We first utilize standard OLS and fixed effects methods to explore body mass index as well as measures of overweight and obesity. We then turn to quantile regression to address the possibility that subsidy receipt has heterogeneous effects on children's weight at different points in the BMI distribution. Results suggest that subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find substantial variation in subsidy effects across the BMI distribution. In particular, child care subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end of the distribution, inconsistent effects in the middle of the distribution, and large effects at the top of the distribution. Our results point to the use of non-parental child care, particularly centerbased services, as the key mechanism through which subsidies influence children's weight outcomes."}, {"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "Over the past three decades, obesity rates among children and adolescents increased dramatically. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that, since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of obesity grew from five to 12 percent among children ages two to five and from seven to 17 percent among children ages six to 11. 2 This alarming trend generates concern among health care officials for a number of reasons. Obesity during childhood and adolescence is highly correlated with weight problems throughout adulthood, and obese children are substantially more likely to develop health problems such as high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes as early as adolescence (Whitaker et al., 1997; Serdula et al., 1993; Freedman et al., 1999; . Moreover, obesity among children and teens is associated with a number of long-term psychological and labor market outcomes ranging from poor self-esteem and depression to discrimination and lower wages (Daniels, 2006; Mocan & Tekin, forthcoming; Dietz, 1998; Strauss, 2000) . Many of these problems impose a substantial burden on the health care system. For example, Guijing and Dietz (2002) estimate that hospital expenditures related to childhood obesity rose from $35 million in the late-1980s to $127 million (in 2001 constant dollars) in the late-1990s.\nMuch of the current policy response to the obesity epidemic focuses on children in elementary and middle school, thereby neglecting the 13 million preschool-age children who spend a considerable number of hours each year in non-parental child care arrangements (National Center for Education Statistics, 1996) . 3 Indeed, about 41 percent of such children attend child care for at least 35 hours each week, and another 25 percent are in care for 15 to 34 hours (Capizzano & Adams, 2 See http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/childhood/index.htm. See Anderson and Butcher (2006) for a review of trends. 3 Indeed, childhood obesity has been identified as one of the most pressing health problems facing the U.S. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001 ) and there are a large number of policy efforts underway to stop or reverse this trend among school-age children. For example, the Child Nutrition and Women Infants and Children (WIC) Reauthorization Act of 2004 requires that all local education agencies participating in the National School Lunch Program create local wellness policies no later than July 2006. The Kids Walk-to-School program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aims to increase opportunities for daily physical activity by encouraging children to walk to and from school in groups accompanied by adults. An increasing number of schools are limiting access to foods high in fats and sugars by banning soda machines and snack bars in cafeterias and school stores. The School Breakfast and the National School Lunch Programs are two federal entitlement programs that provide nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free breakfasts and lunches to millions of children each school day. 2000). Much of this care now occurs in increasingly formal arrangements. For example, the enrollment of three-year-olds in center-based care increased from eight percent in 1968 to 39 percent in 2000, while the enrollment of four-year-olds increased from 23 to 65 percent (Bainbridge et al., 2005) . Today, the predominant child care setting for preschool-aged children is center care (32 percent), followed by relatives (24 percent) and family child care homes (16 percent) (Smolensky & Gootman, 2003) . 4 The growing use of non-parental care has raised awareness among health officials of the critical role that child care settings play in shaping children's eating and activity habits. In particular,\ngiven that young children spend considerable time away from their parents, child care providers lay the foundation for food consumption and exercise patterns. Structural and process features of the child care environment can dictate the types of physical activities in which children are engaged (e.g., structured or free-play), the number of hours per day in which children are performing these activities, and whether these activities occur primarily in indoor or outdoor spaces. In addition, menu options in child care settings expose children to a variety of new foods and flavors, which can influence food preferences at home and school (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001) . Child care providers can also serve as a powerful bridge to aid parents in making healthy food choices in other contexts (Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006 ).\nAn array of federal and state child care policies can further shape children's weight outcomes. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), which provides employment-based subsidies targeted at current and former welfare recipients, allows parents to purchase virtually any legally-operating child care service at a reduced price."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Subsidies can influence low-income children's weight outcomes through a number of channels. First, insofar as participation in formal 4 Participation rates in center-based and other formal settings among low-income children now rival those of high-income children (49 percent compared to 53 percent) (Magnuson et al., 2007) . 5 The CCDF was created by the 1996 welfare reform legislation, which consolidated four previously existing subsidy programs into a single block grant, increased funding for child care funding substantially, and gave individual states greater flexibility in program design and administration (Herbst & Tekin, 2008) . In 2006, states spent approximately $9.3 billion on child care and served more than 1.7 million children in an average month (Child Care Bureau, 2006) . care influences children's weight, one might expect to observe a link between child care subsidies and weight outcomes given that this policy encourages mothers to shift from informal to formal child care modes (Tekin, 2005 ). In particular, child care subsidies reduce the amount of time children spend in parent and relative care while increasing participation in center-and family-based services.\nHowever, the extent to which subsidy-induced changes in child care utilization are associated with changes in children's weight outcomes depends on the relative quality of subsidized child care.\nSecond, the CCDF stipulates that mothers must be employed to qualify for a subsidy. A number of recent studies find that children of working mothers are more likely to be overweight and obese, raising concerns about the subsidy system's current emphasis on employment (Anderson et al., 2003; Ruhm, 2008; Classen & Hokayem, 2005; Fertig et al., forthcoming; Phipps et al., 2006; Courtemanche, 2007; Cawley & Liu, 2007) . Finally, by defraying expenses associated with child care, subsidies increase disposable income that, in principle, can be spent on healthy foods and extracurricular activities. However, it is unclear whether families spend the additional income on goods that enhance child quality or whether these resources increase the demand for fast food and sedentary activities such as video games.\nDespite the potential role for child care subsidies in shaping preschool children's weight outcomes, no previous research focuses on this topic. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the impact of subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten on several measures of children's weight during the fall and spring of kindergarten. Using a sample of children living with unmarried women drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps. We begin by estimating standard OLS and fixed effects models of body mass index (BMI) and indicators of overweight and obesity status. Next, we use quantile regression techniques to address the possibility that subsidy receipt has heterogeneous effects on children's weight at different points in the distribution of BMI. This method permits us to analyze whether the impact of child care subsidies is relatively stable throughout the BMI distribution, or whether subsidy receipt is associated with greater changes in BMI in some parts of the distribution.\nIn both cases, we pay careful attention to the role of maternal employment and child care utilization in meditating the relationship between subsidy receipt and children's weight outcomes.\nOur main results can be summarized as follows. Child care subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find substantial heterogeneity in response to child care subsidies. Subsidies have no effect on BMI at the lower end of the distribution, inconsistent effects in the middle of the distribution, and large positive effects at the top of the distribution. Interestingly, center-based care is associated with large and stable increases in BMI throughout the distribution, while the impact of the other non-parental arrangements appears to be concentrated at the tails of the distribution. We provide evidence that the use of non-parental child care, rather than maternal employment, is the key mechanism through which the subsidy effects operate. Indeed, our results show that, although subsidy receipt continues to be associated with children's weight after accounting for mothers' work history, this relationship disappears when child care arrangements are added to the models."}, {"section_title": "II. Background", "text": "Much of what has been written on childhood obesity focuses on school-aged children and the attending school-based policies and programs, rather than preschool-age children and child care arrangements (Story, 1999; Gortmaker et al., 1999; Veugelers & Fitzgerald, 2005; Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006) . This literature generally concludes that school-based programs play a positive role in reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity. However, many of these programs do not target children from economically disadvantaged families who are at a higher risk of obesity (Frizvold, 2007) . To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the role of child care subsidies in influencing children's weight outcomes. Frizvold (2007) examines the impact of Head Start participation on childhood obesity using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. He finds that participation in Head Start reduces the 6 risk of obesity in late-childhood among black children. Both Head Start and child care subsidies are means-tested, but unlike subsidies, Head Start places a greater emphasis on quality and provides comprehensive child development services. In addition, many Head Start classrooms focus explicitly on children's health through nutritional screening, the provision of healthy and nutritionally balanced meals, and parental outreach and education (Frizvold, 2007) . Hubbard (2008) studies the impact of maternal employment and child care decisions on childhood obesity in a dynamic framework using data from the ECLS-K. She finds that any maternal employment decreases the likelihood of obesity. However, she finds that mothers working full-time and using child care increase the likelihood of childhood obesity. This paper uses a single indicator of child care utilization based on the placement of children in one of three types of settings (informal care from a relative, informal care from a baby-sitter, and all types of formal child care) for more than five hours per week. Furthermore, it does not focus on any dimension of early care and education policy, including child care subsidies.\nA number of descriptive studies assess the nutritional quality of foods offered in child care settings."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "A review of these studies suggests that the quality of foods offered in center-based care, in particular, typically falls short of the standards recommended by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "For example, Padget and Briley (2005) compare the dietary intake of children attending center-based care with the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children. 8 The authors find that such children generally do not receive an adequate diet, and the intake at home does not compensate for the insufficient consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and grains during the time spent in child care. Furthermore, a number of studies show that preschool-age children in various non-parental child care settings do not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity 6 Story, Kaphingst, and French (2006) provide a comprehensive summary of these studies. 7 A publication put forth every five years by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide authoritative advice for people ages two and over about the relationship between increased healthy dietary habits and the reduction in the risk of major chronic diseases. This publication also serves as the basis for Federal food and nutrition education programs. Additional information may be found here: http://www.health.gov/DietaryGuidelines/. 8 Information on the revised pyramid can be found here: http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/FGP4Children.htm. (Story, Kaphingst, & French, 2006). 9 However, research suggests that preschools with practices aimed at increasing quality in general and physical activity in particular can be successful at reaching this goal. For example, in a study of 266 preschoolers, Dowda et al. (2004) find that children in high-quality preschools, as measured by child-staff ratios, teacher education, and structural characteristics of the facility, participate in greater amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activities.\nMotivated by the coincident rise in women's employment and childhood obesity, a number of studies examine the effect of early maternal employment on obesity. Findings from this research generally point to negative effects of maternal employment on children's weight outcomes (Ruhm, 2008; Courtemanche, 2007; Anderson et al., 2003; Fertig, et al., forthcoming) . For example, Anderson et al. (2003) find that increases in hours of maternal work are associated with increases in the likelihood of childhood obesity. They also find greater effects among children of white mothers, of mothers with more education, and of mothers at higher income levels. Fertig et al. (forthcoming) examine the mechanisms through which maternal employment influences children's weight outcomes, finding that employment affects weight primarily through supervision and nutrition, although the channels vary by mother's education. Cawley and Liu (2007) find that employed women spend significantly less time eating and playing with their children and are more likely to purchase prepared foods.\nAlso relevant to the current study is the previous research on the impact of child care subsidies and arrangements on other dimensions of child well-being, including cognitive and behavioral development. Using the ECLS-K, a recent study by Herbst & Tekin (2008) find that child care subsidy receipt in the year before kindergarten lowers reading and math test scores, increases externalizing and self-control behavior problems, and decreases interpersonal skills at kindergarten 9 The 2005 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children and adolescents engage in no less than 60 minutes of physical activity each day. Furthermore, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) recommends that toddlers receive at least 30 minutes of structured physical and 60 minutes of unstructured activity each day. Preschoolers should receive 60 minutes of structured play and another 60 minutes of unstructured play each day.\nentry. In addition, Baker et al. (2008) analyze the impact of Quebec's \"$5 per day child care\" program on several child and parent outcomes. Subsidized children were found worse off in a variety of behavioral and health dimensions, ranging from increased physical aggression and diminished social skills to increases in common illnesses. The program also led to more hostile parenting, worse parental health, and lower-quality parental relationships. Previous research finds mixed results for the impact of non-parental child care on children's developmental outcomes. A large number of studies find positive effects of child care attendance (e.g., NICHD, 2003a; 2003b) , but others find insignificant or negative effects (e.g., Bernal & Keane, 2008; Blau, 1999) . There is more agreement, however, that high-quality center-based care has positive effects on cognitive development among low-income children (e.g., NICHD & Duncan, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "III. Data", "text": "The data used in this analysis are drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of 21,260 children attending kindergarten in the fall of 1998."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Children in the ECLS-K are followed through the eighth grade, with detailed parent, child, and teacher interviews conducted in the fall and spring of kindergarten (1998 and 1999) Analyses in this study are based on the fall and spring of kindergarten waves of data collection, in which children's height and weight were measured and parents were asked questions about child care attendance in the year prior to kindergarten entry. We limit our sample to children who lived with an unmarried mother as of the fall of kindergarten interview. 12 We focus on single mothers because they constitute the majority of eligible subsidy recipients. According to Herbst (2008) , 64 percent of eligible recipients are single mothers. Exclusions from the sample are made if children were living in two-parent families (14, 129) or missing data on BMI (438), child care arrangements (3,070), or child care subsidies (34). We exclude an additional 387 children attending Head Start, since the decision to participate in this early intervention program is not influenced by child care subsidies. Also the emphasis of the Head Start program is on quality whereas the majority of other subsidies are employment-related."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Rates of item non-response on the remaining child and family variables are low, usually well below one percent of the final sample, and we retained these cases by imputing zeros for the missing values and creating dummy variables to control for the possibility of non-random imputation. Our analysis sample consists of 3,113 children in the fall of kindergarten and 3,007 children in the spring of kindergarten.\nOur outcome variables are based on body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m 2 ). In addition to estimating models using BMI expressed in levels and logarithms, we construct binary indicators to represent children who are overweight or obese. For children ages two to 19, BMI values are plotted on growth charts from the Center's for Disease Control (CDC) to determine the corresponding BMI-for-age percentile.\nChildren at or above the 85 th percentile of the gender-and age-specific BMI distribution are deemed overweight, while children at or above the 95 th percentile of the BMI distribution are deemed obese. 14 12 Single mothers were identified in the ECLS-K by using the variable P1HPARNT, which describes the child's living arrangements. We defined single mother families as those in which the child lived with the \"biological mother only.\" 13 Additional minor exclusions from the sample were made due to an inability to match children to the 2000 Census geocoded data (5 observations) and mothers with nonsensical ages (3 observations). 14 For additional information on the CDC growth charts, see http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/resources/growthchart.pdf. Also, see http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/. Until recently, this nomenclature differed across children (ages two to 19) and adults. Children with BMIs above the 95 th percentile of the gender-and age-specific distribution were considered \"overweight,\" and those above the 85 th percentile were considered \"at-risk-for-overweight.\" However, an expert committee convened by the American Medical Association (AMA) in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration A key independent variable in our analysis is a dummy variable indicating whether a child received subsidized, non-parental child care in the year prior to kindergarten. Parents are asked a series of questions about child care utilization during the past 12 months, including the types of arrangements used, the amount of time that each arrangement was used, whether there was a cost associated with each arrangement, and if so, the amount paid for care. Regarding subsidy receipt, parents were asked the following: \"Did any of the following people or organizations help to pay for this \u2026 provider to care for {CHILD} the year before {he/she} started kindergarten?\" Four possible choices were then presented to parents, and we code those answering \"a social service agency or welfare office\" as receiving a child care subsidy. Similar questions appear in several nationally representative surveys (e.g., National Survey of America's Families and the Survey of Income and Program Participation), and other researchers have constructed indicators of subsidy receipt based on them (Blau & Tekin, 2007; Herbst, 2008; Tekin, 2007) . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1999) finds that between 12 and 15 percent of eligible families received a CCDF subsidy in 1998. In our ECLS-K sample, 14.5 percent of children are coded as receiving subsidized care in the same year."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "Another key variable is an indicator of early maternal work, defined as a dummy variable that equals unity if a given mother was employed at any point between the child's birth and kindergarten entry. We also create mutually exclusive groupings of child care arrangements. Specifically, we code children as attending relative care (which includes caregiving inside and outside the child's home), non-relative care (nanny, babysitter, or family-based), center-based care (daycare center), or school-based services (prekindergarten, preschool, and nursery school). Children who did not attend any of these services are coded as receiving parent care. A non-trivial number of children received (HRSA) and the CDC recently endorsed the use of \"overweight\" and \"obese\" for children. See this link for more information on the adjustment (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/ped_obesity_recs.pdf). 15 Rates of child care subsidy receipt calculated by researchers using the NSAF match closely our ECLS-K estimate. For example, Tekin (2007) calculates a participation rate of 11.6 percent for a sample of single mothers, and Herbst (2008) estimates a take-up rate of 13.9 percent, also from a sample of single mothers. child care from more than one provider, so we create a decision rule to ensure mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. 16 We exploit the richness of the ECLS-K to control for a detailed vector of child and family characteristics as of the fall or spring of kindergarten. Key child characteristics include gender, age, race, and birth weight. We also capture parental reports of children's health status through a set of dummy variables indicating whether the child is in excellent health, good health, or fair/poor health.\nHealth status is also proxied by an indicator for whether the child experienced a premature birth.\nChildren's physical activity habits are accounted for by variables denoting the number of hours per day the child watches television, the number of days per week the child experiences vigorous exercise, and whether the child ever participated in athletics. We control for children's eating habits and opportunities to consume healthy meals by incorporating variables for whether the child eats a school-provided breakfast and receives a free/reduced price school lunch. Also of relevance here are controls for the number of days per week the family eats breakfast and dinner together. Parental time and skill inputs are captured by the mother's age, an indicator for whether the child's parents were married at birth, the family's socioeconomic status, and parent's educational expectations for the child. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a composite measure incorporating the mother's and father's (or legal guardian's) educational attainment, mother's and father's (or legal guardian's) job occupation, and total household income. We parameterize the SES measure through a series of dummy variables indicating the quintiles of the full ECLS-K distribution. Other parental resources and goods inputs are represented by food stamps participation and the number of children in the household.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1 . The average BMI is 16.5, and approximately 29 percent of children are overweight as of the fall of kindergarten interview. Fully 13 percent of children are obese. This rate is consistent with figures from the CDC, which reports that the prevalence of obesity among children ages two to five was 12.4 percent between 2003 and 2006. 17 As shown in Table 1 , the BMIs of children receiving subsidized and unsubsidized care are quite similar for the fall and spring of kindergarten. Rates of overweight are slightly higher for subsidized children at both measurement dates. Fully 31 percent and 32 percent of children receiving subsidies are overweight in the fall and spring of kindergarten, respectively, compared to 29 percent and 30 percent for unsubsidized children. However, none of these differences are statistically significant.\nRates of obesity are also similar across these groups of children.\nAs previously stated, approximately 15 percent of the sample received a child care subsidy in the year prior to kindergarten entry. Consistent with previous work, mothers of subsidized children are more likely to be employed than their unsubsidized counterparts (89 percent compared to 82 percent). Participation rates in the various child care arrangements are as follows: 16 percent of children received exclusively parent care; 22 percent received care from a relative; seven percent received care from a non-relative; 16 percent participated in center-based care; and 39 percent participated in a school-based program. As expected, subsidized children are more likely to use center-based care than their unsubsidized counterparts (40 percent compared to 12 percent). The use of non-relative care is also significantly greater among subsidy recipients (10 percent compared to 7 percent). Non-recipients are substantially more likely to utilize care from parents and relatives. This pattern is consistent with previous research indicating that subsidies effectively shift children from informal child care settings into the formal market (Tekin, 2005) . Table 1 also shows that subsidized children are less likely to be white and more likely to be black. Both groups of children are equally likely to be born prematurely and have low birth weights.\nParental reports of children's health status reveal that subsidized and unsubsidized children are 17 See http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/childhood/index.htm. equally likely to be in excellent health, but subsidized children watch slightly more hours of television each day and are less likely to have participated in organized sports at some point before kindergarten entry. Not surprisingly, a much greater share of subsidized children report eating school-provided breakfast and lunch. It is interesting to note that both groups of families are about equally represented in every SES quintile but the top one. However, the difference here is not quantitatively large (five percent compared to 10 percent).\nThe descriptive results presented in Table 1 suggest that rates of overweight and obesity are equivalent across subsidized and unsubsidized children. Table 2 Turning to the non-parental arrangements (Panel B), we once again find small differences in weight outcomes across subsidized and unsubsidized children. If anything, non-recipients tend to have slightly higher BMIs and are more likely to be overweight and obese. However, the story changes dramatically when we compare the weight outcomes of children in parent care with those receiving subsidies. Subsidized children consistently have higher BMIs, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity is substantially greater. For example, 31 percent of subsidized children in center-based care are overweight and 14 percent are obese. Fully 35 percent of subsidized children attending school-based services are overweight, while 15 percent are obese. On the other hand, 24 percent of children in parent care are overweight, and 10 percent are obese. In fact, based on the summary statistics for the full sample, it appears that children in all non-parental arrangementsregardless of whether it is subsidized-have higher BMIs and are more likely to be overweight and obese than those in parent care.\nTogether, the results presented in Table 2 highlight the potential for child care subsidies to operate through maternal employment and participation in non-parental child care. By encouraging low-income mothers to work and by creating incentives to shift children into formal child care settings, subsidy receipt places children in environments where the average child is more likely to be overweight and obese. We will investigate these channels more explicitly in the regression analysis that follows."}, {"section_title": "IV. Empirical Model", "text": "Our goal is to examine the relationship between child care subsidy receipt in the year prior to kindergarten and children's weight outcomes in the fall and spring of kindergarten. Formally, we can specify this relationship in the context of the following regression model:\nwhere W is one of four weight outcomes for child i in the ECLS-K; S is a binary indicator for whether a child care subsidy is received by child i; E is a binary indicator of early maternal work; C is a matrix of child care arrangements; X is a matrix of observable child and family determinants of children's health and development, and \u03b5 is an idiosyncratic error term. The \u03b1, \u03c6, \u03b4, and \u03b2 are the estimated parameters. Recall that the four weight outcomes include the level and log of child i's BMI and indicators for whether child i is overweight and obese. For ease of interpretation, (1) is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Coefficients are weighted using the ECLS-K Base Year Parent weight, and standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary heteroskedasticity using robust standard errors.\nAn obstacle to obtaining an unbiased estimate of \u03b1 is the potential endogeneity of subsidy receipt. For example, employed mothers who obtain a child care subsidy and utilize non-parental care may be systematically different from those who do not in ways that are not captured by researchers. If high-skilled and physically healthy mothers are more likely to work and use child care, then failing to control for these maternal characteristics would lead to an upward bias of \u03b1 if these characteristics are positively correlated with those of the children. Another source of endogeneity stems from the possibility that children's health and well-being influence maternal choices regarding work and child care. Mothers with unhealthy children, for example, may decide to remain out of the labor force or place their children in specialized child care settings. If these choices are correlated with unobserved child characteristics and the outcomes of interest, estimates of \u03b1 will once again be biased.\nWe attempt to guard against potential endogeneity by adding a rich set of child and family characteristics to (1). In particular, we capture the health status of children through such controls as premature birth, low birth weight, and parental reports of children's well-being. We also remove the differential propensities across children to engage in sedentary activities (e.g., watching television)\nversus those requiring substantial physical activity (e.g., participation in athletics). Family routines that are correlated with children's weight are proxied by the extent to which families eat meals together, and whether children eat breakfast and lunch at school. Finally, we add controls family SES and food stamp receipt in order to control for differences across families in the ability to purchase high quality food and support extracurricular activities.\nA potential concern is that our extensive set of child and family controls may not sufficiently account for the selection into subsidy receipt. As a result, we estimate models that incorporate county fixed effects. These eliminate bias from unobserved characteristics across children residing in the same jurisdiction. For the purposes of this paper, fixed effects specified at the county-level hold a number of advantages. Given that state-level economic and policy conditions are identical for children in the same county, these factors are automatically controlled for and are not needed in the model. This is particularly important for states' social policy environment, including the flurry of recent welfare reforms, expansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and pre-kindergarten initiatives, all of which may influence mothers' work and child care decisions and children's wellbeing. In addition, to the extent that the availability of fast food restaurants, supermarkets, and parks is unevenly distributed across the states, inclusion of the county fixed effects will control for these factors as well. Another advantage is that any sub-state-level variation in families' demographic characteristics, physical activity and food options, or the social policy environment is captured by the county fixed effects. Again, this is particularly important for the food and policy environment in which disadvantaged children are raised. For example, substantial evidence suggests that fast food restaurants tend to be clustered in low-income urban and rural neighborhoods (Block et al., 2004; Morland et al., 2002) . In addition, a number of studies find that county administrators of subsidy programs have the authority to shape policy decisions with little oversight (Herbst & Tekin, 2008; Blau & Tekin, 2007; Layzer & Collins, 2000; Blank, et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 1997 )."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "These local-level sources of unobserved heterogeneity are removed by the county fixed effects.\nAlthough the inclusion of early maternal work and child care arrangements in (1) is interesting in its own right, we argue that such controls are crucial for understanding the ways in which subsidies influence children's weight outcomes. In particular, if the impact of subsidy receipt operates through the increase in maternal employment, one might expect little or no change in the subsidy estimates after child care arrangements are included in the model. However, if the impact of subsidies operates through children's attendance in non-parental care, inclusion of the arrangement variables should render the estimates on subsidy receipt statistically insignificant. To test these assertions, we begin by estimating models that include just the indicator of subsidy receipt, followed by models that sequentially add controls for maternal employment and child care arrangements.\nThe coefficients of interest in (1) are \u03b1, \u03c6, and \u03b4, which capture the impact of subsidy receipt, early maternal employment, and child care arrangements on children's weight outcomes. For models in which the dependent variable is BMI, the estimated parameters represent the conditional mean effect of these variables across all children in the sample and over the entire distribution of BMI."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "For models specifying overweight and obesity, the coefficients are interpreted as the average partial change in the likelihood of moving to the upper tail of the BMI distribution. In both cases, however, the OLS coefficients mask heterogeneous effects of subsidy receipt, maternal employment, and child care arrangements across children with different observable characteristics, including BMI.\nTherefore, OLS estimates provide an incomplete picture if, for example, there are a priori reasons to be believe that key variables influence not only the conditional mean expectation, but also the expectation at the tails and other policy-relevant points in the outcome distribution. In the current analysis, the distributional effects of child care subsidies are of particular interest. For example, consider the policy implications associated with changes in BMI at the lower and upper tails of the distribution. If child care subsidies lead to increases in BMI among underweight children, one could reasonably argue that this form of assistance may not impose additional health risks on already fragile children. For extremely low-income families that experience frequent food shortages, the introduction of a child care subsidy may improve health and development by allowing children to experience stable and healthy food options in the child care environment. In addition, an increase in disposable income may improve the ability of disadvantaged families to decrease consumption of low-cost, calorie-dense fast food and increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, if parents and child care staff are aware that subsidies increase BMI among already overweight children, such information can be used to aid parental decisions about the optimal environment for their children. Child care directors can also use this information to address nutrition and physical activity training for staff, and teachers may restructure daily schedules in a way that maximizes indoor and outdoor physical activity. Finally, state-level child care administrators may provide incentives for center-and family-based services operating in low-income neighborhoods to increase healthy food options to accommodate children receiving subsidized care.\nBased on these considerations, we explore heterogeneous effects of child care subsidies, maternal employment, and arrangements at different points in the distribution of children's BMI. To do so, we utilize quantile regression methods (Hao & Naiman, 2007; Koenker & Bassett, 1978; Businsky, 1998) . Quantile regression is a semi-parametric technique that is used to characterize the entire conditional distribution of a continuous dependent variable. This is achieved by dividing the cumulative distribution of a random function into equal intervals (e.g., quartiles or deciles). Then, unlike OLS, which derives estimates by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across the entire distribution, quantile regression estimates are derived for each subsection defined by p n (Koenker & Hallock, 2001) "}, {"section_title": "21", "text": ". Formally, parameter estimates at the n th quantile are calculated by: 21 The term \"quantile\" refers to the general case.\nwhere the function p n ( . ) is the \"check function,\" and k(x i ,\u03b2) is specified as a parametric function in order to generate the estimates. "}, {"section_title": "V. Estimation Results", "text": "Discussion of the empirical results proceeds as follows. Table 3 presents the OLS estimates of the impact of child care subsidies on children's weight outcomes in the fall of kindergarten. The odd-numbered columns show the results without county fixed effects, and the even-numbered columns add these controls. To test whether the impact of subsidy receipt operates through maternal employment and/or children's child care arrangements, Table 3 The equivalent results for children's weight outcomes in the spring of kindergarten are presented in Table 4 . We then turn our attention to exploring heterogeneous subsidy, employment, and child care arrangement effects. Table 5 (fall of kindergarten) and 6 (spring of kindergarten) shows the 22 The p n (. ) is called the \"check function\" because it looks like check-mark when it is plotted (Angrist & Pischke, 2008) . Specifically,\nTo estimate the quantile regression results, we use the ivqte command developed by Frolich and Melly (2008) for STATA 10.1. 23 Note that quantile regression is not the same as fitting OLS models for subsets of the conditional distribution of BMI. The latter approach is equivalent to estimating a model on samples based on truncated dependent variables, resulting in biased estimates. 24 Quantile regression methods have been increasingly utilized in economics to study the returns to education (Arias, Hallock, & Sosa Escudero, 2001 ), changes in wage structure and inequality (Buchinsky, 1994 (Buchinsky, , 1997 Gonzales & Miles, 2001; Garcia, Hernandez & Lopez-Nicolas, 2001 ), union wage effects (Chamberlain, 1994) , and birth outcomes (Abrevaya, 2001) . See Empirical Economics vol. 26, no. 1, 2001 for further examples on some of the applications of quantile regressions. We also located a few papers using quantile regression to estimate child and adult correlates of BMI. Examples of this work include: Terry, Wei, & Esserman (2007) and Beyerlein, Toschke, & von Kries (2008). coefficients from the quantile regression analysis of BMI. To maintain consistency, we begin with models that incorporate just subsidy receipt, then sequentially add maternal employment and child care arrangements."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "OLS and Fixed Effects Results", "text": "As shown in Panel A of Table 3 , child care subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI and a greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. In specifications without county fixed effects, the coefficient on subsidy receipt is always positive but not statistically significant. Adding controls for unobserved heterogeneity increases the magnitude and precision of the subsidy estimate in all models. This suggests that, if anything, the impact of subsidy receipt is likely to be biased downward. As shown in column (4), subsidy receipt is associated with a 1.7 percent increase in children's fall of kindergarten BMI. The coefficients in column (6) and (8) suggest that subsidized children are 5.2 percentage points more likely to be overweight and 3.1 percentage points more likely to be obese.\nAdding a control for early maternal work (Panel B) leads to only a small reduction in the magnitude of the subsidy coefficients, and the standard errors remain unchanged. Subsidy receipt is now associated with a 4.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of overweight and a 2.8 percentage point increase in the likelihood of obesity. Coefficients on maternal work are consistent with previous research. Children whose mothers were employed at some point between birth and kindergarten experience a 1.5 percent increase in BMI. Such children are also 4.7 percentage points more likely to be overweight and 2.7 percentage points more likely to be obese. Substituting the vector of child care arrangements for the indicator of maternal work (Panel C) leads to a large reduction in the subsidy coefficients, and renders the estimates statistically insignificant in all models. For example, the coefficient on subsidy receipt is reduced by 53 percent in the log BMI model and about 44 percent in the overweight and obesity models compared to the baseline subsidy estimate in Panel A. Coefficients on the child care arrangements, however, imply positive and statistically significant increases in BMI, overweight, and obesity. For example, children participating in relative care are 6.9 percentage points more likely to be overweight and 4.8 percentage points more likely to be obese than their counterparts in parent care. Children attending center-based care experience the largest increases in each outcome. Such children have BMIs that are 4.0 percent higher, rates of overweight that 9.9 percentage points higher, and rates of obesity that are 6.0 percentage points higher. There is also evidence that participation school-based care is positively associated with children's weight outcomes, although the effect sizes are not as large as those for center-based care. Interestingly, rates of overweight and obesity among children in nonrelative care are not significantly different from those in parent care.\nWhen the full model is estimated (Panel D), the coefficients on child care subsidies experience a further drop in magnitude and remain statistically insignificant. It is interesting to note that a similar pattern of results emerges for early maternal employment. Although maternal employment is initially associated with significant increases in children's weight outcomes, these effects attenuate and become imprecisely estimated once the child care controls are added. On the other hand, the estimates for child care arrangements are largely unchanged by the inclusion of maternal work. Participation in center-based care continues to be strongly related to children's weight outcomes. Children attending this mode of care have BMIs that are 3.7 percent higher, rates of overweight that 9.0 percentage points higher, and rates of obesity that are 5.5 percentage points higher than their counterparts in parent care.\nResults presented in Table 3 are consistent with the picture emerging from the descriptive evidence in Table 1 and 2. Although subsidized children tend to have slightly higher BMIs and are somewhat more likely to be overweight and obese, these differences are not nearly as large as those between children in parental and non-parental child care arrangements. Accounting for the differential participation in child care settings renders the differences in weight outcomes between subsidized and unsubsidized children statistically insignificant. Variation in employment rates, on the other hand, does not appear to be responsible for the subsidy-induced changes in children's weight. Rather, the subsidy effects operate through the shifting of children into non-parental arrangements, where, regardless of subsidy status, children have higher BMIs and rates of overweight and obesity. Furthermore, our results indicate that participation in center-based care is primarily responsible for the larger weight outcomes among subsidized children. Two pieces of evidence support this claim. Center-based care is the predominant arrangement attended by children receiving subsidies, and this child care setting is consistently associated with the largest increases in BMI, overweight, and obesity. arrangements and children's weight outcomes are still present as of the end of kindergarten. When the full model is estimated (Panel D), participation in relative care is associated with a 2.1 percent increase in BMI, center-based is associated with a 3.8 percent increase in BMI, and school-based care is associated with a 1.5 percent increase in BMI. Furthermore, center-based care is expected to increase overweight by 6.8 percentage points and obesity by 7.6 percentage points. Although school-based care is no longer significantly related to overweight, it is expected to increase obesity by 4.5 percentage points."}, {"section_title": "Quantile Regression Results", "text": "Having established a relationship between subsidy receipt and children's weight outcomes at the upper tail of BMI, we now turn to the quantile regression results, which characterize the entire distribution of BMI. 27 Table 5 shows the estimates for the fall of kindergarten BMI, and Table 6 shows the estimates for the spring of kindergarten BMI. As previously stated, we begin by including only the measure of child care subsidy receipt, and then we add controls for early maternal work and child care arrangements. All models show coefficients using the level parameterization of BMI across the 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 quantiles. County fixed effects are incorporated into all models.\nAs shown in Panel A of Table 6 , we find evidence of substantial heterogeneity in response to child care subsidy receipt. For comparison purposes, it is useful to recall that the effect of subsidy receipt in the fall of kindergarten is 0.308 BMI points (Panel A, Table 3 ) evaluated at the mean.\nWhen the full distribution of BMI is characterized, the impact of subsidy receipt ranges from 0.065 to 0.420. Generally speaking, the magnitude of subsidy effect increases monotonically as children move to higher BMI quantiles. Throughout the first three quantiles, the coefficient is small in magnitude and statistically insignificant, suggesting that child care subsidies are not associated with increases in BMI at the lower end of the distribution. Subsidy receipt, however, is associated with increasingly large and precisely estimated gains in BMI among children above the median. In particular, we find that BMIs among subsidized children increase from 0.151 points at the 0.5 quantile to 0.397 points at the 0.9 quantile, peaking at 0.420 points at the 0. Quantile regression results based on the spring of kindergarten BMI (Table 6 ) are quite similar to the pattern established in the fall of kindergarten. Although the effect sizes attenuate, the range of subsidy coefficients in Panel A remains large (from 0.021 to 0.537 BMI points) and most of the coefficients at the upper tail are statistically significant. The relationship between subsidy receipt and BMI continues to be strongly monotonic: For children below the median BMI, subsidy receipt is associated with gains ranging from essentially zero to 0.0.86 BMI points. For children above the median BMI, the gains range from 0.214 to 0.537 BMI points.\nGenerally speaking, the pattern of results exhibited in Panels B, C, and D is also broadly consistent with the fall of kindergarten. Parameter estimates suggest that subsidy receipt remains significantly related to BMI at the upper tail even after accounting for early maternal work, but the relationship attenuates after incorporating controls for child care arrangements. Attendance in school-based services persists at increasing BMI among children at the upper tail, but some of the significant effects for relative and non-relative care as of the fall of kindergarten are no longer significant in the spring. It is interesting to note that the impact of center care tends to increase in magnitude, become more heterogeneous, and remain highly statistically significant. For children below the median, center care increases BMI between 0.268 and 0.402 points. For children above the median, the effect size increases from 0.469 to 0.728 points. It is difficult to interpret these findings, but we offer two explanations. First, the increased magnitude and heterogeneity reflect the possibility that children in center care are more likely to enroll in kindergarten programs that are less attentive to serving healthy foods and allowing children sufficient time to exercise throughout the day. The other explanation is that any center-induced increase in BMI did not reveal itself in children's weight until the spring of kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusions", "text": "The U.S. child care subsidy system places considerable emphasis on moving welfare recipients into work, and keeping those currently employed out of the welfare system. Indeed, a number of recent studies suggest that a child care subsidy is an effective policy tool for increasing the labor force participation of single mothers (e.g., Blau & Tekin, 2007) . Furthermore, the principle of \"parental choice,\" in which families are able to use subsidies to purchase virtually any legally operating child care service, is beneficial to low-income families struggling to balance work-life obligations. However, there may be unintended consequences associated with child care subsidies.\nIn particular, there are a number of design features associated with states' CCDF plans that create disincentives for parents to choose high-quality care and for providers to make costly qualityenhancing improvements (Herbst & Tekin, 2008) . Consequently, a number of observers have become concerned about the implications of child care subsidies for children's health and well-being (e.g., Adams & Rohacek, 2002) .\nIn this paper, we seek to understand the relationship between child care subsidies, measured in the year before kindergarten, and children's weight outcomes throughout kindergarten. Our findings suggest that child care subsidy receipt is associated with increases in BMI as well as increases in the likelihood of being overweight and obese. We also find initial support for the claim that the estimated subsidy effects operate through children's participation in non-parental child care settings. Specifically, our results point to enrollments in center-based care as the primary mechanism through which the subsidy effects operate. Children in this type of arrangement have substantially higher BMIs and experience a significantly greater likelihood of being overweight and obese. In light of our results, it is no coincidence that center care is the predominant child care mode among subsidized children. Estimates from the quantile regression models provide evidence of substantial heterogeneity in response to child care subsidy receipt: BMI gains due to subsidized care are dramatically different depending on where children are located in the BMI distribution. Children at the upper end of the distribution experience BMI gains that are greater than the gains among children at the lower end. Once again, our quantile regression results imply that center-based care emerges as a likely candidate to explain the pattern of subsidy effects.\nA possible explanation for these results is that child care subsidies induce mothers to choose formal arrangements that are of questionable quality. As previously stated, the CCDF's principle of \"parental choice\" allows parents to purchase child care services operating outside states' regulatory regimes. Furthermore, conditioning eligibility for subsidies on employment and income creates challenges for maintaining stable child care arrangements. In particular, if changes in employment and income are related to lapses in subsidy receipt, such instability could undermine child wellbeing. States' reimbursement rates can also influence quality. If reimbursements are below the federally recommended level, families may not have access to high-quality care, thereby reducing incentives for providers to make important quality enhancements.\nIndeed, recent empirical work seems to confirm these critiques. Several studies find that subsidized children receive lower-quality care than other low-income, unsubsidized children (Adams et al., 2001; Jones-Branch et al., 2004; Mocan, 2007; Raikes, Raikes, & Wilcox, 2005; Queralt, Witte, & Greisinger, 2000; Thornburg et al., 2002; Whitebook et al., 2004; Witt, Queralt, & Witte, 2000) . As summarized in Story, Kaphingst, and French (2006) , another body of evidence suggests that many child care centers in the U.S. fail to provide children with healthy foods and sufficient opportunities for physical activity. Finally, a recent analysis by Herbst and Tekin (2008) finds that subsidized children perform worse on tests of reading and math ability and teacher's assessments of externalizing behavior problems, self-control, and interpersonal skills.
