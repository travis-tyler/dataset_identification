Many studies have demonstrated the link between technological innovation and economic growth and highlighted the role played by highly skilled workers in a knowledge and technology based economy. The OECD and Eurostat have as early as 1995 released a Manual on the Measurement of Human Resources Devoted to S&T, otherwise known as the Canberra Manual. This manual gives guidelines on the measurement of stocks and flows of HRST along various dimensions as well as on the data sources to be used. Because of the breadth and heterogeneity of the HRST population and as recommended in the Canberra Manual, focusing on certain subsets of this population was nevertheless deemed necessary. Furthermore, the interest for certain skills and characteristics of specific populations has kept growing over the years. In particular, the 2004 meeting of the OECD Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP) at Ministerial level urged the OECD to launch new work in the area of human resources in science and technology (HRST), notably \"Improving data on the development and mobility of human resources in science and technology: Using existing data sources and developing new statistical approaches, especially on mobility; Collecting and exchanging information on the career paths of holders of doctorates.\" The training of doctoral graduates and of researchers is indeed a long and costly endeavour, and is regarded as essential in a knowledge-based and complex economy. Since 2000, doctoral awards have increased at the same pace as, and even slightly more rapidly than other degree awards. Doctoral graduates are considered the best qualified for creating, implementing and disseminating new knowledge and innovation. The question of the return on investment of such a long education and training is, however, a policy concern. Furthermore, until recently, not much was known about the employment patterns of doctoral graduates. It is with this in mind that the OECD, together with the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and Eurostat, has, in response to the above 2004 Ministerial mandate, launched a project aimed at measuring the labour market outcome, career path and mobility of this highly qualified population in the framework of the CDH project. Particular effort in this project was also deployed for measuring international mobility. After a thorough review of the user needs in terms of indicators, an expert group drawn from representatives of the national statistical bodies with competence in the area was charged with developing the technical aspects of the project. It worked through a series of workshops in 2005-2006 and drew up a draft of the methodological guidelines, core model questionnaire and output tables. A pilot data collection launched in September 2005 and results received for seven countries (Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and the United States) were also used as inputs to fine tune the technical guidelines, the first version of which was released in 2007. 1 A first large scale data collection followed in 2007 in which some 25 countries participated and a rich set of data was made available. 2 The results were extensively discussed in a workshop involving the policy community held in Brussels in December 2008. This Working Paper presents the second edition of the technical guidelines used in the framework of the CDH project. Numerous comments and interactions with the participating countries following the 2007 data collection exercise have allowed adjustments to be made to the definitions used, drafting of the questions in the model questionnaire, presentation of the output tables, data to be reported and other methodological aspects to be taken into account. A revision of the technical components was therefore deemed necessary before the next data collection. In particular, new definitions and ways to measure two important and uncovered phenomena, i.e. post-doctoral positions and types of mobility (job-to-job/inter-sectoral mobility, international mobility distinguishing between first-time and multiple mobilities) have been discussed with the help of experienced institutions (e.g. the NSF in the case of post-docs) and introduced in this new version. The NSF is currently conducting a dedicated survey to better measure post-doctorates. Some of the questions aimed at identifying post-doctorates have been retained for inclusion in the CDH model questionnaire. This will allow to extend the measurement of the post-doctoral phenomenon to other countries on a comparative basis. An additional effort for reporting job-to-job/inter-sectoral mobility is being implemented for the next data collection through the inclusion of a more detailed output table. An improved definition of an internationally mobile doctorate holder is being implemented in the revised model questionnaire and efforts are made in the output tables for reporting international mobility according to one-time/multiple mobility and length of stay. This working paper is thus aimed at providing guidance to the countries that wish to participate in the 2009-2010 CDH data collection exercise. It is also expected that new experiences with the model survey and comparative analysis of the data, as they become available, will continue to shape the CDH guidelines in the future."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "See http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/57/38055153.pdf and http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/6/25/39811574.pdf\nFellowship, scholarship from your institution 2.

These statistics try to answer questions about the international mobility of highly skilled workers who are frequently characterised under the headings of brain drain / brain gain / brain circulation. In addition, issues of qualitative and quantitative adequacy of the education of doctorate holders for the labour market are covered as well as whether the country prevails as the primary labour market for this highly skilled group. They also address questions on how well the skills of the highest educated are used as well as the attractiveness of different career paths to doctorate holders. Questions like these often are asked on a worldwide level. Based on an output-harmonised approach, the tabulated data to be delivered by countries to international organisations are compiled on the base of different methodological approaches. Often already existing national surveys can be used that sometimes might need to be complemented or extended. These guidelines therefore provide the general framework for national data production. They should on the one hand help countries to improve and align their national survey methodologies.

The CDH statistics will mainly focus on doctorate holders, but the same type of statistics could of course apply to other types of \"highly qualified people\".

One of the aims of these workshops was to define links between research questions and data needs thus setting the objectives for the data collection of statistics on CDH. The policy questions observed at the national and international level are summarised under the following four headings: \u2022 The role of doctorate holders in innovation and the knowledge economy Where do doctorate holders work as compared to other tertiary graduates? Do they follow research careers and in what sector and field? \u2022 Labour market supply and demand Do we train too many or too few doctorate holders? Are there mismatches in the labour market? Why do doctorate holders choose a research career in the public sector, or in the private sector or leave research? What is their perception of career opportunities and employment situation in the public versus the private sector? Do they earn more than the average citizen and which sectors of employment are the most profitable? \u2022 Education to work How long is the time of transition to employment or post doctoral experience? How related is the job to the doctoral degree? \u2022 Mobility How mobile are doctorate holders between sectors? When do doctorate holders leave research for a career in management? How big are the flows of doctorate holders between countries? How common it is for doctorate holders to reside in a country on a non-permanent basis? What are the reasons for doctorate holders to return to their country of origin? With the CDH statistics, policy makers should get much better information to address these questions.

Possible overlaps between sources should be identified and remedied. For this purpose, information that makes it possible to unambiguously identify the same individual in multiple sources like e.g. name, year of award and date of birth could be used. The establishment of a national register of doctorate holders, resident in the country, irrespective of the country of doctorate award, with a mechanism to update it systematically, is recommended for the elaboration of complete sampling frames. Some countries have already put effort and resources into this register. A list of possible sources for building sampling frames for CDH-related surveys is presented below.

The longitudinal panel Survey of Doctorate Recipients in the United States is for example based on a sample of the annually conducted Survey of Earned Doctorates. \u2022 International and national foundations Doctorate holders who have received scholarships during their studies might be identified and reached through the funding organisations. For example, the Portuguese foundation for Science and Technology is used to build a sampling frame in the survey PhDs in the labour market."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 National libraries", "text": "National libraries might be able to provide a list of theses of doctorates awarded within the country together with information like name, university, field of science, and award year.

The registers comprise enterprises, organisations, institutions, etc., a first contact with which is envisaged to identify those which employ doctorate holders. In combination with other sources (e.g. university information systems), this approach works efficiently for tracking doctorate holders who received their doctorate abroad. However, it is not sufficient to capture unemployed and inactive doctorate holders. \u2022 Other surveys (LFS, EU-SILC, SBS, etc.) Other established surveys can be exploited in several ways for building the CDH sampling frame: identify doctorate holders, identify firms, institutions, etc. which employ doctorate holders, supplement administrative-based information (addresses, phone contacts, names, etc.) or other information related to CDH (e.g. LFS collects information on education level and employment status)."}, {"section_title": "Survey types", "text": "Beside the extensive use of administrative sources (which is possible in some countries), different survey types could be considered when compiling information on educational history, mobility and careers of doctorate holders. Below they are categorised into three main types: graduate surveys, cohort surveys and cross-sectional retrospective surveys. These three survey types are ordered according to their degree of coverage of the target population. Cross-sectional surveys are the most efficient in terms of coverage but some specific advantages could also be identified in each of the other types. The three surveys should thus not be seen as mutually excluding, but rather complementary. Countries could opt for one or for a combination of surveys that provide the most cost-efficient national data collection. The sampling frames and their qualities are of course of crucial importance for the quality of the results. The complementary coverage of the different sampling frames used in the different survey types needs to correspond to the CDH target population.

This type of survey is especially suitable for collecting information on the doctorate programme, the education history and conditions during the years of study. A graduate survey is also the appropriate means for obtaining information on post-graduation plans and could be the only point of contact with doctorate holders who plan to leave the country, including those that return to their country of origin. No information however can be gathered on long-time career developments and international mobility. A graduate survey should preferably be conducted regularly on all nationally awarded doctorate holders, including foreigners, as soon as possible after graduation. Information on educational history and the doctorate programme itself (e.g. source of funding and time to completion) is best obtained as soon after graduation as possible. Co-operation with the educational institutions should be sought to take advantage of their information systems and establish contact with the respondents. If the educational institutions could obtain survey results pertaining to their own graduates, their motivation to participate should be high. Records obtained through a graduate survey should be stored and used to build a register of nationally awarded doctorate holders, which will not cover doctorates awarded abroad or doctorate holders having graduated a long time ago, although the latter problem will diminish with the passage of time. Due to this limitation, graduation surveys should always be used in combination with other survey types. Besides being a useful source of information, such a register could also be used in the future to construct sampling frames for cohort and cross-sectional surveys."}, {"section_title": "Cohort surveys", "text": "Cohort surveys with a longitudinal approach have advantages in collecting up-to-date information about the training and working activities undertaken by doctorate holders, by following a homogeneous population over time. For instance, it can be assumed that individuals who graduated in the same year will experience similar conditions in the labour market in job searching. Such longitudinal surveys should ideally be carried out every two to three years. On the other hand however, cohort surveys on recent doctorate holders can provide only limited information about long-time career developments and international mobility, which can be better investigated through a cross-sectional retrospective survey. A cohort survey could be conducted as a sample survey or a census. It should in principle include doctorates awarded by all national institutions, including to foreigners, currently unemployed and inactive as well as doctorate holders entering the country having being awarded abroad. A cohort survey should be based on a sampling frame where the year of graduation is available."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "The U.S. Experience (Burelli, 2005).

Through retrospective questions, the cross-sectional survey should provide a good picture of the career paths of doctorate holders at different stages of their career. The cross-sectional survey is thus the most appropriate tool if information on the entire target population is to be obtained through one single survey or a follow-up of other established surveys which sufficiently cover doctorate holders (e.g. LFS). In the latter case a sample or the total population of the identified doctorate holders will be surveyed for the CDH-specific needs. Cross-sectional surveys have the potential to ensure complete coverage of the target population and moreover to collect CDH-specific information. Countries should make strong efforts to assure the full coverage of all groups, including those that are more problematic to capture (doctorate holders awarded abroad, inactive doctorate holders, unemployed doctorate holders, etc.). The relevance of this type of survey should however be carefully assessed in terms of costeffectiveness, given that a survey for the needs of CDH needs to be established from scratch. Another drawback with these surveys that should also be considered is the risk of recall bias; countries should make an effort to minimise that risk."}, {"section_title": "Stratification", "text": "Cohort surveys and graduate surveys should, if they are carried out as sample surveys, be stratified according to at least two main criteria, graduating institution and sector of employment. For cross-sectional sample surveys, stratification is needed with regard to the structure of the target population and the possible use of multiple sources to build the sampling frames. In statistical surveys, the number of domains needed often determines the number of strata. However, for multipurpose statistics like the CDH statistics, the number of domains will often exceed the desirable number of strata. Since too high a number of strata could lead to a problem with too few observations in some strata, it is important to keep stratification at a reasonable level. The most obvious and significant stratification is to break down the population according to the sampling frames applied. As strata should be as homogenous as possible with respect to the principal variables analysed, further recommended breakdowns are according to the characteristics year of graduation, fields of science, and gender."}, {"section_title": "Allocation and sampling", "text": "The allocation of the sample on the strata may in principle be proportional with regard to the stratum size. If the allocation ends up giving too small sample sizes in some strata, then over-sampling may be considered for these strata. Over-sampling might also be considered in strata where high levels of nonresponse could be expected. Total sample size should be chosen taking into account the detailed breakdowns in the output indicators template. The selection of the sample should be based on random sampling techniques, with known and equal selection probabilities being applied for each stratum. The random sampling techniques should be without replacement within each stratum. It is recommended that the total sample fraction (ratio of total sample size to total population size) exceed 20%. Smaller fractions could be accepted as long as the variance of estimation is restricted to ensure accurate results."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA\nThe model questionnaire is available on the CIRCA site of Eurostat and the OECD NESTI-NET, and will soon be available on the UIS website as well."}, {"section_title": "Data collection methods", "text": "When collecting CDH statistics, a mixed-mode data collection adapted to the possibilities available within each sampling frame and each individuals' willingness to respond could be considered the most successful alternative. This approach, applied by most countries conducting surveys on doctorate holders, includes the use of existing data, postal and Internet surveys, telephone interviews and personal interviews. Postal surveys are commonly used and have the advantage of being relatively inexpensive. Under some circumstances, the delivery agent also may bring back information on the new addresses of people who moved recently. Both postal and telephone reminders may be used to increase the response rate. Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and personal interviews (CAPI) are techniques where interviewers play an active role in collecting information from respondents. Although quite costly they could be justified by the high rates of response that they normally achieve. CATI and CAPI techniques are especially useful in boosting the response rates of a postal survey. Many national practices exist where countries give the respondent the opportunity to fill in the questionnaire electronically on the Internet. The use of questionnaires that can be accessed on line on the Internet is recommended as an alternative to other means of collection after contact with the respondent has been established. In the special case of graduate surveys the relevant institutions should preferably be involved in the data collection. The institutions could considerably facilitate the data collection process by distributing and collecting the questionnaire together with their administrative requirements for graduation."}, {"section_title": "5.2", "text": "The CDH survey questionnaire Since the CDH statistics are based on an output-harmonised approach, countries could decide what survey instruments to use.

The questionnaire is divided into six different modules dealing with different aspects of the careers of doctorate holders: doctoral education (EDU), early career research positions (ECR), employment situation (EMP), international mobility (MOB), career-related experience (CAR) and personal characteristics (PER). In order to facilitate answering the questionnaire, an instruction manual has been developed as well. The model questionnaire is recommended for countries that are going to launch a self-standing CDH survey. In addition, countries that want to revise their existing national questionnaires are encouraged to align it by using the selection of questions presented in the model questionnaire. The first section of the core model questionnaire presents instructions for adaptation of the model questionnaire to national needs, pointing out necessary adaptations as well as options for the drafting of some questions.

Even if the survey is a census survey, with total enumeration of the frame population, weighting is appropriate to compensate for non-response or over-coverage. The simplest weighting technique is to use the inverse of the sampling fractions of the sampling units, the inclusion probability, corrected for non-response. If a stratified sampling technique with different sampling fractions is used, weights have to be calculated individually for each stratum. If appropriate auxiliary information is available, it is recommended that estimates are built on models or calibration for better precision and reduced bias."}, {"section_title": "Over-coverage", "text": "The size of over-coverage could be difficult to estimate, but if the over-coverage can be identified among the respondents, this has some implications.

As it is difficult to recommend the use of certain auxiliary information, surveying countries will have to find their own auxiliary information to use. Another approach, less advanced but perhaps more practical, could be not to try to correct for undercoverage in the estimates, but to discuss its occurrence and implication in the national methodology description.
