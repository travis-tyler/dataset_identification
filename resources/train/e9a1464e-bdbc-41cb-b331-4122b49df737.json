[{"section_title": "Recent Reports on Earth and Space Science Doctorates", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PAGE 22", "text": "Two newly published surveys of recent doc toral degree recipients, the Science and Engi neering Doctorate Awards, 2001(National Science Foundation, 2002 and the Earth and Space Science PhDs, Class of 2001(AGU/AGI, 2002, reveal a generally healthy status for the production of and job market for Earth and space sciences Ph.Ds. The NSF report, which is based on the detailed statistical data obtained in the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates (NSF; 2001), highlights these key findings: \u2022 The total number of science and engineering (S&E) doctorates awarded by U.S. universities has dropped 7% from a high point in 1998, to 25,500 degrees in 2001. Of these, doctorates in the physical sciences dropped from 3,825 in 1998 to 3,389 in 2001, after experiencing modest increases between 1992 and 1998. \u2022 Ph.D.s awarded in the combined Earth, atmospheric, and ocean (EAO) sciences cate gory, which comprises -22% of the degrees in the physical sciences, have shown similar behavior over this time period, with a rapid (15%) drop from a maximum of 878 degrees in 1997 to 749 in 2001. \u2022 Women recipients have made steady progress over the past nine years in increasing their proportion of the physical sciences doctorates (from 20.4% in 1992 to 24.6% in 2001).The greatest improvements have occurred in the fields of chemistry (from 26.2% to 32%) and the EAO sciences (23.7% to 31.5%),particularly in the sub-disciplines of oceanography and environmental science, where women received nearly 40% of the Ph.D.s in 2001. In contrast, physics and the atmospheric sciences sub-dis ciplines have seen little change, with a decadal increase of only -1-2% in the total number of women doctorates. \u2022 African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans continue to be highly underrepresented in the physical sciences overall, and the EAO sciences specifically, in comparison to their proportions in the general population. \u2022 For all S&E doctorates and those in the EAO sciences fields, a little less than 59% of the doctorate degree recipients in 2001 were U.S. citizens; this represents a slight decline over previous years. Additional details of the education and employment of recent doctorate degree recip ients in the Earth, atmospheric, and ocean sci ences are revealed in the second survey, conducted annually by the American Institute of Physics on behalf of AGU and the American Geological Institute. Data for the Ph.D. class of 2001, when combined with data from the previous five years, reveal the following trends: \u2022 EAO Ph.D.s are the oldest of the natural sciences and engineering students when they receive their degree (median age of 33.2 years, compared with physics and chemistry, at 30.2 and 29.7 years, respectively).This age difference "}]
