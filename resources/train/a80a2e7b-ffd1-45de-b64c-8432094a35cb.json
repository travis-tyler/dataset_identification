[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper investigates the effects of public pre-kindergarten participation on the subsequent behavioral outcomes of disadvantaged youth. We utilize a unique longitudinal dataset that links student birth records to pre-kindergarten participation for every child born in Florida in or after 1994 who subsequently attended public school in Florida. Because pre-kindergarten participation is endogenous, we employ a novel identification strategy to estimate the effects of pre-kindergarten participation by comparing siblings within the same family. We demonstrate that, within a family, the sibling with less costly access to public pre-kindergarten -measured by the fact that his or her locally-zoned elementary school offers a pre-kindergarten program when he or she is four years old -is considerably more likely to attend than the equally-eligible sibling who would have attended pre-kindergarten at a school other than his or her zoned elementary school, and use this differential access within a family as an instrument to predict public pre-kindergarten attendance.\nThe vast majority of the economics literature on the efficacy of pre-kindergarten has concentrated on academic outcomes. This topic has been studied extensively with regard to school readiness and student cognitive performance, with mixed evidence to date. The most compelling of these studies exploit cross-sibling comparisons (Currie and Thomas, 2000; Garces et al., 2002) and regression-discontinuity designs that take advantage of discontinuities in Head Start funding (Ludwig and Miller, 2007) . These studies find general evidence that Head Start participation has long-term benefits in terms of schooling outcomes.\nBut from the inception of federal support to extend educational opportunity to 3-and 4-year-old low-income children, there has been a consistent dual emphasis on 2 cognitive and social development. To the planners of Head Start in 1964, preparing disadvantaged youth to succeed in school required a \"whole child\" approach, one in which not only academic knowledge but also behavioral competence would be emphasized (Zigler and Styfco, 2004). In addition to Head Start, the federal government also began to aid state efforts to provide local community-sponsored preschools through the mechanism of the Child Care and Development Block Grant program. This flowthrough program subsidized child care programs whose quality standards were allowed to vary a great deal more than Head Start's. To supporters of Head Start, these statesubsidized early childhood programs \"do not pretend to have anything to do with school readiness. They are essentially custodial programs whose only purpose is to enable poor parents to enter the work force\" (Zigler and Styfco, 2004, p. 53).\nThis issue-that preschool separates parents from children during crucial years of their development as a result of either an elective or required return to the workforceremains at the heart of the debate over its potentially zero-sum benefit/harm ratio: disadvantaged children may receive sufficient academic stimulation to compensate for missing or insufficient parental instruction yet this cognitive benefit may be offset by two negatives: (1) low income children congregate in poor quality child care settings where unfamiliarity with appropriate social interaction is mutually reinforced; and (2) initiation into socially acceptable norms of behavior is conducted not consistently by family members but intermittently by a stranger. The preferred alternative outcome of preschool for disadvantaged youth is that it teaches school acculturation behavior in ways that improve student academic and behavioral outcomes once at school.\nResearch suggesting the possibly negative impact of preschool participation on children's subsequent elementary school behavior is embedded in the larger debate about the psychological consequences of children of any income level being separated from their parents in the first years of life. In the early 1980s educational psychologists began employing attachment theory (Bowlby, 1973; Ainsworth, 1978) in their study of increasing numbers of infants and toddlers being placed in public or private child care as a result of mothers rapidly returning to the workforce. Attachment theory posited that for humans to become trusting and caring individuals they must, as infants, bond with their mothers in the first year of life. The theory predicted that disruption of this attachment process (primarily to a nurturant female) would result in a child who is unable to develop self control or form stable relationships. Jay Belsky was one of the first educational psychologists to claim to have found evidence confirming this prediction. Starting in the mid 1980s, Belsky issued a series of warnings (1986, 1988, 1990) that \"early and extensive nonmaternal care carried risks in terms of increasing the probability of insecure infant-parent attachment relationships and promoting aggression and noncompliance during the toddler, preschool, and early primary school years\" (Belsky, 2002) . The research that Belsky cited was criticized on the grounds that it did not take into account the quality of the childcare setting or the background characteristics of the children.\nThe decade of the 1990s saw a two-prong response to anxiety among both poor and non-poor families that leaving their infants and toddlers in a group child care setting might promote adverse behavioral outcomes such as non-compliance and aggression. In the legislative arena, the National School Readiness Task Force issued a report in 1991 affirming that school readiness involved not only academic knowledge but also social 4 competence. In 1994, Congress set school readiness to be first among the nation's eight education goals. By the year 2000, all children would have access to high-quality, developmentally appropriate preschool programs and would arrive at school able to \"to maintain the mental alertness necessary\" to learn (P.L. 103-227).\nIn the research arena, the National Institute of Child Heath and Human Development commissioned a multi-center study of early child care and youth development. Since 1993, the NICHD Early Child Care Research Network has produced over 60 publications, many of which reach conflicting conclusions about the relationship between early childcare and socio-emotional development. Since the early 1990s, a great deal of research has been conducted on short-and long-run effects of children's early preschool experiences. Given that early childhood education represents a nexus of psychological theory, employment exigency, and cultural transmission, it is not surprising that findings in this body of research using nationally representative samples are decidedly mixed:\n\uf0b7 The National Institute of Child Health and Development [NICHD] Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (1998a) found no difference in problem behavior during the first three years among children reared exclusively at home and those who spent more than 30 hours per week in non parental care.\n\uf0b7 The NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (1998b) found that mothering was a stronger and more consistent predictor of child outcomes than child care. There was little evidence that early, extensive, and continuous care was related to problematic child behavior. Child-care quality was the most consistent predictor of child functioning.\n\uf0b7 The NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (2001) found that when quality and quantity of child care were controlled, the association between family factors and children's social-emotional development remained significant, thereby affirming that parents continue to have a meaningful effect on children's behavior despite considerable child care experience in the earliest years. \uf0b7 Also using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Magnuson et al. (2007) found that participation in pre-kindergarten was associated with higher levels of behavior problems noted in the spring of first grade. This adverse relationship was somewhat attenuated for public school-located pre-kindergarten, particularly for students who continued to kindergarten in the same public school where they attended pre-kindergarten.\nParallel to the legislative and research activity at the national level, the decade of the 90s saw states acting to extend pre-kindergarten into their K-20 educational framework. In Florida as in other states, this downward extension of public schooling to include three and four year olds was partly to accommodate provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (PL 99-457). Since disproportionate numbers of incoming low-income children were classified early in elementary school with special education exceptionalities such as speech and language impairment or emotional 7 handicap, it was considered a worthwhile investment to provide these services in the context of a pre-kindergarten early invention program (PKEI).\nIn funding the program, the Florida Legislature stipulated that priority be given to economically disadvantaged 3 and 4 year old children whose family's income-up to 135% of federal poverty level--made them free lunch eligible. Additional targets were children of migrant workers, children who had been abused, in foster care, prenatally exposed to drugs, and 3 and 4 year olds not economically eligible who could participate with a fee adjusted for family income. Minimum operational parameters were set at six hours per day, five days per week during the school year with an option of extending services to 10 hours per day year round. Public school PKEI teachers had to be certified in early childhood education; however, school districts could also choose to subcontract with community-based non profits such as Head Start or child care agencies to provide services to 3 and 4 year olds. Staff qualifications at non-public school providers were not as rigorous: a 12-credit Child Development Associate credential (plus 120 hours of fieldwork) was acceptable to be a lead teacher. In either setting, the student-staff ratio was set at 10:1.\nThroughout the nineties, annual funding for PKEI hovered just under $100 million with enrollment averaging between 25,000 to 35,000 children per year. By the time our data collection period ended (2003), the program had been transferred out of the Department of Education to the quasi public-quasi private Partnership for School Readiness housed directly inside the Governor's Office. It has since been transferred to the Agency for Workforce Innovation, lending partial support to Zigler and Styfco's 8 contention that the mission of many state-supported preschool programs is primarily to serve as daycare for mothers on welfare who are required to enter the workforce. 1 So far we have been focusing on potentially negative behavioral consequences of preschool participation. To look at the glass half-full, considerable evidence has been accumulated that \"emotional development and academic learning are far more closely intertwined in the early years. . . . Across a range of studies, the emotional, social, and behavioral competence of young children (such as higher levels of self-control and lower levels of acting out) predict their academic performance in first grade, over and above their cognitive skills and family backgrounds\" (Raver and Knitzer, 2002, p. 3). The collocation of academic knowledge and self regulation in the brain is the basis for both conceptual and empirical support in favor of preschool education. To life-span economists such as James Heckman, estimated rates of return to investment in preschool programs far exceed their opportunity costs. These returns to investment would be due in part because younger persons have a longer horizon over which to recoup the fruits of their investments. In Heckman's human capital model (2000), non-cognitive skills and informal learning play important roles in lifetime earnings (see also Heckman, 2006; Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001; Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua, 2006) . Most long-run studies that find support for investment in high quality early childhood programs (e.g., High/Scope Perry Preschool, Carolina Abecedarian Project, Chicago Child-Parent Centers) do not make the economic case that disadvantaged program participants caught up to earning levels of more advantaged age peers but rather that society saved money through lower rates of anti-social, cost-positive behavior such as juvenile arrest, welfare\n1 Cascio (2006) shows that mothers entered the workforce as a result of increased availability of state subsidized kindergarten. 9 dependency, and adult incarceration (Schweinhart et al. 2005; Campbell et al. 2002; Reynolds et al, 2002). Indeed, Belfield et al. (2006) argue that the long-term effects on crime account for a very large share of the dollar-value benefits of the Perry Preschool treatment. On the other hand, Duncan et al. (2006), utilizing data from six longitudinal data sets in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, found very limited evidence that self-regulation skills at kindergarten had lasting import for long-term academic and behavioral success.\nIn the opening years of the present accountability-driven decade, early childhood programs were not spared the press to quantify effects of participation. Head Start adopted a Child Outcomes Framework, and commissioned an impact study as did Early Head Start, both involving random assignment. Some state pre-kindergarten programs were evaluated on the basis of their graduates' performance in elementary school. It has become commonplace to find multilevel and growth curve models being used to investigate the relationship between treatment and proficiency. Calls for \"analytical strategies aimed at explaining interindividual differences in intraindividual change\" proliferate (Granger and Kivilighan, 2003; Kaplan, 2002). Adding to the need to be able to demonstrate value added results, the lingering controversy over possible detrimental behavioral effects of early non-maternal, collective care has galvanized efforts to better measure and treat mental illness in children (Currie and Stabile, this volume).\nIn the forty years since the US launched a nationwide program to extend equal opportunity to disadvantaged 3-and 4-year-olds, the mandate to provide instruction in both the cognitive and socio-emotional domains has become subject to increased specificity. In Head Start's performance appraisal goals for 2007, \"identifying behavioral 10 problems in pre-school children\" is listed as a specific performance measure (DHHS/ACF/OHS, 2007). A history of difficulty in adhering to the behavioral norms expected by schools is frequently used to explain students' poor academic performance (sometimes culminating in their exclusion from the testing pool). Thus, the burden on public pre-kindergarten programs to initiate students into socially acceptable forms of interaction has never been higher. Our study examines whether children who attended public school pre-kindergarten in Florida acquired a better grasp of socially acceptable behavior than their 4-year-old peers who attended either a non-public preschool or no preschool at all.\nThis analysis makes several key advances over the existing literature. First, this is the first large-scale study to utilize administrative data on pre-kindergarten participation.\nThis has the advantage of size: We observe the entire population of income-eligible students in the state of Florida born in or after 1989. Using administrative data also eliminates the potential for recall bias in measuring program participation; any student who participated in a public Head Start or school-based pre-kindergarten program in the state of Florida is observed in our data. Also, because we have matched child birth records, school-based pre-kindergarten participation records, and subsequent school behavior records for the entire state of Florida, we can rely on administratively-observed background factors and behavioral problems.

No evidence was found that more time in child care was associated with higher rates of aggressive behavior.\n\uf0b7 First year findings from The Head Start Impact Study (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005) reported effect sizes of -0.13 for total behavior problems and -0.16 for hyperactivity as reported by parents whose children were randomly assigned to Head Start. Control group could enroll in available community non-Head Start services.\n\uf0b7 A study of subsidized childcare in Quebec found evidence of negative effects on a wide spectrum of child behavioral outcomes: hyperactivity-inattention, general anxiety, separation anxiety, and physical aggressiveness/opposition (Baker, Gruber and Milligan, 2005 Loeb et al. (2007) found that center-based care had a negative effect on socio-behavioral measures (with the exception of English proficient Hispanic children). Across the family income distribution, the younger the start age, the larger the negative effect. Intensity effects (more hours per day lead to more kindergarten teacher-report behavioral effects-measures of self control, interpersonal skills, and externalizing behavior) are moderated by family income and race.\n\uf0b7 Also using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Magnuson et al.

Using administrative data also eliminates the potential for recall bias in measuring program participation; any student who participated in a public Head Start or school-based pre-kindergarten program in the state of Florida is observed in our data. Also, because we have matched child birth records, school-based pre-kindergarten participation records, and subsequent school behavior records for the entire state of Florida, we can rely on administratively-observed background factors and behavioral problems. (We measure behavioral problems by whether the child is referred for disciplinary action by their teachers.) Furthermore, our matching of birth vital records with school records allows us to compare within families, a strategy shared by Garces et al. (2002) .\nSecond, the use of population-based data allow us to stratify the estimated effects of pre-kindergarten participation in a number of different ways. With tens of thousands of income-eligible families with multiple children, we can estimate with confidence the differential effects of pre-kindergarten participation within families along a variety of dimensions, including birth conditions, maternal age and education.\nThird, and most importantly, this analysis introduces a novel identification strategy. In addition to within-family comparisons, we exploit the fact that local policy conditions outside of the control of specific families generate different effective prices of attending public pre-kindergarten for different siblings. Whereas all students who meet certain family income or health criteria are eligible for public pre-kindergarten participation, not all students have the same ease of access. For around 60 percent of income-eligible Florida students, the student's local zoned elementary school does not offer a public pre-kindergarten program. These students must in turn attend a prekindergarten site farther from their home, and perhaps without public transportation.\nWe argue that the presence of a pre-kindergarten program in the zoned elementary school should promote public pre-kindergarten participation for several reasons. One major reason is informational: Parents are more likely to be aware of pre-kindergarten options when they have a child who attends a school that offers such a program, or when their neighbors have children who attend such a school. But transportation costs may also be a factor, even in cases when transportation to preschool is provided. This may be true for several reasons. Parents may not wish for their young children to be bused long distances, especially if they are alone. And it may be easier for parents to send their young children on a bus if they are accompanied by an older sibling or older neighbor whom the child knows; these are more likely to be the case if the pre-kindergarten is attached to the local zoned school. (In fact, the informational and neighbor-transportation factors are probably the strongest reasons for this increased likelihood of attending public pre-kindergarten when the locally zoned school offers the program, as first children attend pre-kindergarten at nearly the same rate as their younger siblings.) For all of these reasons, we suspect that it is the public school zone, rather than travel time and mileage, matters most in determining whether children attend public pre-kindergarten programs.\nWe demonstrate that income-eligible students are highly responsive to the presence of a pre-kindergarten program at their zoned elementary school. Families with a pre-kindergarten program at their zoned elementary school are more than 60 percent more likely to send their children to a public pre-kindergarten program than are families without a pre-kindergarten program at their zoned school. And this pattern holds up within families as well: Around 40 percent of families live in elementary school zones with a public pre-kindergarten program when one sibling is four but not when another sibling is four. This happens either because the family changes residence, because the zoning lines are redrawn, because a school with a pre-kindergarten program dropped it, or because a school without a pre-kindergarten program added it. Regardless, within the same family, the sibling whose zoned elementary school has a pre-kindergarten program is 60 percent more likely to attend than the sibling without such a program at the zoned school. This is true when we exclude families who move, and look only at families with different access to public pre-kindergarten because of exogenous changes in local school policy. Using these differences in access within a family, we find that public prekindergarten participation apparently reduces behavioral problems in elementary school, especially when the child grows up in a particularly disadvantaged neighborhood.\nRaw unadjusted relationship between pre-kindergarten and disciplinary problems Table 1 presents some basic facts about the rates of disciplinary problems in the first three years of school. Here and throughout the analysis, we restrict our attention to students who are income-eligible at the time of potential enrollment in pre-kindergarten.\nWe do not actually measure income eligibility with certainty; to be income-eligible; a family must have income below 100 percent of the poverty line. However, we only observe free lunch eligibility -less than 130 percent of the federal poverty level. We therefore restrict our analysis to the set of families where all students are consistently observed being eligible for free lunch in every potential time period -about 60 percent of the students who are free lunch eligible at any given time. We hope that this more restrictive measure of income eligibility will nearly approximate the true eligible population. Our analysis sample consists of 59,418 children in 29,087 families where all students in the family are consistently observed to be free lunch eligible.\nNote also that we cannot observe private pre-kindergarten (or community-based Head Start) participation, and therefore are comparing public pre-kindergarten attendees with all other income-eligible students. Later in this paper, we attempt to draw some potential inferences from the fact that some communities have community-based Head Start programs and others do not.\nOne observes in Table 1 that students who attended public pre-kindergarten have slightly higher rates of disciplinary problems than students who did not attend public prekindergarten in their early years of school. One further observes that the same patterns hold up within families. The finding in the raw data that public pre-kindergarten attendees are slightly more likely than non-attendees to have later discipline problems in the early grades could indicate that public pre-kindergarten is either ineffective in terms of engendering positive behavior or perhaps promotes non-compliant, acting-out behavior. But it could also indicate that students, even within a family, are negatively selected into public pre-kindergarten programs: The siblings most in need of socialization may be the ones that families choose to send to pre-kindergarten, while those who are reasonably well-socialized might not be sent. It could also be the case that families are transitioning in a manner that is unobservable to the researcher. The potential presence of endogeneity bias indicates the necessity of conducting instrumental variables regression."}, {"section_title": "Evidence of instrument relevance", "text": "As mentioned above, our instrumental variable is the presence of a public prekindergarten program in the public elementary school for which the student would be zoned at the time that he or she is four years old. Table 2 demonstrates that, in cross section, income-eligible children are much more likely to attend public pre-kindergarten when they have more direct access to it. Even though all students in our data set are eligible for public pre-kindergarten, typically with free transportation, the presence of a public pre-kindergarten program housed locally, in the same elementary school where older siblings and neighbors already attend, appears to have a powerful effect on public pre-kindergarten take-up. Comparing zip codes without community-based Head Start options, nearly 55 percent of income-eligible students attend public pre-kindergarten when the local zoned school offers pre-kindergarten, while only 26 percent attend public pre-kindergarten when this is not the case. Note also that while the presence of a community-based Head Start program in the zip code area slightly reduces the likelihood that a child will attend a public pre-kindergarten program (53 percent when the zoned school offers pre-kindergarten, and 22 percent when it does not), it is clear that the overwhelming determinant of public pre-kindergarten entry is not the community-based Head Start option, but easier public pre-kindergarten access.\nBut Table 2 also makes clear that a cross-sectional analysis of participation, using geographic location as an instrument, is not appropriate. This table provides basic descriptive information, culled from the full set of students whose birth records and school records are matched in Florida, on the family attributes of students across geographic locations with differing levels of access to public pre-kindergarten and community-based Head Start programs. Comparing across the columns, one observes that the school zones where public pre-kindergarten is locally offered tend to be poorer (in terms of a higher percentage \"eligible\" for publicly-funded pre-kindergarten 2 ), with larger fractions black and Hispanic, more mothers who are not high school graduates, and fewer married parents than are the school zones where public pre-kindergarten is not locally offered. Community-based Head Start programs tend to operate in zip code areas that are poorer still, with even higher eligibility rates, more black families (though not Hispanic families) and lower rates of parental marriage and maternal high school graduation. The same patterns hold whether one looks at the attributes of the entire population of families in the school zone or whether one looks only at the attributes of income-eligible families in the school zone.\nClearly, families residing in these different types of geographical locations differ in many measured and unmeasured aspects that are independent of whether they attend public pre-kindergarten, and in fact, it makes sense that public pre-kindergarten programs (and community-based Head Start programs) would tend to locate in communities where the need for these programs is greatest. This cross-sectional heterogeneity necessitates the use of a fixed effects model that compares outcomes across students who are considerably more similar in terms of unmeasured characteristics. For that, we turn to a within-family comparison."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "In order to compare within-families, it must be the case that siblings' public prekindergarten take-up varies within a family based on differences in local access to prekindergarten. Table 3 shows that many students without a public pre-kindergarten program immediately available still go to pre-kindergarten, but the probability of attending increases dramatically if the zoned school has a program. 4 Among families where the zoned school offered a pre-kindergarten program to all siblings observed in the data, 56 percent of income-eligible students attended public pre-kindergarten. On the other hand, among families for whom the zoned elementary school never offered prekindergarten just 35 percent of income-eligible students attended pre-kindergarten. Table   4 shows again that families in the three groups presented in Table 3 are very different, further underscoring the importance of conducting within-family comparisons. Table 5 presents within-family information on public pre-kindergarten take-up, by access levels. For the 12,107 \"mixed\" families, the sibling with the easier access to public pre-kindergarten attended these programs 52 percent of the time, while the sibling without such access attended these programs 33 percent of the time. These same differences are apparent when we compare within families of different types, stratified by maternal education, maternal age, and race. This evidence indicates that our instrumental variables strategy has a very strong and consistent (across subgroups) first stage.\nOne potential disadvantage of a within-family identification strategy involves the potential for cross-sibling spillovers. As mentioned in the introduction, we suspect that the reasons that families are more likely to send their children to public pre-kindergarten programs when their local zoned elementary school offers such a program include both transportation and informational factors. In both of these cases, it may be the case that older siblings attending a public school could contribute to a younger sibling attending a public pre-kindergarten program at that same school. The potential presence of strong cross-sibling spillovers could undermine the credibility of this instrumental variable strategy. It turns out, however, that the comparisons in Table 5 appear to be nearly independent of birth order: For instance, 51 percent of eligible first siblings attend prekindergarten when offered at their locally zoned elementary school, as compared with 53 percent of subsequent siblings. Therefore, the non-sibling-related factors associated with public pre-kindergarten participation at locally zoned elementary schools appear to be the dominant reasons for children's attendance. This fact increases the veracity of the within-family comparison as an identification strategy. Table 6 presents regression analysis of the estimated effects of attending public pre-kindergarten on the probability of being disciplined. Each cell in the table represents a different regression specification; the columns reflect different years in school."}, {"section_title": "Regression estimates", "text": "(Typically a student in \"year 2\" would be in first grade, but we chose to treat kindergarten repeaters and \"natural\" first graders the same way.) The regression results presented in Table 6 include controls for school fixed effects, as well as for student race, sex, free/reduced price lunch status (though in practice, all students will show up as free lunch eligible), maternal age at birth, maternal education at birth, maternal marital status, Medicaid status at birth, adequacy of prenatal care, complications of labor and delivery, birth order, and indicators for whether the student's birth weight is less than 1000g, 1000-1500g, 1500-2500g, or >2500 g (extremely low, very low, moderately low, or normal birth weight) . The school fixed effect controls are important because schools may vary systematically in how they dispense and report discipline. As can be seen in the first row of Table 6 , one observes no apparent cross-sectional relationship between public prekindergarten participation and disciplinary problems in the first three years of school.\nThe second row of the table presents the same analysis but with family fixed effects. The (non-)results remain robust; while there exist some sign changes between years, the magnitudes of the point estimates are trivial.\nThe third row of Table 6 presents the instrumental variables regression results.\nAs can be seen, there exists a negative and sizeable estimated effect of pre-kindergarten participation and behavioral problems in the first two years of school, and the estimated effect is no longer statistically significant in the third year of school. This evidence suggests that students who participated in public pre-kindergarten programs are less likely to be referred for disciplinary problems later than are non-participants. This result is at odds with much of the existing cross-sectional literature that demonstrates a positive relationship between pre-kindergarten participation and subsequent misbehavior.\nHowever, there is reason to be skeptical of this finding. Our sample of withinfamily access changers consists of families who moved, families who did not move but who were rezoned from one school to another, where one school offers a prekindergarten program and the other does not, and families who did not move and were not rezoned, but the zoned school changed its pre-kindergarten offerings between siblings. The second source of variation -rezonings -is arguably the most exogenous source of variation, but fewer than one percent of these families changed access status as a consequence of rezoning. However, 45 percent of families did not move and were not rezoned, but had their access status change when their zoned elementary school either added or dropped its pre-kindergarten program. These students provide more plausible variation, and the fourth row of Table 6 restricts the analysis to this set of students. We observe similar findings when we exclude students who changed access status because they changed residences, suggesting that endogenous location choice is not driving our within-family estimates. The fifth and sixth rows of Table 6 stratify these findings by student sex: Unsurprisingly, the results are concentrated exclusively in the male students, who are by far more likely to commit disciplinary infractions in the elementary grades.\nWhile we believe that the within-family identification strategy is more credible than an identification strategy that exploits school changes in public pre-kindergarten offerings over time, because of the non-randomness inherent in schools' and school districts' decisions to initiate or disband school-based pre-kindergarten programs, we are sensitive to the potential that cross-sibling spillovers may still undermine our withinfamily identification strategy. Therefore, in the last row of Table 6 we repeat the same basic empirical strategy without the family fixed effects -in essence, exploiting crosstime changes in locally zoned schools' pre-kindergarten program offerings. When we do this analysis, the results are slightly smaller but broadly consistent with those found using family fixed effects, suggesting that the findings are not being driven by our decision to compare sibling pairs. In the remainder of this paper, we will therefore continue to utilize our preferred within-family identification strategy.\nAre these results evidence of a short-term benefit only of public pre-kindergarten participation? It may be the case that the absence of behavioral problems in the first two years of schooling puts a child on a different trajectory. Table 7 shows that students who had behavioral problems in kindergarten were much more likely to be classified as emotionally disabled or severely emotionally disturbed later on. And Table 8 also presents instrumental variables regression analysis to show that public pre-kindergarten participation reduces the likelihood that a student, all else equal, will be classified as emotionally disabled in year 2 or year 3 of school. And in fact, we observe this reduction even when we control also for a student's actual observed behavior. This finding suggests that public pre-kindergarten participation not only appears to reduce the degree of problem behavior, relative to the alternative of private preschool or no preschool for disadvantaged youth, but it also seems to further reduce the likelihood of later classification into special education classes for students with serious social-emotional handicaps -above and beyond the degree of behavioral problems observed."}, {"section_title": "Falsification exercise", "text": "Especially given the fact that the estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten are considerably different depending on whether or not we instrument for pre-kindergarten participation, one might be concerned that our instrumental variables findings are being driven by the identification strategy employed. We therefore propose a falsification exercise, in which we utilize an indicator for low birth weight (i.e., less than 2500 grams at birth) as our replacement dependent variable. Pre-kindergarten participation cannot influence low birth weight, but an unmeasured third variable (e.g., exposure to an environmental toxin) could be associated with birth weight, pre-kindergarten participation and behavioral outcomes. Medical research indicates that low birth weight infants have a higher incidence of behavioral problems, so this association could be seen as a strong falsification test in the event of a finding of zero effect. Therefore, in Table 9 we conduct this falsification test. Because birth weight is a covariate in our regular regression models, we estimate this model without any covariates except for school and family fixed effects. In order to compare apples to apples, we also repeat our instrumental variables regression with discipline as a dependent variable to make certain that differential treatment of covariates is not responsible for the differences in results.\nWe conduct these tests both for the full sample of families and for the set of families where all observed children were zoned for the same school.\nWe observe that the results are quite similar with regard to discipline as a dependent variable, regardless of whether or not we include the covariates in the model.\nThere remains the general pattern of a negative relationship between pre-kindergarten participation and discipline in the first two years of school, with less evidence of a relationship in the third year. In the falsification exercise, however, there is no evidence of a relationship between low birth weight and pre-kindergarten participation in our instrumental variables models, providing further support for our instrumental variables identification strategy. Indeed, given the positive correlation between low birth weight and behavioral problems, the positive insignificant coefficient in the low birth weight specification is reassuring."}, {"section_title": "Availability of community-based Head Start options", "text": "Our administrative data set observes only children who participate in prekindergarten and Head Start programs located in public schools, but as mentioned above, income-eligible students have community-based Head Start options as well. Ideally, we would have administrative data on all Head Start and pre-kindergarten participants, regardless of whether they attended public or private facilities, but these data are unavailable in a form that can be matched to birth records and subsequent school records.\nTherefore, we are limited in our analysis to compare public pre-kindergarten participants to all other income-eligible children -both those who did not participate in preschool and those who attended a community-based Head Start facility. Evidence of a negative relationship between public pre-kindergarten participation and behavioral problems, therefore, could be either upward or downward-biased, depending on the quality of community-based Head Start facilities.\nWhile we cannot directly observe community-based Head Start participation, we can stratify communities on the basis of differential ease of participating in communitybased Head Start. We matched all community-based Head Start facilities to students at the zip code level, and found that 52 percent of students whose zoned elementary school In Table 10 we stratify our estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten programs into those for students in zip codes with and without community-based Head Start facilities. We observe a striking pattern: The estimated effect of public pre-kindergarten participation in neighborhoods without a local community-based Head Start option (where, presumably, students are less likely to be participating in community-based Head Start programs) is consistently less negative (and is actually positive and statistically significant in the third year of school) than is the case when a community-based Head Start facility is available nearby. These results indicate that in the situations where students are relatively unlikely to attend community-based Head Start (and therefore, that the estimated effect of public pre-kindergarten can more comfortably be viewed as a comparison with no preschool) there is little evidence of a reduction in disciplinary problems, and if anything, by the third year of school, there is evidence of an increase in disciplinary problems associated with public pre-kindergarten participation.\nHowever, when the comparison group is more likely to be a hybrid of no preschool and community-based Head Start facilities, the negative, significant (and consistent through year three) estimated effect of public pre-kindergarten returns. There are a number of potential explanations for this finding: One is that community-based Head Start participation is strongly associated with later behavior problems in school, while another explanation is that the presence of community-based Head Start programs puts competitive pressure on public pre-kindergarten programs to be higher quality. A third possibility is that community-based Head Start programs may be uptaking worsebehaving children as well, which could be the case if public pre-kindergarten programs enforce higher behavior standards. It is impossible to know which, if any, of these explanations might be at play here.\nOf course, another possible explanation is that zip codes with community-based Head Start facilities are simply different. There exists strong evidence to suggest that this is the case: Recall from Table 2 that community-based Head Start programs tend to locate in zip codes with more eligible students, and where students in general tend to be more disadvantaged -coming from households with unmarried mothers or with mothers who did not graduate from high school. Even the eligible students in these neighborhoods tend to be more disadvantaged on average along measurable dimensions. So it might be the case that the differences observed between locales where community-based Head\nStart is an option and those where it is less of an option could merely reflect these neighborhood differences.\nIn an attempt to gauge the degree to which these neighborhood differences might be at play, we repeat the same analysis but compare the estimated effects of public prekindergarten participation for students in relatively advantaged neighborhoods to those for students in relatively disadvantaged neighborhoods. We define neighborhood advantage in two different ways --one based on the percentage of children in the neighborhood who are eligible for public pre-kindergarten and one based on the percentage of children in the neighborhood whose mothers are not high school graduates.\nThese results, reported in the second two panels of Table 10 , indicate that the estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten in these different settings are very highly related to measures of neighborhood disadvantage. Neighborhoods with fewer disadvantaged families tend to have small (or opposite-signed) estimated effects of public prekindergarten programs, while neighborhoods with more disadvantaged families tend to have large, significant estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten programs. 5 These results strongly suggest that the differences in findings between the estimated efficacy of public pre-kindergarten when community-based options are available and that when community-based options are less available are due not to competitive pressure coming from community-based Head Start programs but rather to the likelihood that public prekindergarten programs are most helpful in the most disadvantaged neighborhoodsprecisely the neighborhoods where community-based Head Start programs are most likely to locate.\nIn an attempt to further investigate this interpretation of the findings, we conduct the same analysis in Table 11 , in which we limit the sample to the set of zip codes where community-based Head Start programs are located. This sampling restriction necessarily increases standard errors, but we find strong evidence that, conditioning on the existence of community-based Head Start programs, public pre-kindergarten programs are dramatically more successful with students residing in more disadvantaged neighborhoods than with those residing in less disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nWe next stratify the estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten based on a series of family attributes -the mother's age, mother's education level, the child's birth weight and the mother's race. The results of this exercise are presented in Table 12 . We further differentiate these estimated effects on the basis of measured neighborhood disadvantage, proxied using the rate of free-lunch eligibility in the neighborhood. We have also used the presence of a community-based Head Start program as a proxy of neighborhood disadvantage, and find similar results. We observe relative consistency across the various strata by Year 2 along a series of dimensions: We find that public pre-kindergarten is associated with increased estimated rates of behavioral problems in relatively advantaged neighborhoods and decreased estimated rates of behavioral problems in relatively disadvantaged communities. The differences between these two rates tend to be statistically significant in Year 2. While the results are rather noisy, nonetheless the general pattern of findings remains consistent with those presented above: the estimated beneficial effects of public pre-kindergarten programs are present in the relatively disadvantaged communities and not in the relatively advantaged communities."}, {"section_title": "Other outcomes", "text": "We next turn to other outcomes besides basic discipline and behavioral disability classification. Specifically, in Table 13 we consider the likelihood that a student will, by the end of his or her third year, either have been suspended out of school or repeated a grade. 6 These arguably represent more serious behavioral outcomes than referral to the principal's office for a rule infraction.\nAs can be seen in Table 13 , patterns similar to disciplinary problems emerge with regard to suspension and grade repetition: Students participating in public prekindergarten programs are estimated to be significantly more likely to be suspended than are non-participants in relatively advantaged communities, and are significantly less likely to be suspended than are non-participants in relatively disadvantaged neighborhoods. The difference between the two is statistically significantly different from zero as well. The patterns of signs are the same for grade repetition, but neither point estimate is statistically significant; the difference between the two, however, is statistically significant at the seven percent level. These results, while suggestive, provide further evidence that there exist substantial differences in results between communities with community-based Head Start options and those that have less access to community-based Head Start, most likely suggesting that the potential socializing benefits of public pre-kindergarten programs are strongest in the disadvantaged communities where less socialization may have previously taken place -the neighborhoods where community-based Head Start programs are more likely to locate. It is also possible that community-based Head Start programs enroll less socialized students and/or are less successful in teaching appropriate school behavior. With the available data it is impossible to know for certain the degree to which these various explanations are valid, but these results suggest future directions for research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We utilize a unique matched administrative data set and a novel identification strategy to study the effects of public pre-kindergarten participation on student behavioral outcomes. A first pass at the data would indicate that public pre-kindergarten leads to reduced student disciplinary problems and reduced rates of being classified emotional disabled or severely emotionally disturbed.\nHowever, the comparison group in question includes both community-based Head Start participants and income eligible students who did not participate in preschool.\nWhile we lack the ability to identify which members of our comparison group are community-based Head Start participants, we can stratify neighborhoods based on whether there exists a community-based Head Start facility in the zip code. While this is a crude stratification, it provides some evidence on the performance of public prekindergarten programs as we can make an attempt to tease out the estimated effects of community-based Head Start participation. We find that the favorable estimated effects of public pre-kindergarten programs are concentrated in the communities where there exist community-based Head Start programs. There exist both favorable and unfavorable explanations for this result: It could be the case that community-based Head Start programs recruit more non compliant children and therefore the overall public prekindergarten results are biased in favor of positive behavioral outcomes. But it could also be the case that community-based Head Start programs provide a competitive spur for public pre-kindergarten programs. We cannot disentangle these two candidate explanations for the results found in the presence of a community-based Head Start program.\nHowever, our further investigation strongly indicates that the findings of relative benefits of public pre-kindergarten programs in communities with community-based Head Start programs in operation are due not to the community-based Head Start programs themselves but rather to differences in the communities in which these programs operate. We find that the behavioral benefits of public pre-kindergarten programs are concentrated in the least advantaged neighborhoods -the communities where community-based Head Start programs tend to operate. In relatively advantaged neighborhoods, on the other hand, we do not find evidence that public pre-kindergarten programs have appreciable behavioral benefits. This may be due to differences in community institutions, neighborhood effects, or private pre-kindergarten alternatives in these more advantaged neighborhoods, or it may be that the families eligible for public pre-kindergarten who live in more advantaged neighborhoods tend to be more advantaged themselves than do their income-eligible counterparts in less advantaged neighborhoods. We will continue to investigate these differences in our future work.
