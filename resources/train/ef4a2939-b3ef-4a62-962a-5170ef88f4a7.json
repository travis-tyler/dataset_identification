The radionuclides released from the FNPP1 were transferred eastward by a strong jet stream and reached the west coast of North America within four days [1] . A portion of the airborne radionuclides was deposited into the Pacific Ocean by a dry/wet deposition process. Moreover, water used to cool a damaged nuclear reactor leaked into the ocean. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) estimated that 4.7 \u00d7 10 15 Bq of radioactive materials including 131 I, 134 Cs, and 137 Cs were released directly into the ocean from a pit of the Unit 2 reactor during April 1-6, 2011 [2] . In addition, TEPCO confirmed the following accidental/intentional direct releases into the ocean: (1) an intentional discharge of 1.5 \u00d7 10 11 Bq of low-level wastewater during April 4-10, (2) an accidental release estimated at 2.0 \u00d7 10 13 Bq from the Unit 3 reactor on May 11, and (3) an accidental leakage of 2.6 \u00d7 10 10 Bq from a desalination plant on December 4.\nAssessment of the accident's influence on the marine environment should include a fundamental * Corresponding author. Email: kobayashi.takuya38@jaea.go.jp understanding of the actual conditions of radionuclide release into the ocean through direct and atmospheric pathways. Numerical simulations of radionuclide migration near the coastal region attributed to the FNPP1 accident have been performed by several authors [3] [4] [5] [6] . In addition, long-term climatological simulation models that include 10-30 year forecasting results for the entire Pacific region have been reported [7, 8] . These studies performed atmospheric dispersion simulations of the radionuclide release into the ocean through the atmospheric pathway on the basis of the source term estimated by previous studies [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, it should be noted that while the source term for the period in which the plume flowed over land in Japan is reasonable, that for the period in which the plume flowed into and deposited over the ocean could not be verified [12] . Therefore, it is important to validate the source term of atmospheric release through measurements of the seawater collected from the Pacific Ocean.\nIn this study, as a first step toward a better understanding of radionuclide dispersion in the Pacific Ocean due to the FNPP1 accident, the source term of atmospheric release estimated by a previous study [12] was validated by coupling atmospheric and oceanic 256 T. Kobayashi et al. dispersion simulations with 134 Cs observed in the seawater collected from the Pacific Ocean.\nThe oceanic dispersion of 134 Cs has been simulated using 134 Cs deposition on the sea surface calculated by an atmospheric dispersion model. The source term of 134 Cs was given by that determined by Terada et al. [12] , hereafter the initial source term, by assuming the same release rate for 134 Cs and 137 Cs. The simulation results obtained using the initial source term showed good agreement with most observed sea surface concentration of 134 Cs. However, the simulation results for the eastern North Pacific showed a tendency of underestimating observed sea surface concentration of 134 Cs. We believed that this tendency resulted from an underestimation of the initial source term. Therefore, the source term of the atmospheric release of radionuclides, hereafter the new source term, was refined to reduce the underestimation of observed sea surface concentration of 134 Cs collected from the Pacific Ocean. This refinement of the source term is a first effort to feed oceanic dispersion analysis results back into atmospheric dispersion analysis.\nIn Section 2, we describe the four models and discuss the validation results of the initial source term and the estimation method for the new source term from observed 134 Cs in seawater. In Section 3, the results of the new source term and simulation of 134 Cs using the new source term are explained."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Numerical models for atmospheric dispersion", "text": "The Worldwide Version of System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (WSPEEDI-II) [13] was used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides released from the FNPP1 over the Pacific Ocean.

K7 is a fully coupled global general circulation model (GCM) developed by Data Research Center for Marine-Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC/DrC). The coupled GCM is composed of the Atmospheric GCM for the Earth Simulator (AFES) [18] and the Ocean-Sea Ice GCM for the Earth Simulator (OIFES) [19] . The resolution of the AFES component is T42 horizontally (approximately 2.8\n\u2022 ) and 24 layers in vertical \u03c3 coordinates. The resolution of the OIFES component is 1\n\u2022 horizontally and 45 vertical layers.

The assimilated elements for the AFES included air temperature, specific humidity, and wind vector from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NOAA/NCEP). Further details of K7 and its prediction performance are described in Sugiura et al. [17] . The optimization of the initial value of OIFES and sea surface bulk correction coefficients, including the coefficients of each bulk formula of latent heat, sensible heat, and momentum flux, were iterated to approach the observed dataset during the reanalysis period from January 1 to June 30.\nSEA-GEARN is a particle random-walk model to simulate radionuclide transport in oceans [20] . Cesium-134 (half life = 2.1 years) was considered in the calculation. The computational domain includes the entire North Pacific region ( Figure 1 ).

For vertical fluxes, the average for the mixed layer of an entire calculation period of K7, namely 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 m 2 s \u22121 , was used for the entire model grid. The time step was 20 min.

This tendency indicates that the actual abundance of 134 Cs in the eastern North Pacific was higher than that obtained by calculation using the initial source term. We attributed this tendency to an underestimation of the release rate in the initial source term for some periods. The initial source term was estimated on the basis of environmental monitoring data on land. However, monitoring data in the ocean were not considered. Therefore, the source term of the atmospheric release of radionuclides, hereafter the new source term, was refined using 134 Cs observed in the seawater collected from the North Pacific."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of the new source term", "text": "We set the estimation period as March 12-20 to reflect the large release rate change reported by previous studies [10, 12] . The release period was separated into 18 terms, as shown in Figure 4 . Numbers with the prefix \"a\" in the figure indicate a period in which the release rates were determined on the basis of land monitoring data [9, 10] . We estimated the new release rate during these periods. No land monitoring data was available; therefore, the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 was assumed to be the same as the explosions at Unit 1 in the initial source term [12] . For this reason, the Unit 3 event was time-averaged [12] . Divided periods of estimation are represented by gray lines. The date and time of important plant events are also shown in figure. This figure is modified from Figure 4 of Katata et al. [10] .\nto \"term 5\" for estimation using measurement data in the ocean.\nThe new release rates at each term were estimated by the following method. First, two model simulations were conducted to calculate the sea surface concentration of 134 Cs. These included atmospheric dispersion simulation by GEARN that used the initial release rate, followed by oceanic dispersion simulation by SEA-GEARN that used sources such as direct release from the FNPP1 into the ocean and atmospheric deposition derived from the simulation of GEARN. The correction coefficient for the initial source term, which assumed that these dispersion simulations are correct, was obtained by measuring the calculated sea surface concentration of 134 Cs at the sampling point i as follows:\nwhere R i is the correction coefficient at the sampling point i, M i is the measured sea surface concentration (Bq L \u22121 ) of 134 Cs at the sampling point i, and C i is the calculated sea surface concentration (Bq L \u22121 ) of 134 Cs at the sampling point i at 12 JST on the same observed date. The range of R i was 0.024 to 706.\nNext, to investigate the correction quantity on the basis of the cumulative deposition amount, i.e., to estimate which release period should be corrected, the contribution of deposition must be measured for each release period at each sampling point. In particular, unit release (1 Bq h \u22121 ) calculations during each of the 18 terms of the release periods shown in Figure 4 were performed by GEARN. The daily deposition data of each simulation result were used as the input in the calculation of SEA-GEARN. The direct release from the FNPP1 into the ocean was not considered in the calculation of SEA-GEARN. \nwhere IRate j is the initial release rate (Bq h \u22121 ) at term j, which was estimated by Terada et al. [12] . As a result, the contribution ratio at each term j to the sum of all terms at the sampling point i is written as follows:\nThe correction coefficient X j , which considers the weighting of the contribution ratio at each sampling point i, is written as\nFinally, in this study, the new release rate NRate j (Bq h \u22121 ) at term j is written by multiplying IRate j with the rate X j :"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimation results for the new source term", "text": "The new release rate of 137 Cs was derived from that of 134 Cs because the assumed radioactivity ratio of 134 Cs/ 137 Cs is 1.0. The radioactivity ratio of 131 I/ 137 Cs determined by Terada et al. [12] was also used for estimating the new release rate of 131 I. The time variation and values of the new source terms of 131 I and 137 Cs are shown in Table 2 . These time variations are compared with the initial release rate in Figure 4 . For estimating the new release rate, a coarse oceanographic model of 1\n\u2022 horizontal resolution was used; therefore, a sharp change in the release rate could not be expressed.\nThe correction coefficient X j exceeded one in all periods. The lowest value was 1.1 at term 10, from 18 JST on March 17 to 6 JST on March 18, and the highest value was 4.4 at term 3, from 15 to 23 JST on March 13; the average value was 2.5.\nThe new release rate of 137 Cs reached the peak of 8. plume mainly flowed to the Pacific Ocean owing to a southwesterly-westerly wind from 12 JST on March 12 to 12 JST on March 14 [10] , the estimation accuracy of the initial source term at this period was low. Therefore, the estimation method that used observed seawater data gave a more reliable result. At term 5, from 11 to 19 JST on March 14, the total estimation was 2.0 \u00d7 10 14 Bq during the period in which the release rate of the hydrogen explosion in Unit 3 was time-averaged. However, it was impossible to classify the volume of the amount released as a result of this explosion.\nThe temporal change of the release rate for term a3, from 19 JST on March 14 to 17 JST on March 15, was estimated in detail by previous investigations [9, 10] . However, only air dose rates were available as measurements; the release rates of major radionuclides were determined through reproduction of the air dose rates from groundshine by assuming the radioactivity ratio of the radionuclides. The new release rate was 1.8 times larger than the initial release rate. Thus, atmospheric dispersion simulation with the new release rate will result in overestimation of the surface deposition concentration. The contribution of the wet deposition according to rain or snow coverage at this accident is high. Then, for atmospheric dispersion simulation, increasing the wet deposition intensity by approximately 0.6 corrects the new estimation, and the surface deposition concentration would be in agreement with the land monitoring data. However, when the wet deposition intensity is 0.6 times, the sea surface concentration may be underestimated again. Moreover, considering the overestimation of 137 Cs deposition on the land near the northern part of Japan reported by Terada et al. [12] compared with airborne monitoring, it is expected that the atmospheric dispersion calculation with the initial release rate for this period could reproduce the measurements of 134 Cs in sea water by reducing the error in deposition prediction. The appropriate source term is obtained by conducting sensitivity analysis of the parameter of wet deposition intensity and repeating the same work as reported in this study by using model simulation and the observed sea surface concentration.\nThe total amounts of 131 I and 137 Cs discharged into the atmosphere from 5 JST on March 12 to 0 JST on May 1 are estimated to be approximately 2.0 \u00d7 10 17 and 1.3 \u00d7 10 16 Bq, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Cesium-134 simulation with the new source term", "text": "The horizontal distribution of the sea surface concentration of 134 Cs used for calculation with the new source term and for measurements from March 31 to May 17, 2011 is shown in Figure 5 .

As shown in Figure 5 (b) and (c), the extension of a green contour area of approximately 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 Bq L \u22121 northeast of the FNPP1 agrees with the observed data. Figure 6 shows the results of comparison between the simulation and measurements of the sea surface concentration of 134 Cs using the new source term. The results obtained with the initial source term are also plotted for comparison. Because all the new release rates at all 18 terms increased, the simulated concentration increased relative to the results obtained with the initial release rate. The statistics on the percentage of calculations of the sea surface concentration of 134 Cs that are within factors of 2, 5, and 10 of the measurements are summarized in Table 1 . All statistic values were improved. A comparison of the statistics obtained with the new source term with those obtained with the initial source term reveals that FA5 increased from 60% to 65%. These results indicate that radionuclides observed in seawater can be actually used for estimating the atmospheric source term of nuclear accidents that occur in coastal areas. However, the simulation results in some areas of the eastern North Pacific remain underestimated ( Figure 6 ).
