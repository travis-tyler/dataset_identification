Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Focus on Children As Respondents in Social Research", "text": "Today, children are seen as independent individuals in social survey research and no longer an ignored minority. Survey researchers interested in the growing-up, perspectives, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviour of children increasingly collect data from children themselves. Proxy reporting by parents or other caregivers is no longer seen as a suitable and satisfactory mode of data collection (Scott 1997) . This is exemplified by the many child surveys where children's opinions and attitudes are collected using different modes of data collection and over a different period of time: for example, the Child Longitudinal Study (Germany), the Child Survey (Austria), the British Household Panel Study (Great Britain) , the Young People's Social Attitudes Survey (Great Britain), the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (Canada), the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (United States), and the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, to mention just a few. Large-scale assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) or TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) are also worth noting.\nAlthough survey methodology has been developed mainly for studies in adult populations, research has been done on adapting it for use with children and evaluating the influence of their cognitive growth on data quality (see, for example, Borgers et al. 2000 , Borgers et al. 2003 ). Item nonresponse in child surveys in general, and specifically in standardised face-to-face child interviews, however, has received only limited attention to date (see, for example, Hox 2001, Fuchs 2008) . Compared with self-completion questionnaires that target children as respondents, surveying children by means of interviews is of particular interest, because the interviewer and the interview situation may affect the young respondent's behaviour. We relate the frequency of item nonresponse on particular types of questions to the characteristics of the respondents (children), the interviewers, and the interview setting. The purpose of our main research is to discover whether and how child and interviewer characteristics as well as the interview setting affect item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children."}, {"section_title": "Past Research and Theoretical Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Past Research on Children As Survey Participants in General", "text": "This section briefly reviews past research on children as survey participants in general. An analysis by Borgers et al. (2003, p. 91 ) examined the correlation of child characteristics and offering vague quantifiers and labelled response options with stability over time. They found, contrary to their expectations, that younger children did not have more difficulty with cognitively challenging questions. The older the child, however, the greater the stability was over time. Compared with younger children, older children can take greater advantage of fully labelled response options.\nA methodological survey experiment on the effect of several question characteristics on the reliability of the responses conducted by Borgers et al. (2004) revealed no effects of negatively formulated questions on the reliability measures; the authors advised offering about four response options when children are respondents.\nDe Leeuw and Otter (1995) showed that a clear interaction existed between the age of children and the effect of ambiguous questions. Older children handled ambiguity much more easily than younger children. Fuchs (2005, p. 701) examined several experiments on response order, question order, scale effects, and the effects of the numeric values associated with the response categories with children. His results indicated that younger and less educated children answered survey questions from a cognitively less ambitious perspective than adults did. In a later study by Fuchs (2008) , the interviewer respondent interaction was videotaped, and all children underwent extensive cognitive tests. The results showed that younger children (ages 8 -9) show considerably more problematic behaviours, suggesting problems in understanding and answering survey questions, than older respondents (ages 13 -14)."}, {"section_title": "Past Research on Item Nonresponse in Child Surveys", "text": "This section briefly reviews the state of knowledge in the field of item nonresponse in child surveys. Borgers and colleagues (1999) investigated the influence of child characteristics and cognitive growth on data quality when surveying children by means of meta-analytic techniques. They found that gender and year of education influenced item nonresponse and internal consistency in a large number of different, multi-item scales. The hypothesis that data quality increases with cognitive growth was supported.\nFurthermore, Borgers and Hox (2001) investigated the effect of item and personal characteristics on item nonresponse in written questionnaires used with schoolchildren. They found that item nonresponse is relatively rare, and the predicted response differences are relatively small. They concluded that young children do not perform as well as children who have been in education longer (they produce more item nonresponse), but their response behaviour is still satisfactory.\nWith a more qualitative, semi-standardised approach, Vogl (2011) recently explored the question-answer process in child interviews (ages 5 -11). Focussing on 'don't know' responses, the results indicated fewer 'don't know' responses as children grow older due to their cognitive state; problems with the research instrument did not result in differences in the number of 'don't know' responses.\nAnother analysis of an adult survey by Shoemaker et al. (2002) used question sensitivity and cognitive effort to distinguish between 'don't knows' and refusals. They found that more sensitive questions attracted more refusals, whereas questions that require more cognitive effort received more 'don't knows'. Note that cognitive effort also correlated significantly with refusals. There is also evidence of item nonresponse in the event that adult respondents do not have adequately precise answers (Juster and Smith 1997) , or as Fuchs (2008) reasoned, children might answer survey questions even if they have problems processing them.\nTo summarise past research, we can state that younger children are able to answer survey questions in an appropriate way if survey instruments are tailored to them. Nevertheless, as children grow older, their ability to answer survey questions and to handle ambiguity increases. This is also evident from the fact that item nonresponse declines with increasing age and/or year of education in all of the studies mentioned above."}, {"section_title": "The Influence of Interviewers on Item Nonresponse in Child Surveys", "text": "In the special case of face-to-face interviews, the interviewer plays an important role in the question-answer process, even with children as respondents. Regarding item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with adults, there is empirical evidence that interviewers are not neutral collectors of data but can influence the answers obtained (Pickery and Loosveldt 1998; Pickery and Loosveldt 2001) . The interviewer can have a positive influence in reducing item nonresponse but may also induce item nonresponse (De Leeuw et al. 2003, p. 165) . The results of comparisons of interviewer effects on factual and attitudinal questions in several studies are heterogeneous, with some of them finding that attitudinal measures are subject to higher interviewer variance. Greater effects for attitudinal questions have been found especially for questions with open-ended responses, emotionally charged questions, questions with difficult items (such as income or occupation), and questions that lack specification of an interviewing procedure (Groves 2004, p. 374) . Findings on interviewer effects in adult surveys show that younger and lesseducated interviewers have a higher level of item nonresponse (Huddy et al. 1997) .\nItem nonresponse is often the result of interaction between two sources of survey errors (Groves 2004) , for instance the interaction between an interviewer and a respondent. Not much is known about how children react and behave face-to-face with a strange interviewer. There could be a huge social distance between young children and adult interviewers. Therefore we assume that young children adapt their responses to the suspected expectations of adult interviewers and might have a tendency towards social desirability (De Leeuw et al. 2004 )."}, {"section_title": "The Interview Setting: Presence and Intervention of Third Parties During the Interview", "text": "The influence of third parties during the interview, especially parents, may bias responses from children in a positive or negative way: positively, if children are trying to answer the questions honestly and truthfully in the presence of their parents; negatively, if -especially as regards sensitive issues -the presence of parents or other persons leads to untruthful statements (Scott et al. 1995, p. 261; Reuband 1987) . In general, the presence of third parties during standardised, face-to-face interviews is often undesirable, since researchers suspect there may be negative consequences for the question-answer process. Reuband (1984) reported a proportion of third parties during an average of about one third of adult interviews; similarly, Haunberger (2005) reported a high number of third parties present during standardised, face-to-face interviews with children, for the most part the children's parents (see Table 2 for details). Nevertheless, third parties may not necessarily act as a disrupting factor, but rather can exert a social control function and therefore contribute, especially in the case of factual questions, to more truthful answers (Reuband 1984) ."}, {"section_title": "Asking and Answering Survey Questions: Cognitive and Communicative Processes", "text": "The respondents' answers comprise a cognitive and communicative process (Schwarz and Sudman 1995) . When answering survey questions, respondents must perform several tasks. First, they must interpret the question in order to understand what is meant, and second, they must retrieve relevant information. Third, they must integrate that information into a private opinion to finally formulate and edit a response (see Tourangeau et al. 2000 for details) . This cognitive approach to the answering process shows that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of item nonresponse, which can have different causes and different meanings: Item nonresponse can easily occur when questions about events in the past are asked, or sensitive topics are probed, or when the questions are too difficult, uninteresting, too embarrassing, or too threatening. Middle childhood (ages 8-11) has been referred to as a pathway to future (cognitive) development. In the early middle years of childhood, children gradually increase their logical thinking, memory, and learning strategies, and consolidate important academic skills such as reading and writing. In the later middle years of childhood, children gradually expand their ability to apply learned concepts to new tasks and are increasingly interested in learning life skills from adults (Kail 2011) . Therefore, answering a survey question in middle childhood might be a particular challenge, because children's cognitive, memory, communicative, and social faculties are still developing."}, {"section_title": "Towards a Theory of Item Nonresponse", "text": "The model of the response process posited by Beatty and Hermann (2002; also see Groves et al. 2009 ) distinguishes between four levels of cognitive states regarding information required by survey questions: available, accessible, generatable, and inestimable. The four states are ordered by the level of retrieved knowledge suitable for a question response. If the required information can be retrieved with minimal effort, the substantive response is available or accessible. If the required information is not known exactly, the substantive response is barely generatable or completely inestimable, resulting in item nonresponse. Therefore a hypothetical question should be inestimable as it is based on assumptions rather than facts."}, {"section_title": "Research Question and Hypotheses", "text": "Given the background of the relevant research and theoretical assumptions, we want to investigate whether, and if so, how child and interviewer characteristics and the interview setting affect item nonresponse. For this purpose, several hypotheses have been developed.\nEmpirical evidence points to the fact that younger and less educated children produce more item nonresponses, leading to our first hypothesis. Hypothesis 1: With increasing cognitive functioning (measured by age and educational achievement), item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children will be reduced.\nIn our next hypothesis, we specify a nondirectional premise, as research on interviewer characteristics influencing item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children is still lacking. Hypothesis 2: Interviewer characteristics will influence the impact of item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children in different ways.\nAs we pointed out, we assume that it is primarily young children who adapt their responses to the supposed expectations of adult interviewers because of the huge social distance between them. Hypothesis 3: Cross-level effects between child and interviewer characteristics (especially age) will influence the impact of item nonresponse in standardised face-to-face interviews with children in different ways.\nFurthermore, we suppose that third parties during the interview act as mediators, especially for children in the presence of their parents trying to answer the questions honestly and truthfully, leading to our last hypothesis. Hypothesis 4: Third parties during the interview will influence item nonresponses in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "In this next section, the data, variables, and multilevel logistic analysis are introduced."}, {"section_title": "Data Set", "text": "The data used in the analyses come from the Child Longitudinal Study conducted by the German Youth Institute. They are based upon a prospective longitudinal survey with two national, representative group samples in the following age groups: children in the last year of kindergarten (five-year-olds) and second-year primary school children. Children in the older cohort (and their parents) were interviewed in three survey stages at intervals of approximately 18 months.\nThe first wave was conducted in the autumn of 2002, the second wave in the spring of 2004, and the third wave in the spring of 2005. As the study was not conducted for methodological purposes, a major drawback is that it was not possible to obtain measures of the interviewers' beliefs, expectations, and psychological characteristics or even to arrange an experimental setting. The sample size, the response rates and the number of interviewers for each wave are presented in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selection of Variables", "text": "In a first step, we calculated descriptive analyses for the whole data set to obtain a first impression of the distribution of item nonresponse, and subsequently made a preselection of variables. The following topic areas are addressed in the questionnaires: personality traits: 2 scales, the child's interests and activities: 3 scales, behaviour in conflict situations (with mother): 2 scales, school: well-being in school: 1 scale, parents' interest in school: 1 scale, achievement motivation: 1 scale, victims of violence: 1 scale, bullying: 1 scale, friends: child's network of friends: 1 scale, happiness with friends: 1 scale, behaviour in conflict situations (with friends): 1 scale, family climate: 1 scale, satisfaction with neighbourhood: 1 scale. All scales were asked over the three panel waves.\nWe found that the percentage of item nonresponse in this child survey is generally low, which creates two limitations for the selection of our dependent variables. On the one hand, we had to exclude questions with item nonresponse equal or less than 2 percent from the outset, on the other hand we were unable to follow the suggestion in the literature and distinguish between 'don't know' answers and refusals (Shoemaker et al. 2002) . A separation between 'don't know' answers and refusals would have left too few cases for the analysis. Nevertheless, it was possible to select one scale from almost every topic area. This corresponds to a share of 40 percent of all scales in the questionnaire, which were used in the item nonresponse analyses."}, {"section_title": "Linking Variables to the Model of the Response Process", "text": "In a second step, we linked the remaining variables with the Beatty-Hermann (2002) model of the response process. For self-description and leisure activities, we assumed that children were able to retrieve information with minimal effort (information available). The children's own achievement motivation, family climate, and behaviour in conflicts with friends could be retrieved with effort (information accessible) and represents a sensitive topic. Children might not have much knowledge of their parents' interest in school, In a third step, all dependent response variables were dichotomised, resulting in scales with the categories adequate responses (0) and item nonresponse (1). Remember that our category for item nonresponse includes 'don't know' answers as well as refusals.\nThe dependent variables vary considerably in question length, sensitivity, and response scales. Obviously, the highest item nonresponse rate was found for questions offering an explicit 'don't know' category (child's rating of parental interest in school, child's achievement motivation). In any case, the main purpose of this article is to clarify whether and how child and interviewer characteristics and the interview setting affect item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children, and not to explain the amount of item nonresponse due to different response scales."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "The selection of the independent variables on the respondent and interviewer level was restricted due to the variables available in the existing data file and is largely based on the empirical evidence reported in Section 2."}, {"section_title": "Respondent Variables (Children)", "text": "On the respondent level, we included the following variables in the multilevel logistic analysis (see Table 2 for details): Gender (girl: 0, boy: 1), age (metrical, centred around the grand mean), educational achievement (mean: marks in mathematics, language, and reading, running from very good: 4 to fail: 1, centred around the grand mean), social and cognitive open-mindedness, self-efficacy (strongly disagree: 1 to strongly agree: 4) (both mothers' estimations).\nInterviewer rating: children's willingness to respond (low: 0, high: 1), openmindedness (low: 0, high: 1), concentration skills (low: 0, high: 1) and language skills (poor: 0, good: 1).

With the software HLM 7.0 we specified a nonlinear analysis for binary outcomes. Therefore the binary outcome model uses a binomial sampling model and a logit link function (see Bryk and Raudenbush 2004 for details) .\nBefore performing the multilevel analysis with panel data in HLM we reshaped the wide data files into long form, resulting in a pooled data set with 2,384 cases on each level. Level 1 missing data was automatically deleted when running the analyses. We controlled whether a correlation existed between the amount of item nonresponse in one panel wave per case and unit nonresponse in the following panel wave. We found no correlation, for multilevel logistic analyses centred around the grand mean which is not surprising given that the participation of the child is highly dependent on the participation of the parents.\nAfter running the analyses, HLM offers different outputs (unit-specific model versus population-average model with robust standard errors). We present estimates of the population-average model with robust standard errors, since it is more appropriate for estimating the predicted population proportion and it is much less susceptible to misspecifications and distributional assumptions since it is based on generalised least squares estimation with robust standard errors (Zeger et al. 1988 ).\nWe present an example of model specification using the binary dependent variable 'family climate'. All respondent characteristics are included in Level 1 (see Equation 1 ). Subscripts i belong to the respondents and subscripts j to the interviewers.\nLevel 1 Model\nInterviewer characteristics and characteristics of the interview setting are included in Level 2. We specified a random intercept model, since only the parameters associated with the constant vary across interviewers. The residual at the interviewer level can be denoted as u.\nIn order to better disentangle the effect of the child's gender and the effect of the interviewer's gender due to item nonresponse, we included cross-level interactions on Level 2 (for example: b 1j represents the interaction between Level 1 variable 'gender of the child' and Level 2 variable 'gender of the interviewer') (see Equation 2 ).\nNote that b 3j to b 9j represents the coefficients from Equation 1, without specifying an interaction effect.\nLevel 2 Model\nHaunberger: Item Nonresponse in Face-to-Face Interviews with Children\n4. Results Table 3 reports the results of the multilevel logistic analyses for item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children. For the random part, we included values for the interviewer variance (u0j ) in the table, which corresponds to the interceptonly model. To increase interpretability of interactions, the value zero must be meaningful and actually occur in the data. For age and educational achievement we accomplished this by centring both variables on their grand mean. For gender, females were zero-coded (Hox 2010, pp. 63-68) . In each column, we reported the coefficients, t-ratio and asterisks as indicators of the level of significance. We explained results for all analyses separately, referring only to results reaching the p , 0.05 level.\nWe first look at the interviewer level. Item nonresponse in the question about selfdescription is only explained by the variable indicating the same interviewer in at least two waves. If the interview was conducted by the same interviewer, this increased item nonresponse in the question about self-description.\nOn the respondent level the child's age, concentration and language skills affected the amount of item nonresponse. With increasing age, concentration and language skills, item nonresponse decreases. In addition, a significant interaction effect appeared between child gender/interviewer gender; meaning girls and female interviewers produced less item nonresponse in the question about self-description. However, the variance at the interviewer level is not significant.\nOn the interviewer level, only interview length affected the number of item nonresponses to the question about leisure activities. Increasing length of the interview correlates positively with more item nonresponse. We are not able to specify a cause and effect relationship, since we cannot clearly determine whether increased interview length led to more item nonresponses or whether more item nonresponses led to an increased interview length. On the respondent level, we found two significant effects: With increasing age, item nonresponse decreases. Children with good concentration skills produced more item nonresponses if they were asked about their hobbies. Taking a look at the interaction effect, the coefficient of child age/interviewer age is positive and statistically significant; meaning that with an increase in the age of the child and the interviewer, more item nonresponse occurs for this question. Again, the interviewer variance is not significant.\nFor achievement motivation we found only two significant effects at the interviewer level.

The older the interviewers, the more item nonresponses occurred. Difficulties during the interview led to increased item nonresponse. Furthermore, we found three significant effects on the respondent level. Similar to the interviewer's age, older children produce more item nonresponse.\nPoor academic performance produced more item nonresponse regarding the question of achievement motivation. Last but not least, with decreasing concentration skills, item nonresponse increases.\nIn regard to the question about parents' interest in school, we found no significant effect at the interviewer level and four significant effects at the respondent level. Poor academic performance produced more item nonresponse regarding the question of parents' interest in school. The more self-efficacy children have, the more meaningful responses will be produced. With decreasing willingness to respond and decreasing concentration skills, item nonresponse increases.\nTurning to our next model, analysing family climate, we found three significant effects on the interviewer level: Item nonresponse increases with increasing age of the interviewer. If the interview was conducted by the same interviewer, item nonresponse increases. The shorter the interview, the more item nonresponse will be produced. We identified three significant effects at the respondent level: Item nonresponse increases with decreasing age of the children. The smaller the willingness to respond and the poorer the language skills, the more item nonresponse will be produced.\nAt the interviewer level, item nonresponse to the question about the behaviour in conflicts with friends is explained by two variables: interventions of third parties and difficulties during the interview leading to more item nonresponse.\nAt the respondent level we found one significant variable: The greater the social and cognitive open-mindedness, the more item nonresponse will be produced.\nFor the question about behaviour in hypothetical situations, item nonresponse was only affected by one significant variable on the respondent level: The greater the willingness to respond, the more meaningful responses were produced."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Discussion", "text": "The main aim of this article was to answer the question whether and if so, how child and interviewer characteristics and the interview setting affect item nonresponse in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children.\nFor this purpose, we used data from the Child Longitudinal Study conducted by the German Youth Institute, where children (ages 8-11) were interviewed using standardized interviews in three survey waves. To analyse item nonresponse, we selected questions that met two requirements: They had to cover substantial item nonresponse and should be compatible with theoretical guidelines. We computed multilevel logistic models with the software HLM 7.0 to better disentangle interviewer from respondent effects.\nIn Hypothesis 1 we tested whether item nonresponse in standardized, face-to-face interview with children would be reduced with increased cognitive functioning (measured by age and educational achievement). Our results support this hypothesis for the majority of the questions analysed. This is in line with other empirical evidence (Borgers et al. 1999; Borgers and Hox 2001; Vogl 2011) .\nIn Hypothesis 2, we tested whether interviewer characteristics would influence the impact of item nonresponse in standardized, face-to-face interviews with children in different ways. We found that interviewers in child interviews are not neutral collectors of data, but detected no systematic pattern for item nonresponse due to interviewer characteristics. A closer look at the values of the interviewer variance turns out to be somewhat disillusioning: Not a single value showed significance. This means that in all models the between-interviewer variance is acceptably mild, so it could have been ignored and we could have used simpler, single-level statistical models (Hox 2010) . However, for reasons of consistency we present hierarchical models. The nonsignificant variance could indicate that there might be other, more meaningful interviewer variables which have not been taken into account.\nConcerning Hypothesis 3, we found two cross-level interactions between child and interviewer characteristics. Depending on the different types of questions, it seems that the effect of child age on item nonresponse was moderated by interviewer age in one question; the effect of child gender on item nonresponse was moderated by interviewer gender in another question. Given few interaction effects, there is only little support for this hypothesis.\nOur fourth and last hypothesis tested whether third parties during the interview would influence the number of item nonresponses in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children. Contrary to our assumption that third parties would act as mediators and reduce item nonresponse, we found that the intervention of third parties increases item nonresponse in one of the questions. This is good news for surveys with children, because a third presence did not influence the question-answer process concerning item nonresponse for the majority of the questions analysed."}, {"section_title": "What Do These Results Mean for Surveys With Children?", "text": "Overall, the amount of item nonresponse in the child survey was considerably low.\nThe highest item-nonresponse rate was found for questions offering an explicit 'don't know' category, though not necessarily for sensitive questions. This might mean that children aged 8-11 by and large perform well in face-to-face surveys.\nRespondents' characteristics that correlate with item nonresponse are age and education. This may be an indication that interviewer training should focus more on how to deal with young and less-educated children.\nThe interviewers' rating of the child's ability to manage the interview points to concentration skills as an important factor. Item nonresponse increases with decreasing concentration skills, independent of age and education.\nTo improve the children's concentration, the survey researcher could vary the structure of the questionnaire by using a range of different question forms.\nIn the future, third parties will continue to be present during interviews with children. But this is good news for data quality, as their presence does not influence item nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "What Do These Results Mean for Survey Research on Item Nonresponse?", "text": "In order to explain and predict item nonresponse, it is important to completely understand what happens during the question-answer process. Although a number of approaches exist (Krosnick, 1991; Tourangeau et al. 2000) , we still lack a comprehensive theory explaining item nonresponse in surveys. Even Borgers and Hox (2001) conclude that they were not able to unequivocally confirm or reject Krosnick's satisficing theory. Furthermore, it is not clear whether these approaches can be adapted to child surveys (first attempts by Vogl 2011). This also applies to the Beatty-Hermann (2002) model of the response process. We regard it as more of a heuristic than a verifiable theory. Therefore the present study did not aim to test the model in a strict empirical sense, but uses it as a helpful framework to rearrange our dependent variables.\nThe analysis of secondary data material has considerable disadvantages. First, there were only a limited number of interviewer characteristics available. Second, because of the small proportion of item nonresponse in general, we were unable to separate 'don't know' responses from refusals. Against the background of empirical evidence (see Section 2), we assume differences in the influence of interviewer and respondent characteristics on item nonresponse, broken down by these two categories.\nMore elegant ways to shed light on the question-and-answer process in standardised, face-to-face interviews with children would be experimental designs (first attempts by Fuchs 2008) or collecting reasons for item nonresponse and viable interviewer characteristics from the outset (De Leeuw et al. 2003) .
