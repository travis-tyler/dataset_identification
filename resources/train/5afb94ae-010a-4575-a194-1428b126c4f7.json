Students who were only minimally nontraditional were much more likely to have earned a bachelor's degree (42 percent) than were moderately or highly nontraditional students (17 percent and 11 percent, respectively). With regard to timing of departure, nontraditional students were more than twice as likely to leave school in their first year than were traditional students (38 percent versus 16 percent). However, for students who persisted to their second year, nontraditional students' rates of attrition were much closer to the rates of traditional students. ii 6 Foreword This report examines the postsecondary education participation of undergraduates who do not typify what many have considered a \"traditional college student\"one who enrolls in college full time immediately after high school graduation. It begins by presenting recent enrollment trends for nontraditional students and then compares the persistence and attainment of these students with that of their traditional counterparts. The enrollment trend analysis relies on data from the three administrations of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), occurring in 1986(NPSAS), occurring in -87,1989(NPSAS), occurring in -90, and 1992. These periodic surveys, conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, represent all postsecondary students and collect detailed information about their receipt of financial aid, educational expenses, and family background and demographics. Nontraditional student enrollment trends are presented in two ways: first, according to each individual characteristic used to define a nontraditional student, and second, according to the degree to which undergraduates are nontraditional. That is, whether students are minimally, moderately, or highly nontraditional. The persistence and attainment analysis is based on data from the second followup of the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study, which was conducted in the spring of 1994. The base-year sample of this survey was derived from NPSAS:90, and thus represents students of all ages and backgrounds who first began their postsecondary education in 1989-90. Because the second BPS followup took place approximately 5 years after participants' first enrollment, it provides attainment rates for students completing associate's degrees and vocational certificates, as well as for those earning bachelor's degrees within 5 years. In addition, since the BPS survey is longitudinal, it provides information on both the timing and nature of departure from school for students who did not persist to attain a degree. The estimates presented in the report were produced using the NPSAS:87, NPSAS:90, NPSAS:93, and BPS:90/94 Data Analysis Systems (DAS). The DAS, a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables from the NPSAS and BPS data, produces the design-adjusted standard errors that are necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences shown in the tables.

In 1992-93, for instance, although slightly more than half of undergraduates (57 percent) had enrolled in postsecondary education immediately after high school graduation, only about one-third attended full time for the full 1992-93 academic year.' In a recent report profiling undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in 1992-93, undergraduates were characterized according to a number of attributes commonly associated with nontraditional students.2 These included nontraditional enrollment choices such as delaying enrollment or attending part time, and characteristics associated with financial constraints and family responsibilities such as being financially independent, having dependents to support, or working full time while enrolled. These characteristics, all of which have the potential to increase the risk of attrition, were referred to as risk factors in this study. The results indicated that a clear majority (three-fourths) of undergraduates were affected by at least one of the risk factors, and that students at risk were concentrated in the 2-year sector (primarily public community colleges). In contrast, students with no risk factors (i.e., traditional students) were almost exclusively enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities.3 According to the same study, slightly more than half of all undergraduates were enrolled part time at some point during the academic year (54 percent), and about the same percentage (52 percent) reported being financially independent (according to federal student financial aid regulations). About 43 percent of undergraduates had delayed their enrollment after high school, and about one-third worked full time at some time during their enrollment. Although being responsible for dependents was less common, fully one-fifth of undergraduates were parents.4 In a recent analysis, Berkner et al. examined the persistence and attainment of undergraduates 5 years after their first enrollment (in 1989-90).5 Using the same risk factors as those identified in the undergraduate profile,6 the analysis revealed that an increase in the number of risk factors was accompanied by a decline in persistence and attainment rates. This was true for undergraduates in both the 2-year and 4-year sectors. According to this study, students with no risk factors were almost twice as likely to have attained a degree or to still be enrolled at the 1L. Horn and M. Premo, Profile of Undergraduates in U.S. Postsecondary Education Institutions: 1992-93 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1995). Statistics in this report are based on data from the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). end of the 5-year period than were students with three or more risk factors. On the other hand, this analysis also found that the presence of risk factors had little influence on the persistence and attainment of students attending less-than-2-year vocational institutions. Certainly the changing economy has contributed to the increase in enrollment of students who enter postsecondary education later in life. The decline of the blue-collar manufacturing sector of the economy has displaced many workers, forcing them to choose between lower wage service-sector jobs or enrolling in postsecondary education to obtain the skills necessary for technical-or professional-level jobs.? In addition, the increased participation of women in the work force has increased the number of older women returning to complete an interrupted education or enrolling in postsecondary education for the first time.8 The family and work responsibilities of such individuals often conflict with the time and financial commitments required to attend school. In developing a conceptual model for nontraditional student attrition, Bean and Metzner emphasized the importance of alleviating external risk factors (nonschool responsibilities that conflict with attendance and progress) in helping nontraditional students realize their educational goals.9 As these researchers point out, regardless of nontraditional students' academic preparation, if they cannot make adequate child care arrangements, adjust their work schedules, or pay for college, they simply will not persist in school. The analysis presented here expands on the previous studies in two important ways. First, it examines recent enrollment trends for nontraditional students by comparing their prevalence in the three administrations of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:87,NPSAS:90,and NPSAS:93). Second, the analysis uses the Beginning Postsecondary Student (BPS) longitudinal survey to explore in greater depth than previous studies the persistence and attainment of nontraditional students 5 years after starting their postsecondary education. For example, these data identify when students dropped out and whether or not their degree goals changed over time. In addition, the impact of individual nontraditional student characteristics on persistence and attainment is explored using a weighted least squares regression model. Thus, the availability of data from the three NPSAS surveys combined with the BPS longitudinal component permitted a detailed examination of the participation of nontraditional students nationwide. : 1945-95, Economic Policy Institute (New York: M.E.

Most often age (especially being over the age of 24) has been the defining characteristic for this population.m Age acts as a surrogate variable that captures a large, heterogeneous population of adult students who often have family and work responsibilities as well as other life circumstances that can interfere with successful completion of educational objectives. Other variables typically used to characterize nontraditional students are associated with their background (race and gender),\" residence (i.e., not on campus), level of employment (especially working full time), and being enrolled in nondegree occupational programs.12 In this study, rather than focusing on age or other background characteristics, the criteria chosen to identify nontraditional students pertain to choices and behavior that may increase students' risk of attrition and as such, are amenable to change or intervention at various stages in a student's school life. With this intention, three sets of criteria were used to identify nontraditional students: 1) enrollment patterns, 2) financial and family status, and 3) high school graduation status. Enrollment patterns. Assuming that traditional enrollment in postsecondary education is defined as enrolling immediately after high school and attending full time, students who diverge from this pattern would be considered nontraditional. In this study, therefore, students who delayed enrollment in postsecondary education by a year or more after high school or who attended part time were considered nontraditional. Financial and family status. Family responsibilities and financial constraints used to identify nontraditional students included having dependents other than a spouse, being a single parent, working full time while enrolled, or being financially independent from parents. High school graduation status. Students who did not receive a standard high school diploma but who earned some type of certificate of completion were also considered nontraditional. This included GED recipients and those who received a high school certificate of completion. Students who did not graduate from high school or earn a certificate of completion 1\u00b0Bean and Metzner, \"A Conceptual Model.\" In their review of the literature, age was one of the most common independent variables in studies of attrition.

Because the enrollment trend analysis involved comparing enrollment estimates across three different surveys, a number of modifications to the variables were necessary in order to make them comparable. The persistence and attainment analysis, on the other hand, relied on data from one longitudinal survey, and therefore, the most accurate measurement possible was used to identify nontraditional students. Figure 1 summarizes the variables used for each analysis."}, {"section_title": "Trend Analysis", "text": "The analysis of nontraditional student enrollment trends was based on the NPSAS surveys that were conducted in the academic years 1986-87,1989-90, and 1992-93. These national surveys are cross-sectional and represent all students enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions, from less-than-2 year vocational institutions to research universities. The NPSAS:87 survey differed somewhat from the NPSAS:90 and NPSAS:93 surveys because it sampled students enrolled in the fall term only, while the NPSAS:90 and NPSAS:93 were conducted on full-year samples. To maintain comparability across data sets, the analysis was restricted to students who attended in the fal1.13 Table 1 shows the percentage distribution of fall undergraduates according to level and type of institution. Delayed Enrollment (older than typical age). In previous studies based solely on NPSAS:93 data, it was possible to create a delayed enrollment variable using dates of high school graduation and entry into postsecondary education. However, because of the large number of missing dates of graduation in the NPSAS:87 survey, this analysis uses a surrogate variable that captures delayed entry by identifying undergraduates who are older than typical for their particular year in school. Students who are 20 or older as freshmen, 21 or older as sophomores, 22 or older as juniors, and all students 23 or older were identified as older than typical and considered nontraditiona1.14 Obviously, this definition also includes some students who stopped out for a period of time, attended on a very part-time basis, or otherwise took longer to progress even if they did not delay their initial entry. Thus, students are more likely to be identified as nontraditional with this variable than they would be with a direct measurement of delayed enrollment. For example, among 1992-93 undergraduates, 43 percent were identified as having delayed enrollment, while 59 percent were older than typical. At the same time, 14 percent of 13About one-quarter of nontraditional students in the NPSAS:90 and NPSAS:93 surveys were excluded. This primarily affected students enrolled in private, for-profit institutions, about 40 percent of whom were not enrolled in the fall. However, only about 8 percent of undergraduates were enrolled in such institutions.

Attempting to reduce the proportion of older-than-typical students by increasing the age requirement only increased the proportion of missed delayed entrants, especially among 20-to 23-year-olds,15 an age group that has been shown to differ considerably from traditional students.16"}, {"section_title": "Level of institution", "text": "151992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) Data Analysis System. 16Hurtado et al., in a comparison of traditional students (age 19 or younger when first enrolled), 20-to 24-year-old students who delayed enrollment, and older students (25 or older), demonstrated that students aged 20-24 who delayed enrollment were very different from traditional students with regard to many factors, including student background characteristics, self-reports of ability, sources of financial support, and institutional characteristics. Thus, the authors concluded that the 20-24 age group who had delayed entry should not be considered traditional for policy purposes. See S. Hurtado, K. Kurotsuchi, and S. Sharp, \"Traditional, Delayed Entry, and Nontraditional Students\" (paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, 1996). Part-Time Enrollment. Students who attended school part time when they enrolled in the fall of the survey year (i.e., 1986, 1989, and 1992) were considered nontraditional. Again, in previous studies based only on NPSAS:93 data, a full-year definition of part-time enrollment was used. That is, anyone who was not enrolled full time for a full academic year was considered part time. Because NPSAS:87 is based only on a fall sample, the full-year definition could not be applied. As a point of comparison, the full-year definition of part-time status resulted in about 54 percent of 1992-93 undergraduates being identified as part time, while the definition used in this study resulted in about 42 percent being so identified.17 Financial Independence. Whether or not a student is considered financially independent of his or her parents is determined when assessing the student's need for financial aid. Parents of dependent students are expected to pay for a portion of their child's education, while parents of independent students are not obliged to do so (though many parents do provide assistance). Therefore, independent students often carry a greater financial burden than dependent students, and as such are considered nontraditional. It is important to note that the definition of independence changed between 1986 and 1989. In 1989, all students 24 or older were considered independent, which substantially increased the proportion of independent students due only to the change definition. For comparability in this analysis, the latter definition was applied to the 1986 undergraduates. Full-Time Employment While Enrolled (in October). The most comparable employment variable across the three surveys was one that determined employment status in the month of October.\" Therefore, if a student indicated working 35 or more hours per week during October, the student was considered nontraditional. Dependents. Undergraduates who reported having dependents other than a spouse were also designated as nontraditional. In addition to children, dependents may include elder parents, siblings, or other members of the family for whom the student is financially responsible. Single Parents. If a student was not married but reported having dependents other than a spouse, that student was identified as a single parent and nontraditional. Although an unmarried person with dependents other than children (such as older parents) is not technically a singlt parent, the finanCial burden and time constraints could be similar. GED Recipient or Certificate of Completion. A student who did not receive a standard high school diploma, but reported completing high school either through passing a General Education Development (GED) exam or other equivalency exam, or receiving a certificate of high school completion was considered nontraditional. 171992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) Data Analysis System. 18Since October is typically the second month of enrollment, it was assumed that working full time during this month represented a dominant pattern of work throughout a student's enrollment for that year.\n\nBefore degree attainment or last enrollment student left school and had not re-enrolled in postsecondary education as of spring 1994."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Attainment Analysis", "text": "The analysis of persistence and attainment was based on data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) survey, the longitudinal component of the NPSAS:90 survey consisting of all students who first began their postsecondary education in 1989-90. The second followup of BPS was conducted in 1994, approximately 5 years after students first enrolled. Thus, attainment rates are available for students who received associate's degrees and vocational certificates as well as for those who completed bachelor's degrees within 5 years. Four differences in the definition of nontraditional status for the analysis of persistence and attainment compared to the enrollment analysis using NPSAS data should be noted (see appendix A for explanations): 1) an actual delayed entry variable was constructed (rather than using older-than-typical proxy); 2) the employment variable identifies students who worked full time at any time during their 1989-90 enrollment; 3) students were defined as financially independent according to federal income tax criteria (i.e., they were not claimed on their parents' 1988 federal income tax return); and 4) only children were considered dependents of undergraduates."}, {"section_title": "Nontraditional Scale", "text": "Clearly, many of the characteristics used to identify nontraditional undergraduates are strongly interrelated. For example, students may delay enrolling in postsecondary education or attend part time because of family and work responsibilities. In 1992-93, about 80 percent of students working full time while enrolled attended part time.\"' Similarly, in the same year, nearly two-thirds of undergraduates with dependents had delayed their enrollment. In addition, for certain nontraditional characteristics, a student necessarily has more than one. For example, a single parent is by definition, responsible for dependents and is almost always independent, resulting in a minimum of three characteristics. Thus, undergraduates with any nontraditional characteristics usually have more than one. In this study, therefore, the changing trends of undergraduates with multiple characteristics are presented and discussed. In order to examine this phenomenon, a scale was constructed that represents a simple sum of all nontraditional characteristics (from 0 to 7), with zero representing traditional students. The degree to which students were considered nontraditional is described below: Minimally Nontraditional. Students with only one nontraditional characteristic were considered \"minimally nontraditional.\" In general, these students were most often either older than typical or enrolled part time in postsecondary education (table 2).20 Minimally nontraditional undergraduates accounted for about 14 to 15 percent of students in each of the three NPSAS samples. Moderately Nontraditional. Students with two or three nontraditional characteristics were considered moderately nontraditional. These students, who made up 25 to 31 percent of undergraduates in the three NPSAS surveys, tended to be older than typical, independent, and to attend part time. Highly Nontraditional. Having four or more nontraditional characteristics distinguished students identified as highly nontraditional. In addition to those characteristics associated with moderately nontraditional students, about two-thirds of highly nontraditional students either had dependents or worked full time, and about one-quarter were single parents. Highly nontraditional students accounted for about one in four undergraduates in the three NPSAS surveys. Overall, students who are identified as nontraditional according to these criteria are more likely to be women, to belong to a racialethnic minority group, and to have less educated parents than traditional students (figure 2). However, as previously noted, rather than focusing on background characteristics, the criteria chosen to identify nontraditional students in this study are ones that are subject to intervention or change at various stages of a student's academic life. For example, high school students who are prepared to enter postsecondary education but who are uncertain about whether they should attend immediately or delay their enrollment, could be encouraged to do the former. Alternatively, adults who make the commitment to return to school or enroll for the first time later in life could be offered assistance in a number of ways to help them persist and attain their educational goals. Such assistance might be flexible class scheduling, child care arrangements, part-time job placement, and so on. Finally, with regard to outcome measures it should be noted that the intention of this study is not to imply that degree attainment is the only way that students can profit from postsecondary education. While the labor market benefits of those who earn a bachelor's degree relative to those who attend college but do not attain a degree have long been known,21 it is possible that nontraditional students who do not attain a degree benefit in other ways not measured in this study. For example, nontraditional students may enroll in an associate's degree program with the intention of taking specific courses toward enhancing an established career, rather than to earn a degree. In doing so, their combined work experience and postsecondary course taking may improve their marketability in ways not yet possible for their traditional counterparts who have not begun a career. "}, {"section_title": "Trends in Nontraditional Student Enrollment", "text": "Nontraditional students, as broadly defined by this study, accounted for a substantial proportion of the undergraduate population in all three surveys (figure 3). A clear majority of undergraduates were at least minimally nontraditional, and about half were either moderately or highly nontraditional. The trend over the 6-year period indicates that the enrollment of nontraditional students overall increased between 1986 and 1989, and then leveled off in 1992. While the overall proportion of nontraditional students did not change between 1989 and 1992, the composition relative to the number of nontraditional characteristics did. That is, the proportion who were moderately nontraditional increased from 28 to 31 percent, while the proportion who were highly nontraditional declined from 26 to 23 percent. If one looks at enrollment according to level of institution, the changes can primarily be attributed to the trends of enrollment in 2-year institutions where the highest proportion of nontraditional students are enrolled. Changes in enrollment relative to institution type can provide some indication of whether institutions are successfully reaching out to less traditional students in order to maintain or increase their enrollment. This appears to be true for private, not-for-profit 4-year colleges (table  3). Between 1986 and 1992, for example, the proportion of moderately nontraditional students who were enrolled in private, not-for-profit 4-year colleges (both nondoctoral and doctoral) increased. At the same time, the proportion of highly nontraditional students enrolled in these institutions remained stable. Public 2-year institutions, on the other hand, experienced no meaningful change in the proportion of moderately nontraditional students between 1986 and 1989 (31 and 33 percent), but their enrollment increased from 33 to 39 percent between 1989 and 1992. At the same time, unlike the private, not-for-profit 4-year nondoctoral colleges, the proportion of highly nontraditional students who were enrolled in these institutions actually declined from 42 to 35 percent. While it appears as though there are large fluctuations in nontraditional student enrollment in other institutions such as public less-than-2-year and private, not-for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions, it is important to remember that only about 1 to 2 percent of undergraduates are enrolled in these institutions (see table 1) and therefore, there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that actual changes occurred. Trends in nontraditional enrollment are also apparent when examined according to the average number of nontraditional characteristics among the undergraduate population (figure 4). Among students in public 2-year institutions, for example, the average number of nontraditional characteristics peaked in 1989 and declined in 1992 (from 2.7 to 2.9 to 2.7). Among students in private, not-for-profit 4-year nondoctoral institutions, on the other hand, the average number of nontraditional characteristics for the 3 years was 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6, respectively, demonstrating a gradual increase over time.

Given the propensity of nontraditional students to attend part time, one might expect them to take longer to attain a degree than their traditional counterparts. If this were the case, a greater proportion of nontraditional students would be enrolled in 1994 compared with traditional students. But no such difference was found.

In contrast, traditional students left school at similar rates regardless of their degree objective (19 percent seeking a bachelor's degree, and 22 percent with an associate's degree objective). It is possible that this reflects the tendency of nontraditional students to enroll in associate's degree programs for purposes of obtaining occupational skills through coursework, rather than specifically to earn a degree. Among students whose educational goal was a vocational certificate, having nontraditional characteristics was not associated with overall persistence and attainment. For example, 54 percent of nontraditional students had attained a certificate, as had 61 percent of traditional students, a difference that is not statistically significant.

In this analysis, students' first departure from their initial enrollment path (i.e., their \"persistence track\") was identified.25 A departure from the persistence track was defined as an interruption in enrollment in one of three ways: a downward transfer (e.g., from a 4-year to a 2-year institution or from a 2-year to less-than-2-year institution); stopping out for more than 4 months and then returning to the same or higher level institution; or leaving without returning by 1994. The first column in table 14 shows the percentage of students who never departed from their initial persistence track. These students had either attained a degree or were still enrolled approximately 5 years after their initial enrollment.26 For students who did depart from their persistence track, columns 2-5 show the year of their first departure. 25The concept of \"persistence track\" was first developed by C. Dennis Carroll in a study of how traditional students persist to their bachelor's degree. See C. D. Carroll, College Persistence and Degree Attainment for 1980 High School Graduates: Hazards for Transfers, Stopouts, and Part-timers (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1989). 26 In most cases the degree attained is the initial degree objective. However, in the remote case of a student changing degree objectives with no enrollment interruption and attaining a degree from the same level of institution (such as a bachelor's degree seeker earning an associate's degree at a 4-year college), then it is possible that the degree attained was different from the initial objective. 'Had either attained a degree or were still enrolled in 1994 and had never had an enrollment interruption. 2An interruption is defined as leaving without returning, a downward transfer (e.g., 4-year to 2-year institution withor without an interruption), or a period of interruption of more than 4 months (stopout) and then returning to the same level or higher institution. It is possible for some students who had an interruption to have returned and either attained or still be enrolled. The percentages represent annual rates (i.e. base includes only students still enrolled at the beginning of the year). 'Nontraditional status refers to the presence of one or more nontraditional characteristics including delayed enrollment, part-time attendance, being independent, working full time while enrolled, having children, being a single parent, or being a recipient of a GED or high school completion certificate. 'It is possible that the degree attained was not the initial objective. For example if a student initially had a BA objective but earned an AA and had no enrollment interruption (defined in footnote 2), that student would appear in column 1 under bachelor's degree objective. It is clear from this table that nontraditional students are most at risk to depart from their persistence track in their first year. In fact, nontraditional students were just as likely to depart in their first year as they were to persist or attain a degree over the five year period (36 percent and 38 percent, respectively). In contrast, traditional students were far more likely to remain on their persistence track than they were to depart in their first year (57 percent and 16 percent, respectively). While nontraditional students were more than twice as likely as traditional students to depart from their persistence track in their first year (16 percent versus 38 percent), the gap in attrition between the two groups closed considerably once they reached their second year (figure 7). Taking degree objective into account, the attrition of nontraditional students seeking a bachelor's degree was higher than their traditional counterparts until the fourth year, but the gap continued to close over time. Among certificate seekers (most of whom are in programs lasting no longer than one year), there was no difference in attrition between traditional and nontraditional students after the first year. For associate degree seekers, on the other hand, the gap in attrition rates between traditional and nontraditional students did not close after the second year. The persistence and timing of students' departure relative to their initial degree objective is shown as a distribution in figure 8. Viewed from this perspective, it is very obvious that nontraditional students whose initial degree objective was an associate's degree were about twice as likely to depart in their first year as they were to stay on their persistence track (46 percent compared with 23 percent). The opposite was true for nontraditional students seeking a bachelor's degree: 27 percent left in their first year, while 42 percent persisted. It should be noted however, that nontraditional students seeking an associate's degree were far more likely to be highly nontraditional and less likely to be minimally nontraditional when compared to their counterparts pursuing a bachelor's degree.27"}, {"section_title": "How Do They Leave?", "text": "If students leave their persistence track, it is instructive to determine how traditional students' methods of departure differ from those of nontraditional students. As noted above, types of departure included any downward transfer (e.g., from a 4-year to a 2-year institution); stopping out for more than 4 months but then returning to the same or higher level institution; or leaving without returning by 1994. Given nontraditional students' family and work responsibilities, one might expect them to stop out more frequently than their traditional peers. But this did not appear to be the case, at least within 5 years of students' initial enrollment (table   15).

For example, students who attended part time in their first year of enrollment had an average of 3.3 nontraditional characteristics. In order to measure the influence of a single variable on persistence and attainment, one must control for the effects of related variables. In this analysis, a weighted least squares regression model was used to measure how each nontraditional characteristic affected persistence and attainment. In the model, the dependent variable is defined as the proportion of undergraduates who had attained any degree (regardless of objective) or who were still enrolled at the time of the 1994 follow-up survey. The independent variables included the seven nontraditional characteristics and the following background and institutional variables: gender, raceethnicity, socioeconomic status, institution control (public; private, not-for-profit; and private, for-profit), and institutional level (less-than-2-year, 2-year, and 4-year). The regression coefficients were subsequently used to adjust the original estimates of persistence and attainment, taking into account the joint effects of all the independent variables (see appendix B for methodology details). The results are displayed in Table 16. The original (unadjusted) estimates of the proportion of students who had attained or persisted as of 1994 are in the first column, and the adjusted percentages after controlling for the variation of all other variables are in the second. Asterisks in the these columns identify cases in which the percentage of students in a given category who had attained or persisted is significantly different from the percentage of the reference group (always the last category for each characteristic). For example, part-time enrollment (unadjusted) was associated with lower rates of persistence and attainment compared with full-time enrollment (49 percent compared with 72 percent). This pattern held even after controlling for all other characteristics in the model (58 percent compared with 67 percent, adjusted). The initial negative associations with persistence and attainment found for several other nontraditional characteristics also remained after controlling for the variation of other variables. These included delaying enrollment, being financially independent, and having a GED or high school certificate of completion. The initial negative impact on persistence and attainment of the remaining three nontraditional characteristicsworking full time in a student's first year of enrollment, having children, or being a single parentis no longer directly apparent once all other variables are held constant. However, these three characteristics may be indirectly related to persistence and attainment by virtue of the fact that students who work full time, have children, or are single parents are far more likely to attend part time or delay their enrollment than their counterparts (see table 11). The enrollment options of attending part time and delaying enrollment, in turn, have a significant negative effect on persistence and attainment.28 28A way to test for these indirect effects is to determine whether each of the three characteristics in question significantly affect the likelihood of part-time enrollment or delayed enrollment using regression models where these outcomes are the dependent variables. The results of these models indicated that both working full time and having children had significant effects on part-time and delayed enrollment, but this was not true for single parents. It is possible that the motivation and commiiment required for single parents just to enroll in postsecondary education helps to mitigate the potential barriers they face in progressing toward and attaining their educational goals.  "}, {"section_title": "54", "text": "The model also reveals some interesting findings related to student background characteristics. For example, even though the adjusted percentages changed little, women were significantly more likely than men to persist or attain only after controlling for the other variables in the model. This may be related to the fact that women are more likely to be independent,29 and once this covariation was controlled for, women fared slightly better than men. A similar explanation is possible for the change in significance for the persistence and attainment of Asian/Pacific Islander students as compared with their white counterparts. Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely than white, non-Hispanic students to be in the lowest socioeconomic status quartile (and low SES students are less likely to persist than those at higher SES levels).30 However, once SES was controlled for, Asian/Pacific Islanders' persistence and attainment rates were significantly higher than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts. Not surprisingly, given the higher attrition rates of students with associate's degree objectives relative to those with bachelor's degree objectives, students attending 2-year institutions were less likely to persist or attain than those in 4-year institutions, even after controlling for all other variables. Once other variables were held constant, however, students attending less-than-2-year institutions had similar rates of persistence and attainment as those in 4-year institutions. This may be related to the fact that students in less-than-2-year institutions are much more likely to be from low SES backgrounds than those in 4-year institutions,31 and once SES was controlled for, the persistence and attainment rates no longer differed among students in the two types of institutions. The reduction in the adjusted persistence and attainment rates for students in private, not-for-profit institutions may have been similarly affected in the opposite way. That is, private, not-for-profit institutions have a higher proportion of high SES students than do public institutions,32 and once SES was controlled for,the persistence and attainment of students in these institutions declined. Finally, after controlling for the variation of all other variables included in the model, the adjusted persistence and attainment rates for high and low SES students were no longer significantly different from middle SES students. Thus, it appears that SES per se is not directly influencing persistence and attainment; rather, it seems to be related to a number of other characteristics (such as delayed enrollment, part-time attendance, independence, and so on), which in turn negatively affect persistence and attainment. 29About 29 percent of women were independent students, compared with 22 percent of men. See Berkner et al., Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students. 30About 22 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students, compared with 12 percent of white students are in the lowest SES quartile. See Berkner et al., Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students. 310ne-third of students attending less-than-2-year institutions were low SES, compared with 7 percent of students in 4-year institutions (BPS:90/94 Data Analysis Systein). 3258 percent of students in private, not-for-profit institutions were high SES, compared with 39 percent in public institutions (BPS:90/94 Data Analysis System)."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The term \"nontraditional\" as applied to students who do not follow an educational path historically perceived as traditionalenrolling full time in college immediately after graduating from high schoolhas become a misnomer. A clear majority of undergraduates diverge in some manner from this path whether they begin their postsecondary education later in life, interrupt their education and return, or just take longer to progress due to reduced enrollment intensity. This analysis attempted to characterize the degree to which undergraduates were nontraditional based on the presence of seven possible nontraditional characteristics. These characteristics included delaying enrollment into postsecondary education, attending part time, being independent from parents, having dependents, working full time while enrolled, being a single parent, or having a GED or high school equivalent certificate. The enrollment trends over the 6-year period from 1986 to 1992 indicated that the prevalence of moderately nontraditional students (those with two or three nontraditional characteristics) increased over the time period from one in four undergraduates in 1986 to almost one in three in 1992. The proportion of highly nontraditional students (those with four or more characteristics), on the other hand, declined from 26 percent to 23 percent. The results of this study also revealed differences in the enrollment trends of nontraditional undergraduates according to type of institution. Even though moderately and highly nontraditional students were most numerous in public 2-year institutions, there was discernible growth in the nontraditional student population enrolled in 4-year colleges, especially in private, not-for-profit, nondoctoral institutions. These findings suggest that private 4-year colleges, which have historically attracted traditional students, may be reaching out to a less traditional population to maintain their enrollment levels. Consistent with the findings of earlier research, this study found that nontraditional students, even those who are minimally nontraditional, do not persist in postsecondary education as well as traditional students. For example, one in three minimally nontraditional students left school without a credential, compared with one in five traditional students. An important consideration when designing and implementing programs to reduce attrition among nontraditional students is to determine when these students leave postsecondary education. Nontraditional students are highly likely to leave in their first year of postsecondary education. However, evidence from this study suggests that the gap in attrition between nontraditional and traditional students closes considerably from the second year on. Thus, it seems crucial that programs aimed at reducing nontraditional attrition rates be implemented from the very start of a student's enrollment in postsecondary education.

If so, that student would be coded as having changed objectives for the bachelor's degree variable and also classified according to his or her status toward an associate's degree. For students who ever specified a degree, but had not attained it by 1994, they were coded in one of three ways: enrolled toward the degree in 1994, not enrolled toward the degree in 1994 and never changed degree objective, or changed degree objective.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations.

Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data. 35 The CATI system was begun in 1989-90, NPSAS:87 was a mailed questionnaire."}, {"section_title": "7 0 Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the NPSAS:87, NPSAS:90, NPSAS:93 Undergraduate Data Analysis Systems (DAS), and the BPS:90/94 DAS. The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the NPSAS data. With the DAS, users can re-create or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors36 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, tables B1 and B2 present the standard errors that corresponds to table 2 and table 12, respectively in the text. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce an estimate, the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFT) for all the variables identified in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the NPSAS stratified sampling method.

Each procedure is described below."}, {"section_title": "Differences Between Means", "text": "The descriptive comparisons were tested in this report using Student's t statistic. Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the 36The NPSAS and BPS samples are not simple random samples and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method. 56 71 differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: E, -E2 t = 1.1 sel2 + see 1where E, and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se, and see are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates were not independent (for example, when comparing the percentages across a percentage distribution), a covariance term was added to the denominator of the t-test formula. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p < .05.37 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p 5..05/10, or p .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: 37The standard that p.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56: 52-64. k_J(J-1) where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested.

For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended, within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables. Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as gender, raceethnicity, SES, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, age and gender, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as completing a degree). The variables age and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing age and a dummy variable representing gender:  "}]
