In this study, we compared \u03b4 15 N values from diff erent herbaceous wetland plants across 34 diff erent coastal wetlands from the fi ve main Hawaiian Islands and investigated relationships of \u03b4 15 N with land use, human population density, and surface water quality parameters (i.e., nitrate, ammonium, and total dissolved N). Th e highest \u03b4 15 N values were observed in plants from wetlands on the islands of Oahu (8.7-14.6\u2030) and Maui (8.9-9.2\u2030), whereas plants from wetlands on the islands of Kauai, Hawaii, and Molokai had \u03b4 15 N values usually <4\u2030. Th e enrichment in \u03b4 15 N values in plant tissues from wetlands on Oahu and Maui was most likely a result of the more developed and densely populated watersheds on these two islands. Urban development within a 1000-m radius and population density were positively correlated to average \u03b4 15 N vegetation values from each wetland site (r = 0.56 and 0.51, respectively; p < 0.001). Th is suggested that site mean \u03b4 15 N values from mixed stands of wetland plants have potential as indices of N sources in coastal lowland wetlands in Hawaii and that certain sites on Oahu and Maui have experienced signifi cant anthropogenic N loading. Th is information can be used to monitor future changes in N inputs to coastal wetlands throughout Hawaii and the Pacifi c. Nitrogen Source Tracking with \u03b4 15 N Content of Coastal Wetland Plants in Hawaii Gregory L. Bruland* University of Hawaii-Manoa Richard A. MacKenzie USDA Forest Service N aturally occurring stable N isotopes have been successfully used to identify sources of N in coastal ecosystems, especially when sources have distinct \u03b4 15 N values (McClelland et al., 1997;McClelland and Valiela, 1998;Cole et al., 2004). Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) inputs to watersheds such as precipitation (\u03b4 15 N of \u22127\u2030 to +1\u2030), biologically fi xed N (\u03b4 15 N \u223c 0\u2030), and commercial inorganic fertilizers (\u03b4 15 N of \u22123\u2030 to +3\u2030) have lighter \u03b4 15 N values compared with human waste water and livestock waste (+4 to +6\u2030) (Macko and Ostrom, 1994;McClelland et al., 1997;McClelland and Valiela, 1998;Kj\u00f8nas and Wright 2007;Barnes et al., 2008). As these diff erent DIN pools move through watersheds, their \u03b4 15 N values can become enriched through disproportionate loss of the lighter 14 N isotopes via ammonia volatilization or denitrifi cation (Cifuentes et al., 1989;Macko and Ostrom, 1994). Although this can result in similar \u03b4 15 N values among pools (e.g., fertilizer-derived vs. rain-derived DIN), these processes can also signifi cantly enrich the \u03b4 15 N values of residual N derived from sewage and livestock waste such that their \u03b4 15 N values (+10 to +38\u2030) are distinct from other DIN sources (Macko and Ostrom, 1994;Savage, 2005). As N contributions to vegetation from sewage increase, the \u03b4 15 N values of plants can become more enriched. In contrast, as N contributions to vegetation from inorganic fertilizers or precipitation increase, the \u03b4 15 N values of plants can become less enriched (Wigand et al., 2007). In the northeastern USA, \u03b4 15 N values of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alternifl ora Loisel), a common salt marsh species, have been shown to be eff ective indicators of watershed N sources in coastal areas (Mc-Clelland et al., 1997;McClelland and Valiela, 1998;Wigand et al., 2001;Wigand et al., 2007). Other salt marsh species, such as Jesuit's bark (Iva frutescens (L.)), common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.)), and saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl) have also been used as indicators of N sources (Wigand et al., 2007). Other researchers have investigated \u03b4 15 N values of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) and cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.) tissue to investigate patterns of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication in subtropical Everglades wetlands (Inglett and Reddy, 2006;Chang et al., 2008). Th us, the \u03b4 15 N values of wetland plants can help coastal zone managers monitor changes in inputs of N (McClelland and Valiela, 1998). Unfortunately, only two of the plant species listed above (sawgrass and cattail) are found in coastal wetlands of Hawaii, and they are only minor components in terms of cover and biomass in most Hawaiian and Pacifi c Island wetlands. Plant community structure in Hawaii also diff ers considerably among wetlands, which is largely a result of the isolated nature of Hawaii's wetlands and the introduction of exotic plants (Bantilan- Smith et al., 2009). As a result, intersite comparisons of the same plant species can be diffi cult if not impossible because one species does not occur across all coastal wetland sites. Th us, the use of wetland plant tissue \u03b4 15 N as an indicator of N sources needs to continue to be tested in estuaries with diff erent land uses and in diff erent climatic conditions (Mc-Clelland and Valiela, 1998). Furthermore, most studies have compared \u03b4 15 N values of individual plant species across diff erent sites. Few studies have examined the utility of \u03b4 15 N values of multiple species to track sources of N, and none has been conducted on Pacifi c Islands, where increasing human population densities and development threaten coastal ecosystems (Laws and Ferentinos, 2003). We attempted to determine if the \u03b4 15 N values of mixed plant communities could function as indicators of N sources when compared across diff erent wetlands on the fi ve main Hawaiian Islands. Th e specifi c objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate differences in coastal wetland plant \u03b4 15 N values across wetland sites located in watersheds of diff erent land-use/land-cover and (ii) to investigate relationships between \u03b4 15 N values of coastal wetland plants and land use, demographic data (i.e., population density), and surface water quality parameters (i.e., nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved N). Results from this study will facilitate comparisons of \u03b4 15 N values between coastal wetlands in more-developed versus less-developed watersheds in Hawaii and provide baseline monitoring of N stable isotope values in coastal wetland plants. Th ese values can serve as points of comparison for future studies and allow for the quantifi cation of changes in N sources in these watersheds over time (McClelland et al., 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": "Th irty-four coastal lowland wetland sites across the state of Hawaii were sampled between March and April 2007 ( Fig. 1).

Th e elevation criterion effectively excluded all mountain bogs, which comprise a signifi cant component of Hawaii's wetland area but are considerably diff erent in structure and function than coastal lowland wetlands. Because various coastal wetland sites are located on private property or on military land with restricted access, a random sampling of all coastal wetlands was impossible. Efforts were made to achieve balance between isolated and riparian/estuarine sites and among fresh water, brackish, and euhaline sites. In sampling 34 wetlands, we are confi dent that our sites represented the overall population of coastal wetlands in Hawaii.

At sites where less than three plant species were present, we collected as many species as possible. For grasses, the external-most blade was collected by clipping the blade off close to the root. For monocots and dicots, leaf samples furthest from the apical meristem were clipped from the stem at the leaf petiole. For sedges, culms were sampled.

Watershed land use data were obtained from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). Th e C-CAP analyses used Landsat 7 Enhanced Th ematic Mapper imagery from 2000 to 2001 to map the distribution of land cover types across the state of Hawaii. To minimize cloud cover, multiple image dates and scenes were used to map each island. A band ratio technique was used to mask clouds and cloud shadow areas from the imagery, and cloud-free pieces of overlapping images were then reinserted into the imagery to produce a mosaic with minimal cloud cover. Th e islands were broken into classes of major land cover features such as developed, cultivated land, grass/scrubland, forest, wetland, bare land, shoreline, and open water. Th e low-and high-intensity developed categories were combined into a single developed land-use category, and the grassland and scrubland categories were combined into a single grass and scrub category. A shapefi le of watershed boundaries for each of the fi ve islands was obtained from the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program (available at http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/gis/; verifi ed 1 May 2009). Most watershed boundaries were created automatically from smoothed 1:24,000 scale digital elevation models from the USGS. Watersheds that could not be automatically delineated in the GIS were manually digitized on-screen or from paper 1:24,000 scale topographic quadrangle maps. Percent cover was determined for an area radiating 1000 m out from each of the 34 wetland sites in Arc-GIS 9.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2006). Areal extent of the diff erent land use types within a 1000-m radius area around each wetland was determined from GIS as described above (Table 2). Th e 1000-m radius was selected because it proved to be a better predictor of \u03b4 15 N values according to linear regression than the land use in the contributing watershed, which was also tested. Th e land uses in the local radius may have performed better than contributing watershed because the radius approach used a similar spatial scale for all sites, whereas the contributing watersheds varied greatly in size and in spatial distribution of land uses. Other studies have shown that land use within a localized radius of a wetland site is a better predictor of environmental characteristics such as water quality than watershed level land use (Houlahan and Findlay, 2004). Land uses included development, agriculture, grass/scrub, forest, wetland, bare land, and open water.

Because N isotopic ratios have been used to esti-mate the extent to which anthropogenic N inputs have been incorporated into the biota at specifi c sites in North America (Pruell et al., 2006), this technique also appears to be valid for Hawaii especially given the wide range in \u03b4 15 N values across the 34 sites (1.1-14.7\u2030). Th e extremely high mean salinity value (138.26\u2030) at the Pouhala site on Oahu was most likely due to high evaporation rates and poor hydrologic fl ushing, which leads to a build-up of ions in the water column. Th e high mean NO 3 -N values observed for sites on Maui most likely relate to the agricultural (sugar and pineapple operations) land-use activities in these watersheds upslope of the wetlands. Th e high NH 4 -N value observed at the Kauaihau Riparian site was probably related to N inputs from cattle that were actively grazing this site at the time of sampling. Total dissolved N values were high for sites on Oahu, Molokai, and Maui, suggesting that organic N rather than inorganic N may be the dominant form of N in surface waters of these sites."}, {"section_title": "Plant Tissue \u03b4 15 N among Species and Sites", "text": "Th e 70 composite plant tissue samples comprised 21 diff erent plant species, four of which were native and 17 of which were introduced (Table 4).

Th e other two native species, Java sedge (Cyperus javanicus Houtt.) and sea purslane (Sesuvium porulacastrum (L.) L.), were codominant at six and two sites, respectively.

All other species were sampled at three or fewer sites. Site mean \u03b4 15 N values ranged from 1.1 to 14.7\u2030 (Table 2). Lower values (1.1-4.9\u2030) were typically found in wetlands on the islands of Kauai, Hawaii, and Molokai, and higher values (8.7-14.7\u2030) were found in wetlands on Oahu and Maui ( Table 2).\nTh e higher \u03b4 15 N values from Klipper Pond and Waiawa were attributed to inputs of sewage because the \u03b4 15 N values in the plant tissue at these two sites were similar to \u03b4 15 N observed in waste water (10.1\u2030; Derse et al., 2007) and because both sites are located in densely populated urban areas and are near sewage treatment plants. Four other wetlands on Oahu and three wetlands on Maui had high plant \u03b4 15 N values (>8\u2030), suggesting N enrichment from sewage. Th e fi ve Oahu wetlands with the highest \u03b4 15 N values (Klipper Pond, Waiawa, Hamakua, Pouhala, and Kawainui) were located in urban watersheds that supported populations of >10 people ha \u22121 , were >50% developed within a 1000-m radius of the sites, or both (Table 2).  Th e Maui wetlands sampled were generally located in watersheds with lower levels of development within a 1000-m radius (0.1-4.9%) and lower population densities (0.08-3.2 people ha \u22121 ) compared with Oahu. However, large areas of land within a 1000-m radius of the Pakukalo and Waihee (23.8%), Kealia (38.1%), and Kanaha (43.5%) sites were classifi ed as agricultural. Furthermore, treated sewage water is disposed of in various areas of Maui by injecting it into saltwater underlying the fresh ground water lens. In other watersheds on the western coast of Maui, nutrient inputs from agriculture and sewage injection wells have been linked to nuisance algal blooms that occur in nearshore waters (Soicher and Peterson, 1997). Th e high \u03b4 15 N values of macroalgae responsible for these blooms (7-8\u2030) support the idea that injection wells are the cause of these nearshore blooms (Smith et al., 2005). Th e macroalgal \u03b4 15 N values in the Smith et al. (2005) study were similar to the \u03b4 15 N values we observed in the wetland plant tissues of Maui wetlands. Th us, it is likely that the elevated \u03b4 15 N values from Pakukalo and Kealia were a result of sewage injection wells. Another study of coastal waters in South Florida found high tissue \u03b4 15 N values (+10 to +12\u2030) of fl eshy macroalgae (Codium isthmodcladum) that the authors concluded were a direct result of nutrients from leaky septic tanks, sewage outfalls, and injection wells (Lapointe and Clark, 1992). Th e high \u03b4 15 N values reported from the other Maui wetland, Nuu, were likely due to a cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) rookery that is located at the periphery of the wetland. Each year, more than 200 egrets roost in this wetland (S. Fisher, Maui Coastal Land Trust, personal communication) and likely contribute a signifi cant amount of N to this wetland. Alternative explanations for the high \u03b4 15 N values from the Oahu and Maui wetlands could be processes occurring within the wetlands that result in enriched \u03b4 15 N values of DIN pools. Th ese processes include nitrifi cation, ammonia volatilization, denitrifi cation, and plant or algal uptake. All of these processes use the lighter 14 N isotope at a faster rate than the 15 N isotope, leaving the remaining DIN pool and the plants or algae that use them isotopically enriched with 15 N (Cifuentes et al., 1989;Anderson and Fourqurean, 2003;Fry et al., 2003). Previous research has shown that the fractionation factors involved in various transformations of N vary among ecosystems and specifi c organisms (Fry et al., 2003;Lamb and Swart, 2008). Th us, normal ecosystem processes, such as nitrifi cation and denitrification, which occur regularly in coastal wetlands, can result in \u03b4 15 N values that are misinterpreted as evidence of anthropogenic infl uence (Lamb and Swart, 2008). Th erefore, further research is needed to determine the relative contributions of atmospheric inputs, diff usion from sediments, agriculture, sewage, egret rookeries, nitrifi cation, denitrifi cation, and assimilation to the \u03b4 15 N values of plant tissues in these coastal Hawaiian wetlands. Most of the 21 wetlands with the lowest \u03b4 15 N values (1.1-4.9\u2030) were on the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, and Molokai. Th e land within a 1000-m radius of the wetlands on these islands is less developed (<10%) and supports smaller human populations (<3 people ha \u22121 ) compared with Oahu or Maui. Two of these 21 sites were located on Oahu. Th e fi rst site, Waimea, had <1% developed land use within 1000-m of the site and a population of <1 people ha \u22121 . Th e second site, Percolation Ditch, also had low \u03b4 15 N values. Th is wetland is located near residential lawns and a golf course that receive commercial fertilizers, which may account for the lower \u03b4 15 N values of wetland plants (McClelland et al., 1997;Wigand et al., 2007). Th e lower \u03b4 15 N values of wetland plants from the other 20 sites could also be explained in part by inputs of commercial fertilizers or less contribution from human waste water at these sites (McClelland and Valiela, 1998).  Alternatively, the low \u03b4 15 N values reported from these 21 wetlands could be due to the fact that N is not limited in these systems. When N is limited, plants have \u03b4 15 N values similar to their N source. As more N becomes available, disproportionate use of 14 N over 15 N leads to \u03b4 15 N values that are lower than their N source (Wada and Hattori, 1978;Pennock et al., 1996;McClelland and Valiela, 1998). However, the average N:P ratio from plants in these wetlands was 10.0 \u00b1 0.8 (range, 2.9-17.5), which suggests that N is a limiting nutrient in these wetland ecosystems (Verhoeven et al., 1996) and that the \u03b4 15 N of the plants sampled represents their N source. Furthermore, NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N concentrations in the water column adjacent to vegetated areas were often at or below the detection limit for these sites (Table 3). Th e introduction and establishment of introduced species across coastal lowland wetlands in Hawaii may also have infl uenced the site mean \u03b4 15 N values. A concurrent study of vegetative species composition and cover at these sites reported that only 16 of the 85 plant species identifi ed were native. Th ree of the four most abundant species were considered highly invasive (Bantilan- Smith, 2008). Because many of these introduced species have diff erent N acquisition, translocation, and storage rates, can access N more effi ciently, or are capable of thriving at higher levels of N, we expect that there has been and will continue to be a shift in the \u03b4 15 N values in the plant tissues across these sites over time. More research and more comprehensive sampling of a wider range of species, sites, and seasonal variability are needed to draw further conclusions on this topic. Th e weak relationships we reported when \u03b4 15 N values of individual plants were examined may be strengthened by sampling a larger set of sites with similar plant communities (i.e., one or two common species at all sites). Th is may be a useful approach to evaluate changes in \u03b4 15 N values while holding species constant and varying land-use or N sources. However, this may be a diffi cult task in Hawaii because plant communities signifi cantly vary within and across the fi ve main islands (Bantilan- Smith, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Relationships of Plant Tissue \u03b4 15 N with Predictor Variables", "text": "Th e \u03b4 15 N values were positively correlated to percent development within a 1000-m radius (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and human population densities (r = 0.56, p < 0.001) ( Table 5).

Th ese two variables were better predictors of \u03b4 15 N values than were plant tissue N content or any of the water quality parameters. Higher \u03b4 15 N values were attributed to increased sewage inputs. Such inputs likely include cesspools, septic tanks, leaks in sewage lines, and animal wastes that are associated with higher human population densities and urbanization. Increased sewage-derived N would result in an increase in the amount of heavier 15 N isotope available for wetland plant uptake and an increase in \u03b4 15 N values of wetland plants (Mc-Clelland and Valiela, 1998;Cole et al., 2004). Th e decrease in \u03b4 15 N values with the increase in forested area within the 1000m radius of the wetland sites was most likely due to lower N inputs from the forested ecosystems, which generally do not export as much N as agricultural or urban land uses. Similar correlations between \u03b4 15 N values in aquatic ecosystems and human activities have been reported elsewhere. A comparison of \u03b4 15 N of various consumers (i.e., herbivorous fi sh, mussels, chironomids, isopods, etc.) from 11 diff erent studies revealed that \u03b4 15 N values increased signifi cantly with human population densities in surrounding watersheds. Increased \u03b4 15 N values were attributed to increased 15 N inputs from human sewage (Cabana and Rasmussen, 1996). Significant relationships were also reported when \u03b4 15 N values from fi sh (i.e., largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides] and yellow perch [Perca fl avescens]) and unionid mussels (Elliptio complanata) and the fraction of residential development in 91.4-m buff er zones were compared across 17 small lakes in Rhode Island (Lake et al., 2001). Similar patterns have been reported from coastal ecosystems. For example, Wigand et al. (2001Wigand et al. ( , 2003 reported positive correlations between \u03b4 15 N in S. alternifl ora in Narragansett Bay salt marshes and percent residential land use in coastal watersheds in Rhode Island. Increased inputs of waste water, which are positively correlated to urbanization of coastal areas, have also resulted in higher \u03b4 15 N values of macroalgae, macrophytes, and consumers (Hansson et al., 1997;McClelland and Valiela, 1998;Cole et al., 2004). Th e results from our study and others mentioned herein suggest that increasing human population densities in coastal watersheds lead to increasing N inputs to coastal waters, which have the potential to overwhelm the baseline nutrient processing and removal capacities of these systems. Valiela and Cole (2002) identifi ed a threshold of 20 to 100 kg N ha \u22121 yr \u22121 for N inputs to coastal wetlands. Once N inputs exceed these levels, the ability of coastal wetlands to remove excess N is overwhelmed, and the elevated anthropogenic N loading increases the amount of N leaking from coastal wetlands to nearshore ecosystems. Th us, even though the increase in percent N content of plants and \u03b4 15 N suggests that plants in Hawaiian wetlands have the potential to sequester increased N loads, the effi ciency with which these ecosystems remove increased N loads may be compromised as human populations increase. Th ese results also suggest that new sewage treatment plants and updates to existing sewage infrastructure may be needed in developing and developed watersheds in the state of Hawaii as well as throughout the western Pacifi c region to protect coastal ecosystems because sewage treatment systems have been shown to be major sources of N to coastal systems in other areas (Nixon et al., 1995). Future monitoring of \u03b4 15 N in Hawaii wetlands should also consider sampling design. Cross-site comparisons of \u03b4 15 N values appear to be an eff ective technique for tracking N inputs to coastal ecosystems in Hawaii and elsewhere (Wigand et al., 2001(Wigand et al., , 2003. However, the low r 2 values reported here suggest that the usefulness of these comparisons is limited, especially when \u03b4 15 N values are low. Intensive collection of samples from within a single wetland may prove more eff ective in identifying N sources. Not only can this sampling design determine the spatial extent that anthropogenic inputs infl uence coastal ecosystems (Costanzo et al., 1999;Wayland and Hobson, 2001;Savage, 2005), but it can also help identify N sources (Brion et al., 2000;Fry et al., 2003). Fry et al. (2003) developed a model that used DIN concentrations and \u03b4 15 N values throughout an estuary to identify sources of enriched \u03b4 15 N inputs. Unfortunately, this sampling design would also result in the loss of spatial resolution across the Hawaiian Islands because fewer wetlands could be sampled. Perhaps a better approach would be to sample a subset of wetlands over a longer time period. Algal samples collected over time from Australian estuaries were eff ective at tracking decreased inputs of anthropogenic N (Costanzo et al., 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Salinity pH NO 3 -N NH 4 -N TDN", "text": "vided similar, if not slightly better, fi ts (r 2 = 0.27, p < 0.001; r 2 = 0.11, p < 0.05; and r 2 = 0.32, p < 0.001, respectively) compared with grasses (r 2 = 0.26, p < 0.001; r 2 = 0.10, p < 0.05; and r 2 = 0.29, p < 0.001, respectively), sedges (r 2 = 0.18, p < 0.05; r 2 = 0.15, p > 0.05; and r 2 = 0.14, p > 0.05, respectively), and dicot herbs (r 2 = 0.19, p > 0.05; r 2 = 0.11, p > 0.05; and r 2 = 0.22, p > 0.05, respectively). Linear regressions could not be made using \u03b4 15 N from other monocots due to insuffi cient data for this plant group. Linear regressions for individual plant species often yielded r 2 values less than 0.2 that were not signifi cant. Signifi cant relationships were only observed between \u03b4 15 N values in tissue of Bacopa monnieri and percent development within a 1000-m radius (r 2 = 0.32, p < 0.05) and \u03b4 15 N values in tissue of Urochloa mutica and watershed population densities (r 2 = 0.54, p < 0.05). Th e amount of developed (i.e., urban) land cover in a 1000m radius of the site had a positive relationship (p < 0.001) with the individual plant \u03b4 15 N values ( Fig. 2A). Th e \u03b4 15 N became enriched in 15 N by 0.1\u2030 for each percent increase in developed area within the radius.

Th ere was also a positive relationship (p < 0.001) with individual plant \u03b4 15 N values and watershed population density, with the more densely populated watersheds having \u03b4 15 N values more enriched in 15 N (Fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Previous studies that have examined relationships between \u03b4 15 N of wetland plants and watershed land use have largely focused on comparisons of single plant species across diff erent sites. For example, the \u03b4 15 N values of Spartina alternifl ora were positively correlated to human N inputs in New England salt marshes (McClelland and Valiela, 1998;Valiela and Cole, 2002;Cole et al., 2004). Similar correlations have been reported for Iva frutescens, S. patens, and Phragmites australis (Wigand et al., 2007). However, in Hawaii, plant community structure diff ers considerably among wetlands (Bantilan- Smith, 2008). Th is is largely a result of the isolated nature of Hawaii's wetlands and the introduction of exotic plants. Th us, intersite comparisons of the same plant species can be diffi cult if not impossible because one species does not occur across all coastal wetland sites. However, in this study we have provided evidence that the \u03b4 15 N of mixed plant communities, compared with the \u03b4 15 N of individual plant groups (i.e., grasses, sedges) or individual plant species, shows promise as a potential indicator of N sources to these wetlands."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Th e signifi cant diff erences in \u03b4 15 N values across the 34 wetland sites were attributed to diff erences in surrounding land use and watershed population size. Specifi cally, increased cover of developed land and human population densities were positively correlated with \u03b4 15 N values in coastal wetland plant tissues. Increased \u03b4 15 N values were attributed to increased sewage inputs, which are likely due to cesspools, septic tanks, leaks in sewage lines, and animal wastes as such N sources are higher in 15 N compared with other inputs, such as artifi cial fertilizers or N fi xation. Our results suggest that sewage appears to be a signifi cant source of N to coastal wetlands on Maui and Oahu. Although more research and a more comprehensive sampling of a wider range of species, sites, and seasonal variability are needed to conclusively show the utility of \u03b4 15 N for tracking N sources, the use of \u03b4 15 N values from multiple plants across diff erent wetland ecosystems shows promise. Furthermore, the results from this study can be used as a baseline data set to monitor future changes in N inputs to these coastal wetlands, especially with increases in human populations predicted to occur in Hawaii and in other Pacifi c Islands over the next few decades."}]
