[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: While a great deal of work has gone into understanding the relationship between Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain atrophy, and disease progression, less work has attempted to investigate how genetic variation modifies these relationships. The goal of this study was two-fold. First, we sought to identify high-risk vs. low-risk individuals based on their CSF tau and A\u03b2 load and characterize these individuals with regard to brain atrophy in an AD-relevant region of interest. Next, we sought to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between biomarker classification and neurodegeneration.\nMethods: Participants were categorized based on established cut-points for biomarker positivity. Mixed model regression was used to quantify longitudinal change in the left inferior lateral ventricle. Interaction analyses between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and biomarker group status were performed using a genome wide association study (GWAS) approach. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure.\nOne intergenic SNP (rs4866650) and one SNP within the SPTLC1 gene (rs7849530) modified the association between amyloid positivity and neurodegeneration. A transcript variant of WDR11-AS1 gene (rs12261764) modified the association between tau positivity and neurodegeneration. These effects were consistent across the two sub-datasets and explained approximately 3% of variance in ventricular dilation. One additional SNP (rs6887649) modified the association between amyloid positivity and baseline ventricular volume, but was not observed consistently across the sub-datasets.\nGenetic variation modifies the association between AD biomarkers and neurodegeneration. Genes that regulate the molecular response in the brain to oxidative stress may be particularly relevant to neural vulnerability to the damaging effects of amyloid-\u03b2."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Competing models of the sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cascade have debated whether the two primary pathologies, amyloidbeta (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, are causally related, with some suggesting that early amyloid pathology drives later tau pathology and others suggesting both pathologies arrive through distinct, unrelated molecular pathways (Small and Duff, 2008; Jack et al., 2010 Jack et al., , 2013 . In either case, it is theorized that the onset of these protein pathologies ultimately drives synaptic changes and the neurodegenerative cascade resulting in cognitive impairment.\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of pathology in vivo have been applied alongside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate the relation between biomarkers of pathology and neurodegeneration and as combined measures of risk for disease onset and progression. To date, higher levels of CSF tau and lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 have been shown to predict decreases in total and regional brain volume longitudinally, though regional patterns of atrophy appears to vary across diagnostic categories (Tosun et al., 2010) . Other results have suggested that decreased CSF A\u03b2 levels are related to atrophy rates in healthy normal adults (Fagan et al., 2009; Fjell et al., 2010; Schott et al., 2010) , whereas either biomarker can predict atrophy in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD (Sluimer et al., 2010) . Parallel research has demonstrated that the combined diagnostic utility of both CSF and MRI biomarkers is greater than either measure independently (Vemuri et al., 2009a,b; Sluimer et al., 2010; Davatzikos et al., 2011) . Moreover, both CSF and MRI biomarkers appear to provide independent contributions to AD diagnosis, further suggesting each marks a distinct biological process in the AD cascade (Schoonenboom et al., 2008) .\nWhile a great deal of work has gone into understanding the relationship between CSF biomarkers, brain atrophy, and disease progression, few studies have attempted to investigate how genetic variation modifies these relationships. One possibility is that single genes are associated with biomarker load. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated a relationship between CSF A\u03b2 and the APOE genotype (Morris et al., 2010) , and more recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants that are related to CSF biomarkers (Kim et al., 2011) . A second possibility is that genes interact to confer risk or resilience from biomarker load. Work in our lab has identified novel gene-gene interactions that are related to A\u03b2 load as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) (Hohman et al., 2013 Koran et al., 2014b ) and brain atrophy measured with MRI (Meda et al., 2013; Koran et al., 2014a) . A final possibility is that genes interact with the presence of biomarkers to confer risk or resilience from longitudinal changes in brain volume or cognition. In one study, the APOE genotype in combination with biomarker positivity (high CSF tau or low CSF A\u03b2-42) at baseline was associated with increased regional atrophy in MCI subjects; however, the authors reported that no biomarker \u00d7 APOE interaction reached statistical significance (Tosun et al., 2010) . We previously identified an interaction between CSF levels of phosphorylated tau (ptau) and variation in the protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) gene that modified the association between ptau load and neurodegeneration ). Yet, no study to date has systematically approached genetic modification of the relationship between CSF biomarkers of protein pathology and MRI biomarkers of disease progression.\nThe goal of this study was to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between biomarker classification and neurodegeneration. We hypothesized we would identify a subset of individuals who were resilient to the neurodegenerative cascade associated with biomarker positivity based on genotypic variation across the sample. Moreover, we hypothesized that such variation would explain variance in brain atrophy above and beyond the effect of the APOE genotype. The identification of such genetic factors could clarify the mechanistic relationship between CSF biomarkers and neurodegeneration and provide targets for clinical intervention aimed at altering such pathways of neuro-vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.

The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD.

This observation is also consistent with the proposed cascade of AD biomarkers in which amyloid shows the earliest changes in biomarker levels, followed by tau (Jack et al., 2013) . Thus, the observed association between the amyloid-only and the both biomarker group with brain volume change in an AD relevant region of interest is consistent with the expected AD cascade. The exact relation between CSF biomarkers and both crosssectional and longitudinal brain volume appears to vary by brain region and is modified by genetic profile (Tosun et al., 2010) . Thus, additional analyses targeting non-AD regions of interest, or performed at a voxel-wise level, may help further clarify the association between brain atrophy and biomarker status. Given the association also varies by diagnosis (Tosun et al., 2010) , larger samples that allow stratification across diagnostic groups will be needed to fully evaluate potential genetic modifiers of this complex relationship.

This SNP is also 10 KB upstream of ferritin mitochondrial gene (FTMT). Interestingly, FtMt has been recently been implicated as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegenerative disease through regulation of iron homeostasis in the brain (Gao and Chang, 2014) . Moreover, it has been specifically implicated in reducing oxidative damage and reducing \u03b2-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity (Wu et al., 2013) . Our findings further implicate FtMt in AD pathogenesis, although a larger sample is needed to verify this effect, particularly given that the effect was not observed consistently between the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO datasets. Two SNPs were identified that modified the association between amyloid positivity and ventricular dilation (rs7849530 and rs4866650). In both cases these effects were consistent across the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO cohorts, validating the association and suggesting the effect may indeed replicate in an independent sample. Interestingly, both of these SNPs are also within 50 kb of SNPs that have shown weak associations with AD previously (Li et al., 2008) . Additionally, the rs7849530 \u00d7 amyloid interaction showed an association with disease status in a binary logistic regression with the same covariates used in the previous model. As with brain volume, the minor allele at rs7849530 was protective in non-amyloid positive individuals and conferred risk in amyloid positive individuals.\nRs7849530 is 50 kb upstream of serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1). Interestingly, ceramide levels, both in the brain and the blood, have been associated with risk for AD in a number of studies (Satoi et al., 2005; Filippov et al., 2012; Mielke et al., 2012) . Serine palmitoyltransferase is the rate limiting enzyme in ceramide synthesis, and SPTLC1 has been specifically implicated in increased ceramide synthesis triggering apoptosis in Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) cells (Dawkins et al., 2001) . Moreover, A\u03b2 induced membrane oxidative stress has been shown to cause ceramide accumulation to increase, ultimately resulting in apoptosis and neurodegeneration (Cutler et al., 2004) . The present results suggest that genetic variation associated with ceramide synthesis may leave individuals vulnerable to neurodegeneration in the presence of amyloid, perhaps due to the previously identified relation between A\u03b2 induced oxidative stress and ceramide-induced apoptosis.\nIt is quite interesting that the higher rate of ventricular dilation in minor allele carriers of rs7849530 and rs4866650 is only observed in the group that is amyloid positive (only), but not in the group that is both amyloid and tau positive. In the current analyses we used baseline biomarker groups to predict future ventricular dilation, and past research has demonstrated that CSF biomarker changes in amyloid precede CSF biomarker changes in tau during the typical presentation of AD (Jack et al., 2013) . Therefore, one possibility is that neural vulnerability due to ceramide levels may lead to an amyloid specific neurodegenerative process early in the disease process that is then compounded by a tau-specific neurodegenerative process later on. In such a scenario, a later starting point in an individual's disease course (when the paritcipant has both tau and amyloid pathology) could be associated with an increased rate of decline relative to non-risk groups (as in Figure 2 ), but may at that stage be a more tau-based process that would not be as impacted by a genetic predisposition toward higher levels of ceramides. Additional work following the course of neurodegenerative processes in relation to the course of CSF biomarker changes will be necessary to better understand how individual variability in genetic risk modifies this complex association."}, {"section_title": "SNP MODIFICATION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN TAU AND NEURODEGENERATION", "text": "The primary SNP associated with neurodegeneration in individuals with tau pathology was rs12261764 annotated to WDR11 antisense RNA 1 (WDR11-AS1).

WDR11 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor EMX1 leading to impaired development of olfactory neurons within individuals with Kallmann syndrome (Kim et al., 2010) . There has been some indication of the presence of both tau and amyloid protein deposits in the olfactory bulb of individuals with AD (Mundi\u00f1ano et al., 2011) .

The joint analysis of the combined dataset allowed us to maximize our power (Skol et al., 2006) , and the stratified post-hoc analyses provided support for the consistency of the observed effects across data sources. However, this manuscript is not without limitations. Although consistent effects were observed, a true replication sample from an external data source with GWAS and PET data will be necessary to confirm our findings. We did observe differences in effect size between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO, likely due to the difference in follow-up time.\nIt is also possible that differences in CSF batches between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO could be driving the differences in effect size between the two groups. In the current analysis, it is difficult to distinguish batch effects from group differences because we used the first CSF observation for each subject (thus the batches align roughly with ADNI-1 subjects vs. ADNI-2/GO subjects). However, it should be noted that previous work has demonstrated the test-retest reliability of the biomarker measures from CSF in the ADNI dataset . The proposed mechanisms also assume a strong association between CSF biomarker levels and levels of neuropathology (Clark et al., 2003; Strozyk et al., 2003) . Future analyses will build on this finding by evaluating the observed interactions in an autopsy sample where a more direct relationship between genotype, gene expression, and AD pathology can be assessed.\nIn the present analysis we did not have a large enough sample to meaningfully assess gene-biomarker interactions across diagnostic groups. Our observed effects appeared to show similar trends across the diagnostic categories (Supplemental Figures  2, 3) ; however given the known differences in the relationship between brain volume and CSF biomarkers across diagnostic categories, it would be worthwhile to pursue gene-biomarkerdiagnosis interactions, if a larger sample could be acquired.\nAn additional independent sample with a comparable longitudinal follow-up interval to that of ADNI-1 could help clarify whether the cohort differences observed are simply due to differences in power, or rather such differences were due to batch effects, MRI follow-up interval, or sample characteristics. Moreover, future work replicating our findings in an independent sample with MRI, CSF, and genotype data is needed to confirm the observed effects. Finally, to avoid possible confounding factors related to population substructure we chose to restrict all analyses to Caucasian individuals, and thus our results may not generalize to other ancestral populations. We believe the statistical approach taken provides a blue-print for future gene-environment interaction analyses aimed at identifying genetic modifiers of known AD risk factors."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Timothy J.
