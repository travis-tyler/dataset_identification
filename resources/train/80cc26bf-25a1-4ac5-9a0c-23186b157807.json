[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The relationship between risk and entrepreneurship is a widely studied topic in the entrepreneurship literature (Block, et al., 2009). Risk taking is often considered a distinctive characteristic among entrepreneurs (Block, et al., 2009, Caliendo, et al., 2009, Kamhon and Wei-Der, 2006, Knight, 1921 and entrepreneurs are more risk prone than the general population. Considering the fact that agricultural production is riskier than businesses in other sectors of economy (Hardeaker, et al., 2004, Musser andPatterson, 2002), risk attitude should play a more pronounced role in explaining entrepreneurship in the farm sector. Risk analysis in agriculture can be broadly classified into three categories: (1) how to measure farmers' risk perceptions, 2normative analysis to provide a guideline for the optimal risk management strategies, and 3how risk attitudes, assuming that they are properly measured, influence farmers' actual decisionmaking (Holt and Chavas, 2002). This study belongs to the third category. The objective of this study is to empirically estimate the relationship between agricultural operators' risk attitude and use of agricultural contracts (production and marketing contracts) and the intensity at which they adopt them. This study is an extension of Uematsu and Mishra (2011). In our earlier work, we studied the relationship between farmers' self-assessment of risk attitude measured on a 11-point Likert scale 1 and use of five risk management strategies: off-farm labor, enterprise diversification, contracts (marketing, production and forward pricing), crop insurance, other types of insurance. We estimated a multivariate probit model and unexpectedly found that farmers who were more willing to take risk were more likely to use all risk management strategies but off-farm labor. One of the plausible explanations for this unexpected result was that risk averseness may impose a negative impact on doing something new, even if its purpose is to eventually manage risk. To the extent that this is true, risk loving operators may be willing to adopt a risk management strategy, while risk averse operators may be more willing to use a risk management strategy at a greater intensity if the strategy is proven to be successful and compatible with the existing operation. In order to test these two hypotheses, we estimate the two potentially conflicting impacts of risk attitude on the adoption of agricultural contracts by a double hurdle model, originally developed by Cragg (1971). According to MacDonald, et al. (2004), agricultural contracts are arrangement \"for the transfer of agricultural products from farms to downstream users such as processors, elevators, integrators, retailers, or other farms.\" Production and marketing contracts are the two of the most major forms of agricultural contracts. While production contracts are agreements on production inputs and practices between farmers and contractors, marketing contracts specifies a pricing scheme and sales outlets for the commodity prior to harvest (MacDonald and Korb, 2011). Production contracts are more popular in livestock production while marketing contracts are more widely used in crop production (MacDonald and Korb, 2011). Agricultural contracts explain an increasing share of agricultural sales. In 2008, production and marketing contracts accounted for 38 percent of the total value of agricultural production in the United States (MacDonald and Korb, 2011), up from 36 percent in 2004, and 28 percent in 1991(MacDonald, et al., 2004. Agricultural contracts are important risk management strategies for farmers as they can stabilize farm income by substantially reducing risks associated with input prices, production, and output price inherent in agriculture. In general, farmers can retain a greater degree of autonomy in marketing contracts than in production contracts. Although some agricultural contracts are not designed to reduce risks, the risk management aspect of agricultural contracts provides important benefits to farmers (MacDonald, et al., 2004). The underlying assumption in this study, therefore, is that risk reduction is the major motivation for famers to use agricultural contracts. As in Uematsu and Mishra (2011), we rely on data from the 2001 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Our analysis controls for a wide range of socio-economic factors. In particular, we include farming experience and whether the farmer is raised on farm or not to represent the effect of learning by doing on use of production and marketing contracts. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews relevant literature with an emphasis on the validity of Likert scale risk attitude and its empirical applications. Section III discusses estimation strategy and empirical framework, followed by data description in Section IV. Empirical results are presented in Section V. The final section offers concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "II. Literature Review", "text": "The expected utility framework has been the basis of most empirical analysis of risk in agriculture (Holt and Chavas, 2002). The expected utility framework is a theoretical scheme derived based on the set of axioms developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) in which economic agents are expected to maximize their expected utility. Because of its normative nature, the validity of the expected utility theory needs to be confirmed empirically (Hey, 1979). In fact, an increasing amount of empirical and experimental evidence has been accumulated to document the violations of the axioms in the expected utility theory (Machina, 1987, Starmer, 2000, Tversky and Kahneman, 1982. Nonetheless, the expected utility theory remains by far the most popular theoretical framework in risk analysis in agricultural economics due to its simplicity and the lack of better alternatives (Just and Peterson, 2010). The measurement of risk attitude used in this study is very simple and does not explicitly utilize the expected utility theory. Specifically, the respondents were asked to choose a number between 0 and 10 on a Likert scale to represent the level of risk with which they are comfortable in making decisions, with 0 being \"avoid risks as much as possible\" and 10 being \"take risks as much as possible.\" Any proposed measurement of risk attitude is never free from contradiction with empirical evidence, which are also subject to inconsistent findings within themselves (Lagerkvist, 2005). Likert scale risk attitude is no exception. For example, Fausti and Gillespie (2006) examined consistency across five risk-attitude measurement instruments (RAMI) including Likert scale risk attitude. Not only did the authors find no consistency across different RAMI, they also found no significant relationship between levels of understanding of survey questions by respondents and their consistency across RAMI. Their study suggests that the inconsistency across RAMI cannot solely be attributed to respondents' understanding of survey questions or lack thereof. Bard and Barry (2001) employed the \"closing-in\" method to elicit Illinois farmers' risk attitude. The \"closing-in\" method is an iterative procedure in which respondents are repeatedly asked to choose between gambles until their preference converges to a narrow interval. The authors compared \"closing-in\" risk attitude against farmers' own assessment of risk attitude measured on a 11-point Likert scale, however, the authors found no correlation between them. The lack of consistency across different measures of risk attitude is disturbing not only to theoretical economists who propose them, but also to empirical economists who need to rely on them for empirical analyses. The results from the two studies caution us to solely rely on Likert scale risk attitude. However, there is also some empirical evidence that validates Likert scale risk attitude as a measurement of risk attitude. Dohmen, et al. (2005) Caliendo, et al. (2009) also utilized the 11-point Likert scale risk attitude and observed that self-employed persons are more risk loving than others when they became self-employed out of unemployment in Germany 2 . Block, et al.(2009), using a 7-point Likert scale risk attitude, showed that entrepreneurs who started their ventures with identified business opportunities are more tolerant to risk than those entrepreneurs who started ventures out of necessity to earn a living. To summarize the discussion so far, there is ample evidence in labor economics and entrepreneurship literature that confirms validity of Likert scale risk attitude, while no such evidence exists in agricultural economics (Bard and Barry, 2001, Fausti and Gillespie, 2006, Uematsu and Mishra, 2011. The inconsistent findings in the agricultural economics literature lead us to another question gleaned from our earlier work. In Uematsu and Mishra (2011) In a multivariate probit model in Uematsu and Mishra (2011), farmers' decision regarding use of risk management strategies was coded as a binary variable: whether or not to use a risk management strategy. Although it is a common approach in empirical modeling, the drawback is the loss of information. In particular, a binary variable does not capture the intensity at which a farmer adopts a risk management strategy after he/she decides to adopt it. The most standard approach to incorporate these two decisions would be Tobit model due to James Tobin (Tobin, 1958). Tobit model, however, assumes that the same underlying process determines both the probability that the dependent variable is censored and the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given that it is not censored (Burke, 2009). In the context of this study, Tobit model assumes that the same underlying process determines whether a farmer uses production contracts or not and the intensity at which the farmer uses the contracts given that he/she decides to adopt it. As a consequence, the marginal effect of a regressor on these two outcomes always obtain the same sign (Wooldridge, 2001). This simplifying assumption is of concern in the current context in which we hypothesize that risk attitude can have two opposing effects on whether a farmer adopts agricultural contracts or not and the intensity at which the farmer adopts the contracts. Cragg (1971) proposed a more flexible double hurdle model in which these two outcomes are determined by separate processes (Burke, 2009). The double hurdle model is also more flexible than Heckman's two stage model (Heckman, 1979) as it allows for possibility of zero observations in both of the two outcomes (Cameron andTrivedi, 2005, Wooldridge, 2001). Since the double hurdle model employs two separate processes to determine two outcomes, the model has two latent variables. Following notations in Mishra et al. (2009) and Blundell and Meghir (1987) and suppressing subscript for individual observations, where \u202b\u0755\u202c \u0b35 * is the latent variable representing the decision of whether or not to use agricultural contracts (Tier 1), \u202b\u0755\u202c \u0b36 * is the other latent variable representing the intensity at which agricultural contracts are used (Tier 2). and \u08bc are, respectively, vectors of independent variables and parameters to be estimated and \u07dd is the error term. Note that subscripts, 1 and 2, for , \u08bc and \u07dd indicate that the two latent variables can be specified by different sets of independent variables and error terms. The double hurdle model obtains consistent estimates of \u08bc and \u08bc by maximizing the following likelihood function: where \u202b\u0755\u202c \u0b35 is a dummy variable that takes a value of one when \u202b\u0755\u202c \u0b35 * > 0 and \u03a6 is the standard normal cumulative density function (Burke, 2009). In this paper, we estimate two separate double hurdle model: one for use of production contracts and the other for marketing contracts."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Framework", "text": "In order to establish empirical models, we need to specify the vectors, and . For both of the two models, we use the same set of variables for both and . Variables representing farm characteristics include total operated acres, total operated acres squared, a dummy variable for farms receiving government payments, debt to asset ratio, the entropy index, tenancy dummy variables (full owners and full tenants), dummy variables for use of crop insurance and other types of insurance, distance in miles to the closest city with population of at least 10,000, a dummy variable for farms that estimates a rate of return on assets as part of business analysis, a dummy variable for farms that prepare income and net worth statements for farm records. Farms with large scale operation are likely to be exposed to greater amount of risks, and thus they are expected to make extensive use of risk management strategies (Mishra and Goodwin, 1997) , including agricultural contracts (Key, 2004, MacDonald, et al., 2004. The effect of total operated acres on the probability of using contracts can be more significant for marketing contracts than production contracts since total operated acres represent the scale of crop production for which marketing contracts are more popular. The sign of the coefficient for government payments is a priori ambiguous. We expect debt to asset ratio to be positively correlated with both use and intensity of use of agricultural contracts; highly leveraged farms are more actively hedging income risk as they have relatively less to fall back on in the case of financial hardship. Enterprise diversification represented by the entropy index is a risk management strategy by itself. On one hand, enterprise diversification may reduce the need for agricultural contracts, but on the other hand, adding new farm products in the existing mix of enterprises can be risky and thus agricultural contracts may play a role to address the risk. Our empirical analysis would reveal whether the entropy index is perceived as a complement or a substitute to agricultural contracts depending on the direction of correlation then. As for land tenancy, full owners and tenants are less likely to use agricultural contracts relative to part owners who on average operate largest farms in the United States and are more committed to farming (USDA, 1998). As it is for the entropy index, the impact of crop insurance and other types of insurance on use of agricultural contracts are also theoretically ambiguous. Farms estimating rate of return on asset and preparing income and net worth statements have more precise information and higher analytic capability to assess the financial status of the farm business. Because such farms would perceive the transaction cost for agricultural contracts lower than other farms, we expect such farms to use agricultural contract more often, but it is not clear if such farms would use them at a higher intensity. Finally, we include distance to the closest city and regional dummy variables to account for potentially heterogeneous effect of geographical location of the farm that cannot be captured by other socio-economic factors."}, {"section_title": "IV. Data", "text": "This study uses data from The 2001 ARMS contains a question that queries the respondents' risk preference. Specifically, the respondents were asked to choose a number between 0 and 10 on a Likert scale to represent the level of risk with which they are comfortable in making decisions, with 0 being \"avoid risks as much as possible\" and 10 being \"take risks as much as possible.\" In this study, we compare this variable, which can be seen as perceptions about their own risk attitude, against variables representing actual realization of their risk attitude revealed by decisions they make in farming operation, which are also obtained from 2001 ARMS data. A huge spike in the middle of distribution (Figure 1) shows that the majority of respondents chose 5 at the center of the Likert scale, indicating that most farmers consider themselves as neither risk taking or risk averse. However, this may not necessarily mean that those who chose 5 are risk neutral in terms of curvature of utility function, as there is no theoretical connection between this question and respondents' utility function. Table 1 lists variable used in this study and their definitions. It also shows the mean for the entire sample as well as conditional means for observations with Likert scale risk attitude less than 5, equal to 5 and greater than 5. A significant F-statistic for one-way ANOVA in the last column indicates that the conditional means for the three groups are different from each other. For production contract, the mean values for both the use and the intensity of use are higher for those who have a higher score on Likert scale risk attitude. The pattern is more conspicuous for marketing contracts, demonstrated by much larger F-statistics (55.39 and 30.59). Most variables, except for regional dummy variables, have a significant F-statistic, indicating some correlation between Likert scale risk attitude and independent variables, although it does not control for any confounding factors. Table 2 and Table 3 present the results from the double hurdle model for production contracts and marketing contracts, respectively. Column heading \"Tier 1\" corresponds to equation (1) that estimates whether a farmer uses contracts (either production or marketing) and \"Tier 2\" refers to equation (2) in which the intensity of contract use is estimated. We compare parameter estimates from both models, highlighting different impacts of regressor on production and marketing contracts."}, {"section_title": "V. Empirical Results", "text": "Our primary interest in these double hurdle models is the impact of Likert scale risk attitude on use of agricultural contracts. The results in Tables 2 and 3 show that the coefficients of Likert scale risk attitude are positive and significant in Tier 1; those who are willing to take more risk are more likely to use both production and marketing contracts as observed in our earlier work (Uematsu and Mishra, 2011). This is consistent with the hypothesis we stated earlier that adopting a new practice poses risk to farmers, even if the practice is designed to eventually diversify and reduce risks. The finding here is in line with Dohmen et al. (2005)  As expected, farming as a primary occupation is positively correlated with the use of both production and marketing contracts, but not with the intensity. The positive impact of age on the use of production contracts also confirms our expectation that older farmers are also more likely to use production contract. Total operated acres exhibit different impact on the use of production and marketing contracts. The results in Table 2 show that, in both Tiers 1and 2, total operated acres unexpectedly have a negative impact on the use of production contract, but the negative impact mitigates as total operated acres increase indicated by the positive coefficient on the squared term. The results here are contrary to the general trend in U.S. that larger farmers are more likely to utilize contracts Korb, 2011, MacDonald, et al., 2004). Given the fact that production contracts are more widely used in livestock production, total operated acres may not represent the size of livestock farms as well as it does for crop farms. In the marketing production models (Table 3), on the other hand, total operated acres has a positive and significant coefficient in Tier 1 and a negative and significant coefficient in Tier 2; farms with larger total operated acres are more likely to use marketing contracts. The negative coefficient of total operated acres in Tier 2 may be an artifact of the way the dependent variable is coded. Farms with large operated acres are likely to have higher value of production under marketing contracts, but the share of value of production under marketing contracts in total value of production may become lower as such farms are also expected to have higher total value of production. Government payments are positively correlated with use of both production and marketing contracts and intensity of use for production contract. Government payments can be seen as a tool to reduce income risk as they provide a stable stream of income. The fact that farmers receiving government payments are more likely to use agricultural contracts suggests that they play a complimentary role to agricultural contracts in risk management. Debt to asset ratio has a positive coefficient in Tier 1 in the production contracts model (Table 2) and in Tier 2 in the marketing contracts model (Table 3), which is consistent with our expectation. The entropy index for enterprise diversification is positively correlated with use of both production and marketing contracts. We discussed earlier that enterprise diversification can be positively correlated with use of agricultural contracts if the decision to grow a new commodity poses risk to farmers. The finding here confirms not only supports the claim but also reiterate the significance of risk perceived by farmers when they taken on a new practice, be it a new commodity or a new risk management strategy, for the first time. Land tenancy variables exhibit very mixed results. Results in Table 2 demonstrate that full owners are more likely to use production contracts (Tier 1) at a greater intensity (Tier 2), whereas full tenants are less likely to use production contracts (Tier 2) and, even if they use them, they do so at a lower intensity (Tier 2). Land ownership is positively correlated with use and intensity of use of production contracts. To the extent that capital investment is necessary for growing commodities under production contracts, land ownership may be an important determinant for farmers to take on production contracts. In Table 3, on the other hand, we observe that full owners are less likely to use marketing contracts (Tier 1) but if they use them, they do so at a greater intensity (Tier 2). Full tenants use marketing contracts at a lower intensity (Tier 2). For both production and marketing contracts, use of crop insurance has a positive coefficient in Tier 1 (even though it is not significant for production contracts) and a negative coefficient in Tier 2. Again, we argue that farmers may perceive risk in signing legally binding contracts for the first time and thus crop insurance can work as a complimentary risk management strategy. However, for those farmers who use agricultural contracts at a greater intensity, crop insurance may be less important as they become fully able to handle risk through agricultural contracts. The same argument holds true for use of other insurance programs in both models as it has a positive coefficient in Tier 1 and a negative coefficient in Tier 2 (not significant for marketing contracts). The distance from the farm to the closest city with a population of at least 10,000 has a negative and significant impact on use of both production and marketing contracts. The availability of and physical distance to contractors may be a barrier to potential users of agricultural contracts. As expected, preparing income and net worth statement positively influence use of marketing contracts (Tier 1, Table 3). Transaction cost of marketing contracts, e.g., understanding specific terms and conditions of the contract, may be lower for farmers who regularly assess financial position of the farm business. Farm type dummy variables mostly obtained significant coefficients in both models. High value crops farms are more likely to use both production and marketing contracts at a higher intensity. Livestock farms (excluding dairy farms) are more likely to use production contracts (Tier 1) at a greater intensity (Tier 2) but less likely to use marketing contracts (Tier 1, Table 3), as suggested by MacDonald and Korb (2011) and MacDonald, et al. (2004). Dairy farms are less likely to use production contracts (Tier 1, Table 2) but they are more likely to use marketing contracts at a greater intensity (Table 3). For both production contracts and marketing contracts, geographical location of the farm has a significant explanatory power. Note that all the coefficients for regional dummy variables are relative to the base group of farms located in the Heartland region. In the production contracts model (Table 2), only farms in the Southern Sea Board region is more likely to use production contracts while farm in the Northern Great Plains region, the Prairie Gateway region, the Fruitful Rim region, the Basin and Range region, and the Mississippi Portal region are less likely to use production contracts. Coefficient estimates in Tier 2 show that farms in the Prairie Gateway region, the Eastern Upland region, the Southern Sea Board region, and the Mississippi Portal region adopt production contracts at a higher intensity than farms in the Heartland region. In the marketing contracts model (Table 3), farms in the Southern Sea Board region, the Fruitful Rim region, and the Mississippi Portal region are more likely to use marketing contracts but farms in the Prairie Gateway and the Eastern Upland regions are less likely to use marketing contracts, again, relative to the farms in the Heartland region. Remarkably, all the regional dummy variables have a positive and significant coefficient in Tier 2, suggesting that farms in the Heartland region use marketing contracts at the lowest intensity. Mostly significant coefficients for the regional dummy variables underscore the importance of heterogeneity attributable to geographical location of the farm."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusion", "text": "Risk analysis in agricultural economics often requires an accurate measurement of individual risk attitude. Agricultural economists often rely on the expected utility framework to quantify risk attitude, but any proposed measurement of risk attitude is never free from contradiction with empirical evidence (Lagerkvist, 2005). In our earlier work, Uematsu and Mishra (2011) utilize self-assessment of risk attitude measured on a 11-point Likert scale to estimate its impact on use of five different risk management strategies. We unexpectedly found that farmers who are willing to take more risk are more likely to adopt all risk management strategies but off-farm employment. In addition, the existing studies in agricultural economics documented inconsistency across different measures of risk attitude, including the one measured on a Likert scale (Bard andBarry, 2001, Fausti andGillespie, 2006). Outside the realm of agricultural economics, however, Likert scale risk attitude was found to be a better predictor of actual individual behavior in the face of risk in various social contexts than other measures or risk attitude (Dohmen, et al., 2005). A number of empirical studies have utilized Likert scale risk attitude and obtained theoretically consistent results (Block, et al., 2009, Caliendo, et al., 2009, Jaeger, et al., 2010. The objective of this study was to empirically examine the hypothesis gleaned from the unexpected results in Uematsu and Mishra (2011). That is, risk averseness may be a deterrent to doing something new, even if its purpose is to eventually manage risk. To the extent that this is true, risk loving operators may be willing to adopt a risk management strategy, while risk averse operators may be more willing to use a risk management strategy at a greater intensity if the strategy is proven to be successful and compatible with the existing operation. We employed a double hurdle model (Cragg, 1971) in order to estimate two different effects of risk attitude on use of two types of agricultural contracts: production and marketing. The results partially confirmed our expectation. Likert scale risk attitude has a positive impact on use of both production and marketing strategies, but it has no impact on the intensity at which these contracts are adopted. The finding in this study is theoretically consistent in the sense that risk averse farmers are less likely to use agricultural contracts, which may pose a considerable amount of risk to those who have never used it before. It adds to the list of empirical studies (Block, et al., 2009, Caliendo, et al., 2009, Jaeger, et al., 2010) that utilized Likert scale risk attitude and obtained theoretically consistent results.
