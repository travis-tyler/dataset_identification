Although about 80% of eighth graders have reached the \"basic\" level in mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), one out of five is unable to perform such everyday arithmetic tasks. About 40% show proficiency at the intermediate mathematics level or above. This level is associated with knowledge of decimals, fractions and percents, which are reported to be major topics in junior highs and middle schools. Nineteen percent overall are proficient at the advanced mathematics level (simple problem solving, conceptual understanding).

This is the third in a series sponsored by NCES; the first two are the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) and High School and Beyond (HS&B). Whereas NLS-72 and HS&B focused mainly on the educational, vocational, and personal development of 10th and 12th grade respondents. NELS:88 is both broader in scope and more pioneering in focus. NELS:88 is being conducted in several waves. The first describes the experiences of the students as 8th graders; the second will trace them in the 10th grade; and the third will follow them to the 12th grade. Additional followups will come at 2-year intervals. The longitudinal design of NELS:88 allows researchers to observe not only the critical transition of students from middle or junior high school to high school, but also to identify early student, school, and parental experiences that promote student learning. This report describes the experiences of the students in eighth grade during spring 1988. The NELS:88 study examines the attitudes, school performance, and activities of eighth grade students. It also incorporates supporting data from students' school principals, parents, and teachers to identify additional factors that affect student achievement. In this sense, NELS:88 takes into consideration the much larger environment in which the student functions and develops. The study assumes that a student's eighth grade experiences are critical to the student's further social, emotional, and academic development. The inclusion of the teacher, school, and parent surveys enhances the quality and quantity of data collected on student academic achievement and social development. The milieu in which learning occurs is complex and invites intense scrutiny by researchers and policymakers. One of the major questions this study addresses is, \"Under what circumstances do our children flourish and succeed?\" The NELS:88 data will provide a wealth of information about factors that influence a student's academic performance and social development. Policymakers can use this information to turn the numbers and statistics into practical, workable programs to help solve the problems facing the American educational system and its students. The current longitudinal studies program provides statistics on the education, work, and family experiences of young adults during the pivotal transitions from eighth grade to high school and from high school to postsecondary education and the world of work. Since NLS-72, each successive longitudinal study conducted by NCES has grown substantially in complexity with respect to sample specifications, sources of information, and instrument sophistication. The NELS:88 design reflects two decades of successful experiences with longitudinal education studies. NELS:88 differs from both NLS-72 and HS&B in that the first data collection phase begins in the 8th grade rather than high school. The decision to begin the study in 8th grade was made to provide pre-high school baseline data and construct a national database with the capacity to systematically examine the critical transitions students undergo moving from 8th grade in elementary, middle, or junior high school through 10th grade in secondary school. This period of transition is important for exploring broader policy issues such as how students are counseled into specific high school programs and courses and what impact program choice has on their 10th grade experiences. Information will be available about the effects of this transition on student attitudes, aspirations, self-esteem, and academic performance."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of NELS:88", "text": "As a large-scale, longitudinal study, the survey's fundamental purpose is to provide trend data about pivotal transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on careers.

Other issues addressed by NELS:88 include: how students are assigned to curricular programs; how program assignments affect academic performance and future career choices; what role the family plays in shaping educational attitudes and behavior; how teacher judgments of student motivation and classroom activities influence academic performance; and how school policies affect student educational and social outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Potential", "text": "The availability of this longitudinal database encourages in-depth research for meeting the educational policy needs of the 21st century. There is no doubt that American schools are presently in a state of crisis, but the educational policies and structure instituted to meet the needs of the next century will have a sound foundation in the comprehensive database that NELS:88 provides. The NELS:88 data obtained from the base year and subsequent waves will contribute to increasing our understanding of the transition patterns as eighth graders move from a more socially homogeneous neighborhood school to a more heterogeneous consolidated high school; to understanding the dynamics of tracking and what roles students, teachers, administrators, and parents play in that process; and to identifying the features of effective schools, and determining whether the features differ for particular groups of children. Although NELS:88 is primarily a longitudinal study, the data reported in this report are cross-sectional, as only one wave of the survey has been carried out. This report is a snapshot of the NELS:88 sample at one point in time and primarily focuses on data obtained from student questionnaires. The base year survey is valuable in itself, as it is the first nationally representative sample of eighth graders.

The study design includes a clustered, stratified national probability sample of approximately 1,000 schools (800 public schools and 200 private schools, including parochial institutions) in the United States that enroll eighth grade students. Almost 25,000 students across the United States participated in the base year study. The sample represents the Nation's eighth grade population, totalling about 3 million eighth graders in more than 38,000 schools in spring 1988. Questionnaires and cognitive tests were administered to each student in the NELS:88 sample. The student questionnaire covered school experiences, activities, attitudes, plans, selected background characteristics, and language proficiency. Other groups of respondents provided additional types of information. An administrator such as a principal filled out a questionnaire about the school; two teachers of each student were asked to answer questions about the student, about themselves, and about their school; and one parent of each student was surveyed regarding family characteristics and student activities. The total survey effort thus provides a comprehensive database for analyses (see Inge ls et al.

A Profile of the American Eighth Grader: NELS:88 Student Descriptive Summary Many of the background variables commonly used in education research (race, socioeconomic status, language proficiency, family composition, parent education) are highly related to each other, and multivariate analysis generally allows for a more appropriate description of interrelationships. In this report, only univariate analysis is carried out. Appendix A -\"Sample Composition\" shows the general characteristics of the sample. Missing responses are not listed. The number of missing responses can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the listed categories from the total n (24,599).

All comparisons cited in this report have been tested for statistical significance, using Bonferroni adjustments, and are significant at the .05 level. The overall alpha is adjusted, based on the number of possible comparisons (see appendix B for a discussion of procedures used). xxiv 23 This report draws a profile of the population of 3 million eighth graders enrolled in over 38,000 public and private schools across .the nation in the 1987-88 school year. Statistics, however, only tell part of the story of the lives of our Nation's adolescents. This descriptive report tries to provide an impartial perspective on the environments in which such young people are growing up. Early adolescence is a time when children are exposed to many different situations which may influence their future schooling experiences. Although the majority of students succeed in school, a large number of students can be identified as being \"at risk\"' of failing to achieve in school or of dropping out of school. NELS:88 includes students of all kinds: those who are not at risk of school failure and those who, to various degrees, are at risk. Some special features of the design which make it a powerful vehicle for examining at-risk issues are: a) it begins at eighth grade; b) it has 2-year followups; and c) it contains an over-sample of language minorities. This chapter is divided into three sections. First, we look at demographic characteristics of eighth graders, along with their family, language, and academic characteristics. Next, we explore how the students feel about themselves. Finally, we examine the schools that enroll eighth graders. Each section begins with an overview of general socio-demographic patterns. Similarities and differences are examined for selected groups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,2 and other background characteristics."}, {"section_title": "What They Look Like", "text": "Basic Demographic Characteristics  (born between 1970 and 1972) and about 1 percent were born in 1975-1979 (13 or younger). The eighth graders can be grouped by the use of certain languages spoken in their home into four types of families. HOME LANGUAGE (a composite variable) characterizes the primary language used by the family, differentiating between English and non-English languages and by whether the language was the only language or the dominant one among several spoken at home. It is derived from student reports. Students are assigned to the \"English only\" group if no language other than English is spoken. If the language usually spoken in the home is English, but another language is also used, the student is considered \"English dominant\". If another language is usually used, and English is not spoken in the hohae, the student is assigned to \"non-English only\". If another language is usually used in the home, and if English is also spoken in the home, the student is considered \"non-English-dominant\". For the total eighth grade population, 83 percent report living in English-only homes, 7 percent in English-dominant homes, 7 percent in non-English-dominant homes and 3 percent in non-English-only homes. Students were also asked which language usually is spoken in their home (generally English, Spanish, and otner language are the categories used in this report). English language proficiency is a commonly-used indicator of educational disadvantage. Students were categorized into two groups, limited-English-proficient (LEP) or non-LEP, based on either selfreport or a teacher-report of limited English. About 2 percent of the population were identified as LEPs.3 Parent Education and Income Table 1.1 displays the percentage of eighth graders from families with different levels of parental education and income, by selected background characteristics. About 11 percent of the students' parents did not finish high school, 21 percent completed high school, 42 percent have some college, 14 percent are college graduates, and about 12 percent have graduate degrees (see appendix B for a description of the parent education composite). A socioeconomic status quartile variable (SESQ) was built using parent questionnaire data: father's education level, mother's education level, father's and mother's occupations, and family income (see appendix B for details on construction). Students were placed in quartiles, based on their standardized composite score. This scale is most likely more reliable than individual items such as family income. Previous survey research has established certain patterns which emerge again here when race/ethnicity is paired with parent education and income. As found in previous research, Asians are more likely than other ethnic groups to have parents who are college graduates. Hispanic students are more likely than other groups to have parents who did not finish high school. Children who score in the bottom 25 percent on the cognitive test are 10 times as likely as children in the top 25 percent to be in households with parents who did not graduate from high school. The family income of these eighth graders ranges from none (0.4%) to $200,000 or more (0.9%), with a median income of slightly less than $35,000. About 21 percent of students are in families earning less than $15,000. Fifty-eight percent of the students are in families in the middle range of income, with incomes ranging from $15,000 to $50,000, and about 21 percent are in families with incomes of greater than $50,000 (see appendix A for more detailed income breakouts). Black, Hispanic, and American Indian children are disproportionally represented among low income families. Thirty-eight percent of Hispanic youth are in families with low incomes (less than $15,000). Forty-seven percent of black students and 42 percent of American Indian students are in families with incomes of less than $15,000. Family composition has been shown to be associated with family income, test scores, and grades (Milne et al. 1986 andShinn 1971). Students living with both mother and father are more likely to live in households with incomes of greater than $50,000, compared with mother only, father only, mother and male guardian, or other relative or non-relative only. As seen in figure 1.1, students who are in mother-only families are more likely than students in other types of families to be living in low income households (below $15,000). Although, overall, 21 percent of students live in low income house-holds, 53 percent of students in mother-only households live in low income households (table 1.1). Thirty-nine percent of LEP students have parents who did not finish high school, about four times as many as non-LEP's (10 percent). LEP students are more than twice as likely as non-LEP's to live in families with incomes of less that. $15,000. It is evident that student language proficiency is associated with other characteristics related to educational disadvantage."}, {"section_title": "Family Composition", "text": "Living in a single parent family is commonly associated with poverty. The U.S. Bureau of the Census reports that approximately 27 percent of children aged .10-14 were living in households that did not have two parents in 19854 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1986). Table 1.2 displays the percentage of NELS:88 eighth graders living in different types of households in 1988. The first column (single-parent household) is the sum of columns 5, 6 and 7 (mother only, father only, and other relative or non-relative). About 22 percent of NELS eighth graders report living in a single-parent household. About 64 percent of students live with their own mother and father, and another 14 percent live with a mother and male guardian ex father and female guardian, for a total of 78 percent living with two parents. Black students are more likely than other ethnic groups to be in single parent households. Blacks are three times as likely as whites to be in households with only a mother. Asian students are more likely than others to live in households with both their mother and father.  As seen in previous research, socioeconomic status and parent education are related to single-parent-household status. About one-third of students in the bottom 25 percent of socioeconomic status are in single parent families, as compared with only 13 percent of those in the top 25 percent. Low socioeconomic-status youngsters are more likely than others to be in families with a mother only. By contrast, high socioeconomic-status students are far more likely (78 percent) than low socioeconomic-status children (50 percent) to be in a household with both parents (mother and father). One-third of students whose parents did not finish high school are in single parent families, while only 15 percent of those whose parents are college graduates are in single parent families. Students whose parents have college degrees are more likely to be in households with both parents than those whose parents did not finish high school, were high school graduates only, or who only had some college. As seen in table 1.1, students who are living with both mother and father are more likely than students living with mother only, other relative or non-relative only, or mother and male guardian to have parents who are college graduates. Limited-English-proficient eighth graders are more likely than non-limited-Englishproficient students to be living in single parent families. Test achievement is often reported to be associated with family composition, in that students living with both parents are generally found to score higher than those who live with just one parent (Milne et al. 1986;Shinn 1971). NELS:88 students scoring in the bottom 25 percent of test scores are twice as likely as those in the highest 25 percent to be in single parent families (30 percent vs. 15 percent).

They are not calculated based on all the children responding to the survey. It should be noted that eighth graders are fairly reliable reporters of repeating grades. Parent reports of whether the child had been held back a grade were compared with student reports, and there was about 90 percent agreement. Some interesting patterns emerge. Figure  1.2 displays the percentage of eighth graders who repeated at least one grade, by year of birth. The majority of eighth graders (63 percent) turned 14 in 1988. The self-reported age of the eighth grade students ranged from 10 to 18; but very few students turned less than 14 or older than 17 (about 1 percent). The three groups used were: a) students who turned 14 and younger in 1988 (born in 1974 and later); b) students who turned 15 in 1988 (born in 1973); and c) students who turned 16 and over in 1988 (born in 1972 and before). As expected, among those who ever repeated, older students (these born in 1973 or before: 15-and 16-year-olds and older) are much more likely to have repeated a grade, compared with students born in 1974 and later (aged 14 and younger). However, younger students (born in 1974 and later) are more likely than students born in 1973, or 1972 and before to have repeated kindergarten (See appendix A for a distribution of years-ofbirth of these eighth graders). American Indians, Hispanics, and blacks are more likely than Asians and whites to repeat a grade.

Those students with high grades and from high SES families appear to be more likely to be held back in kindergarten, perhaps for maturational or developmental reasons. Among those who ever repeated a grade, students who repeat upper elementary grades are likely to have low grades, limited-English proficiency, or to come from a low SES quartile (which have all been shown to be related to academic problems). In later grades, grade retention is common for academic or cognitive reasons instead of for maturational reasons."}, {"section_title": "Children at Risk", "text": "As we look at various demographic characteristics of these eighth graders, it becomes apparent that some groups of children have higher degrees of risk of school failure. Certain key factors have A Profile of the American Eighth Grader: NELS:88 Student Descriptive Summary been found to be associated with \"at risk\" status. According to Pallas, Natriello and McDill (1989), an \"educationally disadvantaged\" child is one who has been exposed to certain background factors or experiences in iormal schooling, family, or community. These factors, which are not independent, have been shown to be correlated with poor performance in school. Some commonly used predictors of disadvantage which they feel are important to consider are living in a poor household or a single parent family, having a poorly educated mother, and having a non-English-language background. Pallas, Natriello and McDill (1989) Pallas, Natriello and McDill (1989) note that between 10 and 25 percent of children may be classified as disadvantaged, in terms of any one indicator. Although most estimates are between one-fifth and onefourth, some believe as many as one-third of children are at risk. In order to examine how many students are at various degrees of risk, using the six factors mentioned above, the percentage of students with no risk factors, one risk factor, and two or more risk factors was computed. Differences by sex are very small. As expected, race/ethnicity shows differences in rates of risk factors Blacks are more likely than all other ethnic groups to live in a single parent family. American Indians are more likely than Asians and whites to live in a single parent family. Blacks are more likely than all other groups (except American Indians) to be living in a family with low income (less than $15,000 a year).

General self-esteem is seen as \"a liking and respect for myself' (Kanouse et al. 1980)."}, {"section_title": "37", "text": "A Profile of the American Eighth Grader: NELS:88 Student Descriptive Summary As shown in other research (e.g., High School and Beyond), males are more likely than females to show the highest selfconcept levels. Blacks are more likely than whites, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians to score in the high selfconcept group. Limited-English proficiency appears to be related to selfconcept. LEP students are more likely than non-LEP students to score at the lowest self-concept level. Self-concept has been found to be related to students' grades, test scores, and other outcomes (Coleman et al. 1966). It is evident that academic factors relate to general self-concept. Students whose grades place them in the lowest grades quartile are more likely than those whose grades are in the highest grade quartile to have low self-concept scores. As found in research on the High School and Beyond data, those with low postsecondary education aspirations (plan only to finish high school) are far more likely to have a low self-concept score than those who plan to be college graduates. For example, while 36 percent of those planning to graduate from college have a low self concept, 50 percent of those planning only to graduate from high school have a low self concept score. Those who don't plan to finish high school are also more likely than those who plan to be college graduates to have a low self-concept score. \"Locus of control\" is a psychological term which signifies the degree of control one perceives one has over one's life. It indicates the direction in which a person's inner psychological reference point lies, and is located on a scale from high external locus to high internal locus. Table  1.6 also displays the percentage of eighth graders in three categories of locus of control: high external, neutral (that is, neither high external nor high internal) and high internal locus of control groups. In this analysis, about 33 percent of students were classified as having high external locus scores, 33 percent as having neutral locus scores (that is, neither high external nor high internal locus) and 34 percent as having high internal locus scores. Students who have high external locus of control scores tend to rely on external or outside sources. These students may feel they themselves have little control over the direction their lives are going. In addition, they are more apt than others to believe in \"luck\" rather than in planning or effort for getting ahead. Students with high internal locus scores, on the other hand, are more likely than others to 16 39 Socioeconomic status appears to be related to locus of control. Students in the lowest SES quartile are twice as likely as those in the highest SES quartile to show high external locus. Grades also appear to be related to locus of control. Students in the lowest grades quartile are almost three times as likely as those in the highest grades quartile to show high external locus. Postsecondary education plans also appear to be related to locus of control. Those students with no plans to finish high school are more likely than other students to show high external locus. Students planning to be college graduates are more likely to show high internal locus, compared with those who do not plan to finish high school, those who plan to graduate from high school, those planning vocational or trade school, or those who plan to attend some college. Where They Go to School Table 1.7 displays general information about the schools in which eighth graders are enrolled. Eighty-eight percent of all eighth graders are enrolled in public schools, about 8 percent in Catholic schools, about 1 percent in \"independent\" schools, and 4 percent in other private schools (see figure 1.3). The \"independent\" category refers to a group of elite private schools which are members of the National Association of Independent Schools. These schools are primarily non-religious, but include some religious schools. The \"other private\" category refers to private schools that do not classify themselves as either Catholic or independent. The majority of schools in this category are Lutheran, fundamentalist Christian academies, Jewish schools, etc. The NELS:88 school descriptive report (to be released at a later date) will disaggregate the public schools (e.g. urbanpublic, suburban-public, rural-public) in its reporting. It will also discuss student background characteristics for each of the sectors. As noted previously, the number of schools attended by American eighth graders is over 38,000. School enrollment ranges from 6 to 3,940, with a median enrollment of 320. This figure is affected by the 18 41 Overall, 73 percent of the students are enrolled in middle and junior high schools (grades 5-8, 6-8, 7-8 or 7-9). Fourteen percent are enrolled in K-8 schools, 4 percent in K-12 schools, and 8 percent in 7-12 schools (see appendix A for a distribution of numbers and percentages of students enrolled in schools with different grade spans). Figure 1.4 presents a graphic representation of the distribution of grade spans in eighth-grade schools. An interesting enrollment pattern emerges when we compare type of school and grade span. Almost all students enrolled in middle and junior high schools (grades 5-8, 6-8, 7-8, or 7-9) are in public schools (99%). This is in contrast to schools with K-8 grade spans, where public schools comprise only about 41 percent of the total enrollment, and Catholic schools comprise 47 percent. Students in K-12 schools are more likely than those in middle or junior high schools to be in independent schools or in other private schools. Overall, 25 percent of the eighth grade students attend urban schools, 44 percent are in suburban schools, and 31 percent are in rural schools. Rural students overwhelmingly attend public schools (97 percent), while far fewer urban students are enrolled in public schools (77 percent). Students in urban schools are more likely than suburban students and rural students to be in other private schools. Over 90 percent of Hispanic, black, and American Indian students attend public schools. Asian students are more likely than other subgroups to be enrolled in independent schools. Ninety-six percent of the students in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile are in public schools, as compared with only 78 percent of highest SES quartile students. Students in the highest SES quartile are more likely than those in the lowest SES quartile to be enrolled in Catholic schools, independent schools, and other private schools. Almost all students whose parents did not finish high school are in public schools (98 percent). A smaller percentage of those whose parents are college graduates are in public school, compared with those whose parents did not finish high school. Students whose parents obtained master's and Ph.D. degrees are less likely than those with parents who did not finish high school to be in public school. In addition, students with parents who have college degrees are more likely than those with parents who did not finish high school to attend Catholic schools. Students who score in the top 25 percent on the cognitive test are less likely than those who score in the bottom 25 percent of the cognitive test to enroll in public schools. Students who score in the top 25 percent of the cognitive test are more likely than those who score in the bottom 25 percent to attend other private schools.  Chapter 2: Experiences in School School is a major activity in the lives of adolescents. While there have been previous longitudinal studies of high school students, until now there has not been a national study that reports the educational experiences of elementary or middle school students. This is the first time that a nationally representative portrait of eighth graders' academic experiences, participation in extracurricular activities, and perceptions of school climate can be drawn. Chapter 2 covers several major topics, the first of which focuses on school outcomes: test scores and grades. This is followed by an overview of the academic courses commonly taken by eighth graders. The next topic examines student participation in extracurricular activities. The last section centers on student reports of schOol spirit, discipline, and relations with teachers, along with impressions of school safety. Results for reading are somewhat more encouraging than those for mathematics. Figure 2.3 presents the reading-level proficiency profile for all students. Overall, 14 percent of students score below the basic proficiency level, 52 percent are proficient at the basic level, and 34 percent are proficient at the advanced level. The majority of eighth graders can find information in the text, reproduce detail, and comprehend the author's main thought. Other studies (Hig:. & Beyond and NAEP) have shown that performance gaps among races have narrowed over time, particularly for black students.' However, the gaps between racial/ethnic subgroups remain fairly large. The continuing evidence of students' lack of success at high-level skills suggests that changes in academic programs, curriculum, and instruction may be necessary to improve the situation, especially for at-risk students. Tables 2.1 and 2.2, and figure 2.4 show the percentage of students in various racial/ethnic and language groups who are proficient at each mathematics and reading proficiency level. As can be seen in tables 2.1 and 2.2, about 30 percent of students who usually speak Spanish or another non-English language score below the basic proficiency level in math and below the basic level in reading. Few students who usually speak Spanish or another language score at the advanced level in reading. These students may be at high risk of school failure. Interestingly, those who usually speak a language other than English or Spanish are more likely than those who speak English or those who speak Spanish to show proficiency at the 27 50  When socioeconomic status is taken into account, average majority-minority group differences in mathematics and in reading are reduced by about 25 to 30 percent for blacks, Hispanics and American Indians. In addition, students in the top 25% of socioeconomic status are eight times as likely as those in the bottom 25% to show proficiency at the advanced mathematics level (39 percent vs. 5 percent). As seen in figure 2.5, among students in the bottom 25% of socioeconomic st 'us, 18 percent of Asians, 7 percent of w...,es, 4 percent of Hispanics and 2 percent of blacks are proficient at the advanced mathematics level. As seen in figure 2.6, among students in the bottom 25 percent of socioeconomic status, about one quarter of Asians, Hispanics and blacks and 17 percent of whites fail to show basic reading skills. Table 2.3 presents student reports of their grades (categorized into quartiles) from grade six until grade eight by various student background characteristics. Females are more likely than males to report receiving grades which rank them in the highest quartile. Almost a third of females are classified as being in the highest quartile, while only a quarter of the males are in the same group. At the other extreme, only 21 percent of females report receiving grades that classify them in the lowest quartile, whereas 29 percent of males report receiving grades that place them in this same category. Asians were much more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to report receiving grades in the highest grade quartile. American Indians are more likely than Asians to report receiving grades that place them in the lowest quartile. There are differences in grade quartiles with respect to the amount of time students spend on tonework each week. Students who spec el 1 4.) 1/2 hours or more on homework per week are significantly more likely than those spending 3 hours or less to be,classified in the highest grade quartile. A majority (62 percent) of the eighth graders who are classified in the highest test composite quartiles are also in the highest grade composite quartile. Forty-six percent of those students who are in the lowest test composite quartile also report receiving grades which place them in the lowest grade quartile.

This group includes prealgebra, algebra, advanced or honors classes, along with those reporting taking algebra along with a regular math class. Only 5 percent report being enrolled in remedial math. Two-and-a-half percent report taking no math. These figures are presented in table 2.4.9 Gender differences in mathematics course enrollments are small, with about equal percentages of males and females taking each level of math classes. There are, however, some significant differences in course-taking by racial and ethnic groups. Asians report attending advanced math or algebra in higher percentages than other students. There are virtually no differences among blacks, whites, Hispanics, and American Indian enrollments in regular math (Hispanics, 62 percent; blacks, 60 percent; whites, 58 percent; American Indians, 57 percent).

Catholic school students are less likely than other students to be enrolled in regular English classes."}, {"section_title": "What Extracurricular Activities They Participate In", "text": "The school lives of children are not limited to their academic experiences, but include time spent in school-based extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are those clubs, teams, and groups that students generally participate in during the hours before, during, or after school. This section presents some basic findings about student extracurricular activities in school. Table 2.7 shows that the most popular extracurricular activities reported by students are varsity sports (48 percent participating), intramural sports (43 percent participating), band/chorus (40 percent participating), drama/dance (31 percent participating), science fair (28 percent participating), and newspaper/yearbook (22 percent participating). Again, it is important to note that student reports of activities may be inflated. For example, it is unlikely that 48 percent of eighth grade students participate in varsity sports. The notion of \"varsity sports\" at the eighth grade level may not be the same as the perception we have of varsity sports at the high school level. Sports programs have the largest percentage of student participation, with 48 percent of students reporting participating in varsity and 43 perceht participating in intramural sports. Males tend to report participating in these sports more often than females, with 54 percent of males and 42 percent of females reporting participating in varsity sports. This same pattern occurs for intramural sports. Forty-seven percent of males and 38 percent of females report participating in intramural sports. Females are more likely titan males to participate in band/chorus, and drama/dance. Students in the highest grade quartile are more likely than students in the lowest grade quartile to report participating in any of the extracurricular activities. This finding is not altogether surprising, since many schools have regulations that mandate specific'grade requirements for participation in school-based extracurricular activities, and some students in the lowest grade quartiles may be ineligible for participation.   Table 2.8 shows that, for seven indicators of positive school climate, more than 60 percent of the eighth graders agree that their school experience is positive. Eighty percent agree that the teaching in their schools is good. Seventy-five percent feel that the teachers are interested in the students. However, there are some differences in perceptions of school climate with respect to racial and ethnic groups. Blacks are less likely than Asians, Hispanics, or whites to report that students and teachers get along in their schools. Furthermore, blacks are significantly less likely than Asians, Hispanics, or whites to report that discipline is fair in their schools. American Indians are less likely than Asians or Hispanics to report that discipline is fair. A majority of eighth graders agree that their school experience is positive. But some different in perceptions of school climate exist with respect to racial /ethnic groups and students with various behavior problems."}, {"section_title": "MEM11=IIMMIESEifiliir", "text": "Students with grades in the top quartile are more likely than those with grades in the bottom quartile to report that students and teachers get along; that there is real school spirit; that discipline is fair; that the teaching is good; that teachers are interested in students; that teachers praise student efforts; and that teachers really listen to students. Similarly, students who are hardly ever or never tardy or absent generally express more positive school experiences than students who have been absent or tardy more than three times. Students who are never tardy are more likely than those who are tardy 3 or more days to agree with statements that students and teachers get along, there is school spirit, discipline is fair, and teachers really listen to them. In a similar vein, students who are never absent are more likely than those who 42 missed 3 or more school days to report that students and teachers get along, that there is real school spirit, that discipline is fair, and that teachers really listen to them. Independent school students are more likely than public school students to agree that students and teachers get along, discipline is fair, the teaching is good, teachers praise their efforts, and teachers really listen to them. Independent school students also are more likely than Catholic school students to report that discipline is fair, that the teaching is good, and that teachers praise their efforts. One factor that could relate to student motivation, academic performance, and participation in school activities is the general behavior of other students in school and the school's safety climate. Eighth graders were asked to report on various safety-related occurrences in their schools, and an examination of their responses (table 2.9) is enlightening. The five situations students report on were fighting with another student, something being stolen from them, someone offering to sell them drugs, someone threatening to hurt them, and not feeling safe at school. Overall, about one-half of the eighth graders report that something was stolen from them at school. Twenty-eight percent report someone threatened to hurt them, 23 percent admitted they had fought with another student, 12 percent reported they did not feel safe at school, and 10 percent reported that someone offered to sell them drugs at school. These numbers indicate that safety may be a considerable concern in some of the schools eighth graders attend. There are some subgroup differences in perceptions of school safety. Males are more likely than females to report all of these occurrences. The largest difference between the sexes is \"I fought with another student\"--boys are three times as likely as girls to report fights. Safety may be a considerable concern in some of the schools our eighth graders attend."}, {"section_title": "MMIMIllarliIIIIIM", "text": "Students in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile are more likely than students in the highest SES quartile to report the following occurrences: something stolen, fought with a student, don't feel safe, offered drugs.

Interestingly, students in independent schools are as likely as public school students to report that something was stolen from them. Urban students are more likely than suburban students to report fights, 44 67 something was stolen, and that they don't feel safe at school. Urban and suburban students did not differ on \"someone offered to sell me drugs\" and \"someone threatened to hurt me.\" Urban students are more likely than rural students to report they don't feel safe. Rural students are more likely than urban students to report someone threatened to hurt them. Racial/ethnic differences in perceptions of school safety are also apparent.

Figure 3.2 shows how much time students who attend different types of schools watch T.V., do homework, and read material not assigned for school purposes. The amount of time spent on television viewing seems to vary by school type. Students in all types of private schools spend greater amounts of time on homework than public school students. Students in independent schools watch fewer hours of television than those in public schools or those in Catholic schools (See table 3.2.1 in appendix D for percentages)."}, {"section_title": "When Students Come Home From", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "School", "text": "When students come home from school, they return to different environments. A topic of general interest is whether an adult is present when a student returns from school.' Another issue of concern is how many hours a student spends at home without an adult present. The subtle distinction between returning to an empty home and the number of hours one spends alone should be emphasized. Some students may return from school to an empty home, but within an hour or so a family member or other adult will arrive. In other instances, students may return to a home where an adult is present, but that adult may leave after the students enter the home. It is not surprising, therefore, that the results for these two issues are different. With respect to the question of whether an adult is present when the student returns from school, whites and blacks are more likely than Hispanics to respond that there is usually no one home when they return after school (table 3.2). Children of families in the highest SES quartile are almost twice as likely as those in the lowest SES quartile to report that usually no one is home after school. Table 3.2 also shows that children from families in which at least one parent is a college graduate are more likely than those students whose parents did not finish high school to respond that usually no one is home after school. In addition, students from families in which at least one parent has a master's degree or equivalent are more likely than those whose parents did not finish high school to say that usually no one is home after school. As for how much time students spend alone after school, table 3.3 shows the number of hours eighth graders spend at home after school each day with no adult present. Thirteen percent report that they are never at home after school without an . adult present.

The four activities that students report participating in most often are non-school team sports (37 percent), religious youth groups (34 percent), summer programs (19 percent), and hobby clubs (15 percent). Although the percentages of males and females who participate in at least one activity are about the same, there are gender differences in activity selections.

As seen in table 3.5, males are far more likely than females to do lawn work, wait tables, have a newspaper route, or do farm or other manual labor. Females are more likely than males to babysit. Asians and Hispanics are more likely than blacks, whites, and American Indians to have never worked for pay. White students are more likely than most other subgroups to babysit. For most students, eighth grade marks the last year they will attend elementary, junior high, or middle schools, after which they will move into unfamiliar and often larger high schools. It is a time when eighth graders and their parents are faced with making important decisions regarding the type of high school the students plan to attend and the program and courses in which they hope to enroll. These decisions and choices are likely to greatly influence the paths students will follow throughout high school and into their adult lives."}, {"section_title": "56", "text": "As the preceding chapters indicate, eighth graders experience schooling very differently.

But just as taking specific eighth grade courses appears to be associated with certain positive educational outcomes, there are other behaviors, such as absenteeism, tardiness, and grade retention, that are associated with failure to complete high school. This chapter presents some basic findings about student expectations in eighth grade, including the types of high schools they plan to attend, various programs they expect to enroll in, educational goals, and occupational aspirations. These expectations, based on student reports, are described for selected subgroups defined by demographic classifications--such as sex and race--and by other background characteristics--such as parents' education level.

Most of those who do not make this transition at grade 9 will do so the following year, at grade 10. Some families use this transition period to change from private schools to public ones or the reverse. For example, a student who attends a private elementary school may plan to begin his or her secondary school experience in a public high school. As shown in table 4.1 and figure 4.1, 34 percent of Catholic, 12 percent of independent, 34 percent of other private, and 96 percent of public school eighth grade students plan to attend public high schools\u00b0.

Taking advanced math or algebra and foreign language in eighth grade has been viewed by scholars who study high school curricular placements as preparation for high school academic programs (Goodlad, 1984, Oakes, 1985. Although the base year study of NELS:88 cannot determine if such eighth grade course taking behaviors actually lead to differentiated high school placements, the NELS:88 First Follow-up (which traces these students in high school) should be able to determine what effect prior academic behaviors have on high school placement. However, what can be inferred from these data is that students For such an important decision as planning a high school program, students turn to various adults for advice. It is evident that eighth graders discuss their high school program plans with their mothers more than with their fathers, and far more than they discuss such plans with counselors or teachers. Eighth graders are far more likely to discuss their high school plans with their mothers three or more times (52 percent) than with their fathers (31 percent), their teachers (8 percent) or their counselors (6 percent) (table 4.3.1 in appendix D for data). Eighth graders are far more likely to discuss their high school plans with their mothers three or more times (52 percent) than with their fathers (31 percent), their teachers (8 percent) or their counselors (6 percent). Percentages of students who have never discussed ph nning a high school program with various adults (by expected high school program plans) are presented in table 4.5. Those students who are the least certain about their high school program are those most likely not to speak with family or school personnel about such plans. In every case, those planning to enroll in a college preparatory program are more likely than others to discuss their plans. Thus, it would seem that those needing the most direction concerning high school program options are the very individuals least likely to have discussions with those who could give assistance."}, {"section_title": "Educational and Occupational Aspirations", "text": "Even as early as eighth grade, students have some ideas about the type of work they would like to do as adults and how far in school they would like to go. A large number of NELS:88 students (29 percent) aspire to careers in professional, business or managerial occupations. The category which received the fewest nominations (less than 1 percent) is laborer or farm worker. Looking at table 4.6, some clear sex differences can be seen regarding occupational aspirations. Thirty-eight percent of the females aspire to professional careers, whereas only 20 percent of the males indicate that they are interested in professional careers. Regardless of ethnic group membership, many eighth graders aspire to professional careers. Asians (35 percent), however, are more likely than other ethnic groups to express an interest in pursuing a professional career. As parents' education level increases, so does the percentage of students who aspire to a professional career. Forty-three percent of those students whose parents hold post-college graduate degrees (M.A. or Ph.D.) express an interest in professional careers, in comparison to 20 percent of the students whose parents did not finish high school. Students who expect to enroll in a college preparatory program are more likely than students who expect to enroll in a general high school program to express an interest in a professional career (42 percent vs. 26 percent). Students who do not know what type of high school program they would be in are n..ore likely than others to respond that they do not know what type of occupation they want to pursue. The high occupational aspirations of the eighth graders are also reflected in their educational expectations. As table 4.7 illustrates, most eighth graders expect to finish high school, and a two-thirds majority expect to finish college. Over 42 percent of the students expect to graduate from college and an additional 23 percent report that they would attend a higher level of school after graduating from college. About 2 percent of the students believe they will not finish high school, which is considerably lower than national estimates of high school dropout rates. Eleven percent expect to graduate from high school but not continue any further. Slightly under 10 percent expect to go on to vocational, trade, or business school after high school and 13 percent expect to attend college but not graduate.  The high occupational aspirations of the eighth graders are also reflected in their educational expectations. Most eighth graders expect to finish high school, and a two-thirds majority expect to finish college."}, {"section_title": "91", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "11111110111.. MINIMEMMINMEIZIRM", "text": "With respect to selected student background factors, females are more likely than males to expect to attend graduate school. Asians are more likely than all other groups to expect to attend graduate school. Whites are more likely than Hispanics and blacks to respond that they expect only to finish college and not continue. Hispanics are more likely than Asians, blacks, and whites to report they will not finish high school. As in the instance of high school program plans, those students in the highest qitartiles for socioeconomic status, grades, test scores, and self-concept are more likely than those in the lowest quartiles to expect to graduate from college. Students who expect to enroll in a college preparatory or academic high school program are more likely than those who expect to enroll in a vocational/technical program to expect to obtain a college diploma. There is considerable inconsistency between educational expectations and high school program plans. This suggests possible negative consequences for some groups. Although 55 percent of Hispanics expect to finish college and/or obtain a graduate or professional degree, only 23 percent plan to enroll in a college preparatory program in high school. Assuming they follow their expected program plan, many students may find themselves unprepared for college admission. This same pattern occurs for blacks and American Indians. Sixty-four percent of black eighth graders indicate that they expect to finish college or obtain a graduate and professional degree, but only 25 percent plan to enroll in a college preparatory program. Although most of the eighth graders are optimistic about their educational futures, there is a group of students who are tentative about even completing high school (table 4.8). While 83 percent of the students indicate that they are \"very sure they will graduate from high school,\" 16 percent thought they would \"probably graduate,\" 1 percent responded that they \"probably won't graduate,\" and about 1 percent were \"very sure they would not graduate.\" Hispanics are more likely than Asians, blacks, and whites to respond that they probably will not graduate. They are also more likely than Asians and whites to be very sure they will not graduate. With respect to family characteristics, students in the lowest socioeconomic status quartile and those from families with annual incomes below $15,000 are significantly more likely than others to 72 84 Parent education also appears to be related to expectations of not graduating from high school. Students with parents who did not finish high school are less likely than students whose parents were high school graduates to report they will graduate. Other characteristic, of students who feel they are unlikely to graduate include having older siblings who left school prior to high school graduation, being retained in grade at some time during elementary school, and being tardy or absent three times or more in the past 4 weeks from school. Thus, it appears that, before they begin high school, a small number of students think they are unlikely to graduate from high school. There are a number of explanations as to why certain students report that they do not expect to graduate from high school. In this regard, it is interesting to examine the reiationship between the number of risk factors and various school outcomes. As seen in table 4.9 and figure 4.3, as the number of risk factors 1.1creases, the percentage of children with various education problems increases. Students with two or more risk factors are three times as likely as those with no risk factors to score in the lowest cognitive test quartile. Those with two or more risk factors are twice as likely as those with no risk factors to be in the lowest grades quartile. Students with two or more risk factors are twice as likely as those with no risk factors to be absent more than 3 days in the past month. In addition, those with two or more risk factors are six times as likely as those with no risk factors to expect not to graduate from high school. It is evident that at-risk status is related to education outcomes. Students with two or more risk factors are three times as likely as those with no risk factors to score in the lowest cognitive test quartile. In addition, those with two or more risk factors are six times as likely as those with no risk factors to expect not to graduate from high school. It evident that at-risk status is related to education outcomes. in& Looking toward high school, the results of the base year study reveal that the majority of the students have high educational expectations and occupational aspirations. However, some of the students are planning to enter high school programs that may not lead them to realize their goals. Most students do plan to succeed in school. But often, students are simply unaware of the consequences of their program selections and how such selections may place them on certain tracks both in school and in life. Perhaps one way to help students succeed in high school would be to distribute in the middle grades more information on different high school 74 0 0   \"At risk\" status refers to possessing certain characteristics which have been found to be associated with educational disadvantage, or with school failure. The characteristics include (among others) single parent family, low parent education and income, limited English proficiency, and having a sibling who dropped out of high school. 2 . For this analysis, students were grouped into quartiles according to their score on an index of socioeconomic status (SES). Students are divided into groups with high SES (top quartile), medium-high SES (third quartile), medium-low SES (second quartile) and low SES (bottom quartile). The components of the SES index are described in Appendix B -Technical Notes."}, {"section_title": ".", "text": "It is important to note that the base year NELS:88 sampling procedures disqualified many non-English-proficient (NEP) and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. Schools were instructed to disqualify eighth graders who they thought were not sufficiently proficient in English to answer the questionnaire. Thus, those whose English skills were severely limited were eliminated. LEPs who are included in the survey are probably at the high end of the proficiency continuum in terms of skills. A sample of students who were declared ineligible in base year (1988) will be contacted in 1990 and added into the survey in 10th grade. In addition, some new 10th-grade NEP and LEP students will also be added, and a student Spanish-language questionnaire will be made available.\nCategories used here are similar to those used by the Census Bureau. The \"other relative or non-relative\" category is included in the single parent household group, even though technically there is no parent in the home, and this group may possibly include two people (such as grandparents).

For example, students' ability to perform simple mathematical computations has improved, but students fail to show gains in performing higher level problem solving tasks."}, {"section_title": "8.", "text": "The percentages cited in this chapter are based on student reports. It should be kept in mind that student reports of course taking are not as accurate as transcripts. High School and Beyond data indicated that older students (sophomores and seniors) tended to inflate the number of courses they were taking, sometimes reporting several subjectspecific segments of a single course as different courses (see Fetters et al, 1983). It is probable that these younger students have followed the same pattern of over-reporting. To address this problem, transcripts will be collected as a part of the Second Followup of NELS:88. Evidence from teacher reports of course titles of students' math courses indicates that only about 24 percent of the classes taken were algebra, prealgebra, advanced or honors, compared with 32 percent of students reporting taking these classes.

In the first stage of the sampling process, 1,052 schools with eighth grades were used for the NCES-sponsored core sample. In order to ensure a balanced sample, schools were stratified by region, urbanicity and minority percentage prior to sampling. To make the sample more useful for policy analysis, private schools were oversampled. Just under 70 percent of the sample schools are original selections, while 30.4 percent are replacement schools (schools drawn from the same sampling stratum to replace an initial selection that refused). The second stage of the sampling process was the selection of students within schools. In this stage, students who were judged by a representative from the school as unable to complete the survey instruments were identified. Specifically, students identified as mentally handicapped, having physical or emotional problems that would seriously interfere with their ability to complete the survey instruments, or having a language barrier interfering with their completion of the survey instruments were excluded from the sample. About 5.4 percent of the potential sample was excluded for these reasons. Of those students who were excluded, a majority (57%) were excluded for reason of mental disabilities, with most of the rest (35%) excluded for language reasons, and a small number excluded because of physical disabilities (8%). Again for policy analysis reasons, students of Hispanic or of Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI) origin were oversampled. This oversampling was sponsored by the Office of Bilingual Education f-id Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA). On average, 26 students were sampled per school. This two-stage process resulted in the inclusion of over 26,000 eighth graders in the sample."}, {"section_title": "Completion Rates", "text": "Students and their parents participated in the survey in large numbers. A total of B-3 109 24,599 students participated in the survey by filling out questionnaires. A total of 23,700 students completed the cognitive tests. One parent of each sampled student in the public-use sample was asked to fill out the parent survey. Out of 24,599 eligible students, 22,650 parents completed the survey. A written request stated that the questionnaire should be completed by \"the parent who is most familiar with the student's current school situation and educational plans.\" The parent respondent, therefore, was self-selected. Teachers and school administrators Aso participated in NELS:88. Teachers were selected on a pre-assigned basis in two of four subject areas --mathematics, science, English, social studies (history/ government). Each school was randomly assigned to one of the following combinations of curriculum areas: mathematics and English; mathematics and social studies; science and English; and science and social studies. At any school, each sampled student's current teacher(s) in each of the two designed subject areas was selected to receive a teacher questionnaire. This selection procedure was designed to ensure representation of mathematics or science curriculum and English or social studies in all schools. Using this design, the number of teacher respondents was expected to vary depending on the size and structure of the eighth grade at a particular school. An average of five teachers per school participated. Over 5,000 teachers filled out student-specific evaluations for a total of 23,188 sample students. While the teachers were not selected tr, a representative sample, their evaluations of sample students are linked to the specific student records, as are parent and school administrator reports. Finally, the school administrator (principal or headmaster) of each sample school was asked to complete a school administrator questionnaire. A total of 1,035 school administrators completed school questionnaires. The completion rates for the student, parent, and school surveys and the teacher evalua.Jns of students are presented "}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The statistics in this report are population estimates derired from the sample described in the preceding section. Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling error occurs because samples are not populations. However, the nature of the error depends upon the sample design, and the error properties of many types of sample designs (including two-stage designs such as the one used in this study) are well known. Nonsampling error occurs not only in sample surveys but also in population censuses. Nonsampling error may arise from a number of sources, such as the inability to obtain cooperation from each sampled school (school nonresponse), or the inability to obtain information from each sampled student in cooperating schools (student nonresponse). A third source of nonresponse contributing to nonsampling error is found at the item level. Cooperating students may not have answered every question in the survey. In addition, ambiguous definitions, differences in interpreting questions, inability or unwillingness to give correct information, mistakes in recoding or coding data, and other errors of collecting and processing the data can result in nonsampling error. The precision with which one can use survey results to make inferences to a population depends upon the magnitude of both sampling and nonsampling errors. In large sample surveys, such as the NELS:88 study, sampling errors are generally minimal, except when estimates are made for relatively small subpopulations, such as for American Indians (N=315). The nonsampling errors are more difficult to estimate. The major sources of nonsampling error considered were school, student, and item-level nonresponse.  (Sp,,hcer et al. 1990)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Generally, whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. The alpha level is an a priori, statement of the probability of inferring In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics a number of issues must be kept in mind. First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics, may appear to merit special attention. This is somewhat misleading, since the size of the t statistic depends not only on the observed differences in means or percentages being compared but also on the number of respondents in the categories used for comparison, and on the degree of variability among respondents within categories. A small difference compared across a large number of respondents could result in a large t statistic. Second, when multiple statistical comparisons are made on the same data it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference will be erroneously given. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha-level of .05 there is still a 5 percent chance of declaring that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of comparisons increases, the risk of making such an error in inference also increases. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrasts was used (Myers, 1979 "}, {"section_title": "Variables Used", "text": "A number of classification variables have been constructed for analytical purposes. The classification variables presented in this report are based on datafile variables except for a small number of composites that were constructed differently for the purpose of this report. Most composite variables were constructed using responses from two or more questionnaire items. In some cases, composites were constructed from numerous variables from different databases. Others were constructed by recoding a variable. All of the composite variables are described in detail in appendix D of the student datafile user's manual angels 1990). The classification variables that are composites of schoollevel characteristics or of respondent demographic characteristics, the psychological scales; and the educational variables that are used in this report are briefly described in this section. Composites of school-level characteristics provide information about the student's school. GRADE SPAN classifies the type of school by the grades spanned, based on the report of the school administrator (school questionnaire, item 1). After the unique patterns of grade spans were determined, they were collapsed, creating the following categories. The grade span categories are as follows: P or K or 1 through 8 (K-8) P or K or 1 through 12 (K-12) 6 or 7 or 8 through 12 (7-12) 3 or 4 or 5 through 8 (5-8) 6 through 8 (6-8) 7 through 8 (7-8) 7 through 9/8 through 9 (7-9) SCHOOL TYPE classifies the school into one of four sampling strata of public, Catholic, independent, or other private. Some of this information was taken directly from the QED file. QED is a standard school universe file maintained by Quality Education Data, and correlates well with the Common Core of Data maintained by the U.S. Department of Education. The list used for sampling independent schools was the membership list of the National Association of Independent Schools. The School Type categories presented in this report differ from those found on the public use data file. The NELS:88 base year attempted to capture the diversity of private schools through two different schemes of classifying them. The private school sample of NELS:88 comprises diocesan, parish, and religious order controlled Catholic schools; independent schools with no religious affiliation, both members and non-members of NAIS; and other private religious schools, some members of NAIS Both classification schemes appear on the non-public version of the data tape, though for confidentiality reasons only one of the schemes appears on the public-use files. The first scheme classifies schools by their control into public, Catholic, independent (defined as members of the National Association of Independent Schools) and all other private schools. This classifiation was employed in analyses for the student descriptive summary, but does not appear on the public-use files. The second scheme classified schools into public, Catholic, religious other private, and non-religious other private. This classification appears on the NELS:88 base year public-use files. In the two schemes, the public and Catholic school categories are the same, but the remaining private school categories contain somewhat different mixes of schools. SCHOOL ENROLLMENT categorizes the total school enrollment as reported by the school (School questionnaire, item 2). The categories were created by collapsing the data. Missing data were imputed from the actual enrollment reported in the QED file. The categories are: Other composite and special variables. Many of the classification variables constructed were respondent demographic characteristics. SEX and RACE are examples. SEX (male/female) was taken first from the student questionnaire (item 12). If this source was missing or not available, then the sex variable from school rosters was used. Any records with this variable still missing had sex imputed from the respondent's name, or if that could not be done unambiguously, the value for sex was randomly assigned for the purpose of constructing this composite. RACE also was constructed from several sources of information. The first source was the student self-report (item 31A). Secondly, if the student information was missing, data from the parent questionnaire were used. A small percentage of students who used the American Indian/Alaskan Native category but whose parents SES (socioeconomic status) was constructed using the following parent questionnaire data: father's educational level, mother's educational level, father's occupation, mother's occupation, and family income (data coming from parent questionnaire items 30, 31, 34B, 37B, and 80). Educational-level data were recoded as for the composite PARENT EDUCATION. Occupational data were recoded using the Duncan SEI scale as used in HS&B. Each non-missing component was standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Nonmissing standardized components were averaged, yielding the SES composite. For cases where all parent data components were missing (8.1 percent of the participants), student data were used to compute the SES. The first four components from the student data are the same as the components used from the parent data (in other words, educationallevel data, items 34A and 34B, similarly recoded; occupational data, items 4B and 7B of student questionnaire part one, also recoded). The fifth component for SES from the student data consisted of summing the non-missing household items listed in 35A-P (after recoding \"Not Have Item\"), calculating a simple mean of these items, and then standardizing this mean. If eight or more of items in 35A-P were nonmissing, this component was computed; otherwise it was set to missing. All components coming from the student data were standardized. Non-missing standardized components were averaged, yielding the SES composite for those cases where parent data were either missing or not available. The student data were used to construct SES if all components based on parent data were missing and at least one component based on student data was not missing. Otherwise SES was set to missing. items 30 and 31), or if these were missing or unavailable, from student data (student questionnaire, items 34A and 34B). Five or six categories were used to report levels of parent education in this report. FAMILY INCOME was taken only from the parent questionnaire (item 80). Fewer family income categories are used in this report than appear on the data file, and income is presented in two categorizations here. One categorization of family income is as follows: Less than $15,000 $15,000 -$24,000 $25,000 -$34,999 $35,000 -$50,000 Over $50,000 Income is also reported in three larger categories: Less than $15,000; $15,000 -$50,000; and Over $50,000.

These scales are intended to measure LOCUS OF CONTROL and SELF-CONCEPT. Two of the scales, those that correspond most closely to HS&B and NLS-72 items, are used here. Each composite scale is the average of the standardized scores of the questionnaire items of which it is composed. For each scale a quartile ranking was calculated.

Mathematics \"Basic\" level items require the ability to successfully carry out simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers. A typical item format might be to present two quantities and ask the student if the first or the second is larger, if they are equal, or if the size relationship cannot be determined from the information given. The quantities presented might contain arithmetic operations, simple algebraic representations, money or measurements."}, {"section_title": "C-3", "text": "x24 (John has 20 balls. Sue has 45. How many more balls does Sue have than John)? \"Intermediate\" questions require the same basic competencies, plus the addition of mastery of simple operations with decimals, fractions and roots. The \"quantitative comparison\" format described above might be used, or simple word problems. Some examples of items at this level include: 19.823/5.734 4 How many pencils are needed to give y pencils to each of 3 students? \"Advanced\" level incorporates the ability to successfully master simple problem solving tasks. Unlike the other levels, which require the rote application of rules, performance at this level requires conceptual understanding and/or the development of a solution strategy. Solutions may require some experience with geometry, algebra, or a logical process. Typical word problems might ask: To give a statement about the area of a particular geometric figure, given the length of a part, such as a radius or side. To simplify an algebraic expression by combining or cancelling terms. To determine whether quantities expressed in different terms, such as decimals, fractions, and percents, are equivalent. (e.g., 5/5, 1.00, 100%) Assigning students to one of three proficiency categories for Reading (less than basic, basic and advanced levels) and four analogous categories for Mathematics was a straightforward process for the majority of test-takers. Most students answered all, or nearly all of the 21 Reading items and the 40 Mathematics items. Even if a student had omitted one or more items in a 4-item cluster, a pass/fail determination could be made as long as the remaining three items had been answered correctly, or at least two were answered incorrectly. On the Mathematics test, a substantial number of students (about 14%) could not be categorized, the majority because they had omitted some of the items necessary to identify level of proficiency. For about half of these students, it was possible to obtain estimates of the students' skills, using evidence provided by the item C-4   125 clusters that were present, as well as responses to other items in the rest of the test. This procedure was not applied to reading proficiency, since the amount of missing proficiency level data on this test was relatively small. Another condition complicating the assignment of proficiency levels was the presence of \"reversal\" patterns for a small number of students. That is, a student might answer three out of four items at the advanced level correctly, but fail to do so at the basic level that was assumed to underlie higher level skills. Such a reversal pattern might be a result of a few careless mistakes combined with a few lucky guesses, or could be related to lack of motivation. In any case, it would be inconsistent with the building block assumption of the proficiency level model. Students with reversal patterns (about 1% for reading, 5.5% for mathematics) were not included in the summary statistics. Comparison of mean test scores for the \"reversal\" students with those for the sample as a whole indicated that the missing scores were unlikely to have introduced a systematic bias into the national estimates reported in the text.
