Sz may be associated with progressive cortical GMC loss, 9 though cross-sectional studies often cannot disentangle the effects of age and illness duration due to their high correlation. 10 Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is an automated technique which starts with a segmentation of the brain image into voxelwise measures of GMC or gray matter volume (GMV). 11 These measures can then be analyzed with univariate tests to identify clusters of voxels where Sz show gray matter changes relative to healthy subjects. Many large scale studies 3, 12, 13 and meta analyses 7 have established the effectiveness of VBM analyses for Sz research. While both measures are informative, GMC and GMV may actually track different pathological processes; GMC has previously led to more robust and spatially consistent findings than GMV and can be a more sensitive measure in Sz. 14, 15 The univariate analyses on GMC measures show that many subcortical and cortical regions are affected in chronic Sz; however, they do not determine whether subsets of regions show similar patterns of deficits across individuals.\nClustering GMC deficits into spatial patterns can simplify the search for structural biomarkers, combining multiple regions into a single measure. Rather than considering a single region or subregion in isolation, identifying regions that show similar patterns of GMC loss is an efficient dimensional reduction in the space of potential biomarkers. 16 Source-based morphometry (SBM) is a multivariate extension of VBM utilizing spatially independent component analysis to obtain patterns of common GMC variation among participants. 17 This multivariate technique can improve sensitivity by parceling noise and scanner effects into separate components, 5 and by reducing the number of corrections for multiple statistical tests. Two previous SBM studies identified 5 17 and 4 5 spatial patterns that showed group differences in sample sizes of 240 17 and 635 participants, 5 respectively; these components comprised the bilateral temporal lobes, thalamus, basal ganglia, parietal lobes, and frontal/temporal regions. Determining that these multivariate methods can be used in large, aggregated datasets will be a practical step in exploring genetic influences, disease or medication effects, or possibly identifying areas that exhibit similar developmental trajectories.\nThe recent spurt in collaborative studies and the need to combine images from multiple sites (ie, an aggregated dataset) in order to increase statistical power 3, 5, 18, 19 have encountered several challenges, due in part to inherent methodological differences in scanners and imaging parameters. 18, 20, 21 Most multisite imaging studies, particularly in Sz, have combined a relatively small number of sites (fewer than 10). 3, 5, 17 Large scale multisite integration has been successfully achieved for Alzheimer's and Huntington disorders in ADNI (30 sites) 22 and PREDICT-HD (32 sites), 23 respectively. However, these studies were prospective, requiring sites to collect data based on an agreed-upon protocol. We present the first Sz study that integrates legacy structural imaging data from across a broad selection of international sites in a single analysis.\nA prominent issue in multisite Sz studies is the use of different scales for assessing psychotic symptoms. Three commonly used scales are the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). 24, 25 Combining these scales is necessary for collaborative multisite research. Recent work 26 provides equations for converting symptoms ratings between scales, enabling us to perform a unified analysis in the present report.\nThe current article addresses some of the above issues by aggregating a very large dataset from 23 sites (1720 participants) and using SBM analysis in order to determine spatial patterns of GMC differences in Sz. We also performed a VBM analysis on the aggregated dataset to observe the overlap of spatial regions between both methodologies. This work also determines the relationship between regions showing group differences and symptom severity scores. We present the SBM technique as an effective framework for the integration of multisite data to obtain spatial patterns showing diagnostic group differences, thereby bringing this approach into the realm of the larger mega-analytic VBM studies."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject Demographics", "text": "Each legacy dataset including diagnosis, age at time of scan, gender, illness duration, symptom scores, and current medications when available, was shared by each research group according to their site's protocols. Thorough details regarding the samples have been published in the studies cited in the supplementary appendix 1. The majority of Sz were on antipsychotic medications, either typical, atypical, or a combination. All Sz were clinically stable at the time of scanning. A total of 936 structural MRI images of Ct (mean age = 34.81, SD = 11.89, range: 13-80) and 784 Sz (mean age = 36.65, SD = 11.62, range: 17-64) from 8 independent studies (several being multisite) formed the aggregated dataset, which totaled to 23 scanning sites. The study-wise demographics are given in table 1. All studies were collected under local institutional review board oversight and all participants provided informed consent.\nAll studies used the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis for DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR to confirm a diagnosis of Sz or schizoaffective disorder. Four studies rated symptoms using the PANSS, while the rest used SANS/SAPS scales as indicated in table 2.

According to the methods presented in references 3, 5, 17 , images were normalized using a 12-parameter affine model to the 152 average T1 Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, resliced to 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm, and segmented into gray, white, and cerebral spinal fluid images using the unified segmentation algorithm 11 of SPM5 (http://www.fil. ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/). We used the same standard preprocessing pipeline from our previous studies 3, 5, 27 which included several of the current datasets. While there may be distortion differences across scanners, we had observed that preprocessing (ie, usage of modulated or unmodulated data) does not have a strong effect on SBM spatial patterns in our previous study. 27 Outlier GMC images were identified based on correlations to both a study-specific template and an averaged GMC map 3 from all studies. Outliers were then visually checked, corrected, and resegmented where possible, and removed in cases where correction was not possible. The sample sizes presented in table 1 are those images which passed the quality assurance methods. Age and gender affect GMC 5, 17, 28, 29 and thereby SBM components. The effects of intersite differences also need to be considered; multisite structural studies have reported differences between sites, though not interactions between site and diagnosis, age, gender, or other variables. 3, 30 Our initial analyses presented in Cota et al 31 indicated that linearly regressing age and gender from the images prior to SBM analysis can make the results more sensitive to group differences, while site effect estimates can be noisy for small datasets. Thus we regressed out age and gender of the images voxelwise prior to further analysis, while site and site by diagnosis terms were included in the VBM and SBM analyses models. A full width half maximum Gaussian kernel of 10 mm was used to smooth the images prior to the VBM and SBM analyses, as suggested in previous studies."}, {"section_title": "2,3,32", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SBM Analysis", "text": "In spatial independent component analysis, 17 each subject's data is decomposed into a linear combination of components or patterns and normalized loading coefficients (ie, the weighting of each component in each subject's data).

A prior study has conducted a comprehensive overview of this algorithm's strengths and limitations. 17 The number of components was set to 30 as in earlier work, 5, 17 and we used ICASSO (20 runs) to determine the stability of the components. 5 The SBM decomposition was performed on the aggregated dataset consisting of 784 Sz and 936 Ct from 23 sites. Artifact components were identified visually and not included in subsequent analyses. To confirm the robustness of these findings, we also performed separate SBM decompositions on each study's dataset. A larger loading coefficient for an individual or group indicates that the spatial pattern is more strongly weighted in the data for that individual or group. However, the interpretation of the loading coefficient difference depends upon the spatial image of the component. If the spatial component is predominantly positive, and if the loading coefficients are greater in Ct than in Sz, we infer that GMC is greater in Ct for the spatial component under consideration.\nWe examined the differences in loading coefficients from Sz and Ct participants using SPSS. 33 A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) model was used with SBM coefficients as dependent variables, diagnosis as a factor, site as a dummy-scored covariate, and site by diagnosis as an interaction.

We addressed the effects of imaging heterogeneity due to multisite acquisition by using a uniform preprocessing pipeline for the GMC images, with careful quality assurance, and by including site and site by diagnosis terms in the model. The SBM analysis grouped the GMC changes into 9 independent spatial components, while VBM analyses identified 1 massive cluster of GMC loss across the entire cortex. These components are areas of interrelated GMC differences, potentially identifying regions affected similarly by pathology, development, or environmental effects. Seven of the identified SBM components showed less GMC in Sz, while 2 components (brainstem and cerebellum regions) had increased GMC in Sz. VBM identified the brainstem component showing greater GMC in Sz, but not the cerebellum regions which were delineated by SBM. No spatial patterns of GMC difference were related to the measures of symptom severity.\nWe found the largest GMC difference between diagnostic groups in the network including the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and insula (ie, component 1 in figure 1 ). This primary pattern unifies the findings in several previous VBM meta-analysis studies 2, 6, 7, 9 into a single network. The regions identified by the VBM metaanalysis of Glahn et al 7 as decreased in Sz are also identified in this analysis, but in the SBM analysis they are grouped into networks combining the insula with superior temporal regions and inferior frontal gyrus, while the cerebellum, vermis, and inferior temporal gyrus are grouped into separate networks. This primary pattern of inferior frontal/insular regions, medial frontal, and superior temporal GMC loss has also been identified in our previous smaller SBM studies with partially overlapping data. 5, 17 In one study 5 we also investigated the familiality of SBM components in sibling pairs, and an estimated 43% of the variance in the loadings for this component was attributable to the sibling relationships. Given the reproducibility and familiality of this component, we foresee enough motivation for this to be used as a potential endophenotype in future imaging genetics studies.\nOur analysis showed 2 spatial patterns where Sz had greater GMC than Ct. The first, component 3 in figure 1 , primarily covered the pons, extending into the ventral tegmental area. This is a region which can be noisy and subject to artifact, including possible breathing and heart rate differences, insofar as those affect a structural image. Alternatively, this area of increased GMC does overlap with the ventral tegmental nuclei responsible for dopamine production. These nuclei could be enlarged due to the illness, as increased release of dopamine in the striatum has been demonstrated in Sz independent of antipsychotic treatment. 36 Chronic exposure to dopamine D2-blocking therapeutic agents, the norm in our sample, may have resulted in miniscule compensatory increases in GMC around some brainstem regions. VBM results (for contrast Sz > Ct) also showed this region, with the overlap from both analyses depicted in supplementary appendix 5. Component 6 in figure 1 , which covered the cerebellar regions, also showed greater GMC regions in Sz as observed in previous VBM studies. 37, 38 However this region was not observed in our VBM analysis and did not show a trend toward significance in replication across studies (supplementary appendix 2), and thus should be interpreted with caution. We also observed abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis in component 5, with Sz showing less GMC as previously reported. 39, 40 With recent studies pointing to neuroanatomical evidence of closed-loop connectivity between prefrontal cortex and the cerebellar regions, [41] [42] [43] the understanding of these distributed network interactions may be critical to understanding Sz.\nThe observed 4th component extended up the posterior midline of the brain and was possibly artifactual. To confirm that this component captured the actual variation in the brain shape and had not merely identified participants who were poorly segmented, we examined images corresponding to the largest and smallest coefficients (3 in each case are depicted in supplementary appendix 6). In participants with the largest loadings, the posterior lobes had more GMC (their hemispheres filled the back of the brain more tightly), whereas the participants corresponding to the smallest loadings had larger gaps in the posterior midline. Thus, it appears this component captured true regional differences in posterior GMC.\nWhile the analysis of positive and negative symptom severity did not show any relationship to either univariate or multivariate GMC loss in this sample, this may be due to differences in the implementation of these measures across sites and datasets. As an aggregation of legacy datasets, the data were collected at different times and without cross-study standardization in symptom assessment, which may have increased variation. However, the constructs of positive and negative symptoms are fairly broad and diffuse, capturing variable treatment response patterns. It is possible that since most of the Sz were many years into the disease, these questionnaires yield no additional information on brain structure variation. However, the relationship between these volumetric patterns and individual variation in more granular symptom measures (eg, disorganized thoughts vs hallucination severity), or individual cognitive deficits still needs to be explored in datasets for which those measures are available.\nAs is a common caveat in this work, all the Sz were on antipsychotic medications, and in certain datasets the amounts and history of dosage were not recorded. Further exploration of the interaction between medication dosage and duration of illness, in datasets where those measures are available, is needed for more nuanced analyses of these multivariate patterns of GMC loss. This kind of multisite mega-analysis highlights the need for standardized phenotyping. Availability of standardized chlorpromazine equivalents as well as common cognitive and clinical batteries would make the analysis easier and much more informative.\nIn summary, SBM is an effective technique delineating distinct and consistent anatomical brain regions that show difference between healthy Ct and patients with Sz. We have identified that the cortical, brainstem, and cerebellar areas of gray matter loss form highly replicable patterns across studies, and are not related to global measures of symptom severity. The regions of gray matter loss formed networks of anterior temporal, insular, and medial prefrontal regions, as well as parts of the frontal cortex, posterior brain regions, and several separate brainstem and cerebellar networks. These patterns of spatial components could serve as endophenotypes for Sz, indicating regions which are affected similarly by common causes such as genetics, disease progression, or medication. Future work may involve investigating differences between Sz subgroups as well as comparing patient subgroups with typical and atypical medication use, and finding associations between these imaging endophenotypes and genetic variability.
