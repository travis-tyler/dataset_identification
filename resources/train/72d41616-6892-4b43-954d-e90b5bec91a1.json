[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Hurricanes cause billions of dollars in property damage along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States [3]. After accounting for changes in purchasing power, population and wealth, recent studies find that average annual hurricane damage in the US for the 73 years ending in 1997 is $5.2 billion [8]; furthermore, increasing coastal development exacerbates potential damage [9]. Although the extreme rainfall associated with tropical weather causes upstream flood damage, as evidenced by the recent flooding in North Carolina due to hurricane Floyd [5], storm surge flooding is of greater concern for coastal property owners. Coastal building codes are designed to protect property against storm surge flooding. However, some property owners make improvements beyond code to provide added protection. These improvements include house elevation on fill or pilings, levee and floodwall construction and house relocation. Given recent hurricane strikes in Wilmington, NC -Bertha, Fran, Bonnie, Dennis and Floyd -we investigate the costs of storm surge mitigation for individual property owners in that region. We find: (1) least-cost improvements vary with storm surge depth, foundation type, and new versus retrofit construction; (2) the incremental benefits of structural improvements, in terms of damage reduction, are increasing in improvement expenditures; and (3) the least-cost response to a given storm surge level is to either purchase no structural defenses (beyond building code requirements) or to purchase enough structural defenses to prevent all damage--\"all-or-nothing\" purchase behavior. Furthermore, we show that hurricane strikes at particular locations are such low probability events that the expected benefits from defensive expenditures (beyond building codes) may not justify even least-cost improvements."}, {"section_title": "II. Storm Surge and Flood Depth per Hurricane Category", "text": "We consider a new residential structure located in Wilmington, NC, that conforms to 1999 building codes. The 2,150 sq. ft. (1 sq. ft. = 0.0929 sq. m.), one-story, wood frame home with vinyl siding is valued at $140,000. The structure includes 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a 2-car garage. The home's contents are valued at 70% of s tructure value, or $98,000. The property is located within five miles of the ocean, but is far enough inland to escape direct wave action in the event of storm surge flooding. We assume that the structure rests on a 3-foot (1 ft. = 0.3048 m.) crawl space. This home is typical of new construction in the area. The house sustains potential flood damage as a result of storm surge--extreme coastal tide levels associated with hurricanes. Specifically, we define storm surge as the increase in mean water level above mean sea level (MSL). Expected storm surge levels are closely associated with hurricane wind speed intensity. The National Weather Service (NWS) Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model [4], computes the approximate relationship between tropical weather wind speed and storm surge. The SLOSH model relationship, calibrated for Wilmington, NC, is given by: where SS is Storm Surge measured in feet above MSL and WS is maximum sustained wind speed measured in miles per hour (1 mph = 1.609 kph). This relationship is depicted in Figure 1. We use the Saffir-Simpson scale to categorize tropical weather intensity from tropical storm to category 5 hurricane based on maximum sustained wind speeds. Using the SLOSH model relationship in equation 1, Table 1 shows also the approximate storm surge depth at the study location for each hurricane category. Storm surges are determined using the midpoint wind speed of each category.   "}, {"section_title": "III. Storm Surge Damage", "text": "Absent structural improvements beyond building code requirements, both the structure and its contents suffer flood damage in the event of a \"Cat 4\" or a \"Cat 5\" hurricane. As a given flood depth typically causes a greater percentage loss to contents than to the structure itself, we develop separate relationships for both structure and contents damage.

These activities include house relocation, house elevation on fill or pilings, and levee and floodwall construction. This section outlines the assumptions used to estimate implementation costs for each activity. Since costs depend on foundation type, we present also the implementation costs for a slab foundation. Costs are generally higher for slab than for crawl-space foundations."}, {"section_title": "House Relocation", "text": "Given a structure 33 ft wide and 66 ft long, or 2,150 sq. ft., and assuming a relocation site within five miles, the relocation cost for a home built upon a crawl space foundation is $27/sq.

We assume a tenfoot desired clearance between the house and the base of the floodwall and a maximum floodwall height of 4 ft (due to hydrostatic pressure constraints). Its cost is $85.00 per foot of center-line circumference for a 2-foot high floodwall and $124.00 per foot of circumference for a 4-foot high floodwall. We assume one, 12-ft. opening (with removable barrier) in the floodwall at a cost of $73.00/sq. ft. of opening base area."}, {"section_title": "Elevation on Fill", "text": "We consider elevation on fill prior to home construction [10].

Least Cost Damage Reduction", "text": "Property owners choose between the various structural improvements to achieve a given  The width and height of many structures relative to utility line height and roadway width restrict off-site relocation activities. We assume that off-site house relocation is not a feasible option for the case study structure. In addition, we assume that existing structures, including our representative home, cannot be raised using fill dirt. Thus, the least-cost activities for our crawl space home are represented by the bottom envelope of points in Figure 3a, with the points for activities \"Fill\" and \"Relocate House\" excluded.    For the purpose of illustration, assume that an owner expects a category 4 hurricane strike to occur with probability 1 (this assumption will be relaxed in the next section).

In this range, if the owner makes defense expenditures of c f \u2032, he incurs a net cost equal to Area I in Figure 5. Thus, the owner prefers zero expenditure to any other expenditure level in the range (0, c f \u2032). Notice next that MB increasingly exceeds MC over expenditure range (c f \u2032, c f *); hence, the owner prefers an expenditure level of c f * to any other expenditure level in this range. The net benefit of expenditures from c f \u2032 to c f * is given by Area II. As the owner prefers zero expenditures in the range (0, c f \u2032), and as the owner prefers c f * expenditures in the range (c f \u2032, c f *), he chooses between only these two expenditure levels; the choice is \"all or nothing.\" If Area I is greater than Area II, then zero expenditure is best. If Area I is less than Area II, then expenditure "}, {"section_title": "VI. Expected Net Benefit Analysis", "text": "We now investigate purchase decisions under realistic strike probabilities. Table 2 provides National Weather Service's (NWS) HURISK model estimates of tropical weather strike probabilities and associated wind speeds for Wilmington, NC [6,7]. These estimates are based on the century of hurricane strikes from 1900 to 1999 (including 1999 storms Dennis and Floyd) and are consistent with probabilities based on observed tropical weather strikes [1]. Even though the annual probability of a hurricane strike somewhere in the U.S. is relatively high, the annual probability of a particular location experiencing severe tropical weather is quite low. We now conduct an expected benefit analysis using the HURISK probabilities. We be treated as annual \"savings\"; these savings become a 6% \"return\" on the $3,076 investment. As this level of \"all or nothing\" defense costs almost $40,000, the owner does not choose this option. Requiring a higher rate of return further lowers the value of the protection; a 7% \"return\" requirement yields a present value of the cat 4 protection of only $2,637. If the owner fully defends against a category 5 hurricane, expected damages fall to $0 annually. The present value of cat 5 defenses, however, is only $3,247 ($194.82/0.06). However, these defenses cost $54,567, and the owner does not choose this option. Under the most generous assumption of complete destruction of the home and its contents in either a category 4 or 5 hurricane which amplifies the value of surge protection, expected annual hurricane storm surge damages are still very low ($604.52 + $23.80 = $628.32). Assuming also that the cheaper cat 4 defenses defend completely against both cat 4 and cat 5 damages, the value of cat 4 defenses is only $10,472 ($628.32/0.06), and the owner opts not to defend. In this most accommodating scenario, the cost of capital must fall to 1.58% for the owner to consider defensive purchases."}, {"section_title": "VII. Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Hurricane storm surge causes tremendous property damage, and increasing coastal development exacerbates future damage. We investigate the cost-effectiveness of coastal home improvements designed to mitigate this damage. We show how least-cost improvements vary with hurricane intensity, foundation type, and new versus retrofit construction. We develop and parameterize storm surge damage reduction functions for a case study property in Wilmington, NC, the site of several recent hurricane strikes. We find that the marginal (incremental) benefits of structural improvements, in terms of damage reduction, are increasing in improvement expenditures. Because marginal benefits increase, a property owner engages in interesting \"all-or nothing\" behavior. In other words, an owner facing a hurricane strike of given intensity purchases either no structural defenses or purchases enough structural defenses to fully protect the property. As hurricane strikes for any particular location are low probability events, the expected benefits of structural improvements beyond building codes may not justify the costs, even if flood insurance is unavailable. The owner may be better off investing the money elsewhere and using the proceeds to repair any storm surge damages that arise. Although representative, our results may not hold strictly for all property types and locations. Regional differences in hurricane probabilities, topography, home design, and building codes imply differences in flood damage-reduction functions. Hence, cost-effective structural defenses likely differ from region to region. Finally, these results may not hold for the extremely risk-averse individual; we are currently investigating the effects of risk aversion on mitigation behavior."}]
