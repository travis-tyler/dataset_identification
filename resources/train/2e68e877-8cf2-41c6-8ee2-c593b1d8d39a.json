After successful clinical recovery, the patient led an exemplary adult life that involved higher education achievements, philanthropy, and community service. When the patient was in her early 60s, however, her family members reported to clinicians that she was experiencing memory loss and other cognitive deficits. Genetic screening (30X, Illumina HQ, San Diego, CA, 2013) indicated that the patient was APOE-negative, although her genome did feature single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with presenilinencoding genes (PSEN1, PSEN2), which are recognized as having a putative role in familial AD (Lalli et al., 2014; Mathews et al., 2000) .\nClinical abnormalities were also observed on resting and task-oriented electroencephalographic recordings, suggestive of remnant morphological damage. Prior neuroimaging assessment using 1.5 T MRI over two occasions (Table 1) showed that Patient IH had experienced considerable percentage increases in the volume of the ventricular system over the roughly 3-year period during which symptoms of cognitive decline became noticeable by her close relatives."}, {"section_title": "| Neuroimaging", "text": "Patient IH provided informed consent and underwent brain imaging using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI-2) neuroimaging protocol in a General Electric 3 T MRI scanner located at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The MRI protocol consisted of four sequences: (1) inversion-recovery spoiled gradient echo T1-weighted structural MRI, (2) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI, (3) gradient recalled echo T \u00c3 2 MRI, and (4) 64-direction DTI. Resting-state functional MRI was also collected, but we have chosen to defer analysis of this sequence to a later exploration. Here, we focus specifically on analyses of the T1 structural and DTI imaging data. The details of the ADNI-2 neuroimaging protocol are described in Jack et al. (2010) , while various applications and a review of results obtained from this multisite trial are given in Weiner et al.

We then assessed the overall pattern of connectivity density across the brain of Patient IH against these groups using a posteriori Bayesian probabilities of group membership (see Rencher, 2002, for description) . Finally, we sought to assign Patient IH to the most likely group via chi-square \"goodness-of-fit\" test to enable us to classify her into one or more of the ADNI-2 patient cohorts and, thus, infer upon her a computational \"diagnosis.\" In goodness-of-fit testing, one seeks the smallest v 2 statistic when comparing across classes-thus, the largest probability for a particular comparison based on probabilistic similarity. In other words, this reflects the probability of a subject \"belonging\" to that particular group. This is in contrast to the more familiar seeking of a large v 2 statistic against the associated degrees of freedom (and small P value), suggesting departure from the theoretical expectation (Johnston, Berry, & Mielke, 2006; Kvalseth, 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "| R E S U LTS", "text": "The results of Patient IH's neuropsychological evaluation revealed no areas of significant cognitive or intellectual impairment (Table 2) Interestingly, the left pallidum was noted to be $47% larger than the right pallidum; such a large asymmetry is rare in healthy adults, though it has been observed frequently in patients with chronic TBI and dementia (Gooijers et al., 2016) .

Neuropsychological assessments indicated an intelligent woman presenting no major deficits for her age but with minor weaknesses in executive function and divided attention, which might simply reflect normal age-or stress-related variation.\nUsing structural and diffusion neuroimaging, we parcellated the brain and computed its interregional DTI connectivity. Our analyses find Patient IH's brain morphometry and connectivity most similar to those of patients from the ADNI cohort classified as having EMCI. Several points of discussion are worth considering relevant to Patient IH and our analyses of her neuroimaging data."}, {"section_title": "| Altered brain morphometry in Patient IH", "text": "Patient IH was noted here to exhibit cavum septum pellucidum, altered left temporal gray matter, frontal lobe white volume asymmetry, and a greater volume of the left than the right pallidum. Cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) variations are common in neurological patients (Akinola, Idowu, & Nelson-Paseda, 2014) and have been intermittently reported in retired professional athletes (Bodensteiner & Schaefer, 1997; Bogdanoff & Natter, 1989; Casson, Viano, Haacke, Kou, & LeStrange, 2014) . In a study by Silk et al. (2013) , there was no difference in the presence of CSP between patients with TBI and controls; however, there was larger and more severely graded CSP in the patient group, with the size of the CSP correlated positively with injury severity.\nPatient IH was unconscious for 2 weeks following her injury, suggesting a particular and sufficient level of severity. Greater degenerative white matter alterations have been reported in pediatric TBI patients (Keightley et al., 2014) , where lowered white matter integrity may be more important in the pathophysiology of brain injury than indices of gray matter change, macroscopic lesions, and injury severity (Max (Wilde et al., 2005) ; however, temporal lobe injuries may not be associated with greater levels of anxiety (Vasa et al., 2004) . Finally, subcortical volumetric alterations are frequently reported in TBI (Gooijers et al., 2016) , are notable in MRI of pediatric head injury cases (Wilde et al., 2007) , and can affect cognitive processes such as proactive inhibition (Hermans et al., 2016) . Such alterations in this case, thus, are not uncommon with regard to other reported TBI studies in young and adult samples, and Patient IH's injury was likely the initiation of a process culminating in eventual cognitive decline later in life."}, {"section_title": "| Age as an important factor in TBI recovery but eventual cognitive decline", "text": "Outcome from TBI is a function of age at injury ( show cortical thickness changes measured using MRI at 3 and 18 months following injury in contrast to children with orthopedic injuries (Wilde et al., 2012) . TBI in animal models has suggested increased motor and cognitive deficits in rats suffering injuries earlier in development, in contrast to greater anxiety in rats injured during adulthood (Rowe et al., 2016) . So while structural and connectomic injuries may be clinically recoverable, their residual effects may be expressed later in life as cognitive decline. As such, an improved integration of major clinical and scientific effort needs to be made to improve any potential for posttraumatic recovery after TBI in neonates and young children (Maxwell, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "| Brain reserve capacity", "text": "Patient IH did not present pathological levels of cognitive decline despite subjective reports from herself and her family. Indeed, she showed above-average to superior performance on many of the measures assessed. Brain reserve capacity (BRC) refers to preinjury quantitative measures such as brain size that relate to outcome (Bigler & Stern, 2015) . Higher degrees of BRC imply threshold differences when clinical deficits will become apparent after injury, where those individuals with higher BRC require more pathology to reach that threshold. CR, more specifically, pertains to how flexibly and efficiently the individual makes use of available brain resources even in the presence of advancing age (Whalley, Deary, Appleton, & Starr, 2004 ). The CR model suggests that the brain actively attempts to cope with brain damage resulting from TBI by using preexisting cognitive processing approaches or by enlisting compensatory approaches (Nunnari, Bramanti, & Marino, 2014 (Cheng, 2016; Henderson, 2014; Sakka, 2015; Moussard, Bermudez, Alain, Tays, & Moreno, 2016) . Most research on BRC and CR has taken place in aging and degenerative disease (Sobral, Pestana, & Paul, 2015) , but these concepts likely apply to the effects of TBI, especially with regard to recovery (Bigler, 2014; Miller, Colella, Mikulis, Maller, & Green, 2013; Scheibel et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2014; Sumowski, Chiaravalloti, Krch, Paxton, & Deluca, 2013) . Because increased incidence of TBI occurs in those under age 35, both CR and BRC factors likely relate to how the individual copes with TBI over the life span. Mild to moderate TBI during childhood, during a time of maximal neural plasticity, may show sufficient recovery when exposed to highly educational and psychosocial encouraging environments (Beauchamp & Anderson, 2013; Max et al., 1999) . Such factors may be particularly relevant to the timing of cognitive decline in an individual who has sustained a TBI earlier in life, in contrast to an older adult suffering affected cognition as a consequence of head injury.

This approach is distinguished from machine learning classification since we wish to compute a \"distance\" between the observed values obtained from Patient IH against those expected from each ADNI patient cohort relative to underlying random classification error to obtain a probabilistic statement about group membership (Boyle, Flowerdew, & Williams, 1997; Choi & McHugh, 1989; Fisher, Marshall, & Mitchell, 2011; Reijneveld, 1990) .\nRelated methods have been widely applied in neuroimaging voxel pattern analysis (Walther et al., 2016) , structural connectivity (Gupta et al., 2015) , and functional MRI time series data (Friston et al., 2008) . While machine learning methods might also have been appropriate here (e.g., Apostolova et al., 2010) , this approach serves a parsimonious purpose In general, Patient IH's brain morphometry and white matter connectivity density were determined to be statistically most similar to those of patients having been diagnosed with EMCI as indicated under the ADNI-2 study protocol. This agrees with what has been documented about MCI (Celsis, 2000) and its potential connections with TBI earlier in life (Plassman & Grafman, 2015) . Still, the use of computational approaches for subject classification in this manner has important implications for the proactive utilization of neuroimaging data from leading databases for such purposes. It is important to note, however, that while the role of early-life TBI on neurocognitive changes in later life is an important topic, a number factors beyond Patient IH's injury could also be at play over her lifetime, which complicates making broad sweeping statements about her experience compared with those of other TBI sufferers. However, such subject classification approaches may be useful for providing key insights into the distinctions between patients having early versus later-life TBI and the clinical outcomes thereof."}, {"section_title": "| C O NC LU S I O N S", "text": "Examining the long-term effects of early-life TBI, especially in cases of apparent recovery, may take on particular importance as the brain ages.
