[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Studies of how scientific and engineering knowledge affects the economy focus on the impact of research and development (R&D) spending, and/or new ideas embodied in patents, on the productivity of firms. The majority of scientists and engineers in industry, however, do not perform research in corporate laboratories nor obtain patents that lead to commercially successful products or processes. Most scientists and engineers work in establishments that produce goods and services, on activities that are not classified as formal R&D. Although the pathway that links scientific and technological knowledge to lowering production costs or introducing new or improved products is critical to economic growth, we know little about the contribution of production establishment-based scientists and engineers to productivity. Helper and Kuan's (2016) interviews and surveys of firms in the automobile supply chain show that engineers outside of formal R&D find ways to lower costs and develop new products/ processes, often working with customers and/or production workers. To see whether the employment of scientists and engineers at production establishments contributes to productivity broadly, we create a new establishment-firm-employee data set for manufacturing. We combine data from the quinquennial Census of Manufactures (CM)  Household Dynamics (LEHD) database that links every worker to their employing establishment. Appendix A provides details on how we link workers and establishments across data sets to construct a measure of the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment level, and how we construct a firm level measure of R&D employment. We focus on manufacturing for three reasons. First, manufacturing is a lead sector in productivity growth. Between 1990 and 2016 the average annual rate of labor productivity increased at 3.5% per year in manufacturing compared to 2.0% in the entire economy. 2 Second, industrial R&D and employment of scientists and engineers is disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing. While manufacturing establishments employ 10% of the work force in industry, they employ 20% of scientists and engineers in industry, 3 and manufacturing firms employ over 60% of R&D scientists and engineers in industry. 4 Third, data from the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of Manufactures allow us to analyze production and total factor productivity in manufacturing establishments. A key statistical issue for our analysis is that we are able to link 17% of workers in our manufacturing establishments to Decennial Census or CPS data in order to identify their occupation. We estimate the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment from the sample of Decennial/CPS matched workers at each establishment. The absence of data on occupation for most of the workforce at each establishment creates measurement error in estimating SEP at the establishment. Measurement error is particularly severe for smaller establishments, and can substantially bias downward estimates of the effect of SEP on establishment outcomes in production function analysis that take each establishment as an observation. We address this issue in three ways: 1) restricting our analytical sample to establishments that have at least 10 workers that match to Decennial/CPS, and at least 50 in total employment, thus removing establishment observations with the largest likely measurement error; 2) estimating regressions that weight establishment observations by the number of Decennial/CPS matched workers; and 3) adjusting estimated establishment SEPs toward the overall mean SEP via a James-Stein type of adjustment that depends on the variance of the establishment SEP estimate (James and Stein, 1961). Our main finding is that there is a substantial positive relation between the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of workers at an establishment, and establishment productivity and employee earnings. And the estimated effect is substantially larger and better identified with corrections for measurement error. The paper is divided into four parts. Section 1 documents the phenomenon that motivates our analysisthe fact that most scientists and engineers work in goods and service producing establishments and engage in non-R&D work activities. Section 2 provides cross section and fixed effects estimates of the production function relationship between establishment output and the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment. Section 3 uses person-job level data to provide cross section and fixed effect estimates of the relationship between the earnings of individual workers and the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at their establishment. Section 4 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Scientists and engineers at goods and services producing establishments", "text": "The impetus for this study is the fact that most industrial scientists and engineers work at goods and services producing establishments, and work in activities other than formal R&D. We document this fact with data on the number of scientists and engineers, from the person-level Current Population Survey (CPS) and American Community Survey (ACS) and from the establishment-level Occupational Employment Survey (OES), combined with data on the number of R&D scientists and engineers from the firm-level Business Research Development and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). 5 We also use data on work activities of scientists and engineers from the person-level Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) produced by the National Science Foundation. Table 1 provides our estimates of the number and proportion of scientists and engineers in total, and working in R&D and non-R&D activities in 2013. Line 1 shows the total number of scientists and engineers employed in industry, based on data from the person-level CPS and ACS and from the establishment-level OES. The numbers are fairly similar. The CPS shows the highest number of scientists and engineers, the ACS shows 8% fewer scientists and engineers, and OES shows 3% fewer than the ACS. 6 Line 2 shows the number of R&D scientists and engineers from the firm-level BRDIS. Line 3 computes the number of scientists and engineers working in non-R&D activities by subtracting the Line 2 number from the Line 1 numbers. Line 4 computes the ratio of the number of scientists and engineers in non-R&D activities to the total number of scientists and engineersabout 80 percent of industrial scientists and engineers work outside of formal R&D activities."}, {"section_title": "[ TABLE 1 ]", "text": "We complement these estimates with tabulated data from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) on the work activity of industrial scientists and engineers. SESTAT reports 3.808 million scientists and engineers (excluding social scientists) in industry in 2013 7a figure short of the figures in Table 1. The primary reason for the lower figure is that SESTAT data exclude persons with less than a bachelor's degree. SESTAT provides information on the primary and secondary work activity of scientists and engineers, differentiating among five activities: research and development, teaching, management and administration, computer applications, and other. In 2013, 29% of scientists and engineers indicate that their primary work activity is R&D, and 61% indicate that their primary work activity is non-R&D. Tabulating both primary and secondary work activities, we find 15.3% of scientists and engineers indicate that both their primary and secondary work activities are R&D; 15.7% indicate R&D as primary activity and something else as secondary; 24.5% indicate R&D as secondary activity and something else as primary; and 44.5% indicate that both their primary and secondary activities are non-R&D. To compute a single statistic for scientist and engineer full-time equivalent (FTE) work time engaged in R&D activities, we assume that three-quarters of a worker's FTE time is engaged in the primary work activity, and one-quarter of FTE time is engaged in the secondary work activity. With this assumption on worker FTE time allocation to primary and secondary work activity, we find that the average of scientist and engineer FTE time engaged in R&D activities is 33.2%, so two-thirds of industrial scientists and engineers FTE time is engaged in non-R&D activities. Since SESTAT data exclude persons with less than a bachelor's degree working as scientists and engineers, who are more likely to work in non-R&D activities compared to bachelor's graduates, the proportion of FTE time for all scientists and engineers in non-R&D activities certainly exceeds the estimate of two-thirds. Because the industry classification of workers are not comparable across the person-level CPS and ACS, establishment-level OES, and firm-level BRDIS surveys, we cannot combine data from the different surveys to estimate the proportion of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D versus non-R&D activities in disaggregated manufacturing or non-manufacturing industries. To compare estimates across surveys, we tabulate the number of scientists and engineers in manufacturing from the CPS, ACS, and OES. The two person-level surveys gave comparable estimates: in 2013, from the CPS we find 1.48 million scientists and engineers in manufacturing, and from the ACS we find 1.39 million. From the establishment-level OES, by contrast, we find only 0.95 million scientists and engineers in manufacturing establishmentsjust 64% of the CPS figure and 69% of the ACS figure. 8"}, {"section_title": "Scientists and engineers proportion of employment at establishments", "text": "To study the relationship between scientists and engineers, and output and productivity, at establishments, we need to estimate the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment level. 9 To estimate SEP at establishments, we link workers in the LEHD to the 1990 or 2000 Decennial Census, or the CPS in 1986-1997, to identify the occupation of workers for the matched sample of workers. Our matched sample of manufacturing workers constitutes 17% of all workers in establishments observed in the Census of Manufactures or Annual Survey of Manufactures over the years 1992-2007. We use the matched sample of workers to estimate the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at each establishment. See Appendix A for additional description of the data construction procedure. Our estimate of SEP at the establishment is subject to two forms of measurement error. The first form of measurement error relates to our measure of the occupation of workers. We identify a worker's occupation as the occupation indicated in the year that we observe the worker in the Decennial Census or CPS. If we observe a worker in more than one year of the Decennial Census or CPS, we use the observation from the most recent year, and in fact, most of our matches are from the 2000 Decennial Census. Our establishment production function analysis covers the years 1992-2007. To the extent that workers change occupation from a scientist/engineer occupation to some other occupation, or from some other occupation to a scientist/engineer occupation, during the time period of our data, we may mismeasure the occupation of workers in our sample. The second form of measurement error in our estimate of SEP is sampling error associated with the number of matched workers that we have at an establishment. The fewer the matches, the greater is the sampling error. The sampling error will be large in establishments with few employees, but can also be substantial in establishment with a greater number of employees. For example, an establishment with 25 employees and a worker match rate of 17% would have information on occupation for 4 matched workers. If the establishment has one scientist/engineer, the true SEP is 4%. But with a matched sample of 4 workers, the estimated SEP would be 0% or 25%. For our establishment production function regression analysis, we take three different approaches to address sampling error in our estimate of SEP at the establishment. First, we focus our regression analysis on a restricted sample of establishments with at least 10 matched workers 10 and with total employment of at least 50 employees, thereby available to us to link to Census establishment-level production data. Fairman et al. (2008) show that such a link is possible. 10 The count of matched workers from the LEHD is for a pseudo-establishment defined by EIN-state-countyindustry, so it may not be exactly comparable to total employment of the establishment from the Census of Manufactures or Annual Survey of Manufactures. purging the sample of observations with potentially huge measurement error. Second, we estimate weighted regressions, with observations weighted by the square root of the number of matched workers at the establishment. Third, we apply a James-Stein type adjustment to the estimated SEP that shrinks the estimated SEP for an establishment toward the mean value of SEP over all establishments, with the shrinkage factor depending on the variance of the estimated SEP at the establishment. While we focus on SEP as our key independent variable, we also use the matched worker sample to estimate the average years of education of workers at the establishment level. This allows us to differentiate between the scientists and engineers proportion of workers at the establishment, and average years of education of workers at the establishment, in our production function regression analysis. The measurement error issues relating to estimating the proportion of scientists and engineers also apply to the estimation of the average years of education of workers at the establishment. Our approaches to address sampling error in estimating SEP apply similarly to our estimate of the average years of education of workers at the establishment. Table 2 shows the mean value of selected variables for the full sample of all manufacturing establishments in our CM/ASM data, for the \"Matched\" sample of establishments with one or more workers matched to the Decennial/CPS, and for the \"Restricted\" sample of establishments with 10 or more workers matched to the Decennial/CPS and with total employment of 50 or more. Appendix A describes the construction of our analytical data set for manufacturing establishments."}, {"section_title": "Manufacturing establishments data set", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "[ TABLE 2 ]", "text": "The full sample includes over 1.3 million establishment-year observations over the period 1992-2007. The matched sample includes 506,800 establishment-year observations, and the restricted sample has 215,800 establishment-year observations. The mean values of log gross output and log employment in the matched sample are somewhat larger than in the full sample, while these mean values in the restricted sample are substantially larger. The proportion of establishments that belong to R&D performing firms, and the mean value of R&D worker share of firm employment, are similar for the matched sample and full sample, and larger in the restricted sample. The average production worker share of employment at the establishment level is similar in all three samples. Using the matched worker sample, we produce our measure of the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment. The mean value of SEP is 0.038 in the restricted sample, which is our main regression sample. For comparison, we also produce a broader measure of the scientists and engineers and science/engineering technicians proportion of employment at the establishment. The mean value of this measure in the restricted sample is 0.061. In our regression analysis, we find that estimates using the broader measure of scientists and engineers and science/engineering technicians are similar to our main estimates using the SEP variable. Table 2 also presents the mean of average years of education of workers at establishments. The last two columns of Table 2 compare establishments in R&D and non-R&D performing firms. Previous studies find that R&D (usually measured as a stock of knowledge by accumulating R&D spending over time) is associated with higher productivity (Griliches, 1998;Hall, 2005;Hall et al., 2009). In our data, establishments in R&D performing firms have higher gross output, higher employment, lower production worker share of employment, higher average years of education of workers, and higher scientists and engineers proportion of employment."}, {"section_title": "Scientists and engineers in the establishment production function", "text": "If scientists and engineers at production establishments help implement technical advances that increase productivity, through improved production processes or improved products, then in our manufacturing establishments data set, we expect to find that the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment is positively associated with establishment productivity. We estimate the following establishment production function With our panel data set, we also estimate an establishment fixed effects version of equation 1, which uses time variation in SEP and other variables within establishments to estimate their effect on establishment output. Table 3 presents the estimated coefficients for the establishment production function regression model. Column 1 shows the estimate using the Matched sample of all establishments, with no treatment for measurement error in the variables for scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment and average years of education of workers at the establishment. The positive and significant 0.079 estimate for the effect of SEP on log gross output indicates that even in the likely presence of large measurement error in SEP, establishments with higher scientists and engineers proportion of employment have higher total factor productivity. The estimated coefficients on the standard factor inputsemployment, capital equipment and structures, materials, and energyare all reasonable in magnitude and consistent with constant returns to scale in the production function. The estimated effect of average years of education of workers is positive, consistent with evidence that human capital is related to productivity."}, {"section_title": "[ TABLE 3 ]", "text": "The next three columns in the table show estimates using the Restricted sample of establishments, i.e., establishments with 10 or more workers matched to the Decennial/CPS and with total employment of 50 or more. This addresses the issue of measurement error in the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment, and the average years of education of workers, by dropping observations where measurement error is likely to be exceptionally severe. This reduces the sample size of establishments by almost 60%, but the dropped establishments account for only 10% of the workers, because the distribution of establishments by employment follows a power law with many establishments employing just a few workers and a smaller number of establishments employing many workers. 11 Column 2 shows that using the Restricted sample more than doubles the estimated coefficient on SEP, and more than triples the estimated coefficient on average years of education of workers, compared to Column 1, which indicates that measurement error is indeed a substantive issue for analysis. Column 3 adds variables for whether the firm is an R&D performing firm, and the R&D scientists and engineers proportion of employment at the firm. The estimated coefficients for both of the firm-level R&D variables are positive. The estimated coefficient for SEP is smaller compared to Column 2, but is still substantial at 0.132. Finally, Column 4 presents the estimates for the production function regression model with establishment fixed effects. This model removes any unmeasured cross-sectional establishment factors related to SEP and output productivity that would bias the estimate of the effect of SEP on output. Using only within-establishment variation in the regression variables, the fixed effects model provides our strongest test of the relation between scientists and engineers proportion of employment and output productivity at the establishment level. In Column 4, the estimated coefficient on SEP is 0.055, considerably smaller than in Column 3, and the estimated coefficient on average years of education of workers is diminished by even more in proportional terms. Given that measurement error produces smaller estimated coefficients in longitudinal regressions than in cross-sectional regressions (Freeman, 1984), the smaller estimates in the fixed effects regression are not surprising, and provides additional indication of the presence of measurement error."}, {"section_title": "Methods for Addressing Measurement Error", "text": "The first method we use to address measurement error in SEP and average years of education of workers is to use a weighted regression, where we weight observations in our production function regression by the square root of the number of matched workers at the establishment. Since the sampling error of both variables depend inversely on the square root of the number of matched workers, this weighting procedure gives more weight to establishments with more precise estimates of these variables, and less weight to establishments with less precise estimates, and should thus provide a better estimate of the effect of SEP on output. Table 4, Column 1, presents the weighted regression estimates for the OLS model in the Restricted sample. The estimated coefficient on SEP increases by a factor of 1.71 (= 0.226 / 0.132) compared to the unweighted regression in Table 3, Column 3. The estimated coefficient on average years of education of workers increases by a factor of 1.13 (= 0.043 / 0.038). Table 4, Column 2, presents weighted regression estimates for the establishment fixed effects model. Table 3, Column 4, the estimated coefficient on SEP more than doubles from 0.055 to 0.121. The estimated coefficient on years of education of workers also doubles from 0.004 to 0.008. 12"}, {"section_title": "Compared to", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "[ TABLE 4 ]", "text": "The second method we use to address measurement error is to apply a James-Stein type \"shrinkage\" adjustment to the estimated SEP for an establishment, which pulls the estimate toward the mean SEP in the entire sample, depending on the variance of the estimated SEP. Building on Mairesse and Greenan (1999), in our method, described in Appendix B and in Barth et al. (2017), we calculate the ratio of the variance of estimated SEP at an establishment to the observed variance of SEP across all establishments. A large ratio indicates that sampling error in estimated SEP is large relative to the variation in SEP across establishments. We use this variance ratio to adjust the estimated SEP at an establishment toward the mean SEP over all establishments. We replace each establishment's estimated SEP with a weighted average of its estimated SEP and the mean SEP over all establishments in the data. The weight given to estimated SEP is smaller if sampling error of estimated SEP is larger, and the weight given to mean SEP is commensurately larger. The same procedure is applied to adjust the estimated average years of education of workers at the establishment. Table 4, Columns 3 and 4, present the regression estimates for the OLS model and establishment fixed effects model, using the Restricted sample, and applying the James-Stein shrinkage adjustment to SEP and average years of education of workers. In Table 4, Column 3, for the OLS model, the estimated coefficient on SEP is 0.437, which is 3.31 (= 0.437 / 0.132) times larger than the comparable estimate in Table 3, Column 3. The estimated coefficient on average years of education of workers is 0.054, which is 1.42 (= 0.054 / 0.038) times larger than the comparable estimate in Table 3, Column 3. For the establishment fixed effects model, in Table 4, Column 4, the estimated coefficient on SEP is 0.373, which is dramatically larger than the comparable estimate of 0.055 in Table 3, Column 4. The estimated coefficient on years of education of workers is 0.005, which is only marginally larger than the comparable estimate of 0.004 in Table 3, Column 4. Table 4 present regression estimates using the Matched sample of all establishment, and applying the James-Stein shrinkage adjustment to SEP and average years of education of workers. The estimated coefficient on SEP in the OLS model is 0.154, which is almost double the comparable estimate of 0.079 in Table 3, Column 1. The estimated coefficient on SEP in the establishment fixed effects model is 0.147, which is very close to the OLS estimate of 0.154. Tables 3 and 4 show that the different methods for addressing measurement error in the SEP variable all lead to larger estimates for the effect of SEP on output in the establishment production function. We conclude that the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment has a substantial positive impact on output productivity at the establishment, in our data for manufacturing establishments in 1992-2007."}, {"section_title": "The last two columns in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "In sum, the regression estimates presented in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Establishment scientists and engineers, and earnings of workers", "text": "If the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment is positively related to productivity at the establishment, then we may expect that it is also positively related to the earnings of workers at the establishment. A positive relation between SEP and worker earnings would result if new technologies implemented by scientists and engineers at the establishment complement worker skills in production, 13 or if employers share economic rents from implementing those technologies or products with workers through higher pay. The standard earnings equation regression model in labor economics relates individual workers' log earnings to their human capital and demographic attributes. To assess the effect of SEP on worker earnings, we augment the standard earnings equation with SEP at the establishment and R&D scientists and engineers proportion of employment at the firm. We estimate the following workers' earnings regression model:  This sample of 11,666,200 person-year observations corresponds to the 215,800 establishmentyear observations in the \"Restricted\" establishment sample presented in Table 2. The mean value of SEP in the worker sample, 0.063, is greater than the mean value of SEP in the establishment sample, 0.038, because larger establishments with more workers have higher SEP. The last three columns in Table 5 compare workers who in our panel have work history in R&D firms only, in both R&D and non-R&D firms, and in non-R&D firms only. Workers with work history in R&D firms only, have higher earnings, more years of education, and work in establishments with more employees and higher SEP, compared to workers with work history in both R&D and non-R&D firms, or non-R&D firms only. [  Table 6 presents the regression estimates for the log earnings equation augmented by SEP and other establishment-level and firm-level variables. In Column 1, using the Matched sample, the estimated coefficients on the human capital and demographic variablesyears of education, years of work experience, gender, and raceare similar to typical estimates in standard earnings equations. The estimated coefficient on scientist or engineer occupation is 0.150, so scientists or engineers earn 15% more than other workers. The estimated coefficient on SEP is a substantial 0.582. In Column 2, using the Restricted sample, the estimated coefficient on SEP increases to 0.638, presumably due to reduced measurement error in SEP in the Restricted sample. In the OLS model, the 0.638 estimated effect of SEP on earnings in Table 6 is larger than the estimated effect of SEP on productivity in Tables 3 and 4, which ranges between 0.132 and 0.437, in the Restricted sample. 14 We consider the possibility that the relation between SEP and earnings may be affected by dual causality that produces a selectivity bias in the estimate. Establishments choose which workers to make job offers to, and workers choose which job offers to accept, so part of the positive association between SEP and earnings could be due to selectivity in employer and worker choices rather than the effect of science and engineering on the earnings of a given worker. The natural way to control for this selectivity is to estimate a fixed effects model which identifies the effect of changes in SEP on the same worker. In our data, there are two distinct ways that SEP can change for a given worker. An employer can change SEP over time, which affects workers who stay at the establishment. Or a worker can move between establishments with different levels of SEP. Given the different impetus for change in these situationsan employer-initiated change vs. a worker-initiated changewe estimate fixed effects models separately for job stayers and for job changers. Table 6, Column 3, presents estimated coefficients from a fixed effects analysis of job stayers, defined as person-year observations for a worker at an establishment in two or more continuous years, where changes in SEP are within the establishment over time. Table 6, Column 4 presents estimated coefficients from a fixed effects analysis of job changers, defined as personyear observations for a worker before and after a change in establishment, where changes in SEP are due to the change in employer. There is a large difference between the two fixed effects estimates for the coefficient on SEP. For job stayers the coefficient on SEP is a modest 0.010, while for job changers the estimated coefficient on SEP is 0.184. Workers benefit mainly by changing jobs and moving to establishments with higher scientists and engineers proportion of employment, and not from their employer raising the scientists and engineers proportion of employment at their current work establishment. Comparing the fixed effects estimate of the impact of SEP on earnings for job stayers at an establishment with the fixed effects estimates of the impact of SEP on productivity at the establishment, we find that increasing the scientists and engineers proportion at the establishment has a much greater impact on productivity than on earnings. From Tables 3 and 4, the fixed effects estimate of the impact of SEP on productivity, in the Restricted sample, ranges from 0.055 to 0.373, which are much larger than the 0.010 estimate of the impact of SEP on earnings of workers who are job stayers at an establishment."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Linking data on science and engineering occupations of workers, firm R&D activity, establishment production, worker earnings and job mobility, we find that goods producing establishments with relatively many scientists and engineers have higher productivity and worker earnings than those with few scientists and engineers; and that the results hold up in fixed effects analyses that compare the productivity of the same establishment over time. A plausible interpretation of the results is that production establishment-based scientists and engineers help implement the adoption of new technologies and products at workplaces. In addition, we find that earnings of workers are higher at establishments with higher proportions of scientists and engineers, but that the positive relation between earnings and scientists and engineers proportion of employment is mainly due to workers moving to establishments with higher numbers of scientists and engineers, rather than existing establishments increasing the proportion of scientists and engineers. Our estimates of the effect of scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment on productivity at the establishment are substantially strengthened when we apply methods to address measurement errors due to sampling variance in the estimate of the variable SEP. Given that most industrial scientists and engineers work at goods and services producing establishments and that most of that work is not in formal R&D activities, our analysis suggests that there is much to be learned from extending studies of the economic effects of R&D on the economy to the effects of scientific and engineering work more broadly. Further study using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques could illuminate the link between R&D and non-R&D scientists and engineers and economic performance beyond our foray into this area: ethnographic studies of the work activities of production establishment-based scientists and engineers compared to those of other high-level professionals in bringing new processes and products to the market; statistical analysis of non-manufacturing industries where scientists and engineers increasingly play an important role in implementing information technology and other new technologies; and analysis of the endogenous decisions of firms to employ more or fewer scientists and engineers over time and to allocate them to R&D or non-R&D activities.

The \"Restricted\" sample of workers are all workers in the LEHD that match to the Decennial Census (1990,2000) or Current Population Survey (1986-1997, and also match to the \"Restricted\" sample of manufacturing establishments presented in Table 2. Worker earnings, gender, race, and age are from the LEHD. Years of work experience is constructed from worker age and education. Worker occupation and education are from the Decennial Census or Current Population Survey. See Table 2 for definition of scientist or engineer, and description of establishment-level and firm-level variables. Dependent variable is Ln(Earnings). The \"Matched\" sample of workers are all workers in the LEHD that match to the Decennial Census (1990,2000) or Current Population Survey (1986-1997, and also match to the \"Matched\" sample of manufacturing establishments presented in Table 2. The \"Restricted\" sample of workers are all workers in the LEHD that match to the Decennial Census (1990,2000) or Current Population Survey (1986-1997, and also match to the \"Restricted\" sample of manufacturing establishments presented in Table 2. OLS models include fixed effects for year (1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007), industry (6-digit NAICS), and geographic region (metropolitan or micropolitan Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as defined in 2009 by U.S. Office of Management and Budget, or Economic Area as defined in 2004 by U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis). Job Stayers model includes fixed effects for year. Job Changers model includes fixed effects for year, industry, and geographic region. All models also include years of work experience squared, and interactions of female with years of work experience, years of work experience squared, and nonwhite race. Regression coefficients are shown with one, two, or three stars indicating statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, or 1% level, respectively. Standard errors are shown in parenthesis. 1997, to persons in the LEHD over 1992-2007 We first match persons between the LEHD and the 2000 Census. For those who do not match, we match to the 1990 Census, and for those who still do not match, we match to the CPS in 1986-1997. Using this procedure, we are able to create a matched sample of persons in our LEHD data for 30 states with varying year coverage over 1992-2007. This method identifies occupation and education for 17% of all workers in LEHD employer reporting units that link to CM and ASM establishments in 1992-2007. Since our match identifies education and occupation of persons in 1990 or 2000 from the Decennial Census, or in 1986-1997 from the CPS, while our LEHD persons data covers the years 1992-2007, our matched sample of persons will miss younger workers or new entrants to the labor market to some extent. Using the matched sample, we estimate the scientists and engineers proportion (SEP) of employment at the establishment, and the average years of education of workers at the establishment. Finally, to measure the extent to which the parent firm of establishments conducts R&D we use the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD). The SIRD is an annual survey of firms, including a certainty sample of large R&D firms and a non-certainty sample of other firms. We use the SIRD panel of firms in 1977-2007 to construct our measure of R&D S&E employment as a share of total employment at the firm-level. For each firm in the SIRD panel, we fill in missing years of R&D employment share with the nearest non-missing year available for the firm. We link the firm-level SIRD data to the establishment-level CM/ASM data. For CM/ASM establishments in firms that do not appear in any year of the 1977-2007 SIRD panel, the firm-level R&D employment share is set to zero. From analysis of SIRD sample firms over the period, we conclude that we have reasonable coverage of smaller R&D performing firms. Our full sample of establishments observed in CM/ASM over 1992-2007 includes all establishments with total employment of 5 or more. Our regression sample of establishments includes all establishments with 10 or more workers matched to Decennial/CPS, and with total employment of 50 or more. Our regression sample of workers comprises all persons working in their \"main job\" in LEHD employer reporting units that link to our regression sample of CM/ASM establishments. We calculate the reliability of variable X jt as \u03bb(n jt, N jt ) = 1 -(1 -n jt /N jt ) (1/n jt ) ( where V is the observed sample variance of X jt over all establishment-years. 16 We note that \u03bb varies with n jt and N jt ; reliability increases with the number of matches at the establishment, whereas, for a given number of matches, reliability decreases with the employment size of the establishment. James-Stein estimators (James and Stein, 1961) shrink estimates based on small samples toward some appropriate global value because the small samples have high sampling errors. Stein (1956) proved that while this yields a biased estimator of a value it can reduce the variance of a model that uses the estimator. The intuition for the effect can be found in the problem of predicting the future productivity of a baseball player who has no hits in four at bats on the first day of the season while players on average have batting averages around 0.280 (i.e., they get hits 28% of the time). Given the small sample of four at bats it would be unrealistic to estimate the player's future batting average as 0.000. A better prediction for the rest of the season would be to take a weighted average of the small sample and the overall batting average of ball players or some other global average, such as the player's lifetime average or average over hundreds of at bats in the previous season. This approach is related to empirical Bayesian methods (see Efron, 2010, Chapter 1). In our case, a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator of X jt is given by Z jt = \u03bb jt X jt + (1 -\u03bb jt ) X , where X is the global mean and 1 -\u03bb j is a shrinkage factor that diminishes the role of the observed value and pulls it towards the global mean. As the estimated variance of X jt increases, the shrinkage factor approaches unity, and the shrinkage estimator of X jt approaches the global mean X. variances of variables assuming the matched sample is drawn with replacement, whereas our calculation treats the matched sample as being drawn without replacement and therefore adds a correction factor for the finite sample. 16 More generally, in our implementation, we compute V as the variance of residuals from an establishment regression model for X jt that includes covariates. For our establishment fixed effects model, to account for covariance between person observations over time, our computation of V* includes an additional term, that is, one minus the harmonic mean of k j /K j across establishments, where k j is the average number of years that unique persons are observed at establishment j during the panel, and K j is the number of years that establishment j is in the panel; and we compute V as the variance of residuals from an establishment regression model for X jt that includes establishment fixed effects and no other covariates.
