Introduction", "text": "There is considerable evidence that a student's cognitive skills affect his/her future personal income and that in the aggregate these skills affect future national income Woessmann, 2008, and Breton, 2011] . In response to this evidence, a growing number of countries regularly test their students in national and international examinations to determine their skills. One of these examinations is the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Figure 1 shows the average test scores in mathematics in 4 th and 8 th grade for a subset of the countries that participated in TIMSS 2007 [Mullis, Martin, and Foy, 2008] .\nThe average international score was 500. A score of 400 is considered a low benchmark for acceptable mathematics skills on this test [Foy and Olson, 2009] . As shown in the figure, students in developing countries typically do not perform well on these tests [Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008] . As an example, the imputed TIMSS 2007 average score in mathematics for the Colombian 4 th grade population is 355, which is considerably below the low benchmark of acceptable skills. In addition, the distribution of Colombian student scores indicates that 95 percent score below 500\n[ICFES [2010] .\nScores in 4 th and 8 th grade are highly correlated. In countries where students have low average scores in 4 th grade, many drop out of school, and those remaining have low average scores in 8 th grade. Since skills in mathematics are cumulative, deficiencies in 4 th grade are an obstacle to later learning. The end result is that upon completion of secondary school, only a very small fraction of students are qualified to pursue careers that require a strong foundation in mathematics.\nWhile schools and teachers are often blamed for low scores, studies across countries consistently show that family characteristics, such as the education level of the parents and family income, are an important determinant of student achievement [Parcel and Dufur, 2009] . Due to the limited educational opportunities historically for most children in developing countries, most parents have little education and little income. These limitations adversely affect their children's achievement in school.\nSchool and teacher characteristics and teaching methods also affect student achievement, and in the near term changes in these characteristics are the only option potentially available to raise students' skills. But despite the enormous number of studies that have been carried out, there is a surprising lack of consensus about the schooling characteristics that contribute to student achievement. The empirical results from these studies vary between developed and developing countries, between countries within these groups, between primary and secondary schools, between studies that include different sets of characteristics, and between studies that use different statistical techniques to quantify effects.\nTeachers generally believe that they can improve student achievement if the size of classes is reduced, but a very large number of empirical studies have shown that this generally is not the case. Eric Hanushek, alone and in conjunction with other researchers, published numerous articles between 1986 and 2003 in which he presented evidence that increases in school resources, typically through a reduction in class size, do not improve student achievement in either developed or less developed countries [Hattie, 2005] . As a consequence, the number of recent articles that examine the effect of class size on student achievement is quite small.\nIronically, in his more recent publications and studies, Hanushek, along with others, presents evidence that class size in primary school, and particularly in mathematics, does affect student achievement. In a very recent meta-analysis of studies performed since 1990 in developing countries, Glewwe, Hanushek, Humpage, and Ravina [2011] report that most of the studies that they find acceptable (26 out of 47) and most of the studies they deem to be of highest-quality (five out of only eight) find evidence that larger classes adversely affect student achievement and other school characteristics, such as teacher education, teacher experience, and the availability of computers generally do not. Their findings indicate that researchers should take another look at the effect of class size on student achievement in elementary school in developing countries, since reductions in class size may be one of the few available policy options that may reliably raise students' skills.\nIn this paper I present the results from my analysis of the effect of changes in class size on Colombian student achievement in 4 th grade mathematics. I control for the many other family and school characteristics that could affect student learning, but they are not the focus of my analysis.\nI decided to study the effect of class size on student achievement in 4 th grade mathematics in Colombia because class size hugely affects the cost of education and because a priori the available evidence strongly suggested that the large classes in 4 th grade most likely were contributing to the low scores in these classes. What was this evidence? First, Juerges and Schneider [2004] report that the positive effects from smaller classes are found mostly at the primary level. Second, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain [2005] average test scores by about 80 points, or two points for each additional student in the class. The implication is that a much higher share of students would achieve scores above 400 if classes were smaller.\nOn the other hand, it seems likely that changing the class size in 4 th grade alone would not be sufficient to substantially raise existing scores. Given the lack of controls for achievement prior to 4 th grade and the likelihood that most students were previously in classes of a similar size prior to 4 th grade, these estimates likely measure the cumulative effect of class size on student achievement during grades one to four.\nAnother important finding from this study is that a substantial fraction (22%) of the TIMSS 2007 data on class size in Colombia were misreported. Many teachers reported the total number of 4 th grade students they taught in two classes as their estimate of class size. Estimates of the effect of class size on test scores using these data are negative but not statistically significant. In contrast, estimates of the effect of class size on achievement that exclude the misreported data, or that use the number of students taking the test as the measure of class size, are much larger and have a high level of statistical significance.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the methodology used in the analysis. Section III presents the results. Section IV concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. Methodology", "text": "A common approach for evaluating student achievement is to estimate a student\u00b4s test score (TS) as a function of the student's personal and family characteristics, the teacher's characteristics, the teaching methods employed, and the characteristics of the school environment (X j ):\n(1) TS j = \u03b1 0 + \u03a3 \u03b1 j X ij + \u03b5 i\nIn this paper I estimate various versions of this model, with class size included as one of the characteristics of the school environment.\nEach study of student achievement differs with respect to the structure of the tests, the type of data collected, and the methods used to collect the data. TIMSS 2007 provided a variety of tests to students and then estimated the score each student would have received on a uniform test. Due to the uncertainty in this estimate, TIMSS provides five plausible values for each student's test score. Details on the creation of these data are provided in Olson, Martin, and Mullis [2008] .\nTIMSS 2007 collected additional data using questionnaires provided to the student, the teacher, the director of the school, and a national expert on the curriculum.\nThe questions included in these questionnaires are provided in IAEE [2007] . In this paper I include variables that utilize data obtained from the first three questionnaires.\nThe sample of schools participating in the TIMSS 2007 evaluation was stratified to improve the evaluation of the effects of the learning environment in less common categories of schools. The TIMSS 2007 data set includes sampling weights for use in the statistical analysis so that estimates of the effect of different characteristics on student test scores are representative of the Colombian school population. I estimated all of the models using weighted least squares (WLS) and these sample weights.\nI estimated the models using STATA 10 after conversion of the data format from SPSS to STATA. I utilized a STATA program created by Macdonald [2008] to analyze the data. This program provides statistical estimates that account for the variance in the five plausible values provided for each student's imputed score and for the sample weights provided in the TIMSS data. As a test of the validity of this software, I estimated the effect of the characteristics on the average of the five plausible values using the standard STATA 10 software. The standard software produced the same estimated coefficients but smaller estimates of variance than MacDonald's program.\nThe data set for 4th grade mathematics in Colombia includes observations for 4801 students. These students are divided into two types of classes, mathematics classes and integrated mathematics and science classes. I decided to use only the data for the mathematics classes to avoid potential variation in the amount of time allocated to mathematics in the integrated classes. The data for the mathematics classes included observations for 2361 students in 66 classes. The variables used in the regressions, the unweighted mean for each variable, its range, and the number of observations for each variable are shown in Table 1 . "}, {"section_title": "Class Size Data", "text": "The TIMSS 2007 data include the teacher's estimate of the size of each 4 th grade class. As shown in Table 1 , these estimates range from 6 to 80 students, while the number of students tested ranges from 3 to 50. Since it seemed unlikely that classes had as many as 80 students and such a large absentee rate on the day of the test, I\ncompared the number of students actually tested in each class to the reported size of the class. This comparison is shown in Figure 2 , and it reveals that many classes have a reported size that is about double the number of students who took the test."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2 Reported Class Size vs. Class Size as Tested", "text": "In a more in-depth review of the data, I determined that many teachers with two 4 th grade classes had included the total number for both classes as their estimate of the size of each class. The class size data are collected in question at4mstud on the teacher questionnaire, which asks: \"How many students are in the TIMSS class for mathematics?\" [IAEE, 2007] For a teacher with two 4 th grade classes, it is not clear if the question refers to the number of students in each class or in the two classes\ntogether. An additional problem with these data is that about 25% of the observations Due to these measurement problems and the large number of missing observations, I decided to use the number of students taking the test as the primary estimate of class size in the study. The distribution of test scores as a function of this estimate of class size is shown in Figure 3 . There is no apparent relationship between average test scores and average class size in these data."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3 Test Scores vs. Class Size as Tested in the Data Set", "text": "The plot shows that the data includes 21 students in very small classes (6 or less) and that they had lower average test scores. These students are in rural schools, which must be in isolated areas. I considered these data to be outliers and excluded them from the statistical regressions. Use of the class size as tested rather than the reported class size could bias the estimated coefficients, since it likely incorporates two types of error into the data. First, the number taking the test are in most cases an underestimate of the number in the class. Second, the degree of error in each measurement depends on the absentee rate, which is random. The first error biases the data downward, which should bias the estimated coefficient upward. The second error creates attenuation bias, which biases the estimated coefficient downward.\nBut another possibility is that the number taking the test is a good estimate of the number normally present in the class, which is the number that should affect the test scores. If so, then the number tested is a more accurate estimate of the true class size affecting student achievement than the official class size. In this case the estimated coefficient using the number tested would have less attenuation bias than the estimated coefficient using the (correctly-reported) official class size. .\nI created a smaller data set using the teachers' estimates of class size by identifying the incorrect estimates of class size and eliminating these observations from the data set. An examination of the data in Figure 2 reveals that the largest number of students taking the test was 50, while the reported number of students in that class was 60. In other classes the difference between the reported class size and those taking the test was either less than ten or much more than ten. This pattern indicated that a data set with valid class size data could be created by eliminating any data for reported class size that exceeded the number of students taking the test by more than ten.\nThis sort reduced the observations in the reported class size data from 1769 to 1375, leaving only 78% of the original observations and providing data for 58% of the students tested. In this subset of data, the average class size was 36.7, of which 34.5 students, or 94.0%, took the TIMSS test. While this data set is smaller than the data set using the number tested for class size, I estimate the model using these data to provide a robustness check for the results using the larger data set.\nThe effect of class size on test scores is expected to be negative, but it is not clear a priori whether this effect is linear or non-linear. I examined the effect on test scores of both class size and (class size) 2 to determine which provided superior statistical estimates."}, {"section_title": "Other Characteristics", "text": "The only personal characteristic included in the model is the student\u00b4s gender.\nGender has been shown to affect scores in some tests of mathematics skills. The confirmed that the number of books across the four size categories does not explain the variation in scores in 4 th grade and then collapsed the data into two categories, 0-10 books, and more than 10 books. The number of books in these two categories had some explanatory power.\nStudies normally include data on teacher education and experience, since in theory these characteristics should have a positive effect on student achievement. I included variables for both characteristics, even though Glewwe, et. al. [2011] report that empirical studies usually find little or no effect. Teacher education is measured in levels from 2 to 6, but most teachers in the data set are in level 4. Experience in the data set is measured in years.\nStudies sometimes find that the frequency and/or the amount of homework assigned have positive effects on student achievement [Glewwe, et. al., 2011] . TIMSS 2007 has both student and teacher questions related to this factor. I included the homework frequency variable from the teacher questionnaire in some models because the coefficient on this variable had the correct sign. In these data the frequency ranges from homework for some lessons (1) to half the lessons (2) to all or almost all lessons (3).\nFor school characteristics I included the size of the school, whether the school is urban or rural, and whether the school is private or public. Juerges and Schneider [2004] found that students in larger schools have higher scores. The ICFES [2010] report shows that on average 4 th grade mathematics students in Colombia score higher in private schools than in public schools and higher in urban schools than in rural schools. These variables for the location and the type of school implicitly may provide additional controls for family characteristics, since family income is likely to vary in a consistent manner between these school categories."}, {"section_title": "Potential Bias and Limitations of the Study", "text": "Many estimates of the effect of class size on student achievement exhibit endogeneity bias. Lindahl [2005] , Woessmann and West [2006] , and Jakubowki and Sakowski [2006] show that OLS estimates of the effect of class size on student test scores in OECD countries are biased because schools often place students with learning problems in smaller classes. This practice causes OLS estimates of the effect of class size test to be positive, while estimates of the effect that control for this bias are negative.\nThe TIMSS 2007 questionnaire for School Directors included a question about whether students are grouped by ability. The data indicate that 300 students attended schools that group by ability. I removed these students from the data set in most of the regressions to control for endogeneity bias. Any remaining endogeneity should bias downward the estimated negative effect of class size on test scores.\nThe data set had numerous missing observations, and the number missing was different for each variable. As a result, the number of observations in each regression depends on the particular variables included in each model. This number is reported for each regression. All of the regressions had considerably less than the 2361 observations available for test scores. The variations in the sample size make the estimates in the various models less comparable. The reductions in the sample size make the statistical results less representative of the Colombian population. This is a limitation of the study. Some studies attempt to estimate the value of the missing observations, but given that the TIMSS test scores themselves are estimates of plausible values created using five different (and unknown) sets of characteristics for the student and the learning environment, it was not evident how the missing observations could be reliably estimated.\nAnother limitation of the study is that it does not control for students' mathematics skills prior to entry into 4 th grade. These data are not collected in TIMSS or in most other international evaluations. As a consequence, it is not clear if the estimated effect of class size is due primarily to the student\u00b4s experience in 4 th grade or to the cumulative experience during the student\u00b4s first four years of primary school. Since most 4 th grade students are likely to have been in the same school in a similar size class since 1 st grade, the estimated effect of class size on test scores in this study is most likely the cumulative effect of this class size during the first four grades."}, {"section_title": "III. Empirical Results", "text": "Table 2 presents the empirical results using the number of students tested as the estimate of class size. Column 1 presents the results for the complete model, which has 1357 observations. In this data set the effect of class size is negative and quite large, but it is not significant at the 5% level. Each additional student in a class reduces student scores by 2.5 points. Column 2 presents the results for the same model, excluding the students in schools that group by ability. This restriction reduces the sample size to 1247 observations and reduces the magnitude and significance of the effect of class size. It appears that in contrast to the OECD countries, grouping by ability may assign the more able students to smaller classes. In any event all of the subsequent regressions in Tables 2 and 3 exclude the students in schools that group by ability.\nSince teacher education and experience have virtually no effect on test scores in the first two regressions, these variables are eliminated in column 3. With this change the effect of class size becomes larger and significant at the 5% level. But since school size and class size are correlated and the estimated coefficients have opposite signs, the magnitude of the coefficients on these variables may be too large.\nColumn 4 examines whether the effect of school size is robust to elimination of the class size variable from the model. The resulting smaller and insignificant estimated coefficient on school size indicates that school size may not have much effect on test scores. Column 5 shows the results without the school size variable, and again the estimated coefficient on class size is smaller than when both school size and class size are included in the model. This estimate of the effect of class size seems more reliable, and it is still statistically significant at the 5% level. Each additional student reduces test scores by 2.7 points.\nColumn 6 tests whether the effect of class size on test scores may be non-linear."}, {"section_title": "The statistical results indicate that (class size)", "text": "2 is slightly more statistically significant than class size, although either variable provides similar estimates of the class size effect. In these results the estimated coefficient on private school is small and not statistically significant. Columns 7 and 8 show the results with the variable for private school removed from the model. The estimated coefficients on the class size variables in these models are slightly smaller but still statistically significant at the 5% level.\nThese estimates provide a conservative estimate of the effect of class size on test scores. Over the range of class sizes as tested (19 to 50), these estimates indicate that the increase in class size reduces test scores by 75-79 points.\nOverall the results in this table provide strong evidence that 1) family income, raises test scores, 2) large classes and rural settings reduce them, and 3) teacher characteristics have no effect. These results are consistent with the other studies of the determinants of student achievement in 4 th grade. The magnitude of the explained variation in test scores (0.21 to 0.24) is consistent with other national studies using international test score data [Fuchs and Woessmann, 2007] Table 3 presents the results of the model using the reported class size provided by the teachers. Column 1 shows the results using all of the estimates, including those that appear to be in error. The effect of class size is negative, but the effect is small and not statistically significant. Column 2 presents the results for the same model but using only the numbers for reported class size that do not exceed the number of students tested by more than ten.\nThe estimated coefficient on class size is -2.04, and it is statistically significant at the 10% level. Columns 3 presents the results for (class size) 2 , and columns 4 and 5 present estimates for these two variables for class size without the variable for private schools. The empirical results using these data are all similar to the results in Table 2 , except that they are slightly smaller and slightly less statistically significant. Over the range of reported class sizes (19 to 60), the increase in class size reduces test scores by 78-83 points using the two class size variables. Since the estimates of class size are higher in the reported class size data, the net effect of changes in class size on tests scores in these estimates are 4-5% larger than the effect using the class size data based on the number tested.\nGiven that the data samples are different for the two measures of class size (1442 vs. 962 observations), these two sets of results are quite consistent. Since the estimates using the number tested are slightly smaller, the implication is that the class size data as tested are a slightly less accurate measure of the actual class size than the class size reported by the teachers. Alternatively, this difference in results could simply be the random result from using different samples of the population. These results provide evidence that a reduction in primary school class sizes could be an effective strategy to raise student achievement in mathematics. These results indicate that a reduction in the size of mathematics classes from 60 to 35 students during grades one to four would raise average test scores by 46 points.\nThe results also identify another policy change that could raise student test scores. The two sets of results both obtain a positive effect from an increase in the frequency of mathematics homework. In the results using the number of students tested, an increase in homework frequency from half the lessons to all the lessons increases scores by 22 points, but the estimate is not statistically significant. In the results using the reported class size, this change increases student test scores by 40 points, and the estimate is statistically significant at the 5% level. The data indicate that 65% of the 4 th grade students in the sample already have homework for all lessons, but that still leaves 35% who could increase their scores if they were given homework more frequently."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "Test Score vs. Reported Class Size (Conditional)"}, {"section_title": "IV. Conclusions", "text": "This study examines whether larger classes in 4 th grade have an adverse effect on student scores on tests of mathematics skills in Colombia. These analytical results depend crucially on the selection of the class size data used in the analysis. An analysis of these data revealed that the question about class size is not well-specified, and as a result, for 22% of the observations, teachers apparently provided an estimate of the total number of students they teach in 4 th grade rather than the number in each class.\nAs a consequence, if the effect of class size on test scores is estimated using the all of the reported data, the estimated effect is negative, but it is small and not statistically significant. The results showing that class size has a large, statisticallysignificant negative effect on test scores either exclude the misreported data or use the number of students tested in each class as the estimate of class size.\nThe adverse effects of class size found in this study are larger and more statistically significant than the effects found using TIMSS data in many other countries.\nThere are several possible explanations for this difference. The most likely is that class sizes In Colombia are larger on average and exhibit more variation than in most OECD countries. It is also possible that the TIMSS data on class size are also misreported in other countries. The results here indicate that if researchers have not identified and corrected or eliminated these misreported data, they would not find as large an adverse effect of class size on student achievement.\nReducing class size is expensive. Sanchez [2006] estimates that teachers' salaries constitute 85-90% of the cost of schooling in Colombia, so unit schooling costs are much higher in small classes. But the focus here is only on mathematics classes, not all primary school classes. The size of mathematics classes in primary school could be reduced at a more reasonable cost by providing additional teachers only for mathematics classes.\nParticularly if the additional teachers have high competence in mathematics, the empirical results in this study and the benefits of greater teacher competence reported by Metzler and Woessmann [2010] for 6 th grade mathematics in Peru suggest that student scores might improve substantially at a relatively low cost. Perhaps some test schools could be selected for a controlled experiment to evaluate whether such an approach is effective in raising student achievement in mathematics.\nThe empirical results indicate that test scores for students in 4 th grade mathematics may be higher in larger schools. It may be that larger schools use specialized teachers for mathematics more frequently than smaller schools. If this is the case and they obtain superior results, then the increased use of such teachers could be a cost-effective method for raising test scores."}]
