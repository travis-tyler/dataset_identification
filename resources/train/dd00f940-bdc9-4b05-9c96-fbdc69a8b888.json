For all the present analyses, the 29903 nucleotide long complete whole-genome of the earliestsequenced SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan (NC_045512.2) was used as the reference sequence. The software package called MicroGMT or Microbial Genomics Mutation Tracker [13] was used to identify modifications in the genome sequences analyzed. This package essentially uses Minimap2 [14] and Bcftools [15] to map individual genomes against the reference and store the results in a Variant Call Format (VCF) table. It further utilizes the SnpEff tool [16] to characterize all the detected mutations at the level of the nucleotide as well as the amino acid in the translated sequence. Although MicroGMT also reports instances of insertion and deletion in the sequences compared, the current study focused only on the pointmutation data, which were further verified as follows. The software MAFFT [17] was used with default options to align all the whole-genome sequences included in the dataset.\nPolymorphisms (base substitutions) were identified in the individual genomes using the software SNP-sites [18] , which specifically identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from aligned multi-fasta sequence files. Subsequently, the VCF file generated from the SNPsite analysis was processed using the software VCFtools [19] to enumerate all transition and transversion events within the dataset of aligned whole-genome sequences. Frequency of point mutations (M f ) in the SARS-CoV-2 pan-genome, or a given segment (locus) of the pangenome, was calculated as P i / (L n \u00d7 N s ), where P i is the number of instances of polymorphism detected within the genome/locus, L n is the nucleotide length of the genome/locus, and N s is the number of sequenced entities present in the dataset. dN/dS (also known as \u03c9 or Ka/Ks), which is the ratio between the rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) mutations, was determined for all the individual genes of SARS-CoV-2, based on likelihood analysis using J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof the software package HyPhy [20] . Sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 genome pairs were computed using the software FastANI, which uses a high throughput method for average nucleotide identity analysis [21] ."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenomic analyses", "text": "Evolutionary relationship between the existing SARS-CoV-2 lineages was inferred from a phylogenetic tree constructed based on a subset of the 71703 whole-genome sequences used for studying mutation accumulation trends. Sub-sampling was necessary because it is not possible to meaningfully display 71703 sequences in a single phylogenetic tree. This subdataset, comprising 4618 complete whole-genome sequences, was created using the software package Augur [12] , and by means of including (in an unbiased way) 150 genomes per geographical region (continent) per month since the first Wuhan strain was sequenced (NC_045512). Multiple sequence alignment was also created using the Augur tool kit of the Nextstrain package. Further alignment was carried out using the software IQ-TREE 2 which uses the maximum likelihood method for tree construction [22] ; Generalised Time Reversible (GTR) model was followed to construct the phylogenetic tree, which was finally visualized in the software Auspice (https://auspice.us). For the labeling of clades in the phylogenetic tree, type defining marker mutations were downloaded from the Nextstrain github repository which comes as a package within the Nextstrain tool (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov). Rules of clade-labeling followed were those mentioned in the website located at https://nextstrain.github.io/ncov/naming_clades.html. Thus, clades were labeled based on the geographical origin of the sequences, plus three different concepts of clade nomenclature that are in use for COVID-19, namely (i) the dynamic clade nomenclature system PANGOLIN [23] (ii)\nYear-Letter nomenclature system proposed by Hodcroft et al.\n(https://nextstrain.org/blog/2020-06-02-SARSCoV2-clade-naming), and (iii) the system proposed by Tang et al.

This holds major implications for the adaptation of the virus within human hosts, and in doing so have serious consequences on the resultant pathogenesis, disease complications, and control [25] .\nThe overall evolutionary paths traced thus far by SARS-CoV-2 was delineated by labeling the 4618 global (GISAID) sequences on the phylogenetic tree using three different concepts of clade nomenclature defined in the web-based resoure https://nextstrain.github.io/ncov/ ( Figures 1A-1C) . Information regarding the geographical origin of the sequences analyzed was also used to label the tree ( Figure 1D ). Figure 1A , where the tree topology was labeled according to the dynamic clade nomenclature system [23] called Phylogenetic Assignment Consistent with the above phylogenetic interpretations, labeling of the tree with the third clade-nomenclature convention proposed by Tang et al. [24] and also followed by GISAID, indicated that the two original lineages, named as S and L (essentially equivalent to 19A and 19B of the Year-Letter nomenclature system), has diversified and thus far given rise to a total of seven clades, based on nine distinct marker mutations spread over 95% of the known SARS-Cov-2 diversity ( Figure 1C ). As per the data available till 21 August 2020, Clade L is apparently more populous than Clade S, and has diversified further into V and G, with G Figure 1D ). India being the latest hotspot of the COVID-19 pandemic, recording >50000 cases of infection and >700 cases of fatality daily between July-end and October-middle 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/), the phylogeny and biogeography of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates was analyzed using the specialized (GISAID-derived) dataset encompassing 1148 and 4630 genome sequences of Indian and global origins respectively.\nThe phylogenetic tree topology obtained with this India-focused dataset ( Figures 1E and 1F) was essentially congruent with that obtained for the global dataset of 4618 GISAID sequences ( Figures 1A-1D ). Mapping of the Indian sequences on this tree topology using the GISAID ( Figure 1E ) and Year-Letter ( Figure 1F ) clade nomenclature systems showed that all the mutation-types which epitomize the major clades of global SARS-CoV-2 evolution are also present in India, albeit at potentially different frequencies of distribution within the country's viral population. For instance, the relatively lower number of sequences populating the two emerging lineages 20A/20268G and 20A/15324T can be clearly seen in Figure 1F which, in turn, corroborated the hypothesis that in the Asian countries the ancestral lineages are still more prevalent than the recently-derived mutational groups. Table S1 ). This distribution showed that 53.5% (i.e. 16002 / 29903) of the SARS-CoV-2 pan-genome has developed polymorphism via generation of small but definite mutations across the plethora of strains disseminated globally since the COVID outbreak in December 2019."}, {"section_title": "High rate of missense (nonsynonymous) mutations in the structural protein-coding", "text": "genes SARS-CoV-2 has experienced strong selection pressure over a short period of time. For animal viruses, in general, forces of selection (fitness constraints) emanate from host immunogenic responses, and also during replication and transmission between hosts.\nEvolutionarily fit (selected) strains develop tropism, and infect different cell-types or tissues of the host, reproduce within them, and in turn give rise to a variety of new strains having diverse chronic to acute infectious characteristics [26, 27] . Genomic data can reveal where, when, and (sometimes) how viral pathogens have responded to various forces of natural selection. In the context of codon models, natural selection of any genetic locus is typically measured using the parameter dN/dS, which represents the ratio between the global rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) mutation accumulation in that locus. to infect host cells via evading the immune system (specifically, the innate immune system), and eventually induce apoptotic pathways [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Consequently, brisk amino acid changes in these protein sequences may well be instrumental in allowing the virus innovate newer techniques to fulfil its pathogenic objectives. From a holistic evolutionary perspective based on the above considerations, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have already succeeded in stably synchronizing its replication and transcription machineries with the host's metabolic environment (as its non-structural genes are clearly recruiting less missense mutations). The virus, however, by means of actively recruiting more missense mutations in its structural genes, is still testing newer biophysical options to increase the efficiency of its molecular contrivances for virulence and transmissibility (pathogenicity)."}, {"section_title": "High frequency of C\uf0e0U and G\uf0e0U mutations across global SARS-CoV-2 genomes", "text": "Of Of the total 12594 transition mutations encountered, maximum, i.e. 3783, featured C\uf0e0U conversion, which was 30% of the total transition count (Table 1) .

Of the 7569 transversions detected across global SARS-CoV-2 genomes, an overwhelming 2414 (31.9%) featured G\uf0e0U conversion (Table 1) . Individually, all the SARS-CoV-2 genes had G\uf0e0U conversion as the most predominant transversions-type."}, {"section_title": "Significance of copious mutations in non-structural genes 1 and 2, and most structural genes, especially orf3a and orf7a", "text": "Since RNA viruses encode their own genome replication machineries (and do not depend on the hosts' replication systems as the DNA viruses do), they can optimize their mutation rates to achieve evolutionary fitness. This leads to an unrelenting generation of genomic variants for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof any RNA virus, alongside a rivalry among the extant variants, including the more advanced ones that are added to the viro-diversity over time [36] . Consequently, all active genomic variants maintained within global/local RNA virus populations (quasispecies) come to possess equal abilities to replicate and complete the infection cycle [36] . In this context, the divergence of several lineages and sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 since the December-2019 outbreak (via generation of small mutations across its world-wide strains) -alongside the more or less efficient circulation of its two original major-lineages (clades indicated as S and L in Figure 1) across distinct geographies -reflects the equivalent pathological and evolutionary fitness of all its extant quasispecies. This rich stock of genotypic, and therefore potentially phenotypic, variants is likely to hold major implications for potential multifaceted adaptations of this novel coronavirus within human hosts, and in doing so have serious consequences on the resultant pathogenesis, disease complications and control [25] .\nViruses that have evolved to survive via changing their hosts are extremely skilled molecular manipulators; the key to their ecological fitness is attributed to their ability to subvert host defense systems to ensure survival, replication and proliferation [37] . Coronavirusencoded accessory proteins, in general, play critical roles in virus-host interactions and modulation of host-immune responses, thereby contributing to their pathogenicity [38, 39] . nsp1\nand nsp2 are the most mutation-prone non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2, as they have the highest M f values among all such genes. Nsp1 is known to inhibit translation by binding to the host's 40S ribosome, and also inhibit IFN signaling, while Nsp2 inhibits the two host proteins proinhibitin1 and proinhibitin2 to disrupt the cellular environment [33] . Copious mutations in these two genes, therefore, can help the virus innovate novel molecular routes to evade host immunogenic response.\nWith regard to the 16 non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 it is remarkable that only nsp11 has a dN/dS value >1. The exact function of Nsp11 is not known. However, in Arterivirus, this protein has been characterized as a Nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that is associated with RNA processing [29] . So, a dN/dS vaue >1 Orf3a of SARS-CoVs has pro-apoptotic activity [41] ; very recent studies further implicated this protein of SARS-CoV-2 in inducing extrinsic apoptotic pathway through a unique membraneanchoring strategy [34] . In view of these key roles of Orf3a in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and Figure S1 ). In all SARS-CoVs, the type I membrane protein encoded by this gene is known to interact with bone marrow stromal antigen-2 (BST-2) and may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoVs [33] . Budding events are central to the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, so recruitment of copious mutations, especially nonsynonymous ones, in this structural gene ( Figure 3 ) affords novel molecular options to increase the efficiency of virulence (pathogenicity) of the virus."}, {"section_title": "Physicochemical underpinnings of the preponderance of C\uf0e0U and G\uf0e0U substitutions", "text": "In view of the overwhelming preponderance of C\uf0e0U and G\uf0e0U transitions in the global mutation spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 (as compared to all other transition and transversion mutations respectively) it seems likely that in the ecological context of this novel coronavirus some physicochemical and/or biochemical mutagen is more instrumental in bringing about this selective change, over and above the general replication error-induced mechanism of mutagenesis. Cytosine can convert to uracil through processes akin to hydrolytic deamination under the action of ultra-violet (UV) irradiation, which is well established in the context of DNA"}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "Journal Pre-proof [42] . C\uf0e0U conversion is also possible chemically under the mediation of bisulfite reagents [43] that are frequently used as disinfectants, antioxidants and preservative agents. Incidentally, several control techniques involving heating, sterilization, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) [44] and/or chemical disinfectants [45] are being used currently to reduce the risk of viral infection from contaminated surfaces. Of these, intense UV-C irradiation is at the forefront of our fight against COVID-19, so indiscriminate use of the same may well accelerate the incidence of C\uf0e0U mutations in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Furthermore, UV's specificity for targeting two adjacent pyrimidine nucleotides is long known [46] , while in the context of DNA, UV-induced signature mutations collated from existing data on cells exposed to UVC, UVB, UVA or solar simulator light, have been confirmed as C\uf0e0T in \u2265 60% dipyrimidine sites, of which again \u2265 5% is CC\uf0e0TT [47] . In consideration of the above facts, it seems likely that prone to mistranslation [48] . It is therefore conceivable that SARS-CoV-2, in addition to classical mutations acquired from error-prone replication at the genomic level, uses the mistranslated replication-cum-transcription complex for the development of diverged genomic lineages [49, 50] . In other words, when the viral infection discharges its positively-sensed RNAgenome into the host cell, errors in the RdRP crops up via mistranslation [51, 52] ; the consequent blend of wild-type and changed RdRP enzymes through its replication activities give rise to a range of viral genome-variants or quasispecies, even within a single transmission event [50] . Those variants which have the best viral fitness, eventually, endure and become predominant in the population. In this context, it is further noteworthy that both tautomeric and anionic Watson-Crick(W-C)-like mismatches can increase the recruitment of replication and translation errors [53, 54] .

Owing to its crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection the spike constitutes a key target for vaccine and drug development against COVID-19 [57] [58] [59] , and for the same Like most other SARS-CoV-2 genes, C\uf0e0U and G\uf0e0U were also found to be the most dominant transition and transversion types across global S gene homologs ( Table S2 ). In all the other structural and nonstructural genes as well, nonsynonymous amino acid substitution-yielding C\uf0e0U mutations exhibited global propensity for replacing proline to serine or leucine residues (Supplementary File 2, Table S2 ). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (R = 0.97; P = 0.00001) was observed between the number of missense C\uf0e0U mutations accumulating in a gene and the number of proline replacements occurring in the corresponding translated sequence. In a protein sequence, when proline is replaced by serine or leucine a strong helix breaker is removed and replaced by a residue indifferent to helix formation [63] .
