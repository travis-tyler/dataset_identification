Assessment: The 0% vial was measured along three orthogonal axes, and at two different temperatures. The ADC for each concentration was compared between the C3T and two whole-body scanners. Cerebrospinal fluid and white matter ADCs were quantified for each patient and compared to values in literature. Statistical Tests: Paired t-test and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: For all PVP concentrations, the corrected ADC was within 2.5% of the reference ADC. On average, the ADC of cerebrospinal fluid and white matter post-GNLC were within 1% and 6%, respectively, of values reported in the literature and were significantly different from the uncorrected data (P < 0.05). Data Conclusion: This study demonstrated that GNL effects were more severe for the C3T due to the asymmetric gradient design, but our implementation of a GNLC compensated for these effects, resulting in ADC values that are in good agreement with values from the literature.

G radient linearity is essential for accurate spatial localization in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as uncorrected gradient nonlinearity (GNL) leads to unwanted image blurring and distortion. [1] [2] [3] While commercial MR scanners have some degree of gradient nonlinearity or nonuniformity due to engineering limitations, manufacturers commonly employ an image-based postprocessing GNL correction algorithm (e.g., \"gradwarp\" on GE's system) to compensate for spatial encoding distortions. 1 This standard correction, however, does not correct the diffusion measurement bias caused by nonlinear diffusion-encoding gradients, which results in a spatially-dependent error in quantitative diffusionweighted imaging (DWI). 4, 5 In a system with perfectly linear gradients, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be estimated using images acquired with distinct b-values. The bvalue is dependent on the duration and amplitude of the diffusion encoding gradient pulses in addition to the time interval between the two gradient pulses. Instead of a uniform b-value for all spatial locations, the gradient nonlinearity property requires description of the spatial-dependent b-value matrix, which is not trivial to determine. In this case, the gradient field map tensor and the idealized gradient vector can be used to approximate the b-value matrix. 4, 6 The gradient field map tensor can be generally expressed using spherical harmonic polynomial expansion. 7, 8 The model coefficients can be obtained using electromagnetic (EM) simulation or phantom calibration. 1, 9, 10 In general, for conventional whole-body systems, only model coefficients of odd-orders (eg, 3 rd order, 5 th order, etc.) are required for distortion correction when imaging the head. A more detailed discussion of this gradient nonlinearity correction (GNLC) method has been described in Bammer et al and in Tan et al. 4, 6 In addition to the standard GNL correction for image geometric distortion, the effects from nonlinear gradients in diffusion-encoding can also be corrected in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DWI. [4] [5] [6] It has been shown that the application of retrospective GNLC can reduce the GNLrelated errors and differences in ADC between different scanners from 10% to 2%. 4, 6 The effects from GNLC as applied to a multicenter trial for quantitative breast DWI was shown to reduce errors in ADC maps by up to 12%."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "A novel, compact 3T MR scanner (C3T) 12, 13 was developed as a technology demonstrator under a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded program. The motivation behind the C3T was to demonstrate the advantages offered by a lightweight, low-cost, and high-performance MR system. The C3T was designed with a high-performance gradient system with a 42-cm inner diameter. Due to its relatively small size, the gradient system can achieve 80 mT/m amplitude and 700 T/m/s slew rate simultaneously, while remaining below the peripheral nerve stimulation limit. [12] [13] [14] To facilitate patient access, it was necessary to shift the imaging volume towards the patient end of the bore to accommodate both the head and shoulder. This shift is accomplished by using asymmetric gradient coil windings 12,14,15 along the bore axis (i.e., the physical Z axis) for both transverse gradients (i.e., the physical X and Y axes). The asymmetric configuration allows the homogeneous gradient volume to be closer to the patient end of the bore. However, this asymmetry introduces more complicated GNL compared to the conventional symmetrical systems that are used in the whole-body scanners. Therefore, both odd-and even-order spherical harmonic polynomials, up to the 10 th order, are required to accurately model the gradient field map. 10 While GNLC algorithms for diffusion have been demonstrated successfully on conventional whole-body MR scanners equipped with symmetrical gradient systems, they have yet to be tested on asymmetric gradient systems, except in our preliminary report. 16 The purpose of this work was to investigate the quantitative accuracy and precision of the ADC on the C3T using the GNLC algorithm with these higher-order coefficients, and to determine how they compare to whole-body scanners."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Phantom Study/Preparation", "text": "A diffusion quality control (QC) phantom (HPD Devices, Boulder, CO) was selected for our phantom study, as it met the recommendations of an ideal phantom for diffusion quantification as set out by Keenen et al. 17 This commercial phantom was also based on the design originally developed by Boss et al. 18 The phantom consisted of 13 vials of 3-cm diameter and filled with varying concentrations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in water contained within a 19.4-cm diameter plastic sphere. 18, 19 The vials in the phantom were arranged in two concentric rings. Vials in the inner and outer rings were spaced 4 cm and 6.5 cm apart, respectively, with PVP concentrations ranging from 0-50% with a 10% increment clockwise. There was one additional 0% PVP vial in the center. The phantom was imaged in four orientations: the standard, axial position with the long axis of the vials parallel with the bore axis (physical z-axis) direction, and rotated about the z-axis every 908 to measure the ADC of each PVP concentration in various quadrants of the axial field of view (FOV). In addition, the phantom was imaged at two different temperatures: 08C (reference standard from the literature) and at ambient room temperature (to measure ADC values as obtained in a clinical environment). Following recommendations by the phantom manufacturer, the phantom was prepared with an ice-water bath $2 hours prior to imaging, and additional ice was added immediately beforehand to ensure a stable 08C temperature for the duration of the imaging session. For higher temperature imaging, the phantom was filled with deionized water and was equilibrated to ambient room temperature (208C) in each scanner room overnight before imaging. The phantom temperature was verified with a thermometer to within 60.058C prior to and after each imaging session.

A downward shift towards the assumed ADC was observed for all scanners except the MR750w at the 30% PVP concentration. Prior to GNLC, the difference between the ADCs from all vials and the reference values ranged between 3.6-6.1%, 1-5.8%, and 3.8-5.2% for the C3T, MR750, and Signa HDxt scanners, respectively.

Furthermore, the measured uniformity across all ROIs and cases was 81% and 82% for CSF and WM before correction but improved to 93% and 92% after GNLC. Our results show that GNLC is able to correct for disparities in ADC quantification regardless of location from isocenter and trends towards a more uniform ADC (decrease in variance). A paired t-test resulted in P < 0.0004 for both CSF and WM, indicating a significant difference between the mean ADC before and after GNLC correction. Figure 5 shows two example MD slices of the axial brain DTI from one volunteer. ROIs are not explicitly shown due to the small size relative to the image. The difference ratio map shows the bias is mainly located in the periphery of the FOV for the axial slice near isocenter and across the full imaging area for the slice away from isocenter, which is due to increased nonlinearity effects as distance from isocenter increases in both the radial and S/I direction, and correlates well with the decreased ADC observed in regions furthest from isocenter. Figure 6 summarizes the effect of GNL correction on the ADC for a whole-body scanner versus the C3T from the same volunteer.

ADC values for CSF measured at 4.8 cm from isocenter were $9% lower and 7% lower for WM as compared to ADC values measured at 9 cm from isocenter. In addition, for similar distances from isocenter, the measured ADC for the C3T was slightly underestimated compared to the MR750w. Overall, the GNLC patient data showed greater improvement in the mean ADC maps for regions further from isocenter and both CSF and WM agreed with values observed in the literature."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "From our observations, ROIs of vials located farther from isocenter in the axial plane had larger ADC bias from the reference value as compared to ROIs displaced from isocenter in the slice direction. Reduced bias was observed in the slice direction because the length of the vials limited ADC quantification from 22.2 cm to 1.4 cm from isocenter, whereas ADC quantification in the axial plane was measured up to 8 cm radially from isocenter. Nonuniform bias was observed when the phantom was rotated every 908, indicating the magnetic field was not symmetric, but our results show appropriate gradient modeling can account for this. The observed ADC of water at 08C in our study was (1.12 6 0.01) 310 23 mm 2 /s and is consistent with the ADCs reported by Palacios et al, 28 Easteal et al, 26 Jerome et al, 30 and Hectors et al. 31 However, our observed ADC FIGURE 5: Volunteer data from C3T scanner: (a) Axial mean MD maps from the two axial slices of a DTI brain scan before GNLC (left) and after GNLC (right) (b) with the corresponding normalized difference ratio maps. The slice locations for the two axial slices were 2.45 cm and 7.7 cm from isocenter. The slice 7.7 cm superior to isocenter was enlarged relative to the inferior slice for better visualization, and therefore pixel size between slices are not to scale.\nprotocol used in this work was optimized for ADC values observed in a typical brain imaging study that was adopted to evaluate the effect of GNL and its correction in clinical applications; therefore, imprecise ADC estimates were expected for low diffusivity vials. This effect was apparent as the ADC accuracy decreased and PVP concentration increased.\nOur results from the C3T showed slightly greater improvement with the GNL correction compared to the whole-body systems when quantifying a range of PVP concentrations. There are two possible reasons that may contribute to this finding. First, real-time field adjustment (RTFA) 36 for correcting higher-order eddy current effects was available in the C3T and the MR750 whole-body but not in the HDx whole-body. Second, potentially more accurate field maps in the form of higher-order basis functions were used to characterize the C3T system; up to 10 th order spherical harmonic polynomial terms were used for the C3T, 10 while up to 5 th order terms (default configuration provided by the manufacturer) were used for the wholebody systems. With symmetric gradients in whole-body systems and an overall larger bore, higher-order terms would not be expected to substantially improve clinical diffusion imaging for a head-sized field of view. However, a study by Tan et al showed that modeling conventional whole-body scanners up to the 7 th order increased ADC accuracy by 1% as compared to the traditional 5 th order modeling, 6 which could provide improved agreement in ADC measurements between scanners. While the absolute ADC value of the CSF in individuals can vary, it is expected that ADC values should be fairly uniform and consistent for the same subject. It is further expected that the CSF should exhibit similar if not the same ADC values throughout the entire brain volume, since it mostly consists of water and its structure does not change in different regions of the brain. Interestingly, the estimated ADC for CSF in the patient example corresponded well with the values from a study by Helenius et al. 29 The were statistically different from Helenius et al, it is in general agreement with that reported in the literature. The change in uniformity between ROIs and patient cases may be more appropriate to quantify the improvement in in vivo ADC due to the GNLC. The uniformity across all sampled ROIs was $82% prior to correction and increased 93% after correction for both CSF and WM. These results are encouraging, as they indicate improved agreement in ADC over a range of locations within the FOV. The variation in the locations from isocenter between patients was partially due to internal patient anatomy and the positioning of the patient within the bore and ranged from -3 to 8 cm in the inferior to superior direction. Of the 12 patient exams, seven were considered healthy individuals with no indicated clinical findings from the radiologist's report. The other five volunteers had incidental findings unrelated to the quantification of the CSF and WM, which is confirmed with agreement of the ADC values in the literature.\nWhile phantom and in vivo data demonstrate promising results with GNLC, there were some limitations to our study. First, using the phantom we were able to quantify ADC at various regions in the imaging volume. However, it is not a fully complete assessment of the accuracy throughout the entire imaging volume. Second, a single imaging protocol was used and therefore a full range of ADC values was not assessed. However, the theory of GNLC suggests that GNL effects are independent of the encoding b-value and the ADC of the measured object, and one would expect that the benefits from GNLC can be generally applied to any ADC value. This assumption does not account for a potential ADC bias introduced by noise using larger bvalues. Third, we were limited to a relatively small sample size for the in vivo dataset. Despite these limitations, our study quantified ADC in a number of regions in the imaging volume to provide a sufficient estimate of the accuracy in ADC estimation using GNLC. For clinical DWI, the bvalue is often selected to quantify specific pathology, so we focused more on the improved uniformity before and after the GNLC.\nIn conclusion, the improvement in the accuracy of the ADC values demonstrated the GNL correction algorithm to be robust on the C3T scanner. The correction resulted in a more uniform ADC map for the QC phantom and a systematic shift of the mean towards the reference ground truth. In addition, GNL correction provided ADC values from the C3T scanner that were more comparable to that of the whole-body scanners. The in vivo DWI and DTI results demonstrated improved uniformity of ADC values across the same tissue type across all subjects."}]
