[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Taipei basin, located in northern Taiwan, is formed at the intersection of the Tanshui River valley (;30 km) and the Keelung River valley (;60 km). Summer is the dry season in northern Taiwan, but the maximum rainfall in the Taipei basin occurs during 15 June-31 August. The majority of summer rainfall in this basin is produced by afternoon thunderstorms. Thus, the water supply, air/land traffic, and pollution for this basin can be profoundly affected by interannual variations of thunderstorm days and rainfall. Because the mechanism for these interannual variations is still unknown, a systematic analysis is made of thunderstorm days and rainfall for the past two decades . These two variables are found to correlate opposite interannual variations of sea surface temperature anomalies over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ni\u00f1o-3.4 region. Occurrence days for afternoon thunderstorms and rainfall amounts in the Taipei basin double during the cold El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase relative to the warm phase. During the latter phase, a stronger cold/drier monsoon southwesterly flow caused by the Pacific-Japan Oscillation weakens the thunderstorm activity in the Taipei basin through the land-sea breeze. In contrast, the opposite condition occurs during the cold ENSO phase. The water vapor flux over the East/Southeast Asian monsoon region converges more toward Taiwan to maintain rainfall over the Taipei basin during the cold ENSO phase than during the warm ENSO phase."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The East Asian summer monsoon undergoes a life cycle with active and revival phases separated by a monsoon break (Ramage 1952) . These phases of the summer monsoon in Taiwan cover the periods of midMay-late June (active phase), late June-early July (break), and early July-end of August (revival phase) (Chen et al. 2004) . Rainstorms originating in northern Vietnam and southwestern China produce the most rainfall during the active phase, while rainfall during the revival phase is generated by typhoons and afternoon thunderstorms (TS). Regardless of these monsoon rainfall activities in Taiwan, summer is a dry season in northern Taiwan (Chen et al. 1999; Yen and Chen 2000) .\nNevertheless, the Taipei basin has its maximum rainfall occur in summer, as a result of afternoon thunderstorms (Chen et al. 2007, hereinafter C7) . The Taipei basin is formed at the intersection of two river valleys: the Tanshui River (;30 km; northwest-southeast oriented) and the Keelung River (;60 km; northeast-southwest oriented). Despite its small geographic size, the Taipei basin is to home to a population of about three million people. C7 notes that the increase in thunderstorm activity and rainfall during the past four decades has had a profound impact on many environmental issues for the Taipei basin, namely the water supply, urban planning and pollution, ground subsidence, and air and land traffic hazards. Chen et al. (2014, hereinafter C14 ) conducted a field experiment for two summers to understand how afternoon TS occurrence in the Taipei basin relates to the sea-breeze circulation along the basin's two rivers and to understand the effects of the large-scale monsoon circulation on afternoon TS activity. Summer rainfall in this basin is characterized by two salient features: 1) the average commencement date for afternoon thunderstorm activity during summer is 15 June and 2) summer rainfall is produced by afternoon thunderstorms (;75% of total rainfall) and typhoons (;16%). Clearly, rain production in the Taipei basin is significantly different from that over the remainder of Taiwan. Further observations by C14 included TS activity and rainfall within this basin, which were enhanced when the monsoon southwesterlies were strengthened, but reduced when the southwesterlies were weakened. In contrast, non-thunderstorm (No-TS) days were not significantly affected by the monsoon southwesterlies.\nIn response to the interannual variation of the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), the monsoon circulation change leads to an interannual variation of typhoon genesis over the western tropical Pacific (WTP; appendix A provides notation and expansions for key terms and acronyms used in this paper) (e.g., Chen et al. 1998; Chan 2000 ; among other studies) and the late spring-early summer rainstorm activity between the southwestern China-northern Indochina region and Taiwan (Chen et al. 2011) . The anomalous summer monsoon circulation along the western North Pacific rim induced by the tropical Pacific SST anomalies is depicted by Nitta (1987) and identified by Trenberth et al. (1998) as the Pacific-Japan (P-J) Oscillation. Closely linked to the monsoon southwesterly flow, afternoon thunderstorm activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin may undergo an interannual variation caused by the summer monsoon change through the P-J oscillation. The interannual variations of the summer TS activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin caused by this potential mechanism have not been explored so far. Therefore, this study proposes to address this issue.\nTo that end, we need a quantitative approach for defining the TS day and for making quantitative measurements of rainfall across the Taipei basin. For this purpose, the present study adopts quantitative approaches introduced by C14. Based on the relationships among the intensity variation of monsoon southwesterlies and the basin's humid conditions, along with the thunderstorm activity/rainfall reported by C14 in the Taipei basin, the present study explores the mechanisms causing interannual summer rainfall variation in the Taipei basin for the 1993-2013 period. This study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology adopted to perform all of the necessary diagnostic analyses. Section 3 presents the results of our analysis of the mechanism causing the interannual variation of the afternoon TS activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin during summer in three components. Section 3a provides the seasonalmean values for the TS days, and area-mean rainfall and humidity are used to portray the interannual variations for TS activity and rainfall within the basin. Section 3b describes the large-scale monsoon conditions favorable for TS occurrence as determined in terms of the radiosonde observations from the Panchiao WMO station (WMO 46688) near the city of Taipei. The influence of the ENSO cycle on this TS activity and rainfall is illustrated by the change in favorable synoptic conditions affected by the P-J oscillation. Section 3c illustrates the impact of the interannual variation of the large-scale monsoon circulation on the hydrological environment in maintaining the TS rainfall. Section 4 provides a concise summary of new findings for the causes of interannual variations of TS activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin, as well as our conclusions. This section also suggests potential future studies."}, {"section_title": "Data and methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "a.

The sea-breeze onset is determined by shortwave radiative heating on the mountains surrounding the basin, while the sea-breezeland-breeze (SB-LB) transition is determined by the longwave cooling of the mountains. This No-TS land-sea breeze life cycle is shortened by afternoon TS rainfall. Following C14, land-sea breezes with and without TS activity are identified by the following criteria: 1) TS days (i) The Taipei basin is cloud/rainfall free in the morning, but clouds appear in the afternoon. (ii) Sea breezes are the inbound surface winds along the two river valleys (Fig. 1b) (Jenne 1975 ) is used to project 3-h rainfall data onto a grid with spacing of 0.0368 3 0.0368 [;(4 km 3 4 km)] (Fig. 2) for 1993-2013. Using only station data over the stationdense area to estimate the area-mean rainfall enables us to use this area-mean rainfall to calibrate TRMM rainfall and GBT rainfall proxy. Duan et al. (2015) noted that calibration of rainfall proxy with satellite observations could be affected by orography. Therefore, the mountain height within the basin is divided into three ranges: 0-100, 100-500, and 500-1000 m. To save space, a detailed calibration procedure for both TRMM rainfall and GBT rainfall proxy data over the entire analysis domain (encircled by the red line in Fig. 2 ) of the Taipei basin is provided in appendix B. The observed rainfall and calibrated rainfall proxy are projected onto the grid system shown in Fig. 2 . The area-mean rainfall over this basin is integrated with gridded station rainfall, and either calibrated TRMM rainfall or GBT rainfall proxy data within the area encircled by the red line in Fig. 2 . A majority of the summer rainfall (;78%) in the basin is contributed by TSs, with only 21.5% rainfall contributed by TYs, FTs, and RSs. The area-mean surface specific humidity q s is also estimated over the area encircled by the green line. Figure 3 shows the TS dates for 21 summers during the 1993-2013 period (rainy season) determined in the basin. The average starting TS date is 15 June with a standard deviation of 10 days. Thus, the period from 15 June to 31 August is defined as the summer rainy season in the Taipei basin. The three summer climate indices used in the current study are defined as follows: Yang et al. 1996; Chen et al. 2006) . However, the SST anomalies are smaller in the latter region than in the former region. The SST anomalies averaged over a 58 3 58 box encircling the maximum SST anomaly within the region (108-208N, 1258-1558E) are defined as the DSST (WTP) index. For the 15 June-31 August period, this index is denoted as DSST HJ (WTP). (iii) The response of the warm-season atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific to the interannual variation of DSST (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) and DSST (WTP) is a teleconnection short-wave train along the North Pacific rim emanating from the Philippine Sea to the North American west coast (Nitta 1987) . This short-wave train consists of an anomalous circulation cell centered east of Taiwan and another one with an opposite phase centered east of Japan, represented by the composite eddy streamfunction anomalies at 500 hPa Dc E HJ (500 hPa) difference between the cold and warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase shown in Fig. 4 . Nitta (1987) used geopotential height to portray this teleconnection pattern. Note that the amplitude of the geopotential height perturbation in the tropics is an order of magnitude smaller than that in the midlatitudes (Charney 1963) , but the perturbations of wind speed in both latitudinal zones are comparable. The streamfunction is a proper variable used to depict this teleconnection pattern. The two opposite-phase anomalous circulation cells of the Pacific-Japan pattern undergo a flip-flop oscillation in response to interannual variations of DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4). This oscillation is reflected by the (P-J) HJ index, which is the difference between the Dc E HJ (500 hPa) anomalies averaged over the 58 3 58 box surrounding the centers for both the Taiwan and Japan cells during the cold (blue dot) and warm (red dot) seasons. Any one of these two centers may not exhibit a clear circulation cell during the normal phase of DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4)."}, {"section_title": "3) THREE SUMMER CLIMATE INDICES", "text": "The Dc E HJ (500 hPa) anomalies averaged over the 58 3 58 box around the mean centers (the averaged locations of four cold and four warm centers The network for surface stations (red dots), the grid system used to estimate the rainfall and surface specific humidity q s within the Taipei basin, and the orography.

The water vapor flux Q can be separated also into rotational Q R and divergent Q D components:\nThus, the convergence of water vapor flux can be written as 2= \u00c1 Q D , which can be related to the atmospheric divergent circulation through the potential function of water vapor flux x Q .

The East/Southeast Asian monsoon circulation, in response to the tropical Pacific SST anomalies, should affect TS activity in the basin. This contrast for TS occurrence days between the two extreme DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases is confirmed in Fig. 5a and Table 1 . Days with synoptic/environmental conditions other than TS and No-TS (with sea breeze) days are included. The average number of TS days is 20.2 days, 26% (20.2/78) of the entire summer rainy season in the Taipei basin. The TS days exhibit a clear interannual variation coincident with the interannual variation of the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) index. The average number of TS days for the former group is 30 days, while the value for the latter group is 14 days. The TS activity may be modulated by the interannual variation of the large-scale East Asian monsoon circulation. This modulation will be illustrated later. Figure 5b shows the rainfall histograms for P T , thunderstorms (P TS ), and typhoons (P TY ). Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "2) TS RAINFALL", "text": "the statistics for these rainfall amounts. Climatologically, 78% of P T in the Taipei basin is from thunderstorms, while only 19% is from typhoons. Thunderstorms, rather than typhoons, produce far more rainfall in the Taipei basin. About 75% of the P T variance is explained by P TS , but only 22% is explained by P TY . Apparently, the interannual variation of P T in the Taipei basin should be primarily attributed to the interannual variation of P TS .\nThe interannual variations for P T and P TS shown in Fig. 5b and TS days shown in Fig. 5a are anticorrelated with the interannual variations for the summer DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) index. The TS days are about twice as frequent and produce twice as much rainfall as cold ENSO conditions. The largescale monsoon hydrological environment enables the TS (cold) days to be more efficient in producing rainfall. This assessment will be substantiated in section 3c. Figure 6a shows the time series for DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) (black solid line) and DSST HJ (WTP) (red line with faint dashes). The warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) ($0.58C) and cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) (#20.58C) phases opposite the cold DSST HJ (WTP) (#20.268C) and warm DSST HJ (WTP) ($0.268C) phases are marked with pink and light blue strips, respectively. Over the 1993-2013 period, there are four warm and four cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases. Figure 6b shows the histograms for the (P-J) HJ index: (P-J) HJ is larger than 1 positive standard deviation during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase and smaller than 1 negative standard deviation during the opposite phase. The contrast between the three climate indices (Fig. 6 ) and the afternoon TS occurrence days and rainfall (Fig. 5 ) leads to the following inferences for the relationship between them: 1) As inferred from the in-phase (out of phase) relationship between interannual variations among the three climate indices (P-J) HJ , DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4), and DSST HJ (WTP) in Fig. 6 , the interannual variation of the East Asian monsoon circulation along the western North Pacific rim is the response to these tropical Pacific SST anomalies through the P-J oscillation. 2) Indicated by the out-of-phase interannual variations between the afternoon TS days and rainfall in the Taipei basin, and the relationship between interannual variations of the (P-J) HJ index and DSST HJ (WTP) [or DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4)], the interannual variations for the afternoon TS days and rainfall are affected by the tropical Pacific SST interannual variations through the (P-J) HJ oscillation. This inference will be substantiated in sections 3b and 3c.\nThe interannual variation of the summer atmospheric circulation in the western North Pacific in response to the interannual variation of the tropical Pacific SST, indicated by the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) and DSST HJ (WTP) indices, is reflected by the (P-J) HJ index and depicted by the (P-J) HJ pattern. Despite the small geographic size of the Taipei basin, the interannual variations of the afternoon TS activity and rainfall are coincident with the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4), DSST HJ (WTP), and (P-J) HJ indices. It is likely the interannual variations for TS activity and rainfall in this basin are modulated by the interannual variation of atmospheric circulation in the western North Pacific. These modulations will be demonstrated by the relationship of the TS activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin with the dynamical and hydrological conditions for the monsoon circulation around Taiwan in sections 3b and 3c.\nb. Upper-air synoptic conditions by this surface ridge structure into the southeasterlies across Taiwan. In contrast, during the TS day ( Fig. 7 in  C14) , the surface ridge appears over eastern China, but is not linked to the surface anticyclone in the Philippine Sea. Thus, the southwesterlies/southerlies from the South China Sea flow across Taiwan. As shown in Fig. 7a , precipitable water W is high between 108 and 308N, and between India and the Philippine Sea. The 700-hPa streamline chart superimposed with precipitable water composites for TS (Fig. 7b) and No-TS (Fig. 7c) days shows more precipitable water near Taiwan during the former group-a moist tongue extends from the northern South China Sea to the Taiwan Strait and the southern East China Sea (Fig. 7b) . Displayed in Fig. 7d is the difference between Figs. 7b and 7c. This difference clearly shows that the warm/moist air transported from the northern South China Sea establishes a favorable environment for TS development in the Taipei basin. The contrasts between the upper-air synoptic conditions and the circulation structure TS and No-TS days observed by C14 lead us to consider the notion of whether they can be affected by the anomalous East/Southeast Asian monsoon circulation in response to the tropical Pacific SST anomalies. This notion can be clarified by statistics for DT d (where T d is dewpoint) and velocity V over the 500-850-hPa layer measured by the radiosonde measurements at Panchiao, and composite TS and No-TS streamline charts against the seasonal-mean monsoon circulation. (ii) V in the 500-850-hPa layer As observed by C14, afternoon TSs occur when the flow in the lower half of the troposphere in the Taipei basin is southwesterly. To avoid redundancy, only the (u, y) scatter diagrams for 500 and 700 hPa, and the composite soundings for No-TS and TS days during the three ENSO climate conditions, are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. Interesting features emerge from these scatter diagrams and sounding profiles.\nFor all TS days, the directions of V TS (500 hPa) and V TS (700 hPa) are located within the quadrant of southerly and westerly flows. This observation is confirmed by the composite soundings of No-TS and TS days in Fig. 10 . These southwesterlies would transport warm/ moist air from the South China Sea, which helps to maintain TS sea breezes within this basin and to facilitate the occurrence of TS convection/rainfall. The relationship between the monsoon southwesterlies and the sea breezes in this basin is shown by a scatter diagram (Fig. 11) made with the magnitude of jV SW (700 hPa)j measured at 0000 UTC and the maximum surface sea breeze (jV SB (surface)j) during 1300-1400 LST at Panchiao. It is clear that the occurrence of the sea breeze in the The average jV TS j (cold) , jV TS j (warm) values at both 500 and 700 hPa are shown in Figs. 9a and 8b , respectively. These average V TS (cold) and V TS (warm) results are confirmed by the composite V TS soundings shown in Fig. 10 and are summarized and highlighted in . Note that No-TS days shown in Figs. 10c and 10d exhibit no interannual variation systematically related to the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) index (Fig. 6a) . In addition, the interannual variation for DSST HJ (WTP) is opposite DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4). Thus, during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase, the environment for the Taipei TS has been added to its corresponding vertical profile. In (g), color shadings highlight the differences between the cold, normal, and warm profiles.\nbasin is moister and does not need strong southwesterly flows (Figs. 9a and 9b ) and/or sea breezes (Fig. 11) to initiate TS activity. In contrast, during the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase, the air mass from the South China Sea is drier. The contrast for the seasonal-mean (15 June-31 August) basin surface specific humidity q s between the cold and warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases shown in Fig. 5c , confirms our inference. Thus, stronger southwesterlies are needed to drive the sea breeze into the Taipei basin ( Fig. 11) to trigger TS activity."}, {"section_title": "2) TS UPPER-AIR CIRCULATION", "text": "The Asian continental thermal low during the summer is encircled by the monsoon westerlies around South Asia and the monsoon southwesterlies around East/Southeast Asia (Fig. 12a) . Three troughs (thick, dashed lines) and three ridges (thick, solid blue lines) are embedded in these monsoon flows. The composite anomalous circulation pattern of the TS (No-TS) days exhibits an anticyclonic (cyclonic) shear zone around the coasts of South, Southeast, and East Asia, all of which serve to intensify (weaken) the three pairs of monsoon troughs and ridges, as observed by C14 for the period of 2004-05. It is revealed from the composite TS anomalous circulation in Fig. 12b that the anomalous southwesterlies would facilitate the occurrence of the TS activity in the Taipei basin. On the contrary, the occurrence of this TS activity would be hindered by the anomalous northeasterlies of the composite No-TS anomalous circulation.\nOur next concerns are 1) how the composite TS anomalous circulation stimulates more (fewer) TS days during the cold ENSO phase and fewer during the warm ENSO phase in the Taipei basin and 2) how the interannual variation of the seasonal-mean circulation affects TS activity. As is revealed in the right-hand panel of Fig. 10 and .\n[DV TS (700 hPa) (cold) 1 DV HJ (700 hPa) (cold)] .\nThe composite DV TS (700 hPa) (warm) and DV TS (700 hPa) (cold) anomalous circulations are shown later (Figs. 13a and 13b, respectively). Both the cold and warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases exhibit anomalous southwesterly flow adjacent to Taiwan. The difference for these two anomalous circulations shown in Fig. 13c displays the anomalous southwesterly flow adjacent to Taiwan. The anomalous southwesterly flow of jDV TS (700 hPa) (cold)j is smaller than the anomalous southwesterly flow of jDV TS (700 hPa) (warm)j. The composite seasonal-mean anomalous circulations for the cold and warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases, DV HJ (700 hPa) (cold) and DV HJ (700 hPa) (warm), are displayed in Figs. 13d and 13e , respectively; the anomalous circulation cells east of Taiwan and Japan form the P-J patterns (Nitta 1987 ) during these two ENSO phases. Adjacent to Taiwan, the cold ENSO phase exhibits the anomalous southwesterly flow, but the warm ENSO phase shows the anomalous northeasterly flow. Rearranging the inequality from Eq. (6), one obtains DV TS (700 hPa) (warm) . DV TS (700 hPa) (cold)\n1 [DV HJ (700 hPa) (cold) 2 DV HJ (700 hPa) (warm)] .\nTo have DV HJ (700 hPa) (warm) , DV HJ (700 hPa) (cold) adjacent to Taiwan, one expects [DV HJ (700 hPa) (cold) 2 DV HJ (700 hPa) (warm)] is an anomalous southwesterly flow, as shown in Fig. 13f . The inequality from Eq. (6) can be substantiated. This inequality explains why the TS activity in the Taipei basin can be triggered by weaker southwesterlies during the cold ENSO phase by other southwesterlies during the warm ENSO phase. Apparently, the afternoon thunderstorm activity/rainfall is affected by the ENSO cycle through the impact of the P-J oscillation (Figs. 13d and 13e ) and Lefever (1926) to generate a standard deviational ellipse (Bui et al. 2012 ) (http:// cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aspace/index.html; information on R is available online at http://www.r-project.org/).\nthe TS anomalous circulation (Figs. 13a and 13b ) on the monsoon southwesterly flow adjacent to northwestern Taiwan and, in turn, on the sea breeze into the Taipei basin, which affects TS activity."}, {"section_title": "c.

Nevertheless, the minimal scatter for P TS versus (2= \u00c1 Q) TS in the Taipei basin confirms P TS is primarily maintained by the convergence of water vapor flux from the large-scale monsoon circulation. Although 2= \u00c1 Q is a local hydrological process, it is related to the largescale circulation through the following relationship:\n. In other words, the largescale circulation [illustrated by (x Q , Q)] P TS is maintained through (2= \u00c1 Q) TS . This hydrological process will be elaborated upon in section 3c(2). It was already shown in section 3a that the TS days and rainfall are more in the Taipei basin during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase compared to the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase, and the rainfall-producing efficiency is also doubled during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase compared to the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase. In Fig. 14, the cold, normal, and warm TS days for the P TS versus (2= \u00c1 Q) TS distributions are marked by blue times signs, red plus signs, and green open circles, respectively. Even though all three groups belong to different hydrological regimes, they follow linear relationships between P TS and (2= \u00c1 Q) TS . The TS (warm) clusters contribute the smallest values in the diagram of P TS versus (2= \u00c1 Q) TS (Fig. 15c) , while the TS (cold) clusters provide larger values (Fig. 15a) , and TS (normal) provides values between these two extremes (Fig. 15b) . Evidently, large-scale circulation converges more (less) water vapor toward the Taipei basin to maintain larger (smaller) TS rainfall during the cold (warm) DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) ENSO phase. This inference will be substantiated in section 3c(2)."}, {"section_title": "2) MAINTENANCE OF THUNDERSTORM RAINFALL DURING WARM AND COLD ENSO PHASES", "text": "The departure of composite x Q (P, Q D , x Q ) TS for all TS days over a season from the seasonal-mean (P, Q D , x Q ) HJ , D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS , provides a clear picture of how hydrological conditions maintain the TS rainfall. The departure of seasonalmean (P, Q D , x Q ) HJ from its 21-seasonal-mean (hPi, hQ D i, HJ , would provide some perspective on the interannual variation of (P, Q D , x Q ) HJ . The composite D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS undergoes an interannual variation, but the interannual variation for D(P, Q D , x Q ) HJ would provide extra information on the impact of the interannual East/Southeast Asian summer monsoon circulation variation on (P, Q D , x Q ) TS .\nAs shown by Xie et al. (2006) , monsoon rainfall (Fig. 15a) over the TS season appears to be primarily offshore on the windward side of the western coasts of the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Taiwan, southern Japan, and the Philippines. Thus, the divergent component of water vapor flux hQ D i HJ converges toward the rainfall center, stretching from the upper Bay of Bengal to the southern Philippine Sea. The composite D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS chart (Fig. 15b) exhibits a short-wave train emanating from the Bay of Bengal along the northern rim during the summer monsoon rainfall center to the North Pacific east of Japan. However, the convergence center of D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS for this short-wave train is anchored at Taiwan. This indicates the TS rainfall is maintained by the enhanced convergence of water vapor flux from the Taiwan vicinity to maintain the local TS rainfall.\nThe aforementioned short-wave train of composite D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS during the cold (Fig. 15c) and warm (Fig. 15d) DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) ENSO phases shows the following change: a convergence center of water vapor flux over Taiwan is enlarged/intensified during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) ENSO phases, while this center is reduced/weakened during the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase. To further confirm this comparison, the D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS (cold) 2D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS (warm) differences are shown in Fig. 15e . A convergence center for this difference around Taiwan confirms this argument.\nNext, the impact of the interannual variation for\nThe response of seasonal-mean (P, Q D , x Q ) HJ to the interannual tropical Pacific SST anomalies is reflected by the departure of Figs. 16a  and 16b , respectively. The climatological hPi HJ center extends from the Philippine Sea westward to the Bay of Bengal, embedded in the hx Q i HJ center with hQ D i HJ converging toward this rainfall center (Fig. 15a) . This rainfall center intensifies during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase by a wet tongue of D(P, x Q ) HJ (cold) sandwiched to its north and south by the east-west-elongated dry zones of D(P, x Q ) HJ (cold). Taiwan is located close to the northern edge of this wet tongue, so this wet tongue should strengthen the convergent cell for D(Q D ) TS across Taiwan. In contrast, a slightly northward-migrated dry tongue for D(P, x Q ) HJ (warm) during the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) FIG. 11 . The scatter diagram for the 700-hPa wind speed jV SW (700 hPa)j measured by radiosondes launched from the Panchiao station (WMO 46688) at 0000 UTC for TS days and the maximum surface sea-breeze jV SB j at this station for the corresponding TS days. The mean jV SW (700 hPa)j and jV SB j for the cold and warm ENSO phases are marked by the large open blue and red times signs, respectively, and the blue and pink dashed elllipses mark their standard deviations, respectively.\nphase replaces the wet D(P, x Q ) HJ (cold) tongue. This dry tongue is parallel to its north and south by the east-westelongated wet zones. During these climate conditions, Taiwan is located within the dry zone. Therefore, the convergence of water vapor flux to maintain the TS rainfall in the Taipei basin weakens. It is clear that the anomalous wet zone during the cold DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase enhances the TS rainfall in the Taipei basin, but the opposite change occurs during the warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phase. The response of the East/Southeast Asian summer monsoon circulation to the tropical Pacific SST anomalies is the P-J oscillation presented in Figs. 13d and 13e , respectively, for the cold and warm DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) phases. The monsoon rainfall also undergoes a corresponding change shown in Figs. 16a and 16b for these two extreme ENSO phases, respectively. A spatially quadrature relationship emerges from the contrast between the Taiwan cell of the P-J pattern (the right-hand column in Fig. 13 ) and the convergent zone of D(P, Q D , x Q ) HJ south of Taiwan (the left-hand column in Fig. 16 ). This spatially quadratic relationship also appears between D(P, Q D , x Q ) TS (the right-hand column in Fig. 16 ) and DV TS (700 hPa) (the left-hand column in Fig. 14) . The impact of the global-scale ENSO cycle on the basin-scale thunderstorm activity/rainfall is established through the effects of the P-J pattern and the associated hydrological processes in East/Southeast Asia."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "Summer is a dry season in northern Taiwan, but in contrast, the Taipei basin has its maximum rainfall during summer. Afternoon thunderstorms become active in the basin during June and produce the majority of annual rainfall. Observed by C7, an increase or reduction in the TS rainfall may exert a significant impact on many aspects of the Taipei basin's environment: water supply, urban pollution (affected by the ventilation of the basin's air mass through the land-sea breeze), land/sea traffic hazards, and so on. Thus, any interannual variation of TS activity/rainfall in this basin can affect the wellbeing of the region's three million inhabitants. Following C14, this study provides a systematic definition of TS [DV TS (cold) 1 V HJ (cold)] observed from the anomalous circulations adjacent to Taiwan. The ENSO impact on the afternoon thunderstorm activity/rainfall in the Taipei basin goes through the P-J oscillation and the TS anomalous circulation on the monsoon southwesterlies adjacent to northwest Taiwan and the sea breeze into the Taipei basin. 3) Large-scale hydrological environment of TS activity-\nThe linear relationship P ; 2= \u00c1 Q is confirmed by the diagonal line of the scatter diagram of P (abscissa) versus 2= \u00c1 Q (ordinate) for all TS days over the Taipei basin. Because both ratios P TS (cold)/P TS (warm) and\nare about 200%, the TS rain-producing efficiency in the cold ENSO phase is about twice that compared to the warm ENSO phase. From the perspective of largescale monsoon circulation, the impact of ENSO on the local hydrological cycle in the Taipei basin would go through these two regional hydrological processes in company with the monsoon circulation change reflected by the P-J oscillation and the TS activity.\nIn conclusion, the summer afternoon TS activity in the Taipei basin is maintained by the warm, moist air transported by the monsoon southwesterly flow across Taiwan. In contrast, the summer afternoon TS activity is suppressed by the cold, dry northeasterly flow over Taiwan. The synoptic conditions associated with the summer afternoon TS activity in the Taipei basin can be affected by the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) and DSST HJ (WTP) anomalies through the Pacific-Japan Oscillation in such a way that the southwesterlies are stronger (weaker) during the warm (cold) ENSO phase. Actually, DT d (cold) , DT d (warm) over the entire troposphere in the Taipei basin indicates the RH is larger during the cold phase than the warm phase because of the enhance afternoon TS activity in the Taipei basin.\nFIG. 14. The scatter diagram for the P TS estimated with data from the surface stations in the Taipei basin (0300-0900 UTC) and (2= \u00c1 Q) TS estimates with reanalysis data over the average of 0600-1200 UTC over the domain in Fig. 2 . Times signs, plus signs, and open circles show the scatter for the cold, warm, and normal ENSO phases, respectively. The gray straight lines are the linear least squares fit for the cold, normal, and warm years, respectively, for the equations shown at the bottom of the three scatter diagrams. The impacts of TS activity/rainfall on daily weather and urban climate in the Taipei basin are important issues regarding the basin-scale weather forecast and climate changes. New findings from the present study may be utilized as a guide in searching for a direction to improve the forecast of afternoon TS activity and the simulation of urban climate in the Taipei basin:\n1) The skill of forecasting TS activity/rainfall in the basin depends on the skill of simulating the East/Southeast Asian monsoon and its hydrological environment. Thunderstorm activity/rainfall in the Taipei basin undergoes a process of interannual variation, opposite the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) index through the interannual variation of the East/Southeast Asian monsoon circulation. The forecast model must be sufficiently sensitive to respond to this interannual variation (Niyogi et al. 2011) . Rain-producing efficiency during the TS occurrence day is enhanced (reduced) during the cold (warm) DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) ENSO phase. Accuracy of the hydrological response of the forecast model to the interannual variation of the southwest-east monsoon circulation pattern is a critical component for capturing the convection-allowing configurations of the weather forecast model (e.g., Kain et al. 2006) . 2) Summer is a dry season in northern Taiwan, but the maximum rainfall in the Taipei basin occurs during summer. In addition to this unusual seasonal rainfall variation, interannual variations for the TS activity and rainfall in the Taipei basin are opposite the DSST HJ (Ni\u00f1o-3.4) impact. It is inferred from this close relationship between the Taipei urban climate and the SST climate index that a downscale interaction exists between the largescale monsoon circulation and the small-scale urban climate. This interaction is accomplished through the impacts of the southwesterly monsoon flow through the P-J oscillation and the associated East/Southeast Asian hydrological environment during the afternoon TS activity in the Taipei basin. This impact should be simulated through a proper nesting between the spatially and/or temporally, high-resolution, local climate model, and the large-scale East/Southeast Asian monsoon climate model, as suggested by Arritt and Rummukainen (2011) .\nFIG.

For convenience, rainfall amounts for these three datasets are denoted as P (station), P (TRMM), and P (GBT), respectively. As noted by Duan et al. (2015) , the TRMM PR exhibits terrain bias.
