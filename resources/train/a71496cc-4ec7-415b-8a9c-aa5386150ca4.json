[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Since the emergence of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel Coronavirus disease has spread widely to become a global pandemic, with nearly twenty five million individuals infected worldwide and resulting in the death of >800,000 individuals. 1 The causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus.\nDuring its transmission, the virus has differentiated into at least 10 clades globally and is continuously evolving. 2 This has implications in genetic epidemiology, surveillance, contact tracing and the development of long term strategies for mitigation of this disease. 3 The recent availability of whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 from across the world deposited in public databases provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the dynamics and evolution of the pathogen. The availability of genomic data in a public repository like GISAID 4 also provides wider access to the resources and enables researchers across the globe to address pertinent hypotheses. Likewise, this gave us a unique scope to understand the introduction, evolution, and spread of the virus in India and understand it in the context of global clades circulating across the world.\nIn this manuscript, we report the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates predominantly sampled from the states of Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Further, we systematically analysed the phylogenetic clusters of genomes from India and characterised a unique cluster of sequences (Clade I/A3i), which could not be classified into any of the previously annotated global clades. Isolates forming this cluster were predominant in a number of states and characterized by a shared set of four genetic variants. The cluster potentially arose from a single outbreak followed by a rapid spread across the country. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of the novel and predominant cluster of sequences from India and suggests its distribution beyond India in many countries in South Asia, Oceania and America.\nA c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4"}, {"section_title": "Sample processing and sequencing", "text": "Samples were collected and processed as per the guidelines of the Institutional Ethics Committee.

The age of the patients ranged from 1.5-80 years, with >80%\n(275 out of 303) within the age bracket of 20-60 years ( Figure S1A) . A total of 294 samples were sequenced using an amplicon-based approach with a target of ~2 million paired-end reads per sample.

This cluster of sequences could not be classified into any of the 10 clade sequences defined by Nextstrain, and did not share the nucleotide compositions that define any of the 10 clades. 17 This cluster was found to have diverged from the A1a and A3 clades and most, but not all of the sequences shared a variant (L3606F in ORF1a) with members of the A3 and A1a clades. We propose to call this the A3i clade in cognisance of this fact. To avoid potential conflict with the nomenclature followed by Nextstrain, we, therefore, define this cluster of sequences as Clade I/A3i, for the unique occurrence as a dominant cluster amongst SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from India and also since this clade is largely formed by sequences from India ( Figure S2, S3) .\nA c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 The other clusters encompassed the B4, A3, A1a, B, and B1 clades with 52 and 17 genomes falling into the clusters A3 and B4 respectively and clades A1a, B and B1 having one genome each.

This distinct cluster could not be classified into any of the 10 clade annotations as described by Nextstrain, and was characterized by a unique combination of four variants which was shared by over 95% of the isolates falling in the cluster. The cluster was predominantly found in genomes from India; though additional members could also be found from genomes deposited in other countries, they form a minor proportion of the genomes from the respective countries. As per Nextstrain, the Indian genomes constituted over 30% of the global genomes for this cluster.\nIn-depth analysis of the genome cluster suggests a comparable rate of nucleotide substitutions with other predominant clades, though a gene-wise estimate of substitution suggests a distinct mode of evolution, driven by the Nucleocapsid (N) and Membrane (M) A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 12 genes, and sparing of the Spike (S) gene in contrast to predominant diversity in the Spike (S) gene in A2a clade, the globally predominant clade. 27 However, it has not escaped our attention that host genetic factors could modulate the evolution of the virus genome, and without large-scale host-genomic studies, the causal relationships cannot be conclusively established.\nThe cluster suggests a potential single introduction around February, followed by a country- "}, {"section_title": "Patient Consent Statement:", "text": "A written consent from the patients was obtained wherever applicable.
