[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus is a member of family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae, which is large and enveloped RNA virus having the largest genomes (25-32 kb) among RNA viruses (Richman et al., 2016) . The genome sequence of human coronavirus (HCoV) has four genera as Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2), Gamacoronavirus (\u03b3) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4). Among all four HCoV, \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronaviruses are pathogenic (Woo et al., 2012) . The domestic mammals (swine, mice, bat etc.) and\nhumans are suggested to be the origin and host for \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronaviruses, respectively (Lim et al., 2016) . However, \u03b3 and \u03b4 coronaviruses are originated from birds and beluga whale, respectively (Geng et al., 2013) . There are six \u03b2 coronaviruses which infect the human respiratory system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoV) are very infectious among the six existing HCoV [HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV] (Li et al., 2005) . The SARS-CoV was originated from bats and birds in China, in 2002, with the common cold as a general symptom (Kuiken et al., 2003) . A report suggested that approximately 8000 patients were infected by SARC-CoV, worldwide (Gual et al., 2003) . However, the mortality rate due to SARS-CoV infection was found to be ~ 10 % . In 2014, in Saudi Arabia, new HCoV, MERS-CoV, similar to SARC-CoV was reported with a mortality rate of 35 % (Morra et al., 2018; Terada et al., 2014) . The MERS-CoV was originated from bats similar to SARS-CoV, later camels become an intermediate host (Crossley et al., This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved similarity with RaTG13 CoV. In another study, it has been reported that the genome of SARS-COV-2 is ~ 87.6-87.7 % similar to ZC45 and ZXC21 (Woo et al., 2005) . The bats are suggested to be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. The genome size of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be 29.9 kb . However, this value for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are 27.9 and 30.1 kb, respectively (Wit et al., 2016) . The genome of COVID-19 has more similarity with SARS-CoV with a few changes. The amino acid substitution is not observed in COVID-19, which is there in NSP7 and NSP13 (Lam et al., 2020) . The infection and transportation of COVID-19 depend on the mutation of NSP2 and NSP3 (Li et al., 2016) . Both SARC-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammatory cytokines which is the main cause for the damage of human organs .

All rights reserved\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has 6-11 open read frames (ORFs) (Paraskevis et al., 2020) . Two-third of the viral RNA is found in the first ORF (ORF1a/b), which encode 16 non-structural proteins (NSP) and also convert two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Li et al., 2016) . However, the structural proteins such as spike glycoprotein, envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid protein are translated by the rest of ORFs . These four structural proteins are responsible for the functioning of COVID-19. The spike glycoprotein binds the virus with receptor angiotensin converting enzyme . The transport of nutrients and development of envelope is associated with membrane proteins . However, nucleocapsid and envelope protein is responsible for the host immune function (Cui et al., 2019) . Fig.1 demonstrates the origin, host and structural layout of SARC-CoV-2 . The genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from USA, Italy and India are ~ 99 % similar to Chinese SARS-CoV-2, while Nepal SARS-CoV-2 genomes are 100 % similar to that of the Wuhan (Sardar et al., 2020) . The genome mutation of SARS-CoV-2 from USA, Italy, India, China and Nepal has been carried out using real-time (rRT-PCR) method to understand the effect of genome sequence on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The sample for gene sequencing was taken from SARC-CoV-2 infected patients of Jin Yintan Hospital (Wuhan, China) for analyses of open read frame ORF1b and N genes (Thompson et al., 1994) . The sequence of both, ORF1b and N genes are represented in Table 1 (Chu et al., 2020) . The expected amplicon sizes for ORF1b and N genes were calculated to be 132 and 110 bp, respectively. The amplification efficiency of both, ORF1b and N genes were calculated to 99.6% and 95.4%, respectively. The reported gene was a perfect match with the available standard data for gene sequencing (Accession number: MN908947) (Kumar et al., 2018) . Table 1 .

The attachment of S-protein with ACE-2 is one of the major factors for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 (Aniket et al., 2020) . There are several host factors such as, inter feroninducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), which inhibit the attachment of HCoV. The attachment with previously existing HCoV such as SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E is inhibited by IFITMs protein due to its antiviral resistance against RNA viruses . Recently, the binding efficiency of SAR-CoV-2 is reported to be approximately 10-20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV (Letko et al.,\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved 2020). The research outcome suggested that SARS-CoV-2 attach more easily than other HCoV (Shereen et al., 2020) .\nThis article is protected by copyright.

In the intercellular region, spike proteins interact with HCoV which shows genomic RNA in the cytoplasm.

The virus can cause heart muscle inflammation called myocarditis, making it more difficult for the heart to pump (Burrell et al., 2005) . The heart attack can be one of the reasons for the deaths of COVID-19 patients (Christopher et al., 2020) . Generally, ACE inhibitors are prescribed for hypertension (Ge et al., 2013) . Therefore, the dose of ACE has to be stopped for cardio patients infected with COVID-19 (He et al., 2006) . Cardiovascular patients need more attention during the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. In another study, it has been recorded that the use of antiviral medicines can cause heart failure and other cardiovascular problems (Sakabe et al., 2013) . The SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with the cardiovascular problem have a higher fatality rate as compared to general COVID-19 patients. In another study, it has been reported that the use of ACE for cardio patients increases fatality. The fatality rate for COVID-19 patients using ACE is higher (~ 36.8 %)\nthan that of without ACE (25.6 %) .\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, the control of blood glucose level in diabetes patients can improve the antiviral activity (Michael et al., 2020) . Blood sugar level may increase in diabetic patients which reduce the production of insulin, resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The body begins breaking down energy fats, resulting in an accumulation of blood ketones, which make the blood more acidic resulting in the serious heath complications. The diabetic patients have a higher risk of pneumonia such as COVID-19 as it causes due to inflammation of the air sacs of the lungs.\nTherefore, diabetes patients (above 2 years) have been advised to have pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccines.\nACE-2 has been recognized as the potent receptor of SARS-CoV-2. The ACE-2 has been suggested as a medicine for the treatment of diabetes because it reduces inflammation .Therefore, the diabetes and COVID-19 patients treated with ACE-2 have higher risk of infection (Zachary, 2020) . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) has been reported as the receptor for MERS-CoV (Letko et al., 2020) . In addition, DPP-4 is used for reducing the blood glucose level and therefore, DPP-4 can protect the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fadinil et al., 2020) . Another research outcome suggested that diabetes patients are not susceptible towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the fatality rate is quite higher than that of normal SARS-CoV-2 patients (Zoppini et al., 2018) . In summary, the diabetes patients have a higher risk of complications due to the lower immune system which increases the fatality rate. Several reports suggested that old age diabetes patients have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to young diabetes patients. It is important to notice that COVID-19 patients display symptoms very similar to flu and in many cases, it results in death of the patients in a very short time. Therefore, better treatment initially requires accurate disease diagnosis.\nDue to very fast disease progression, non-specific symptoms, and death of the patient in the short duration requires detection scheme sensitive and selective enough to accurately indicate this disease.\nImportantly, the COVID-19 virus is a single-stranded and fast mutating, which requires sensors to be robust, insensitive to mutation, rapid and very sensitive to viral detection on the onset of the diseases with minimal false positive results. For this reason, PCR based detection kits are the best suited.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, the treatment of COVID-19 patients is mainly focused on symptomatic and respiratory support (Colson et al., 2020) . Initially, the oxygen therapy is given to all COVID-19 patients (Marmor et al., 2016) .\nAlthough, the specific drug for SARS-CoV-2 is not discovered till date, the medical observers are attempting with different antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 infection .\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved patients demonstrated that the combination of a new antiviral drug remdesivir and chloroquine slowed down the growth of SARS-CoV-2 (Abdul et al., 2017) . The mechanism for the effectiveness of chloroquine against COVID-19 is still unclear. However, few reports suggested that chloroquine increases the pH of endosome which can inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV (Abdul et al., 2017) .\nHowever, another report suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit the generation of sialic acid biosynthesis by inhibiting quinone reductase 2, which affect the ACE-2 glycosylation in human cells. In addition, the immune module of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has anti-viral property (Tricou et al., 2010) . In contrast, high dose of chloroquine increases the toxicity which \nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved infection. The trial of chloroquine and remdesivir has been performed on Vero E6 cells. During the trial, chloroquine and remdesivir were pretreated with the drugs for 1 h (Full time) [Fig. 5 ]. Following this, the virus was introduced (2 h). The mixture of the viral drug was extracted and cells were cultured in the medium containing drug. However, for \"Entry\" treatment, the drugs were applied to cells for 1 h prior to viral attachment. Drugs were introduced for 2 h for the \"Post-entry\" trial and retained until the end of the experiment (Fig. 5 ).\nThis article is protected by copyright.

The SARS-CoV-2 patients were treated with traditional decoctions such as qingfeipaidu decoction (QPD), gancaoganjiang decoction, sheganmahuang decoction, qingfeitouxiefuzheng recipe, etc . Chinese government treated approximately 60,000 COVID-19 patients using these conventional decoctions (Publicity Department of the People's Republic of China; 2020). This treatment is helpful for the treatment of mild cases .\nHowever, it has been reported that sever cases were recovered 2 days earlier than that of treated with hydroxychloroquine. It has been reported that the oral liquid of Shuanghuanglian can be used to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lin et al., 2002) . However, another report suggested that the oral liquid of baicalin, chlorogenic acid and for sythin in Shuanghuanglian is more effective to inhibit a variety of viruses and bacteria (Lu et al., 2000) . According to the Chinese research report, both, mild and severe COVID-19 infected patients were treated with traditional medicine. However, it is more suitable for the treatment of mild cases.\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved risk of organ damage. The plasma of recovered patients is used to make the plasma globulin, specifically for the SARC-CoV-2. However, this globulin has adverse effect to human health. It has been reported that after testing in 10 adult COVID-19 infected patients, suggested that 200 mL of convalescent plasma saturated the patient's condition after 3 days of treatment (Duan et al., 2020).\nHowever, after 7 days high level antibodies were produced which remove the viremia. Another research report suggested that the convalescent plasma treatment improves the breathing of patients and remove the mechanical ventilator after 3 days of treatment (Shen et al., 2020) . The condition of plasma donor is an influential factor for this treatment. A generalized criteria has been adopted for the plasma donor which are as follows,\n1. The body temperature of a plasma donor must be normal for more than 3 days.\n2. The plasma donor has at least two consecutive negative reports of SARS-CoV-2.\n3. The plasma has to be collected from the donor who has plasmapheresis in the range of 21 CFR 630.15.\n4. The donor has a positive serological test report at the time of plasma collection.\nThe plasma therapy can be an effective treatment for COVID-19 if it is started at the early stage of infection and considering the donor and acceptor eligibility factors. In addition to the success of convalescent plasma therapy, a research report suggested the risks factor associated with plasma treatment. The plasma treatment may fail in a few patients which increases the COVID-19 infection.\nIt can also affect the immune system of the patient, which subsequently, causes the re-infection. Apart from this risk factor, plasma therapy has been potentially used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients worldwide.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

However, longer and rigid temporary social distancing was not more effective to reduce the basic production rate of COVID-19 (Lu et al., 2020) . Fig. 6 represents the dynamics of COVID-19 infection without considering seasonal effect. The reproduction rate was taken constant (2.2) during the entire scenarios. The success of social distancing ranged from zero to a 60% reduction in R 0 . The long-term (20 weeks) social distancing has the lowest average peak and total outbreak duration. The more success rate (20-40%) has been recorded in long-term social distancing as compared to temporary distancing scenarios (Lu et al., 2020) . \nThis article is protected by copyright.

It was, therefore, concluded that nasal and pharyngeal swabs displayed poor sensitivity. Other study reported the detection of COVID-19 infection using RT-LAMP method, which is a rapid visual detection kit . The detection employed colour change of reaction mixture, from orange (negative) to green (positive) and also utilized turbidity (650 nm) measurements (Shirato et al., 2020) . Primers used for the detection of Orf2ab and spike gene segments are provided in Table 3 . The pseudo-virus, ranging from 1 copy/\u00b5L-1x10 8 copies/ \u00b5L was detected using these primers (Park et al., 2020) .\nIn essence, it is observed that RT-LAMP methods have been used in most of the cases for the \npolymeric nanoparticles, polyethyleneimine (PEI) with modified fat chains and Poly (b-amino) esters (PABEs) were adapted to deliver the DNA and mRNA (Sonaje et al., 2012) . In another study, it has been reported that chitosan nanoparticles were used for delivery of antiviral drugs to the infected patients. Recently, Novochizol (containing chitosan nanoparticles) is used for the treatment of infected areas, especially lungs infection due to COVID-19 . Lately, graphene has been recognized as an alternative material for the treatment of COVID-19 infection due to its antibacterial and antiviral efficiency (Palmieri et al., 2020)."}, {"section_title": "Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cells and replication", "text": "The novel SARS-CoV-2 has a similar interaction with host cells as observed in SARS-CoV.
