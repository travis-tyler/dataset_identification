[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Objectives Social support and engagement are related to smoking behavior in general populations, but it is unknown whether these measures of social integration as experienced by recent mothers are related to longitudinal maternal smoking patterns. The purpose of this study is, first, to describe longitudinal patterns of maternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy through the early childhood parenting years, as well as variation in these patterns; and second, to examine these patterns in relation to social integration, emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors. Methods Among 9050 mothers of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (a nationally representative probability sample of children born in 2001), we estimated trajectories of maternal smoking with a general growth mixture model and examined how baseline predictors are associated with these patterns over a 5-6 year period beginning 3 months prior to pregnancy. Results A 5-class solution identified trajectories of nonsmokers (70.5 %), temporary quitters (9.4 %), pregnancy-inspired quitters (3.3 %), delayed initiators (5.1 %), and persistent smokers (11.7 %). Modifiable risk factors included postpartum alcohol consumption and behavioral cues from coresident smokers, while breastfeeding beyond 6 months and social engagement through religious service attendance were protective characteristics. Conclusions for Practice Prevention of and treatment for maternal perinatal and postpartum smoking is best informed by mothers' emotional, behavioral and sociodemographic characteristics.\nReligious service attendance, but not measures of social support or social engagement, was a protective factor for maternal smoking trajectories."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In addition to overall risks to women's health from smoking, women's smoking during pregnancy as well as close maternal-child contact postpartum introduces health risks to children. However, the experience of pregnancy, accompanied by changes in nicotine metabolism, and the transition to parenting may disrupt women's smoking patterns. Postpartum, there is a disturbing tendency for smoking mothers to assume no further risks to their child's health [9] . While there has been some success in achieving late pregnancy smoking cessation, only a few (unsuccessful) efforts have targeted postpartum women to prevent relapse [6] . Investigating early modifiable risk factors of longitudinal smoking patterns from preconception through the early parenting period broadens the intervention window to engage clinicians across specialties, allowing for a life course perspective in supporting screening and treatment follow through to reduce smoking among women.\nDespite the value to prevention and cessation intervention research, variation in smoking trajectories among pregnant women and recent mothers has rarely been investigated. The few studies exploring these patterns [12, 31, 32] focused solely on individual characteristics to describe smoking trajectories, leaving important questions unanswered regarding the social context in which trajectories of maternal smoking behavior develop. Theory suggests social interaction and relationships-both informal (e.g. family, friends, and neighbors) and formal (e.g. organizational involvement)-affect individual health [23] . The nature and measurement of 'social context' in empirical studies have varied widely and been categorized in multiple schema. Cohen et al. [8] refers to social integration, distinguishing participation in social groups from the informational, instrumental, and emotional support garnered through social interactions. Drawing on Link and Phelan [26] , Berkman et al. [2] connect social integration to health outcomes through explication of upstream economic and cultural forces (the macro-social context) that shape downstream micro-level psychosocial processes. These micro-level dynamics affect health through multiple pathways including social support, social engagement, and person-to-person contact. For example, social engagement may be characterized by neighborhood organizational participation as well as informally getting together with friends and neighbors.\nConsistent with this theoretical framework, the impact of measures of social integration on smoking behavior has received some empirical support. A handful of studies have examined the relationship between social integration and women's prenatal smoking. Specifically, social support provided to women who were pregnant has been found to be associated with nonsmoking during pregnancy as well as smoking cessation during pregnancy (e.g., [15, 37] . Further research has examined social engagement as measured through participation in religious services indicating that, controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics, the protective effect of religious participation extends to women who are pregnant. For example, religious service attendance was negatively associated with prenatal smoking (e.g., [22] . Further, women who were smokers were more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy if they reported religious service attendance [15] .\nSeveral important gaps have been identified: First, with the exception of Gillum and Sullins' [15] study which included the preconception period, these studies focused solely on prenatal smoking, leaving the relationship between measures of social integration and post-childbirth maternal smoking behavior unexamined. Second, these studies have left out potentially important components of social engagement identified in other population-based research, such as community organizational participation and informal interaction with friends and neighbors. Social engagement may engender positive and/or negative social comparisons, influences, or cognitive interactions, and thus influence individual health behavior and choice [2] . Further, studies of social support and engagement associated with prenatal maternal smoking have failed to consider these relationships in the context of an array of emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic characteristics. While studies of maternal employment have yielded mixed results [16, 18] , perinatal smoking is consistently associated with lower levels of education and income, being single, white race/ethnicity, maternal depression, alcohol use, limited or no breastfeeding (e.g., [20, 32, 35] ), and co-residence with a smoker [21] . However, little is known about the combined effects of social integration, emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors.\nAddressing these gaps, we investigated measures of social integration as potential protective factors in influencing longitudinal maternal smoking patterns. Using data from a large nationally representative sample, we examined the direct relationship between women's social support and social engagement and their longitudinal smoking trajectories from pre-conception through prenatal and postpartum periods with follow up extending 5-6 years after childbirth. Based on prior research regarding current smoking by women who are pregnant, we hypothesized that measures of social integration would differentially distinguish longitudinal trajectories of smoking from a pattern of consistent non-smoking, with implications for smoking cessation treatment programs and guidelines for women during this transitional life course phase."}, {"section_title": "Methods Data Source and Study Sample", "text": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-B), nationally representative of the 2001 US birth cohort, provides data on 10,700 children and their parents collected when the child was approximately 9 months (baseline), 2 years, 4 years, and 5-6 years of age (kindergarten).

From a list of 13 possible personal relationships, respondents were directed to mark all potential sources of support regarding four scenarios: feeling depressed or confused about a problem; needing to borrow money for an emergency; needing help in the middle of the night for an emergency; and seeking advice about child care. We coded these 13 potential support sources into three categorical sources of support: family (excludes co-residents); friends (including coworkers, church members, and/or an ex-spouse); and professional (e.g. clergy, health/social workers, emergency services, childcare providers). Following Cabrera et al. [4] , three (family, friends, and professional sources) separate 3-point ordinal composite support variables were created. Social engagement was represented by baseline measures of social connectedness (frequency with which the respondent mother got together to socialize with friends or neighbors following the birth of the child; 5-point scale); community service (whether or not they participate in any activity, e.g. school, sports, neighborhood, or church volunteerism); and religious service attendance (frequency in the past year; 5-point scale)."}, {"section_title": "Emotional and Behavioral Covariates", "text": "Based on the literature regarding associations of women's emotional state and behavioral choices with their smoking behavior, we included an indicator of moderate or severe postpartum depression (marked by score of 10 or more on a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). We also examined an indicator of postpartum alcohol consumption and a three-category ordinal measure of the duration of breastfeeding. Women who reside with another smoker are also known to be a greater risk of smoking themselves, building on behavioral studies following smoking cues [38] and the theorized stimulation of desire [19] , and thus we include an indicator of their co-residence with one or more additional smokers. These measures were captured at the baseline survey.\nModerate to severe postpartum depression, maternal drinking behavior, duration of breastfeeding, and living with at least one other smoker were all predictors of being classified in a smoking trajectory versus the nonsmoking class (Table 3 "}, {"section_title": "Sociodemographic Covariates", "text": "Finally, we included in the models common sociodemographic covariates of smoking behavior measured at baseline: age; education; married/cohabitating; employment status; race/ethnicity; and household income."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Strategy", "text": "We used general growth mixture modeling (GGMM) [33] to empirically identify developmental trajectories of maternal smoking status. GGMM uses a categorical latent class variable in combination with continuous growth factors to explore population heterogeneity in the change process of the outcome of interest, i.e., whether the study population consists of two or more discrete classes of individuals with varying growth trajectories [33] .\nIn order to determine the functional form for individual change in our categorical smoking outcome [30] , we first estimated a series of growth models with fixed or random intercept, linear and nonlinear slopes using Mplus version 7.1. The origin of time was set at the baseline interview in order to accommodate inclusion of covariates measured at baseline. Thus, the methods support the association of baseline covariates with subsequent smoking measures [3] . Heterogeneity in maternal smoking trajectories was then explored by estimating models with increasing numbers of classes. The final model selection applying a random intercept and a random slope was based on substantive reasoning as well as standard criteria such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood ratio Chi-square test. Once the best fitting GGMM model was selected, we modeled the association of individual and social characteristics with class membership, via categorical logistic regression [28] . Given the strong associations of individual level covariates found in past studies, we chose a multi-step approach. In the first step, we separately estimated the effect of (a) measures of social integration to detect their role in the absence of other characteristics, (b) measures of emotional and behavioral measures hypothesized to predict smoking trajectories, and (c) known sociodemographic correlates of smoking behavior. In the second step, we estimated a model inclusive of social integration, emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic characteristics to test the relative impact of these measures in a fully adjusted model.\nWe accounted for missing data on smoking measures over time through full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation [1, 36] . In the sample of approximately 9050 mothers, 60 % had valid information on all six smoking measures and 20 % on five of the six measures. Complex sampling design was accounted for by computing robust standard errors using a sandwich estimator. Results were weighted to represent the 2001 birth cohort (weights provided by the National Center for Education Statistics)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Description of Maternal Smoking", "text": "A quarter of the sample smoked during the 3 months prior to conception (Table 1) .

In contrast, a class of ''persistent smokers'' (11.7 % of the sample) had a near 100 % chance of smoking over the six time periods with a slight reduction to an 80 % probability in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. A ''temporary quitters'' class (9.4 %) started with a high likelihood of smoking, but exhibited significant reduction during pregnancy. While temporary quitters also displayed an apparent increase in smoking following the child delivery, their smoking rate never returned to the preconception level and their smoking propensity continued to decrease throughout early parenthood. Two additional classes were identified: ''pregnancyinspired quitters'' (3.3 % of the sample) who returned to smoking briefly after delivery at a very low probably of 0.1 The 4, 5, and 6-class solutions were considered to be candidate models.

Attending religious services had a protective effect from assignment to any of the four smoking trajectories, with a higher frequency of religious service attendance reducing the likelihood of following persistent smoker (AORs range from 0.11 to 0.58) and temporary quitter trajectories (AOR ranges from 0.20 to 0.60). For pregnancy-inspired quitters and delayed initiators, the protective effect appeared only for more frequent religious service attendance (weekly; AORs = 0.36, 0.58 respectively).

Consistent with the education effect, reporting a household income of at least 130 % of the federal poverty line showed a protective effect from following a persistent smoking trajectory (AORs 0.30 to 0.62), and the highest income category was additionally associated with a reduced likelihood of being classified in the delayed initiator trajectory (AOR = 0.41).

Controlling for other characteristics, postpartum drinking was a risk factor for the three initiating/continuing smoking trajectories of (AORs range from 1.95 to 2.13).

The array of emotional and behavioral covariates no longer distinguished the pregnancy-inspired quitting trajectory from the nonsmoking trajectory. Effects of the sociodemographics characteristics were largely the same in this model adjusting for behavioral, emotional, and social integration characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we found that mothers of a nationally representative birth cohort were likely to follow one of five distinct trajectories of smoking behavior. Consistent with Mumford et al. [31] , in addition to nonsmokers, we found patterns of persistent smoking; temporary cessation limited to pregnancy; the encouraging pattern of women who quit smoking at pregnancy and remained smokefree through at least the child's entry to kindergarten; and, less promising, a group of women who initiated smoking following childbirth, as others have reported [39] . We found some evidence that women's social support and social engagement are associated with longitudinal patterns of maternal smoking behavior, with implications for the design of longitudinal epidemiological studies as well as interventions administered before, during, and after pregnancy. A perception of low social support from friends and low engagement in community service activities appears to be of particular relevance for distinguishing the risk of perinatal women and recent mothers following a persistent smoking trajectory. Regular participation in religious activities appears to be an even stronger protective factor. It may be that these social factors represent the social connections that Link and Phelan [27] identify as essential for the transmission of healthy beliefs averting persistent smoking behavior. However, as Link and Phalen further note, the expansion of human control over health outcomes leads to health disparities by sociodemographic measures of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Accordingly, in this study we find that the emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors known to predict maternal smoking show particularly strong effects. While this finding stands in contrast to the identified role of social support and engagement in general population smoking behavior, the relative differences may be attributed to measurement and analytic differences, life course position, or even crossnational cultural differences. Our study is consistent with prior findings that weekly religious service attendance protects against maternal smoking during pregnancy in the first year postpartum [35] and further distinguishes the strength of this significant association for women following persistent smoking, pregnancy-inspired quitting, and temporary quitting trajectories throughout the early parenting years. Although we theorized religious service attendance as a proxy of social engagement, there are multiple potential mechanisms. The protective effect of religious service attendance may also or alternatively be a result of healthy norms or expanded social networks [14] or, as Nonnemaker and colleagues [34] posit, social control or social support. However, to the extent that norms in a religious community reflect those in the mainstream culture (which in the US tends to censure smoking by women who are pregnant or caring for children), the religious norms per se have less impact [7] . This would suggest, for the purposes of prevention and cessation interventions, that support and engagement may be the dominant mechanisms through which public participation in religious communities affects maternal smoking behavior. Additionally, research investigating social influence or self-esteem as potential mechanisms may be constructive inputs to faith-based smoking prevention designs [2] . This is the first study to examine social engagement in terms of community service in association with maternal smoking. In our study, the community service activities of perinatal women and mothers of young children in the US were not significantly associated with their smoking behavior. This stands in contrast to general population cross-sectional research in Sweden [25] . Further research may elucidate the inevitable time constraints imposed by pregnancy and early parenting and therefore reveal little variation in community service participation regardless of smoking behavior; other potential explanations for our null findings may be the more generous employment leave benefits that extend into parenting elementary school children in Sweden which would provide more discretionary time, cultural differences in volunteering in the US, and/or the narrower definition of community service in ECLS-B data.\nAdjusting only for other measures of social integration, our results are consistent with past research [13, 29] in finding an inverse association between informal social support (from non-co-resident family, coworkers, church members, and/or an ex-spouse) and maternal smoking during pregnancy. In addition to examining informal social support, our study was designed to examine professional sources of support, including clergy, health/social workers, emergency services, and childcare providers. Also in line with prior research, support from professionals does not appear to be of comparable protective value to that received from family and friends. Health professionals may be most constructive by motivating women to identify individuals in their personal networks who could provide (emotional, instrumental, informational, other) forms of support to encourage nonsmoking [37] .\nBy controlling for a broad range of emotional, behavioral, and sociodemographic characteristics, this study expands the literature in assessing the relative strength of social integration measures' impact on maternal smoking. The results, adjusted for factors known to have a strong impact on women's postpartum smoking-including, for example, women's alcohol consumption and smoking by other household members-challenge findings of the role of social support. One reason may be that the ECLS-B measure of social support excludes persons who were coresidents of the respondent. For some women, ample support may be available at home, as in a recent study of the protective effect of partner support associated with maternal nonsmoking [5] . Moreover, the nature of the social relationship-i.e., intimate partners, family members, or friends-from which positive or negative support is derived may not be as important as the form or the content of support [24] . However, importantly, even should social support be insufficient to prevent maternal smoking directly, the effect of social support among maternal smokers may be beneficial for birth outcomes [13] .\nAlso for consideration is the extent to which measures we consider in this study to be sociodemographic factors may be proxies for broader social constructs, i.e. the upstream economic and cultural forces that Berkman et al. [2] label consisting of inequality, discrimination, labor market structure, and other macro factors. However, as Glass and McAtee [17] note, the influence of these constructs cannot be directly tested and we are left with moving downstream to look at non-material risk regulators (e.g. emotional/behavioral cues like smoking in the household, or psychosocial protective factors such as social support, connection, and participation in other community activities). To the extent that individual sociodemographics in this study of women's smoking behavior are proxies of or shaped by upstream social capital regulators (e.g., public policies, environmental factors), our findings do not negate the importance of broad social constructs but, rather, identify downstream individual characteristics and resources as the measurable representations of increased population-based risk for smoking [27] .\nLimitations of this study include potential exaggeration of weekly religious service attendance in self-reports to a live interviewer [10] . Also, limited variation in the measure of social connectedness may mask effects of that form of social engagement. Two of the six smoking time points are collected retrospectively which may introduce recall bias; however there is some evidence that measurement of maternal prenatal smoking collected post-delivery is a reliable approach in comparison to potential antenatal underreporting [11] . Additionally, research focusing on the mother's intimate partner suggests that the partner's own smoking status and commitment to supporting cessation, rather than broader measures of support, are key factors [21, 24, 37] . Further, as noted above there is some variation in the definitions and operationalization of the ECLS-B measures of social integration used in this study compared to other studies of social factors, which could account for different results. Finally, there are numerous independent factors (e.g., individual resilience to stress, hereditary risk for smoking, among others) that are risks for tobacco use. The current study does not rule out potential interplay between other covariates and social factors, and additional research to examine these complexities may benefit prevention and treatment design."}]
