The last decade has seen a paradigm shift by which AD is now perceived as a biological continuum that ranges all the way from normal cognition to dementia [1] . This new concept of AD recognizes the presence of a preclinical stage of AD (PreAD) that precedes the symptomatic phases of mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) and dementia due to AD (AD). PreAD is characterized by cognition within normal ranges and abnormal amyloid biomarkers as measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by positron emission tomography (PET). Studies show that amyloid biomarkers in cognitively healthy individuals can be altered decades before the clinical diagnosis of the disease and, therefore, the PreAD stage constitutes a window of opportunity for prevention therapies [2] .\nAt present, disease-modifying therapies have failed to show adequate efficacy in clinical trials and there is a growing consensus that trials should focus on earlier stages of the disease, prompting treatment options before irreversible neuronal loss. For example, the A4 (Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease) stands as the first secondary prevention trial aimed at preventing clinical symptom in cognitively healthy individuals with AD pathophysiology. However, prevention trials in the PreAD stage face crucial ethical and logistic challenges. Among other considerations, the slow buildup of amyloid accumulation requires long follow-up periods, and large amounts of individuals that should be screened in order to achieve adequate statistical power due to the small effect sizes. Critical to the success of AD prevention strategies, efficient, noninvasive and cost-effective methods of screening asymptomatic at-risk subjects for preventive trials need to be developed.\nMRI has proven to be instrumental at characterizing impending dementia and cognitive decline due to AD both for research and in the clinic. Structural changes in AD-vulnerable structures such as the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporal lobe constitute diagnostic markers of cognitive impairment [3, 4] and stand as valid marker for AD progression [4] . Moreover, other MRI modalities (Magnetic resonance spectroscopy [5] , diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) [6] , diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) [7, 8] ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [9] offer further complementary information and have unveiled specific AD alterations at different stages of the AD spectrum. On the other hand, to which extent MRI can resolve structural and connectivity changes at the preclinical asymptomatic stage of AD is still an area open for exploration [10, 11] .\nThe machine learning field has contributed a battery of tools for the automated classification of images from MRI. These tools have been applied to publicly available data resources dedicated to AD biomarker discovery. For example, the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [12] with the primary goal of testing whether serial MRI, PET and other biological markers, can be combined with clinical and neuropsychological assessment to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nWhile most studies are limited to structural T1 data, some recent efforts also cover other imaging modalities (e.g. ASL [13] ), To our knowledge, all machine learning efforts have been focused on diagnostic categories (MCI and AD) and the prediction of impending cognitive decline. For recent reviews see [14] . Whether machine learning can resolve the signature of preclinical AD remains to be investigated. Furthermore, no studies have analyzed the practical utility of MRI-based screening for the recruitment of cognitively normal volunteers in AD prevention trials.\nIn this work, we propose an MRI-driven machine learning protocol for the identification of cognitively normal individuals bearing abnormal amyloid levels to be implemented in clinical trial recruitment. Our proposed protocol, uses an MRI-based machine learning model to identify those subjects that are more likely to report abnormal amyloid biomarkers ( Figure 1 ). While it does not replace the gold standard measures, our method gains further knowledge from already acquired MRIs, minimizing the amount of PET or CSF tests, in exchange for non-invasive and cost-effective MRIs.\nWe assessed the utility of our system for PreAD screening based on MRI. To this end, our model was trained on features based on brain morphometry and structural connectivity using a subset of the ADNI cohort. Then, in a local cohort we validated the capacity of our model to prospectively detect amyloidpositive individuals. Finally, we determined the benefits of utilizing this classifier in the recruitment of subjects for secondary prevention trials. Taken as a whole, our results show that MRI modalities combined with machine learning can be used as a practical and cost-effective screening tool for AD prevention trials."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "CSF as well as T1 and DTI imaging data from 96 subjects of the ADNI cohort [12] was downloaded.\nThis subset of ADNI was selected to collect T1 and DTI images acquired on the same 3T scanner. In this sample, cognitively normal subjects were classified as PreAD if they had A\u03b242 CSF concentration Equivalent CSF, T1 and DTI imaging data was also acquired from our single-site cohort at the AD Unit Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB) including 87 subjects (40 NC, 12 Pre-AD, 21 MCI due to AD\n[MCI], 14 AD). Subjects were classified as PreAD if they were cognitively normal and A\u03b2+, defined according to recommended reference values with the INNOTEST ELISA (CSF A\u03b242 < 500 pg/mL) [10, 15, 16] . Criteria for MCI and AD have been previously reported [10] and, of note, only included A\u03b2+ patients. The local ethics committee approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent. T1-weighted images were segmented with the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) VBM8 toolbox [18] to obtain CSF, gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) probabilistic map. Then, a binary GM mask was formed by those voxels whose probability of belonging to GM was bigger than the probability of belonging to any other tissue. The AAL atlas [19] in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space was warped to each subject's T1 native space by mean of ANTS (UPENN, UVA and UIowa, USA; http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and using the DARTEL template obtained from the segmentation step. AAL maps were resliced to the T1 resolution using nearest neighbour interpolation and intersected with the GM mask. Volumes of all AAL regions were computed for every subject and normalized by total intracranial volume, calculated as the sum of the CSF, WM and GM masks."}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition and processing", "text": "Structural connectivity matrices (SCM) were also computed. To this end, AAL regions were superimposed to the DTI data using a similar protocol as the one described above. For tractography, to create a seed mask insensitive to grey matter volume changes, the interface between grey and white matter was dilated by one voxel. Then, probabilistic tractography was performed between pairs of AAL regions using FSL's ProbtrackX [20] (see further details in [16] )."}, {"section_title": "Overview of machine-learning methods", "text": "Our core machine learning pipeline was trained using the ADNI cohort dataset and tested with our local dataset from HCB ( Figure 2 ). The performance of the overall system was validated using CSF/PET biomarkers as gold-standard. The different acquisition protocols across medical centers introduce biases that are reflected in considerable variability in the distribution of imaging feature vectors. Thus, imaging features were normalized using Z-scores computed independently for each cohort to make data comparable and ensure standardized feature weights.\nDifferent filter feature selection methods have been compared for performance. We focused on balancing the relevance and the redundancy of the subset of features and three methods were evaluated for this purpose: F-test, mRMR-FCD and mRMR-FCQ [21] . The first two provided optimal performance in the selection of T1 and DTI imaging features respectively and were used throughout this study. We discard the use of wrapper and embedded feature selection methods since they are sensible to small sample sizes and result in high generalization error indicating severe overfitting of the training set.\nClassification. Cognitively normal individuals (NC and PreAD) in the two cohorts were used to train and test a classifier to predict dichotomous A\u03b2 status (either positive or negative). The ADNI cohort were used for training the classifier and the HCB data for test. In addition, two different classifiers were built, one based on T1 data alone and, another one, based on a combination of T1 and DWI data.\nDifferent classification schemes were tested out, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) with linear and gaussian kernels, random forests and k-nearest neighbours, being linear methods (logistic regression and linear-SVM) the most succesful, giving similar results in practice.\nFinally, due to slightly better performance and easier interpretation of the model, a binary LR classifier was used with L2 regularization and a penalty term \u03bb, optimized by a cross-validation strategy in the ADNI cohort. The LR classifier outputs a score for each subject that can be interpreted as the probability of being A\u03b2+ or A\u03b2-, as validated by the CSF biomarker readout.\nThe optimized model was tested for performance in terms of the savings in cost of clinical trial recruitment. To this end, precision (fraction of positive prediction correctly classified)), recall (also known as sensitivity, i.e. fraction of positive instances correctly classified) and specificity (fraction of negative instances correctly classified) were calculated using the dichotomized CSF A\u03b2 as gold standard. Precision-recall (PR) and receiver-operating curves (ROC) were also computed to evaluate method performance. See formulae in Appendix A.\nFor a target normal population of mean age 65, the prevalence of amyloid pathology was estimated to be 20% [2] . We employed a bootstrapping approach to simulate the required disease prevalence and iteratively repeat the classification protocol, yielding different splits of the test set at each run.\nAs a secondary analysis and for the sake of comparability with previously reported AD/MCI classifiers, an 'optimized diagnostic' classifier was derived with an identical pipeline and using NC, MCI and AD subjects in the two cohorts to discriminate between NC-MCI and NC-AD (for further details see Appendix B). Finally, we also assessed the performance of the classifier optimized to discriminate\nPreAD from NC to classify between of NC vs. the diagnostic categories (MCI and AD). Eq. [2] in terms of the precision (P), recall (R), and the costs of MRI and CSF tests estimated as CMRI = 700\u20ac, and CPET = 3000\u20ac. Cavg represents the average cost among the screening tests which may include additional costs (e.g. neuropsychological cognitive testing). For simplicity, we have performed the calculations solely using the imaging costs. A more general formulation of the savings structure and formulae is provided in Appendices C & D. Classifier thresholds and feature-extraction methods can be optimized to enhance the Savings in Eq. [1] visualized with precision-recall curves."}, {"section_title": "Savings.

Z-score transformed features concatenated from both modalities yield 4095-dimensional feature vectors. The optimal PR threshold that yields the highest savings highly depends on the number of features used in the classifier (Table 3, Figure 5 ). Feature selection with the mRm-FCD [21] Figure 5 shows the most DTI-connected regions, given by the weighted sum of the DTI-feature pairs and reflects their relevance in the identification of PreAD. For example, the Pallidum is highlighted as a ROI with multiple connections as well as by itself as a GMV feature.\nRemarkably, almost same performance (AUC) and cost savings are obtained for both T1 and the multimodal classifiers but precision is higher (P = 0.85) in the multimodal model than in the T1 case (P = 0.54) resulting in larger savings with regards to participant burden (76.5%).

On the other hand, the classifier optimized to discriminate between NC and PreAD subjects yielded an AUC<0.20 to discriminate among NC and the diagnostic categories (i.e. MCI, AD). For further details see Appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our work investigates the automated screening of PreAD individuals using machine learning methods on features derived from structural MRI. We present the potential integration of such a technology as a screening tool for the recruitment of subjects in secondary prevention trials and present a framework to quantify the benefits of such approach in economic and participant burden terms. Noteworthy, it is not proposed to replace the gold standard PET/CSF tests, but to provide a prediction of amyloid positivity in order to avoid unnecessary PET/CSF tests and, thus, reduce participant burden and economic costs.\nValidation across cohorts. We utilized public MRI and CSF data available from ADNI for feature selection and model training. Our independent HCB cohort served for model testing, simulating a real trial recruitment scenario. The data normalization scheme enabled validation overcoming the differences between data acquisition protocols and scanners in both institutions. Thus, the relevance of our models can be generalized to other population samples, with different age and education ranges. Of note, performance of the algorithm was stable when reversing the training and test datasets. Therefore, we foresee that the performance of our PreAD classification will hold when prospectively applied to independent cohorts with practical utility for PreAD screening purposes.\nFeature selection. By design, our data-driven approach was agnostic to previously reported anatomical changes due to AD. This allowed us to validate the selected features given their role in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD according to the literature. As expected, most of the features found informative in PreAD classification relate to the established AD signature. In the case of T1, characteristic AD affected regions include atlas ROIs such as the Hippocampus and Amygdala, temporal and parietal areas as well as the Cingulum, Thalamus, Rectus and Fusiform giri (Figure 4 ). Regions such as olfactory bulb pertain to well documented alterations of the olfactory system in the pathogenesis of AD and other dementias [22] . Other regions showing a high discriminative power such as the Caudates, have been found altered in cognitively normal individuals at high genetic risk of developing AD [23, 24] . Finally, the role of other regions such the Globus Pallidus is not as clear in PreAD ( Figure 5 ). One explanation would be that this atlas ROI includes the nucleus basalis of Meynert, which is an adjacent region not explicitly identified in the AAL parcellation. In a previous voxelwise analysis of the HCB cohort, the nucleus basalis showed alterations in PreAD [15] and, moreover, this region has been consistently reported to degenerate in early AD stages [25] . Interestingly, the features that classify between NC and PreAD yielded an AUC<0.2 to discriminate among NC and the diagnostic categories (i.e. MCI, AD).\nAn AUC significantly departing from 0.5 is classifying de facto. However, being well below 0.5 suggests that some features that characterize PreAD from NC appear in the opposite direction as some of the features that classify NC vs AD. This interpretation is further reinforced by the fact that classification models built using an identical pipeline but trained specifically to recognize diagnostic categories perform accordingly to what has been reported in the literature (AUC=0.95 for 20 T1\nfeatures, P=1.0, R=0.76), and are based mainly on hippocampal and temporal lobe volumes (Appendix B). Future work should improve the identification of discriminant brain regions using voxelwise approaches to fully characterize the preclinical AD signature using MRI and to identify overlaps with the established AD signature [24] .\nOverall, our results shows that feature selection has prioritized DTI features over T1 features in a multimodal imaging vector. Thus, DTI feature-pairs may be more robust than T1 features, compensating for the lower image quality (resolution, noise, blur) and artifacts given by surrogate measures of brain anatomical connectivity in DTI. Also, DTI conveys complementary information from white matter connectivity. Our data raises the question of whether changes in connectivity may be more evident in early AD than volumetric changes [16] . Nevertheless, the relevance of DTI over T1 features observed in this study should be further confirmed in other datasets. Despite its similar performance, the multimodal model is more precise than the T1-based model, which translates into less false positives and therefore less unnecessary PET/CSF tests in exchange for more MRI scans given the low recall of the model."}, {"section_title": "Range of application and PreAD prevalence.", "text": "In this proof-of-concept study, our MRI-based classifier thresholds are optimized to maximize the cost savings. The model can be tuned for other applications such as minimizing participant burden (Equation 2).\nThe practical utility of our MRI-based screening protocol highly depends on the prevalence of PreAD subjects, which in turn, is intimately related with the age range and age distribution of the clinical study.\nAt lower disease prevalence, savings rely on higher classifier precision to make the MRI-based screening layer worthwhile (Equation 1 ). This proposed recruitment protocol is most efficient for younger cohorts which are also best suited for secondary intervention trials. between plasma A\u03b2 species against PET imaging. Unlike our PreAD group that only included cognitively normal subjects, the performance of these methods was estimatied including MCI and/or AD patients which might have favoured them. Nevertheless, these works demonstrate a link between cerebral and peripheral A\u03b2 alterations and, when validated and automated, they will represent a major resource to screen the general population and implement secondary AD prevention strategies. On the other hand, our MRI-based approach might be particularly useful in the context of research studies in which CSF and or PET imaging is envisaged, as in this case MRI scans are typically prescribed for safety reasons.\nLimitations. The main limitation in our study is the small sample size of the studied groups. This was due to the limitation of available T1 and DTI data of the same individuals in the two cohorts.\nNevertheless, previous reports on standardizing the evaluation of algorithms for computed-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI recommend using small training sets (N~30) to mimic the clinical setting where limited data is available and to avoid overtraining issues [Bron et al.\nNeuroimage. 2015 May 1;111:562-79]. On the other hand, to maximize the generalizability of the performance evaluations, they prioritized applying the algorithms to independent datasets with different demographics and scanning parameters. Based on this rationale, we prioritised testing the algorithm in independent cohorts over the total sample size. Nevertheless, future studies will focus on validating similar approaches in larger test sets to better account for sample demographics and confounders. To this end, and given the results in this report, T1 data might solely achieve similar levels of classification accuracy. In addition, the small sample size has limited the complexity of the machine learning schemes that could be implemented robustly. Future studies with bigger samples sizes will also allow the investigation of potential improvements in classification performance of more complex classifying schemes. Nevertheless, we consider this report as a promising proof-of-concept as, even with a simple logistic regression model, robust performance can be achieved across two independent datasets with distinct demographic characteristics, potentially leading to significant savings of gold-standard procedures.\nAnother limitation of our experimental approach is that thresholds for A\u03b2+ might not be completely equivalent across the two cohorts. The respective CSF A\u03b2 cut-offs have been independently validated to yield optimal discrimination between NC and AD patients on the respective analytical platforms Future developments. Our study was restricted to a limited subject sample and therefore our models can only recognize a limited aspect of the PreAD signature. We expect an enhancement in performance when using larger training sets. We have adopted an atlas ROI-based approach using the AAL atlas that implements a rather coarse parcellation; future work will explore additional more fine-grained atlases or even explore voxel-based multivariate approaches. Despite their modest performance, our models could still be applied for prospective classification in an independent cohort. Follow-up efforts involve the application of this workflow to larger imaging datasets such as the one being acquired within our ALFA project [25] . Another line of improvement is to predict the actual CSF A\u03b242 levels in order to dichotomize the result at a later stage in order to accommodate for optimal A\u03b242 thresholds for different applications."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this proof-of-concept study, we establish that machine learning can detect amyloid pathology in cognitively normal populations using T1 and DTI MRI.
