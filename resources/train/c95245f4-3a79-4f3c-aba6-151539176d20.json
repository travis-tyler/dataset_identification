[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Body size is a basic biologic characteristic. It enters into evaluation of health status, disease, and malnutrition, as well as consideration of drug dosage and recommendations for healthy body weight. Height (or stature) is, in a sense, the primary estimate of \"size\"; it is a determinant of body mass index (most commonly computed as weight/height 2 ) and is a component in the equations used to compute body surface area. Body mass index and body surface area are, in turn, used as reference bases for interpreting physiologic and clinical tests such as tests of pulmonary and renal function. The rate of increase in height from birth to early adult life has been well studied, and it is recognized to be an essential index of the developmental phase of life. The rate of decrease in height at the end of growth and development has been less thoroughly studied. Indeed, to our knowledge there has been no comprehensive attempt to summarize the literature that is available. However, in recent years there has been increasing interest in the need for age-specific body weight recommendations (1) and in the role of osteoporosis in height loss with aging, making a review of height change timely.\nAside from the purely intellectual interest in the rate at which height changes with aging, the question has practical implications. A number of studies suggest that the body mass index associated with minimal mortality increases with age. In order to determine whether the increase in body mass index-associated minimal mortality is an \"artifact\" of loss of height with aging, it is necessary to know the magnitude of the artifact. We use the data summarized in this review to quantify the effect of height loss on body mass index indepen-dent of any change in weight. To the best of our knowledge, this question has not been previously explored.\nIt has been recognized that older persons are shorter than middle-aged and young adults, and there have been numerous cross-sectional reports of height differences with age (e.g., see Biichi (2) ). However, these studies may not reflect actual height changes as determined longitudinally, that is, by quantifying heights in individuals as they age. \"Secular\" effects on heighteffects due to differences in such environmental variables as quantitative and qualitative nutritional characteristics, prevalence of diseases and activity levels in infancy and childhood, and maternal health and nutrition-have been noted (3, 4) . The present report considers all identifiable studies that assessed longitudinal change in height in adults."}, {"section_title": "REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Search strategy and criteria for acceptability", "text": "Studies of longitudinal change in height in adults were identified through a MEDLINE\u00ae search using the keywords \"human,\" \"height,\" \"stature,\" and \"longitudinal.\" We searched the MEDLINE\u00ae database from 1966 through 1996. To meet our acceptability criteria, studies had to provide data on rates of change in height or data from which the rates of change could be computed within clearly defined age groups, and the published reports had to include a clear presentation of the numbers of subjects in each age category and the duration of the follow-up period. Two reports (5, 6) failed to meet these minimal criteria but are briefly noted here because they had interesting features. Sixteen reports met the criteria; one of them (7) presented data on two separate populations in Wales. Thus, 17 populations were included in this review.\nThe reliability of estimates of rates of change in height depends on a number of factors: the number of subjects, the number of measurements made per individual, and the length of the follow-up period. Information on these factors is presented below. What cannot be reported are details on methodologic tech- 248 Sorkin et al. niques, including reproducibility over lengthy followup periods, since the individual reports do not discuss these issues. There is quite remarkable consistency in the results despite large differences in the details of the individual studies. Space limitations precluded the presentation of tabular data from the individual studies. Data that we could display in the tables include the age range of each age group studied, the number and mean height of subjects in each age group, the rate of height change and its standard error, and the statistical significance of each rate of height change. These data can be found in the individual papers or will be provided upon request by the authors of this review."}, {"section_title": "Methods used to compute rates of height loss", "text": "Several methods can be used to compute the rate at which height is lost in different age groups. The simplest and most common method is to measure each subject's height at the beginning and end of the study and divide each subject's height change by the length of follow-up. Subjects are next assigned to age groups based on their age at study entry. The rate (and standard error) of height change for each age group is calculated as the mean (and standard error) of the subject-specific rates for the subjects constituting the group. This method was used in studies I, II, VI, VIII, IX, X, and XIII below. A slight modification of the method, sometimes referred to as a two-stage random effects model, can be used when three or more height measurements are obtained. The method differs from that described above only in that the rate at which height is lost for each subject is calculated by regressing each subject's height on his or her age rather than computing the rate as the difference between the final and initial heights divided by the length of follow-up. This method was used in studies XI, XII, XV, and XVI below. Some variant of the two-stage random effects procedure may have been used in study XIV, as is explained below. For four studies, III, IV, V, and VII, rather than computing the average of subject-specific rates of height change, the rate of height change was computed as the difference between the mean heights of the subjects at the beginning and end of follow-up."}, {"section_title": "STATISTICAL METHODS", "text": "Combining estimates from several studies to derive a consensus equation giving the rate at which height is lost at different ages A consensus equation which summarizes the rate at which height is lost as a function of age was obtained by regressing the age-specific rates of height loss on age. The age-specific rates came from those studies reviewed and deemed to be acceptable. Additionally, only those age-specific estimates that were computed from a group of 10 or more subjects were included in the computation. Separate equations were developed for men and women. A random coefficients model with an unstructured covariance matrix was used to account for the fact that the slope estimates come from different studies. The model was implemented with PROC MIXED in SAS, version 6.12 (8) . As implemented, the model allows each study to have its own intercept and slope (referred to as random effects). The slope and intercept of the consensus equation (referred to as fixed effects) are the means of the study-specific slopes and intercepts. Conceptually, the model is very similar to the two-stage random effects model described above. The unstructured covariance matrix used in our random coefficients model indicates that we make no assumption about the correlation between the slope or intercept estimates from the different studies. Further discussion of random effects models, random coefficients models, and covariance structures can be found in the statistical literature (9) ."}, {"section_title": "Computation of cumulative change in body mass index", "text": "The cumulative change in height from age] to age 2 was obtained by evaluating the definite integral of the consensus equation between the two ages.

In Rhondda Fach, there was no consistent sex difference in the rates of height loss; in the Vale of Glamorgan, women of all ages lost height faster than did men. The change in height was generally more negative in Rhondda Fach than in the Vale of Glamorgan in both men and women. The authors stated:\nThe differences between the men in the Vale and the Rhondda may be caused by dissimilar occupations. Many men in the Vale were agricultural labourers, whereas in the Rhondda many were coal miners whose work involved much stooping. However, similar but less pronounced differences were found between females in the two areas, suggesting that some other factor, possibly nutritional, may also play a role in determining this pattern (7, p. 451)."}, {"section_title": "III.

Nine of the populations were from Europe: three from the United Kingdom (7, 16), one from Belgium (10), one from Czechoslovakia (11), one from Norway (13), two from Sweden (14, 15) , and one from Switzerland (2). One population was from Australia (22) . The published data came exclusively from Caucasian populations; we were unable to locate any data on nonCaucasian populations. Among the 17 populations, 16 had data for men (2, 7, (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) 16 , 17, 19-24) and 13 had data for women (2, 7, 12-16, 19-22, 24) .

The southern Arizona study (21) found an increase in height among men aged 70-74 years; the Albuquerque study (19) found a loss of height as large as 6 cm per decade. Two of the three studies that had clearly extreme rates of height change in men also had extreme rates of height change in women (the Albuquerque (19) and southern Arizona (21) studies (figure 2); the University of Missouri study (23) did not include women). The reasons for the extreme values in these three studies cannot be determined from the published reports, but small sample size is clearly not the explanation. A number of the studies reporting nonextreme rates of height loss reported age-specific rates of height loss that came from age groups with fewer subjects than those in the studies that reported extreme rates of height loss. The data from the three studies with extreme results will not be considered further in this review. Therefore, the remainder of this paper discusses only 13 populations of men and 11 populations of women. Within these populations, there is quite remarkable consistency by sex in the agespecific rates of height loss.

The data from all of the populations reviewed in this paper can be combined to determine a \"consensus\" rate at which height is lost at any age (figure 4). The consensus rate of height loss can be used to compute the cumulative loss of height with age ( figure 5 ). The consensus rate of height loss is computed by plotting the value for each of the age-specific slopes (i.e., the rates at which height is lost) at the mean age of each age group and then regressing the slopes on age (figure 4) as described above. Age-specific slopes obtained from groups of less than 10 subjects were excluded both from the plots and from the regressions. For men, the equation relating slope to age was figure 1 ) and two studies in women (L and N in figure 2 ), as well as data from age-specific populations with less than 10 subjects, were not included. Unweighted least squares regression on age was computed for the 67 age groups of men (-) and 61 age groups of women ( --). The linear regression analyses indicated that height increases until approximately age 30 years in both men and women and that women lose height faster than do men beyond approximately age 45. FIGURE 5. Cumulative height change in men and women from young adulthood to old age. The solid line represents a combination of the age-specific rates of height loss from 13 studies of men (2, 7, (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) 16, 17, 20, 22, 24) ; the dashed line represents a combination of the age-specific rates obtained from 11 studies of women (2, 7, 12-16, 20, 22,24 Longitudinal Change in the Heights of Men and Women 257\nThe slope for women was Slope = 0.1727 -0.0054 age.\nFor both men and women, the coefficient of the age term and the intercept were significant at p < 0.0001. For men, age explained 87 percent of the variation in the rate at which height was lost; in women, age explained 86 percent. The regression lines for men and women (figure 4) indicate that the slope is slightly positive until approximately age 30; that is, height increases slightly. Beyond approximately age 45 years, women lose height faster than do men. Equations 1 and 2 above give the rate at which height changes at any age. In effect, these equations give the \"instantaneous\" rate of height loss, ^/height/ c?age. Because the instantaneous rate of height loss is the first derivative of the equation relating height to age, the equation relating height to age can be obtained by integrating equations 1 and 2 with respect to age. Furthermore, evaluation of the integrals at two ages will give the average cumulative change in height that occurs with aging. \n0.0041age Jage = 0.1258age -0.0021age 2 , and for women it is\nCumulative height change = 0.1727 -\n0.0054 age Jage = 0.1727 age -0.0027 age 2 .\nA plot (figure 5) of equations 3 and 4 indicates that by age 80 years, the average man will have lost approximately 5 cm from his maximum height, the average woman approximately 6.2 cm."}, {"section_title": "Effect of loss of height on body mass index", "text": "The cumulative change in height with aging will affect the interpretation of the body mass index at different ages. Body mass index, computed as weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters), is often used as an index of obesity. If weight remains constant with aging, the body mass index will increase \"artifactually\" as height is lost with aging. The magnitude of the artifact can be calculated by substituting for cumulative height change in the equation:\nCumulative change in body mass index = initial weight (initial height + cumulative height change) 2 initial body mass index. Because the cumulative height change beyond age 30 is always negative, i.e., a loss of height, the cumulative effect of height change on body mass index beyond age 30 will be to increase the body mass index. In the average man, the magnitude of the cumulative change in body mass index due solely to loss of height will be an artifactual increase in body mass index of 1.2 units from age 30 to age 80; in the average woman, the artifactual increase will be 1.6 units ( figure 6 ). If the body mass index (kg/m 2 ) at age 30 were 22, a 1.6-unit increase in body mass index in a woman will result in a 7 percent \"error\" in the body mass index at age 80.\nAnother way of expressing these effects is to compute the weight gain equivalent to the height loss. Since one unit of body mass index is equivalent to 3.2 kg (7 pounds) in a man of average height (1.75 m) and 2.7 kg (6 pounds) in a woman of average height (1.63 m), the 1.2-unit increase in body mass index in men is equivalent to a 3.8-kg (8-pound) increase in weight. In women, the 1.6-unit increase in body mass index is equivalent to a 4.3-kg (10-pound) increase in weight.\nThe change in height with aging has implications beyond the interpretation of body mass index. Weight-for-height guidelines, though sometimes expressed as a series of heights and their corresponding recommended weights rather than as body mass indices, are by their very nature lists of recommended body mass indices. Two sets of weight-forheight guidelines, the Gerontology Research Center table (25) and the recommendations of the National Research Council (26), indicate that minimal mortality occurs at progressively higher body mass indices with increasing age (table 2, figure 6 ). The Gerontology Research Center table indicates that minimal mortality is associated with a 1.6-unit increase in body mass index per decade of adult life; the National Research Council recommends a 1.0-unit increase in body mass index per decade. It has been suggested that the increase in the body mass index associated with minimal mortality with increasing age could be an artifact of the loss of height with aging. The effect of height loss on body mass index can be seen to be much smaller than the increase in body mass index associated with minimal mortality (table 2, figure 6 ). 2 . t The Gerontology Research Center, National Research Council, and Dietary Guidelines for Americans tables are not sex-specific; that is, separate tables for men and women were not deemed to be necessary. For the 1983 Metropolitan Life tables, the body mass indices at the midpoint for the medium frame are essentially the same for men and women at their sex-specific average height; heights were corrected for shoe height (2.54 cm for both men and women), and weights were corrected for weight of clothes (2.3 kg for men, 1.4 kg for women). The body mass indices given in the table (except for the last two lines) represent the midpoints of the recommended ranges from the sources cited. In reporting longitudinal data, it is considered good epidemiologic practice to state the percentage of people lost to follow-up and to try to determine whether nonrandom loss to follow-up could have introduced bias into the results reported. It is also considered advisable to give data establishing the repeatability of the measure of interest and to demonstrate that there was no change in measurement technique during the course of the study-a change that could produce a spurious \"longitudinal effect.\" Unfortunately, these steps were not taken in this field of study."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiol Rev", "text": "None of the studies described in this review compared characteristics of subjects lost to follow-up with those of persons who were seen at the beginning and end of the follow-up period. Furthermore, none of the published articles gave statistics on the repeatability of height measurements for either short term or long term follow-up. The uniform lack of \"epidemiologic rigor\" in the studies may reflect the fact that height is generally believed to be accurately and reliably measured. The consistency in the reported results among these studies (figures 1 and 2) makes it likely that the effects reported are real and not produced by a change in method. Although most of the studies summarized did not use random samples of the population, the consistency among the results-results that come from many populations and many parts of the world-suggests that they are quite generalizable, at least to Caucasian populations."}, {"section_title": "Thoughts on combining data from different studies", "text": "When estimates from several studies are combined so that a consensus estimate of an effect can be computed, the estimates are often weighted by the inverse of their variance. There are several reasons for weighting: to assign greater weight to estimates in which we have greater confidence (and conversely lesser weight to estimates in which we have lesser confidence), and to stabilize the variance of the resulting consensus estimate. Unfortunately, weighting was not an acceptable option for the data reviewed in this report; too much information would have been eliminated. Only four of 11 studies of women (36 percent) and five of 13 studies of men (38 percent) provided estimates of variance (or the standard error and number of subjects in each age group, which could have been used to compute the variance). Failure to weight estimates can, in theory, affect the consensus estimate of the effect. To estimate the effect that failure to weight might have on the consensus estimates of the rate at which height changes, the cumulative change in height, and the cumulative change in body mass index, we compared the weighted and unweighted estimates of these three metrics from the four studies of women and five studies of men in which the age-specific variances could be computed. The comparison demonstrated that there were no important differences between the weighted and unweighted estimates (data available upon request). It therefore seems likely that the failure to weight when we developed our consensus equations of the rates of change in height among men and women had no substantial effect on the results we reported."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for future studies", "text": "The age-specific rates of longitudinal loss of height in Caucasian men and women have been well investigated. There is a remarkable consistency in the rate of height loss across studies from widely different geographic locations and ethnic groups (figure 4). Although the cumulative loss of height with aging is large, the effect of the loss on body mass index is modest. Future studies should seek to determine the etiology of the height loss. There is a need to determine rates of longitudinal loss of height in non-Caucasian populations. Among women, loss of bone mineral density is known to increase at the time of menopause. It would be interesting to know whether there is an acceleration in the rate of height loss shortly after the increased rate of demineralization begins.\nIn all future studies, researchers should strive for greater epidemiologic rigor than has been the norm for studies of the rate of height change with age. As we noted above, the investigators should describe the methods used to standardize the measurement of height and to assure that methodologic drift did not occur over time. An attempt should be made to determine whether differential loss to follow-up could have affected the estimates of rates of height loss. For each age group studied, the number of subjects studied should be given, as well as an estimate of the precision with which the rate of height change has been measured. This estimate could take the form of the standard error, the standard deviation, or the variance of the rate of height change."}]
