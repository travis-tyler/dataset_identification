[{"section_title": "", "text": "such as U-pick fruit and vegetables, corn/sorghum mazes, haunted houses, petting zoos, and fish ponds, but now visitors to agricultural-tourism operations might also brew beer and cider, produce cheese, make soap or organic yarn, blend perfumes, create chocolates, or bottle wine, with all the ingredients and training provided on the farm. Taken together, all of these activities represent a fast-growing and profitable component of the U.S. tourism sector with significant horizontal linkages to other tourism-related businesses (Che, Veeck, and Veeck 2005;Che 2006). Using data from the 2012 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), Bagi found that compared to other farmers, \"agritourism farmers are more likely to have a college degree (45 percent versus 25 percent), use the Internet for business (78 percent versus 64 percent), and draw on paid management advice (72 percent versus 42 percent)\" (2014, 1). Agricultural tourism continues to have commercial, ecological, social, and cultural impacts, and more information is needed to determine the actual economic contributions of this industry to government revenues, agricultural-tourism business operators, and their employees (Che 2006). The purpose of this article is to explore and summarize the state of contemporary agricultural tourism through a case study of Michigan, so as to understand the economic contributions of these activities. The findings are based on analyses of a systematic survey of 154 agricultural-tourism operations conducted throughout the state of Michigan during the summer and fall months of 2013 ( Figure 1). The article has four coming sections. In section two, we explore the types of products and activities now included under the agricultural tourism \"umbrella\" and discuss theoretical issues related to the difficulty of \"branding\" agricultural tourism. Section three introduces the research design of the case study and details the types and relative share of particular activities, goods, and services that now constitute Michigan's agricultural-tourism sector. Section four incorporates a quantitative assessment of the contribution of agricultural tourism to Michigan's economy through an extrapolation of our sample and the use of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multivariate regression analysis. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results and some of the new challenges and opportunities related to agricultural tourism in Michigan."}, {"section_title": "AN EXPANDING DEFINITION OF AGRICULTURAL TOURISM", "text": "Identifying a sector-wide term that incorporates all activities and dimensions of agricultural tourism has proven quite difficult (Barbieri et al., 2015). This lack of agreement regarding the breadth and depth of agricultural tourism goes beyond the mere need for an appropriate consensus term. Rather, the different terms used in legally binding laws and regulations related to agricultural tourism are different for different states. Specifically, what farmers legally call the services provided by their operations may importantly include or exclude their farms from \"Right to Farm\" legislation, subsidized insurance programs, signage permits, entrepreneurship classes, extension support programs, association advertising, health department regulations, and even liability insurance programs (Bagi and Reader 2012; Barbieri 2013; Rogerson and Rogerson 2014; Barbieri et al., 2015;Knowd 2015). What to call these activities matters to consumers, but more importantly-in a legal sense-to farm operators and those that manage them. As more farms across the U.S. offer agricultural-tourism activities and products, it may be that the most inclusive definition is best. The University of California Small Farms Program (2011) broadly defines agricultural tourism as \"a commercial enterprise at a working farm, ranch, or agricultural plant conducted for the enjoyment of visitors that generates supplemental income for the owner\" (2011). According to Barbieri: \"The agriculturalist literature places agricultural tourism within the farm enterprise diversification grand schemeas entrepreneurial ventures resulting from the reallocation and recombination of farm land, labor or capital for the purposes of enhancing farm revenues or values\" (2013,253). This is a useful point of departure, as agricultural-tourism operations are increasingly branching out into new marketing venues-some duplicated on-and off-farm-while providing many new on-farm products and services as compared to even a decade ago. The diversity of on-farm activities that are now conventionally incorporated into definitions of agricultural tourism makes the development of an inclusive \"umbrella\" term that could effectively serve as a \"brand\" very difficult. In an important new study where 797 farmers and 1,119 residents (actual and potential customers) of Missouri and North Carolina were asked to evaluate eight potential terms (agritourism, farm tourism, agricultural tourism, rural tourism, farm visits, and agritainment) on four dimensions (memorability, distinctiveness, relevance, and flexibility), Barbieri and colleagues found that a majority of both operators and customers preferred farm visit, farm tourism, or agricultural tourism to other options including agritourism, agrotourism and the despised agritainment (2015). Barbieri and her colleagues caution that the lack of a single sector-wide consensus term inclusive of all of the activities that might be associated with agricultural tourism or farm visits \"diminishes marketing effectiveness and hinders stakeholder collaboration\" (2015, 1). Presumably, as the sector continues to expand and mature, a consensus term will emerge. In this article, we opt for agricultural tourism, which we define as any and all retail enterprise at a working farm conducted for the enjoyment of visitors that generates income for the owners (University of California 2011). Regardless of the preferred term, a wealth of literature documents the growing importance of this sector with respect to small farm economics throughout North America and Europe (Knowd 2006;Hoppe 2014). Findings consistently indicate that agricultural tourism is providing the additional income needed to compensate for the fluctuations in wholesale agricultural prices and/or allows families to continue farming when farm scale and/or labor is limited and wholesale sales are insufficient (McGehee and Kim 2004; Barbieri and Mahoney 2009; Bagi 2014; Newton 2014; Schilling, Attavanich, and Jin 2014). Beyond income, agricultural tourism opportunities allow families to maintain a way of life while helping to preserve agricultural land and proximate natural amenities, such as forests, streams, and wildlife (Sznajder, Przezborska, and Scrimgeour 2009;Bagi and Reeder 2012). Further, agricultural tourism offers many intangible benefits to visitors to the farms, including a means to connect with the past, an accessible out-of-doors experience, and memories often shared by multiple generations of family members (Che, Veeck, and Veeck 2005)."}, {"section_title": "PROJECT DESCRIPTION", "text": "This case study is based on a survey of agricultural-tourism operations in Michigan conducted from May to November of 2013. The survey was preceded by qualitative research, consisting of a set of focus groups and a series of interviews, to help define the main issues as seen from the perspective of Michigan's agricultural-tourism farms. Coordinated by the Michigan Agritourism Association (MATA), three focus groups, each consisting of seven to ten specialty crop agricultural-tourism operators, were convened in Lansing, Traverse City, and Kalamazoo. In addition, site visits were made to sixteen operations around the state, resulting in longer, recorded depth interviews. The questionnaire was informed by results from the focus groups and interviews, combined with a review of current literature. The six page survey had four sections: basic information on the firm (opening/closing dates, hours of operation, inventory of products sold, number of full-time and part time staff, and advertising costs and venues); Likert-type scale items on the benefits of respondent operations to customers; Likert-type scale items related to problems and benefits of direct on-farm sales; and perceived economic benefits of their agricultural-tourism operations to the state, the operators of the business, and employees (income, revenues, wages). Pretests indicated the survey required about thirty minutes to complete. The questionnaire was designed so that it could be sent via regular mail or the Internet (via a link to the Qualtrics website) to agricultural tourism farm operators. Prior to conducting the survey, a statewide address list of agriculturaltourism operations was developed. Identifying agricultural-tourism operations is an important challenge for all states, including Michigan. As is the case in the majority of states, there is no census of agricultural-tourism operations in Michigan. One estimate by Sandra Hill of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) in 2003 placed the number of agricultural-tourism operations in Michigan at approximately 4,000 (Veeck, Che, and Veeck 2006). Using all of Michigan's regional Chamber of Commerce websites, urban \"Yellow Page\" directories, specialty crop growers' directories, and other on-line guides, we ultimately identified 2,974 farms reporting agricultural-tourism activities with active addresses where we could send the survey. Of course, there are many very small \"cash and carry\" operations that do not advertise or choose to list in a directory. The survey was sent to 2000 \"snail mail\" addresses and 974 on-line addresses of agricultural-tourism operations. Respondents were given a choice as to which format was used and the U.S. Mail version also provided the web link to the Qualtrics on-line survey. A single incentive, a drawing for an Apple I-pad or a $500.00 cash option, was offered to encourage participation via a drawing. Ultimately, a total of 154 usable surveys (162 total) were returned, resulting in a response rate of 5.44 percent (60 percent paper, 40 percent on-line). After data entry, each operation was assigned to one of twelve categories and descriptive statistics related to sales, employment, and taxes for each group were calculated. Once this step was completed, extrapolation for statewide estimates for a set of employment and sales variables were calculated based on the published 2003 MDARD estimate of 4,000 agricultural-tourism operations cited above. Twelve years later, there are probably many more operations than this number, but the extrapolations reported in section four of the article are made using this conservative estimate (Veeck, Che and Veeck 2006). In addition to the creation of tabular and graphic summaries with associated univariate statistics for the agricultural-tourism operations that participated in the survey, OLS multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between gross sales per day of operation and standard econometric variables, such as advertising costs, payroll, days of operation, and sources of sales (types of products). The goal of this portion of the research was to identify factors that partially account for firm success as measured by sales. Several other recent studies have also adopted this identical approach with the same goal in other locations (Schilling, Attavanich, and Jin 2014;Hung, Ding, and Lin 2015). The standardized dependent variable-gross receipts per day of operation-was created in recognition of the great range in the number of days of operation across the many types of agricultural-tourism operations. For example, Christmas-based operations (trees, wreaths, ornaments, sleigh rides) generate all retail revenue in seventeen to ninety days, while most farm market destinations operate for seven to twelve months. Standardizing gross sales per diem allows for comparison across different types of operations. The independent variables include: mean advertising costs per day of operation (adjusted per diem for the same reason as above), the percent of sales from off-farm products (food and non-food items retailed on site, but not produced by the operators), the number of days open to the public, and annual wages. In addition, a dummy variable (annual sales above $20,000 = 1, less than $20,000= 0) was added to the model to determine the presence or absence of scale effects on daily revenue."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS OF ANALYSES", "text": "Analysis of the survey underscores both the diversity of agricultural-tourism activities and the importance of these family operations to Michigan's rural and peri-urban economies. Extrapolating the results to 4,000 operations in similar proportions with respect to the types of the operations participating in the survey, results indicate the economic impact of agricultural tourism is significant in terms of income, wages, employment, and tax revenues. Table 1 aggregates the 154 operations participating in the survey by major focus, that is fall harvest, farm markets, and the like. Each farm was placed in one of these twelve categories based on qualitative descriptions of their operation and a list provided by each respondent of the top ten sources of revenue for each operation. These same categories are used in subsequent analyses as well. For privacy concerns, a single aquaculture/fishing operation is excluded from analysis. Table 2 provides the mean days (out of 365) of operation and related descriptive statistics for each of the twelve types of operation. Large standard  deviations indicate the unique quality of these operations as each farm family accommodates off-farm work schedules, available capital, and seasonal-product availability. Animal-related firms (wool products, weaving, classes, dairy, and [often] organic meat), honey/maple syrup firms (candle making, royal jelly, candy classes as well as product sales), and vineyards (wine tasting, tours, winemaking classes, and wine-related retail) operate year round. The number of animalrelated firms (n=28/154) was greater than we anticipated, but reflects a growing direct sales trend (organic free-range meat and poultry) also identified in the U.S. Agricultural Census (USDA 2014). Another striking outcome is the proportionally large number of farm market and farm-experience operations that offer a more diverse product base over more \"open days\" than many other types in the sample. Farm market/farm-experience operations often combine on-farm sales of spring, summer, and fall produce with activities such as a petting \"zoo,\" hay rides, playgrounds, corn mazes, and cooking classes. The distinction between the two categories is that farm-experience operations place greater marketing emphasis than farm market operators on links to educational opportunities such as hosting school groups and retirement home visitors, usually with cider, meals, or snacks. Both of these types often report additional retail sales of products produced or manufactured off-farm such as soaps, candles, syrup, honey, jams, jellies, and souvenirs. Some, but not all, of these offfarm products reflect horizontal linkages to other local agricultural-tourism operations. For example, a farm might sell chocolates or honey made at a nearby operation in exchange for the inclusion of their products at the other farm. On the other hand, many Christmas-focused operations report the sale of lights and ornaments made in China and purchased wholesale."}, {"section_title": "DIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL-TOURISM OPERATIONS IN MICHIGAN", "text": "Farm market operations, in contrast to more specialized operations built around U-pick berries, fall harvest, or Christmas-focused farms, operate for longer periods and stock a more diverse product base. Even more traditional agricultural-tourism operations, such as an apple U-pick, offer a far more diverse set of products and services than in the past. A decade ago, it was common for such operations to report selling apple pies, tarts, jellies, cider, candied apples, and donuts for 90 to 100 days (Veeck, Che, and Veeck 2006). At present, a similar farm continues to sell all of this, but also markets unpasteurized juice for home cider makers and cider-making supplies, while offering classes on cider making and pie/tart baking. On average, an orchard-based agricultural-tourism operation is now open over 200 days despite the brief period that fruit can actually be picked (Table 1). Similarly, Christmas-focused operations -once open only thirty to forty-five days-are now open for three months, combining sales of ornaments, stockings, candy, and visits with Santa, with sales of trees, wreaths, and garlands. Also notable in tables 1 and 2 is the presence of operations specializing in the production and sale of new crops and related activities (hops/brewing classes; classes for making sachets, rose oil, perfume, flower arranging, or soap). One operation selling lavender and offering classes in soap and perfume making also reported the operation of a health spa, complete with yoga classes. Operations are not only open longer and offer more products and activities than in the past, but many have increasingly \"gone hybrid\" by also participating in off-farm farmers' markets, typically two or three days a week. Beyond increased revenues, many operators responding to an open-ended question on sales venues wrote that selling at farmers' markets and community centers helped expand their \"brand,\" which promoted increases in on-farm visits. Several farm-experience operations reported adding community-supported agriculture (CSA) on-farm to take advantage of visitors' familiarity with their farm as well. Some farm-experience/CSA operations also offered classes in vegetable and flower gardening, while selling transplants, home-gardening supplies, and organic fertilizer (manure). Others offer regular cooking/baking classes or season-specific special local-sourced meals (Easter dinner, Christmas dinner, summer-garden harvest) on-site or at a nearby bed-and-breakfast."}, {"section_title": "THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF AGRICULTURAL TOURISM", "text": "Tables 3 and 4 provide summaries of mean employment, annual taxes paid, and several employment statistics disaggregated by type of operation. Table 3 reports the information for our actual cases, our sample, and Table 4 reports the statewide estimations derived from our extrapolation. Turning first to Table 3 (estimates for farms participating in the survey), ranges representing 95 percent confidence intervals are provided for six variables (taxes, annual sales, per diem sales, full-time employees, part-time employees, and unpaid family members participating in agricultural-tourism activities). Most striking is that the large ranges (95 percent confidence intervals) reflect significant differences in these economic indicators from operation to operation due to differences in both the number of days of operation and the scale of the operation-even within the same type of operation. Anticipated by William Coleman, Wyn Grant, and Tim Josling and discussed previously with respect to the farm sectors in most nations, it is very clear that this widening gap between large and small operations is characteristic of agricultural tourism as well (2004). These differences can be seen in terms of taxes, annual sales, and employment or even sales per day of operation (Figure 2 and Table 3). Almost one-third (29.5 percent) of farms participating in the survey reported annual sales of less than $1,000.00. At the other extreme, 38.5 percent had sales of over $30,000.00/year, while 8 percent reported sales over $400,000.00. Once again, the middle is missing. At the extremes, the largest vineyard reported annual sales of almost $2 million, while some small operations sold less than $10.00-$20.00 per day of operation. It might be expected that larger operations have both higher gross sales and higher per diem sales, but this is not always the case (Figure 3) (Pearson's product moment correlation r=.795, p=.0001). For contemporary   agricultural-tourism operations in Michigan, however, bigger scale (employment, taxes) is typically better in terms of revenues, a finding further supported by results of the regression analysis provided below. Reviewing the data from the surveys presented in Table 3 by type of operation, vineyards/wineries, Christmas-focus firms, and orchards pay the most taxes, have the highest annual revenues, and employ the most people. However, assessed using per diem sales, fall harvest and berry-based operations also make major contributions for the periods they are open and especially with respect to part-time employment. Farm market operations do not post high numbers for employment, but their large number (n=51/154) reflects their great significance in terms of local employment opportunities throughout the state, especially for part-time or seasonal employees, many of whom are students. Many farm owners do not pay themselves a salary, or count their hours in their budgets. On average, 1.8 family members work on the farms in the survey in some capacity or another, with animal operations, honey/maple syrup, fall harvest, farm markets all employing more than one family member at least part time at the 95 percent confidence level. Realistically, most of the smaller operations could not operate without this commitment from family members. In all, around 7,000 members of Michigan farm families devote part or all of their time to agricultural tourism ( Table 4). Assuming our estimates of the total number of operations is correct, and that the relative proportions for each type of operation within the sample (Table 1) remain constant, an extrapolation of the economic and employment contributions of the agricultural-tourism sector in Michigan can be calculated. Certainly, these figures must be taken as estimates-not facts-as the samples in some categories are small, but the figures do reflect the importance of agricultural tourism to Michigan's economy and, we believe, offer a useful starting point while underscoring the need for a larger sample. Table 4 extrapolates survey data to 4,000 operations statewide. These extrapolated estimates, the first estimates to our knowledge generated for Michigan, are calculated based on the mean estimate for each of the six indicator variables (annual taxes, annual sales, sales per day of operation, full-time staff, part-time staff, and family members participating in agricultural-tourism activities) times the pro- portional share of each of the types of agricultural-tourism firms participating in the survey and listed in Table 1. Based on this approach, the taxes paid in 2012 by all agritourism operations in the state were slightly over $13.7 million. Of course, many farms participating in the survey continue to sell wholesale in addition to agricultural tourismrelated sales of nonfood items so these taxes are not derived solely from agricultural tourism. Still, these funds represent an important contribution to state revenues, and may justify greater support of agricultural-tourism promotion and technical support by the MDARD. Gross sales and gross sales per day provide additional \"snapshots\" in terms of the importance of these operations to the state's economy. Estimates for the gross value per year of all sales in 2012 are over $434 million, while statewide gross sales per day of operation are well over $2 million (Table 4). Farm markets account for about 33 percent of all agricultural-tourism operations, so while revenues at any given market may be modest (Table 3), the large number of these operations has them essentially tied with vineyards for total annual gross sales, with orchard-based operations a close third. Farm markets, orchards, and vineyard/wineries account for 64 percent of all agricultural-tourism annual sates in Michigan. Turning to employment, based on our extrapolation we estimate that agricultural-tourism operations in Michigan provide approximately 4,000 full-time annual jobs, exclusive of unpaid family members. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that agricultural tourism provided work and training to approximately 28,000 part-time employees, many of whom go on to work in other sectors where the skills learned during time spent on these farms can prove extremely valuable (Table 4)."}, {"section_title": "DRIVERS OF DAILY SALES AT MICHIGAN AGRICULTURAL-TOURISM OPERATIONS", "text": "Finally, as noted in the methods section, an OLS multivariate regression test is conducted to determine effective predictors of gross revenues per day of operation. Again, the dependent variable is total reported gross sales adjusted by the number of days of operation so that all farms could be compared. The independent variables included in the model include: mean advertising costs per day of operation (standardized for the same reason as the dependent variable), the percent of retail sales from off-farm products, a scale dummy variable (where 1 = annual sales above $20,000, below $20,000 = 0), the number of days open to the public, and the total wages paid annually. The figure of total wages paid was selected, versus absolute full-and part-time employees, to include both full-time and part-time seasonal workers. Results for the regression analysis are presented as Table 5. The model is robust (R 2 = .671, F=44.58 p=.0001, n=121 list-wise). All independent variables are significant at .056 or better. Collinearity statistics are well below standard thresholds. Several interesting results emerge from a review of the model. First, the two scale-related independent variables (sales > $20,000 dummy and total annual payroll) rank first and third when the estimates of beta are standardized ( Table 5). Larger operations, with greater than $20,000 in gross sales annually, have higher daily sales (b=$558.90, t-3.468, p.=.001); firms with greater than 20K in annual sales can expect $558.0 more in mean daily sales. However, the number of days of operation each year actually has a slight inverse relationship (b=-1.14, t=-1.931, p=.056) with mean gross sales per day of operation (Figure 3). It is not that firms make more money by just staying open for longer seasons, but rather that larger operations, with a greater number of employees and more advertising, attract more visitors and generate greater sales. The inverse relationship between daily mean sales and days of operation probably reflects the intensity of sales surrounding particular holidays or short growing seasons as in specialized Christmas tree farms, or strawberry and raspberry U-pick operations. In terms of the standardized coefficients, advertising expenditures per day of operation was second only to gross value of total payroll in significance (b=10.04, t=3.653, p=.0001) ( Table 5). Scale matters and advertising works. For firms participating in the sample, every dollar spent in advertising results in an additional $10.04 in sales for every day of operation. The benefits of a more diverse product mix are also apparent as every percentage increase in the sale of items not produced on the farm and purchased wholesale, such as Christmas ornaments or candles results in an additional $7.95 in mean daily sales (b=7.948, t=2.493, p=.014). The most successful operations not only offer a more diverse mix of on-farm produce and services but those that also offer theme-related inventory-purchased elsewhere as compared to products grown or processed on-farm-are also more successful as measured by gross sales per diem. "}, {"section_title": "FINAL THOUGHTS", "text": "Agricultural tourism is an increasingly important portion of the agriculture and tourism sectors throughout the United States and North America as small farms seek to reposition in the post-WTO agricultural economy. In Michigan alone, annual sales are over $430 million dollars while providing employment to over 4,000 full-time workers and 28,000 part-time ones. Beyond allowing these farms to remain solvent, it is important to appreciate the economic contributions that agricultural-tourism operations make to the rural economies within which they operate. As the results of this survey of Michigan farms indicate, the economic impact of agricultural-tourism operations in all their diversity is great and growing. Catching the wave of the local-food movement, the \"green\" foods movement, and the shift away from processed foods, agricultural-tourism operations help sustain many rural areas throughout Michigan, and indeed the nation, while providing employment, tax revenues, economic development, and \"free\" job training. Economically, agricultural-tourism operations employ a significant number of full-and part-time workers in many rural areas where jobs are difficult to find. Often overlooked in the agricultural-tourism literature are the contributions these businesses make in training the workforce in terms of hospitality skills, running a register, or keeping accounts, while cultivating farming and horticultural expertise. Local advertising options also clearly benefit as well. The benefits of advertising on local radio stations and newspapers cuts both ways and savvy operators not only have an on-line presence but still advertise conventionally in daily and weekly papers and on local and regional radio and television stations. Many of the rural places where agricultural-tourism operations are concentrated have experienced out-migration of youth and high unemployment rates. As results of our survey show, these operations provide full-and part-time jobs to thousands of residents, while horizontal linkages with other components of the tourism sector employ many more thousands as well. Of course, it is logical to assume that most of these wages are spent locally, shoring up rural economies. What is also patently clear from our survey results is that as the agricultural-tourism sector matures, there is a growing gap between a limited number of larger operations open year round with large advertising and promotion budgets, and smaller operations where agricultural tourism provides a secondary source of income to one or perhaps two family members during a very limited portion of the year. Adding to this complexity is the fact that a growing number of the smaller operations not only welcome on-farm visits, but also opt to maintain a regular presence at the growing number of farmers' markets throughout the state. This growing hybridization presents some important challenges to statewide agricultural tourism umbrella organizations such as the Michigan Agritourism Association. As if this divergence in the types of agricul-tural-tourism operations in Michigan is not enough, the strong and effective role that specialty crop growers associations play in Michigan means that farmers are sometimes forced to divide their attention between the state's agricultural-tourism association (MATA) and their specific specialty-crop associations, cooperatives, or boards. Based on our review of literature from other states, Michigan is hardly unique in this regard and thus the selection of a name-of a branding term-for all the activities discussed in this article really matters, both in terms of recruitment of members to the agricultural-tourism association, and also in terms of state and county government perceptions. Our findings, then, have important implications for how agricultural tourism is promoted to state legislatures. This is not \"boutique farming\" destined to forever take a back seat to large-scale operations producing corn, beans, and the like. MATA, however, again finds itself in a difficult position. Setting a prolegislative agenda that is important and appropriate while appealing to both small and large firms is a significant challenge. Large wineries push for legislation related to out-of-state sales and tax issues related to on-line sales; small firms seek better state-supported promotional campaigns or relief from duplicate site inspections from city, county, and state agencies and health departments. As the industry matures, common ground for these diverse businesses may appear more difficult to find given growing differences in scale and the ever greater range of products and services involved in agricultural-tourism operations. A farm producing lavender and other essential oils that invites visitors to learn to make perfume or to practice yoga appears, at first glance, quite different from a U-cut Christmas tree farm. Certainly, every operation is unique-that is part of the appeal of these businesses to the customer base that has grown increasingly diverse. On the other hand, all agricultural-tourism operations continue to have common interests related to on-farm liability insurance, state-led promotional efforts, and proagricultural-tourism legislation with respect to signage, insurance, liability, health regulations, road improvements, and the like. The predecessor to Michigan Agritourism Association, the Michigan Farm Market and Agricultural Tourism Association (MiFMAT), was formed in 2006 to get local officials who proposed restrictive agricultural-tourism ordinances removed. In 2009, MiFMAT succeeded in getting Generally Accepted Agricultural Management Practices (GAAMPs) for farm markets included under Michigan's Right to Farm Act. However, the farm market GAAMPs only covered farm markets, while agricultural tourism encompasses many other value-added activities such as corn mazes, haunted houses, U-picks, fish ponds, and public events, including weddings, that are often not permitted under local ordinances and regulations. Given this \"patchwork\" of regulations, MATA must work steadily on developing broader state legislation for agricultural tourism as well as on educating government officials about agricultural tourism and its benefits (Vassano 2010). We believe there are many areas of mutual interests among these disparate operations, but much more information is needed including more input from agricultural-tourism operators. Only very limited information on agricultural tourism was collected for the first time by the U.S. Agriculture Census in 2012. Standardized regularly scheduled nationwide surveys are needed as is more support from state farm extension agencies. Extrapolating data for a small sample is hardly ideal, but in the absence of more extensive sampling by state and provincial farm extension agencies, it is a useful first step."}]
