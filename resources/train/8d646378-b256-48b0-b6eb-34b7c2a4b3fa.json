[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Dementias are now recognized to present some of the most important challenges to face medicine in the 21st century. The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) reported that, in 1991, the prevalence figures for all types of dementia were 80/1,000 in those over the age of 65 and 345/1,000 in those over the age of 85 in this country. The study projected that by 2011 there would be 475,000 individuals over the age of 65 affected with dementia. 1 Of those affected with dementia, 50-65% have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), while mixed causes of dementia are increasingly recognized. The direct and indirect cost of care for each patient with AD has been estimated to vary between $16,000 to as much as $37,000 per year (1998, CAD), with increasing costs tied to disease severity. 2 This estimate ABSTRACT: The magnitude of the problems faced by an aging Canadian society has been clearly identified. Perhaps the single most important problem is the increasing incidence of dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50-60% of the dementias in later life within a spectrum of other contributing dementias. Regulatory approval has been given to Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate AD, and conditional approval to memantine for the symptoms of moderate to severe AD. There has been no regulatory approval for the treatment of the degenerative dementias beyond AD. The very rapid progress in the past decade in biotechnology and in the molecular biology of the dementias is supporting a new generation of innovative treatment strategies that will more directly target the underlying disease pathogenic mechanisms. Such treatments will foreseeably include immunotherapies, anti-aggregants that may prevent misfolding and deposition of proteins, and neuroregenerative interventions. These Guidelines follow the 2nd Canadian Conference on the Development of Antidementia Therapies, held in 2004, which covered a range of design, methodological and ethical issues facing clinical researchers and regulatory authorities. They are intended to provide a common point of reference and guidance in Canada for therapeutic development of the dementias.\nR\u00c9SUM\u00c9: Lignes directrices canadiennes pour le d\u00e9veloppement de traitements de la d\u00e9mence: sommaire conceptuel.

This rapid growth of research, however, requires careful consideration of the range of ethical issues that come up almost continually. As well, the development of new treatment approaches for dementia will require position papers to be published and disseminated to stimulate the public discussion needed on these very important issues related to antidementia treatments. The existence of an integrated network of investigators from within the Consortium of Canadian Centres for Clinical Cognitive Research (C5R), the Canadian Neurological Society, the Canadian Academy of Geriatric Psychiatry (CAGP), and the Canadian Geriatrics Society (CGS), allow Canada to play a significant role in addressing this important global problem.\nThe goal of this Guidelines paper is to provide a broad conceptual summary that can serve as a point of common reference to clinicians, clinical researchers, government agencies, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology industries in Canada who all face the important challenge of the dementias together in the coming decades.

Conn (CAGP), C. MacKnight (CGS), and M. Freedman (Canadian Neurological Society). An agenda was developed to cover the range of diagnostic and treatment standards, study designs, ethical issues related to the development of therapies, outcome measures, biological markers, and the broad spectrum of the dementias. Emphasis was placed on both the current state of the art as well as on the anticipated future issues around each topic. Each participating organization was asked to recommend five representatives with recognized expertise for each topic area, to ensure the highest level of contribution to the conference. Selected consultants were then added to the conference to cover specialized areas outside of the expertise of the working group, including D. Streiner who spoke on design and methodologic issues, and J. Poirier who provided a future vision of the development of therapies. Important regulatory guidance was provided by three participating members of the Central Nervous System (CNS) Division of the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) of Health Canada. The Alzheimer Society of Canada sent three representatives to the Conference to ensure that the perspective of patients and caregivers was fully considered. Finally, there were a number of international external consultants invited, including the Chair of the International Working Group on the Harmonization of Antidementia Drug Guidelines (Dr. J.-M. Orgogozo) , and a member of the United States Food and Drug Administration Advisory Panel on Dementia (Dr. S. DeKosky). In preparation for the conference, all of the medical society representatives were asked to submit a 500-word summary statement and potential recommendations for their assigned topic. Participants working within specific topic areas met with the conveners via teleconference to review their progress and discuss their perspectives before the conference. Each participant was also asked to submit a more expanded 2,000-word background paper to capture the basis of their summary statements and recommendations. At the time of the conference each topic was presented in a short plenary format, followed by an open-session discussion of the recommendations that had been proposed. The summary of the conference and its recommendations were finalized and prepared for publication by the authors of this paper.\nDuring the conference, all participants provided statements of disclosure of their involvement with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which are held on file. Funding for the conference was received through a workshop grant of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Institute on Aging and through grants-in-aid to the meeting from a large number of pharmaceutical companies who were invited in an observer role (see Acknowledgements for details).

While a number of diagnostic criteria have been proposed worldwide, in Canada, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) is the most widely used framework for the general definition of dementia. 5 This diagnostic standard continues to be revised and will be updated.\nThere are some noted deficiencies in the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Of particular concern is the central emphasis on the memory domain, whereas some forms of dementia frequently present without a prominent memory deficit. The provision that there be a progressive decline in any two cognitive domains, each resulting in impairment in social or occupational function, would allow a broader range of dementias to be captured beyond those that can be identified by the DSM-IV-TR. Furthermore, there is no requirement for neuroimaging within the diagnostic research criteria, yet it is standard that neuroimaging be performed in all subjects participating in dementia therapeutic trials.

It is now recognized that cerebrovascular dementia and AD co-exist clinically at a frequency in 30-40% of all dementia cases. 10, 11 Other subgroups within possible AD have also been identified. 12 \"Possible AD\" has been generally removed from AD clinical trials research focus and the licensing of AD treatment for \"probable\" AD leaves a significant percentage of patients with mixed disorders being treated off of labeled indication and without sufficient supportive data on efficacy and safety. The deficiencies of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria in addressing comorbid and mixed AD pathologies need to be addressed in future AD diagnostic criteria, as will the need to include study groups with mixed pathologies within the clinical trial development of therapies.\nWith the emergence of naturalistic and treatment studies focusing on earlier AD identification beginning with the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), there is also a current need to develop more sensitive formal diagnostic criteria for early disease.

With their detailed characterization of these recognized subtypes, the Neary criteria have some advantage for use in clinical trials research.

Although intervention at the earliest point in the dementia pathway is clearly desirable, there are a number of issues surrounding MCI that will need resolution to allow it to be an acceptable condition for regulatory approval.

The progressive nature of these illnesses requires intercession as quickly as possible, while non-judicious use of inadequately tested treatment with doubtful efficacy and significant toxicity can be injurious and is clearly undesirable.\nA further concern with respect to emerging biotechnological therapies for AD is the absence of reliable animal models for investigation. The \"new biology\" of immune therapies, nerve growth factors, genetically-engineered tissues, and other tissue modifying techniques pose both ill-defined risks and considerable opportunity. While showing therapeutic promise they may also have significant risks. For example, one AD immunotherapy trial with amyloid beta (Ab) was initiated, then discontinued in Phase II when an important and serious meningoencephalitis occurred in 6% of subjects. 54 Consideration should be given to testing beyond murine models before taking novel putative disease-modifying treatment into human studies to assist in ascertaining a signal of safety and, where possible, efficacy.\nThe Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement, Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS, 2003) embodies principles for ethical decision-making, with some more clearly defined than others. 55 The TCPS is the basis upon which Canadian research review boards review their submissions, though it is unclear in its discussion of consent, assent, and proxy-decision-making in dementia.

With treatments targeting the biology of the disease directly, Phase I trials will usually require individuals with the disease rather than healthy volunteers. The traditional role of Phase II studies has been the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of drugs in small, well-defined, restricted patient groups, as well as to obtain signal of efficacy as proof of principle. This usually involves multiple doses, looking for maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For treatments targeting the biology of the disease directly, alternative research pathways to MTD seem likely to be pursued. These may center around the treatment dose that can provide both a biological and clinical response in Phase II, as a prelude to a larger scale Phase II-III trial looking for a clinically-meaningful response in a representative population. 59 The dose selected may not be related or determined by the MTD. The success of this alternative approach remains to be demonstrated. Open-label extension studies on the active drug after Phase II would be useful sources of the necessary safety data for regulatory approval to proceed to Phase III. Pharmacovigilance after marketing (or a structured Phase IV trial concentrating on safety) is essential to detect unexpected and important adverse effects. There is currently no structured program in Canada for this and this represents an unmet need."}, {"section_title": "Study Designs", "text": "New agents for the treatment of AD are most likely to be developed with randomized, controlled trials that allow for the use of the standard of care treatment for all subjects, with the experimental agent or placebo added on. This design will restrict the new indication to add-on therapy, while new monotherapy claims will foreseeably require alternative approaches to add-on designs, including testing for superiority, equivalence and noninferiority. The use of a placebo design without a usual care background will likely be restricted to those patients who are intolerant, those with a non-response to standard pharmacological treatment, or those who give an informed refusal of standard pharmacological care. Each of these scenarios is anticipated to occur infrequently. A further design option is a three-arm trial where there is an experimental treatment, an AChEI and a placebo arm. The size of the placebo arm would be as small as possible, with as short duration of placebo exposure as necessary to demonstrate the requisite efficacy. Some studies have attempted an enrichment technique through a defining of early responders who then continue on a more extended protocol; 60 however, this is not a currently recommended approach.\nMost studies are designed to compare the results on a particular test at time X between groups. Survival studies (time to a clinically relevant event) will be seen more often, and may be simpler for patients, families, third-party payers and nonexpert professionals to interpret. These types of studies have been tried in AD. 61 For disease modification the randomized withdrawal design that has been proposed has particular ethical problems, while the randomized start design assumes that the response to an agent (either symptomatic or disease-modifying) is independent of the stage at which the agent is started. [62] [63] [64] Designs based on survival to a clinically meaningful endpoint might solve some of these problems; however, there are a number of considerations that must be resolved to establish widely accepted and appropriate disease milestones. To date, studies have used time to nursing home placement, decline in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage, loss of ADLs, and death. 61 Nursing home placement as a disease milestone is complex, as it is determined not only by disease progression but by bed availability, caregivers and other socioeconomic factors that have little to do with pharmaceutical treatment. Death may not be a suitable outcome in dementia if there is prolonged suffering and incapacity in a poor state of health. The delay in losses of ADL may be a suitable outcome; however, there are stage-specific changes and confounding factors can enter into consideration based on settings of care. The emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) has been proposed but phenomenologically NPS may be recurrent and not a suitable permanent dementia milestone. The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that delaying a clinical milestone in a parallel-group, controlled trial would not be viewed as sufficient evidence for disease modification. 65 This leaves the unresolved question of whether in the absence of a surrogate biological marker, the demonstration of disease modification is a realistic goal.\nOther study designs for dementia also have pitfalls. Multiple cross-over trials are inappropriate for a progressive disease, given that the response at one point in time would not be expected to be the same as the response at a different point in time, precluding the pooling of results from each phase. The use of historical controls is also inappropriate because of the rapid changes in the management of the whole patient with AD, making subjects from even just a few years ago very different from those today."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Considerations", "text": "Until recently, the gold standard for assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of new medications has been the placebocontrolled, RCT. With a need to advance monotherapy claims in the presence of a standard of care, other study design options include superiority, equivalence, and non-inferiority trials. 66 In superiority trials, the goal is to establish that the new drug is better (i.e., more effective or with a more benign side-effect profile) than the standard. Because such trials require much larger sample sizes than placebo-controlled studies and are rarely required to bring a drug onto market, they are infrequently done. In equivalence trials, the aim is to show that the new and standard agents have similar degrees of effectiveness or adverse events; however, due to sample size requirements, most studies of new drugs are non-inferiority trials in which it is sufficient to demonstrate that the new drug is not significantly worse than the existing ones. 67 There are methodological considerations with equivalence and non-inferiority trials, including (a) an inability to determine if the drugs were equally good or equally bad; (b) poorly executed trials with low power can be mistaken for \"proving\" equivalence or non-inferiority; (c) the equivalence interval is arbitrary; (d) successive non-inferiority trials may lead to a gradual reduction in effectiveness; and (e) often larger trials are necessary. 67 At the analytic level a strict adherence to intention to treat analyses carries difficulties when applied to AD and other dementias. In dementia trials, subjects often die or withdraw for reasons unrelated to their dementia, and analyses only of completers or with an ITT approach using Last Observation Carried Forward can significantly bias the results. The use of retrieved drop-outs, though theoretically helpful, is difficult to carry out in practice. Studies will need to be designed and analyzed keeping these particular analytic challenges in mind.

The ADAS-cog is useful for differentiating AD patients from controls 69 and for stratifying dementia severity. 71, 72 Worsening on the ADAS-cog is not linear across disease severity, having both a ceiling and a floor effect. 73 Patients with moderately severe AD deteriorate more on the ADAS-cog over a year than patients with mild or very severe disease. 74 Mohs et al 75 have investigated some additions to the ADAScog and found that a cancellation task is sensitive across a range of dementia severities. A word learning task with delayed recall and a maze task may be useful additions in studying patients with early dementia or MCI.\nThe ADAS-cog has been used within a number of recent MCI studies where its utility as an outcome measure will be evaluable. 76, 77 It has also been used in drug trials for vascular and mixed dementia and has demonstrated sensitivity and reliability to measure change longitudinally in these conditions. 17, 78, 79 In more advanced dementia the most widely used assessment tool is the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). 80, 81 The domains tested are analogous to those assessed by the ADAS-cog. The SIB is reliable and valid and its utility has been demonstrated in moderate to severe dementia. [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 87 is often used to classify dementia severity. Floor and ceiling effects are limiting, 88, 89 with scores being affected by both age and education. 90 Although the MMSE has been included as an outcome measure in trials, [91] [92] [93] its main use has been as an inclusion criterion. It is part of the lexicon that allows an understanding by the wider clinical community around subjects selected for trials.\nRemarkably little is known about the specificity of symptomatic medications for particular cognitive domains, even though this may provide important insight into treatment response. As medications are developed in the future it is foreseeable that more focused testing of specified cognitive domains with neuropsychological testing may be a preferred approach to investigate potential treatment benefits. Inclusion of more fine-grained neuropsychological testing, particularly of executive function, should be encouraged at least as secondary outcome measures in trials. 94 "}, {"section_title": "Recommendations on Cognition", "text": "The "}, {"section_title": "Neuropsychiatric Symptoms", "text": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in dementia. They increase in prevalence with severity and are a major source of disability, patient distress, caregiver burden, and cost, and are an important determinant of nursing home placement. 95, 96 This grouping of symptoms includes disorders of mood, behaviour as well as psychosis. Given both their clinical and social importance, antidementia therapies should be directed at NPS including aggression, psychosis and mood as specific treatment targets. 97 Mood assessment is of particular importance, yet the actual diagnosis of depression in dementia is complex and requires a high level of clinical knowledge and acumen, as well as second party collateral information. Instruments that have been specifically developed to assess mood in the non-demented population, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 98 and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, 99 may be useful in mildly demented individuals, but they are not reliable in the later stages of dementia when language and comprehension have declined significantly. The Geriatric Depression Scale, which is widely used in clinical practice, has been shown to be unreliable in those with increased cognitive impairment. [100] [101] [102] Many of the global neurobehavioural rating instruments do include mood items; however, their clinical significance has not been established.\nIn studies where the assessment of mood in dementia is of major importance, it is preferable to use an instrument that has been developed specifically for dementia, and which integrates caregiver information into the rating. Two useful instruments for clinical trials that focus on mood as an outcome measure are the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. 103, 104 The Dementia Mood Assessment Scale was developed for rating the severity of depressed mood in mild to moderate AD. 103 It was modelled on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale but excludes items that are more subjective and therefore prone to error. For patients who are more severely demented, the Cornell Scale is a better choice, as it is a caregiver-rated scale that is particularly suited to differentiating between cognitive and mood symptoms, and is sensitive to treatment effects over a wide range of depression and dementia severity. 104 Outside of depression, rating instruments designed specifically to measure the spectrum of NPS in dementia are generally caregiver-rated. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is particularly useful as it is brief and addresses a wide range of symptoms. 105 It measures 12 domains and has been validated with evidence of reliability and sensitivity to measure change within clinical trials. Concerns about the NPI scale include some difficulties in the metrics of the scale as well as the wide variance that is seen within the trials that have included it.\n106,107 The Behavioural Pathology in AD Scale (BEHAVE-AD) is also considered to be a valid and reliable scale that measures 25 behaviours in seven clusters. 108 It includes a global assessment of caregiver distress and has been used within a number of RCTs demonstrating both reliability and sensitivity to change. 109, 110 The behavioural rating scale for dementia of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-BRSD) is another useful instrument that measures 46 items in eight clusters. 111 Unlike the BEHAVE-AD, it evaluates the frequency of behavioural symptoms as opposed to their severity.\nThe Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is the best-known instrument for the detailed evaluation of agitation. 112 The original version assesses 29 different items and was developed for use in nursing homes although its use has been extended to other settings. It is particularly useful when a study is being considered around the target symptom of agitation.

It usually progresses hierarchically, starting with demanding occupational tasks, followed by instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and finally affecting the basic ADLs (bADLs), such as dressing, personal hygiene, and continence. 113 The ADL status can also be used to chart the course of the disease, having utility as a prognostic marker, and significantly contributing to caregiver burden and institutionalization. 96 For these reasons, functional assessment has been widely used as an outcome measure in treatment trials of dementia and is emerging as a useful coprimary outcome measure particularly in more advanced dementia.\nFunctional decline results from a complex interaction of factors, including cognitive decline (particularly executive dysfunction), behaviour, motor skills, perceptual and sensory abilities, medical comorbidities, and social variables. 114 The loss of functional autonomy does not, however, invariably parallel the loss of cognitive function.\nThe ADL scales have been specifically developed for use in the assessment of AD, and have been integrated as outcome measures in clinical trials with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. The most widely used scales are the Alzheimer Disease Functional Assessment and Change Scale (ADFACS), 115 the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), 116 the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), 117 and the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS). 118 These scales share some common features. They each assess both ADLs and IADLs, are based on an interview with the caregiver, and can be completed within 15-20 minutes. Only the DAD assesses the hierarchical manner with which function declines cross referenced to the cognitive processing involved for each item. 116 All of these scales have been validated and have been used in trials involving predominantly patients with AD.

Though they have been a regulatory specified primary outcome measure in antidementia trials for the FDA, they also have found acceptance from clinicians. They require skilled judgments to be made by experienced clinicians about whether treatment has been associated with clinically detectable change at the individual patient level. As a dual primary outcome measure within dementia RCTs, they ensure that in addition to a statistically significant effect on a primary objective psychometric or other outcome, there is also a clinically detectable global change. The CIBIC-plus assessment, which requires caregiver input as well as patient assessment, has been validated and has been shown to have both measurement sensitivity and reliability in AD. 119 Other global measures, such as the CDR and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), 120, 121 which consist of descriptions of patient characteristics in a variety of symptomatic domains (e.g., memory, behaviour, functioning), as well as social domains (e.g., home and hobbies, community affairs, personal care, ADLs), allow an alternative approach to the CGIC/CIBIC-plus. 122 To judge where a patient falls on these various domains, clinicians either conduct a semi-structured interview with ratings of each domain or complete an aggregate rating with all clinical information available following the assessment. The CDR allows both an overall stage as well as a sum of the individual domains to be determined, while the GDS provides a specified stage. These global assessments have been used in many clinical trials, particularly in those longer than six months.\nThe experience with global clinical measures to date suggests that the above approaches both can identify treatment effects of about the same order of magnitude as the ADAS-Cog; 123-125 but they do not identify the same patients as benefiting. 126 However, there are important limitations to the use of global assessments that should encourage refinements in future research studies. The currently available global rating scales do not consider patient preferences in evaluating the clinical meaningfulness of antidementia drugs. Furthermore, there have also been recent data demonstrating that the CIBIC-plus, as it is currently operationalized, has a limited ability to detect improvement as opposed to decline, a deficiency that will need to be addressed as treatment opportunities with larger effect sizes become available for testing."}, {"section_title": "127", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Recommendations on Global Assessments", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The use of global assessments as a primary outcome measure has both clinical and ecological validity.

The QOL measures vary with respect to content, respondent, method of administration, and target population.\nUntil recently, there was a focus on proxy and observational QOL measures, because it was believed that dementia patients could not rate their own QOL; 136, 137 however, there is now substantial evidence to suggest that a majority of mild-moderate dementia patients can meaningfully rate their own QOL.

To date, few dementia clinical trials have included patient QOL as an outcome. 151 A number of AChEI trials used a poorly validated generic QOL measure that exhibited marked variability and inconsistent results, 93, [152] [153] [154] while other trials used The Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS), which was developed as a dementia-specific QOL measure.

From a societal perspective, data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) have suggested that the costs of the illness rise very significantly in transition from mild to severe disease. 2 Despite the obvious importance of moderate to severe AD, there have been few treatment trials in this population. In Canada, memantine has received conditional regulatory approval for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe AD. There is a strong rationale for attention to this stage of dementia severity as CSHA estimated that the prevalence of moderate to severe dementia was 50% of all cases of dementia. 1 For the purposes of RCTs, subjects with moderate to severe AD can be distinguished from milder disease through the combination of a global staging instrument and a screening cognitive measure. The GDS stage 5-7 or CDR stage 2-5 are recommended for global staging. [120] [121] [122] For cognitive screening in moderate to severe trials, average MMSE scores should be no higher than 12, and should have a range of inclusion from 0 to 15. Until there is an approved standard of care for severe AD, trials should be randomized and double-blind with placebo controls. In the future, when a standard of care for severe AD is established, a design to allow all patients being treated with \"standard care\" and then an add-on design will likely be needed with the provision that for a monotherapy claim there will be a need for direct head-to-head designed RCTs.\nOutcome measures in moderate to severe AD trials must address stage specific symptoms. Since small changes in cognitive function may have questionable clinical relevance at this stage, primary outcomes should include a global rating, and might alternatively include a functional or behavioural coprimary outcome measure. The CIBIC-plus has been successfully used in previous RCTs in this population. 107 There is some suggestion that it relies heavily on ADLs and behavioural changes, which is appropriate for moderate to severe AD. Function can be measured with the ADCS/ADLSEV or DAD, though both scales are limited in long-term care settings. NPS at these stages can be measured with the NPI and efforts to include subjects with significant NPS in RCTs are well justified. The SIB is currently recommended as a cognitive outcome measure.\nStabilization of function, behaviour, and cognition are all reasonable goals of therapy, and potentially more realistic than significant improvement at this stage.

From the preliminary presentations of these studies, as well as from previous population studies, 174 it has become apparent that small differences in the MCIa inclusion criteria, in the cut-off points on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory, in the exclusion criteria or in the AD diagnostic conversion criteria, all impact on the rates of progression to dementia in RCTs. Careful interpretation of this variability will be required in determining whether this is a problem with the validity of the MCIa construct, the treatments being used or the underlying heterogeneity of MCIa that have yet to be reconciled.\nIt was estimated in a study of Canadian dementia referral clinics that only 25% of MCI is MCIa. This leaves the largest group of referred subjects with MCI outside of the MCIa studies. 10 From a regulatory perspective, it can be anticipated that were a successful MCIa RCT to be reported, there would still be the need to address the clinical heterogeneity and efficacy of the therapy of MCI more broadly within a usual care setting, as it would need to be demonstrated that treatment is both safe and efficacious in usual care settings. 175, 176 It reflects the important and diverse causes of vascular injury and the related patterns of cognitive impairment.

These studies have underscored some of the important conceptual and methodological challenges. \"Probable DLB\" as defined by the McKeith criteria is an infrequent disorder for which RCT recruitment has been very difficult. 23 A large scale RCT did not meet its recruitment targets citing both administrative delays and recruitment difficulties in some centers. 181 For PDD there is still a lack of consensus definition. 26 There are unanswered questions over the natural history of these disorders and there are a lack of validated outcome measures. As with vascular dementia, there is a tendency to call on outcome measures that have been validated for use within AD trials, though there are important differences in the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms that would make the AD outcomes more insensitive probes than those that might be developed and validated for DLB/PDD.

The development pipeline includes approaches that aim to protect the brain from damage by reactive oxygen species or inflammation, [218] [219] [220] that can stimulate nerve regeneration and can either prevent or enable the removal of the protein aggregates that form the neuropathological tombstones of neurodegeneration. 221 There are now strong grounds for believing that compounds that act to prevent or reverse amyloid plaque formation will modify the progression of AD and possibly related forms of dementia. [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] In the next few years, many medicines directed at these targets will enter Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Anti-amyloid therapies, antioxidants, stem cells, nerve growth factors, insulin modulating approaches and neurotransmitter based therapies are all on the visible horizon of clinical trials.

They serve to update the initial set of 1995 Canadian Guidelines for the Development of Antidementia Therapies. A set of Guidelines, developed through the process undertaken for this Conference, provides a point of common reference to clinical researchers, government agencies and the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industries engaged in the therapeutic development in this field.\nThe approach taken by the conference was \"oracle-based\" with topic review and presentation by recognized experts who were asked to reference evidence-based data where it existed, and to craft recommendations within each topic area. They were also asked to provide working recommendations and expert opinion where there was no substantive evidence base or where opinions were disparate but where some guidance was still desirable. The Conference did not adhere to a consensus-based approach with voting and with levels of evidence, rather the authorship of this paper was charged with providing a unifying synthesis of the presentations and discussions at the meeting, and the written submissions of the presenters.\nThese Canadian Guidelines are unique for having been peerreviewed and then published within a peer-reviewed journal. This has allowed for significant feedback prior to publication, as well as for the anticipated discussion in the broader community that will follow their publication. They stand apart from the more usual process where draft guidelines are developed by the Regulatory agencies with some consultation from the expert community. At the same time, there are clearly significant limitations to Guidelines that are developed in this way. In some topic areas, generalizations may have been made that overrepresent the opinions of the community of experts that convened for the meeting. The response of the community-atlarge to this publication may help address this deficiency and is encouraged. In the development of the Guidelines, outside of the conference, there was no formal process for presenting dissenting opinions and these may not have been fully represented in the final Guidelines. Though there was participation and input received from the representatives of the Regulatory agency through discussion at the Conference, to date these published Guidelines have not been accorded any formal standing as an official government-endorsed Guidelines and should not be construed as having such standing.\nA reflection of the progress in this field of dementia can be appreciated in comparing the current Guidelines with those of 1995. Our updated list of topic areas, covered in detail in the current Guidelines, in many instances were only alluded to in the 1995 version of the Guidelines. At the same time, there are significant uncertainties that are apparent within a variety of these topic areas. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) was one such area, and was the topic that led to the most contentious discussion. Whereas there was general agreement that it represents a state of cognitive function that falls outside of normal for age and short of dementia by formal criteria, it was unclear whether the amnestic form MCIa will survive as a meaningful diagnostic construct or defining characteristic suitable for clinical trials. The heterogeneity of populations enrolled and outcomes of RCTs that have used this MCIa is apparent and not fully resolved. In the area of VaD RCTs the adoption of AD clinical trials methodology and outcomes has likely hampered the ability to evaluate emerging therapies. The necessity for standardization of the neuroimaging criteria for RCTs is now recognized for VCI/VaD as is the need for longer study durations to address some of the more important clinical outcomes and changes that occur in this condition. For PDD and DLB, there is a fundamental uncertainty over whether these are discrete clinical disorders that should be evaluated separately in RCTs or whether they are part of a continuum with pathological overlap that should allow them to be studied together in larger scale RCTs. In FTD there is a large unmet need for treatment and there are no formal standards yet for therapeutic trials.\nThis Conference concludes that there is room to define consensus standards for clinical trials outside of AD and that this might well be undertaken even in advance of promising candidate therapeutic interventions. Finally, among the new topics is the area of mixed dementia, where there has been a growing recognition that a significant proportion of dementia cases do have multiple overlapping neuropathological processes. The regulatory input is that some definition of mixed dementia will be needed, with data presented to receive therapeutic labeling for such conditions whose inclusion in RCTs is recommended.\nIt is clear, from the reflections of the progress of the past ten years and the challenges outlined, that the development of Guidelines will not be a static process. There will be a foreseeable future need to update these 2004 Guidelines. The Conference is optimistic that this future challenge will be met in time and that the current set will serve us well."}]
