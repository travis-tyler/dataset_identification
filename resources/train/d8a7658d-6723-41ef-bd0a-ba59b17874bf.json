For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the likelihood of progression to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important not only for individual patient care, but also for the identification of participants in clinical trial, so as to provide early interventions. Biomarkers based on various neuroimaging modalities could offer complementary information regarding different aspects of disease progression. The current study adopted a weighted multi-modality sparse representationbased classification method to combine data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, from three imaging modalities: Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir PET. We included 117 normal controls (NC) and 110 MCI patients, 27 of whom progressed to AD within 36 months (pMCI), while the remaining 83 remained stable (sMCI) over the same time period. Modality-specific biomarkers were identified to distinguish MCI from NC and to predict pMCI among MCI. These included the hippocampus, amygdala, middle temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, the posterior cingulum, precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen for florbetapir PET. Results indicated that FDG-PET may be a more effective modality in discriminating MCI from NC and in predicting pMCI than florbetapir PET and MRI. Combining modality-specific sensitive biomarkers from the three modalities boosted the discrimination accuracy of MCI from NC (76.7%) and the prediction accuracy of pMCI (82.5%) when compared with the best single-modality results (73.6% for MCI and 75.6% for pMCI with FDG-PET).\nKeywords: Florbetapir positron emission tomography, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, mild cognitive impairment, multi-modality, prediction, progressive mild cognitive impairment 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

Over time, some MCI patients convert to AD (denoted as progressive MCI, pMCI), while others remain stable or even revert to normal healthy cognitive status (defined as stable MCI, sMCI) [3] . The accurate prediction of MCI, especially pMCI that probably converts to AD, is significant for the timely provision of patient care.\nBesides the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [4] , biomarkers from various neuroimaging modalities have been increasingly suggested as of utility in predicting MCI and pMCI [5] [6] [7] [8] . Such biomarkers include those obtained from volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) measuring either metabolic or pathological burden using different radioactive tracers.\nVolumetric MRI measures have been widely used to detect the structural changes in the early stage of AD (e.g., MCI) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . For example, Jefferson et al. used hippocampal volume and cortical thickness to predict MCI conversion [9] ; Fan et al. considered spatial patterns of brain atrophy including the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, orbitofrontal, and medial prefrontal grey matter to identify MCI patients [10] ; Zhang et al. identified regional gray matter volumes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus to predict the cognitive impairment of MCI patients [11] ; Willette et al. performed independent component analysis on gray matter images and used several independent components to diagnose MCI [12] ; Risacher et al. revealed that besides decreased hippocampal volume being a robust biomarker to predict MCI, the medial temporal structure was also a promising MRI marker for the same purpose [13] .\nFluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), which measures cerebral glucose metabolism, provides sensitive biomarkers for the prediction of MCI and converters [14] [15] [16] . For instance, Mosconi et al. reported that hypometabolism in the inferior parietal cortex was indicative of potential MCI progression [14] ; Chen et al. revealed that the hypometabolic convergence index based on FGD-PET could be applied to distinguish those who progressed to AD from those who did not among patients with MCI [15] ; Cerami et al. found hypometabolism in the orbitofrontal region, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporal lobe in patients with MCI [16] .\nMost recently, florbetapir PET, which measures the accumulation of amyloid in the brain, has been introduced to study MCI [17, 18] . For example, Camus et al. reported that patients with MCI showed a relatively high uptake of florbetapir in the posterior cingulate cortex [17] ; Rosenberg et al. found that greater standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were associated with poorer performance on all cognitive tests; the averaged SUVR of occipital, parietal, precuneus, temporal, and anterior cingulate regions were correlated with cognition scores, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) [18] .\nThe biomarkers from different neuroimaging modalities could reflect different aspects of the early stages of diseases. Combination of biomarkers from different imaging modalities could offer complementary information for a given disease [19] [20] [21] [22] and might facilitate more accurate diagnosis or prediction results than single-modality biomarkers [5, 23, 24] . Multiple studies have reported a combination of different modalities in investigating MCI. For example, when combining MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data [5, 25, 26] , Westman et al. achieved an accuracy of 77.6% in classifying MCI from normal controls (NC), which was superior to each of the singlemodality results (71.8% for MRI and 70.3% for CSF). Furthermore, adopting MRI + CSF they also predicted the conversion from MCI to AD within 36 months with an accuracy of 66.1% [5] ; Regarding MRI and FDG-PET [21] [22] [23] , Liu et al. combined these modalities in discriminating MCI from NC and achieved better performance than using singlemodality biomarkers [23] ; When combining MRI, CSF, and FDG-PET [24, 27] , Zhang et al. discriminated MCI from NC with an accuracy of 76.4%, which was again superior to the single-modality results (72.0% for MRI, 71.4% for CSF, and 71.6% for FDG-PET) [24] .\nIn this study, we explored the contribution of different neuroimaging modalities in their predictive power and characterized the sensitive biomarkers from each modality, so as to conveniently and effectively predict MCI/pMCI. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database encompassing three modalities: MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET. A multi-modal algorithm based on sparse representation-based classification (wmSRC) [28] was applied to study the baseline differences between MCI and NC and between pMCI (who converted to AD within 36 months) and sMCI (who did not convert to AD within 36 months). The experimental results indicated that FDG-PET may contribute more to the accurate prediction of MCI/pMCI than florbetapir PET when using a set of brain regions as features. Furthermore, the results also suggested that combining features from MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET increases the accuracy of discriminating MCI from pMCI, compared with using features from a single-modality; a small set of modality-specific sensitive biomarkers were identified for effectively predicting MCI/pMCI."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni. loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The determination of sensitive and specific markers for very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness and lessening the time and cost of clinical trials. ADNI is the result of the efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, aged 55 to 90 years, to participate in the study (approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years). The research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating site and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. For up-to-date information, see http://www.adni-info.org.\nThree imaging modalities were investigated, namely MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET, and a total of 227 subjects were included, consisting of 110 patients with MCI (27 cases of pMCI, which converted to AD within 36 months; and 83 cases of sMCI, which remained stable during the same time interval, or the participant left the study) and 117 NC "}, {"section_title": "Data preprocessing", "text": "All the MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET data were preprocessed as follows according to the procedures described in our previous study [28] . The preprocessing of the volumetric MRI data was performed via the Voxel-Based Morphometry 8 (VBM8) Toolbox (http://dbm.neuro.unijena.de/vbm8), which involved two main segmentation and normalization steps. First, segmentation was performed on each MRI image to obtain the grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using adaptive maximum posterior and partial volume estimation [32, 33] . Two denoising methods, namely a spatially adaptive non-local means denoising filter and a classical Markov random field approach, were adopted to improve segmentation performance. Then, the grey matter images obtained from the segmentation step were used for the following analysis:\nA diffeomorphic anatomical registration using exponential Lie algebra (DARTEL) protocol was applied to normalize the grey matter images [34] with iterative template creation and image registration, after which the grey matter maps were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The registered grey matter maps were multiplied by Jacobian determinants with only non-linear warping to exclude individual differences in total intracranial volume.\nThe FDG and florbetapir PET images of each subject were first co-registered to his/her MRI using a rigid body transformation, and subsequently were warped to the cohort-specific DARTEL template. Then, the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated using the whole brain as the reference region for each FDG-PET and cerebellum as the reference region for each florbetapir PET.\nThe normalized grey matter images from MRI, SUVR images from FDG-PET, and SUVR images from florbetapir PET were then used for further analysis."}, {"section_title": "Feature extraction", "text": "After preprocessing, features needed to be extracted from each modality for the further prediction of MCI/pMCI with multi-modal and single-modality features.

Then, for each subject, 90 features were extracted for each modality. Specifically, for one ROI, the mean gray matter volume, the mean SUVR value of FDG-PET, and the mean SUVR value of florbetapir PET were calculated by averaging the corresponding value of all the voxels within that ROI as one feature for MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET, respectively.

[24] , 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 10 times to avoid the bias generated in the classification step, and a grid search approach on each training set was implemented to optimize the combining weight parameters \u03b1. For each 10-fold cross-validation, the procedures were as follows. First, 10 subsets were randomly equally partitioned from the whole samples. Each time one subset was taken as the test set and the remaining nine were used as the training set. Then, weight selection was performed based on the training set with another 10-fold cross validation. In particular, a grid search approach with a range of [0, 1] at a step size of 0.1 was adopted to determine the weight parameters \u03b1 of multiple modalities at each fold.

The performance of wmSRC was evaluated by calculating the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the test samples.

A key issue was identifying which features were most sensitive in their predictive power. Therefore, wmSRC for three modalities (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) and each single-modality (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET) was investigated using a different number (from 1 to 90) of the ranked features from each modality. Then, a small set of discriminating features was chosen from each modality to generate the final predictions.\nTo choose the top few sensitive biomarkers from each modality for the prediction of MCI and pMCI, we investigated different number (from 1 to 90) of ranked features for multi-modal discriminations (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) and the single-modality discriminations (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET). Subsequently, a small set of features from each modality were chosen for the final prediction, according to their predictive power.\nThe results from single-modality (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET) and multi-modal (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) analyses are displayed in Fig. 1. Figure 1a and 1b indicate that discriminating MCI from pMCI by combining features from multiple modalities was superior to single-modality features, and the single-modality results from FDG-PET were superior to those of florbetapir PET along with different number of the ranked features. In particular, the weights \u03b1 in wmSRC for MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET were optimized by a grid search approach and finally set as 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3 for MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET, respectively, for discriminating MCI from NC; and 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6, respectively, for discriminating pMCI from sMCI.\nThe multi-modal analysis achieved reasonable accuracy for discriminating MCI from pMCI even with a combination of only the top 6% (i.e., 6) features from each modality (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET). Thus, to provide a conveniently small set of features to effectively predict MCI and pMCI, the top 6% of ranked features from each modality were chosen as sensitive biomarkers to obtain the final prediction. Table 3 lists the most sensitive 6% of biomarkers from each modality and Fig. 2 shows them in the template space. Table 4 displays the prediction results from multi-modal (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) and single-modality (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET) analyses using the sensitive biomarkers shown in Table 3 , as well as with all 90 features. For the discrimination of MCI from NC with the sensitive biomarkers, the multi-modal analysis achieved an accuracy of 76.7%, which was superior to single-modality analyses (MRI: 63.9%, florbetapir PET: 68.7%, FDG-PET: 73.6%). With all 90 features, the multi-modal analysis achieved an accuracy of 74.5%, which was superior to singlemodality analyses (MRI: 68.7%, florbetapir PET: 70.5%, FDG-PET: 71.8%). These results show that when using the sensitive biomarkers, the discrimination performance for MCI versus NC was comparable to using all 90 features. For the discrimination of pMCI from sMCI, the combination of multi-modal sensitive biomarkers achieved an accuracy of 82.5%, which was superior to MRI (57.6%), florbetapir PET (73.2%), and FDG-PET (75.6%). The combination of all 90 multi-modal features achieved an accuracy of 77.8%, which was superior to MRI (50.6%), florbetapir PET (63.7%), and FDG-PET (67.0%).

These weights suggest that combining structural (i.e., MRI) and functional information (i.e., FDG-PET, florbetapir PET) improves the discrimination of MCI/pMCI. Further, the unequal weights imply differential contributions when combining modalities. In addition, for combinations involving MRI, FDG-PET provides more benefit for accurate discrimination of MCI/pMCI than florbetapir PET. This may because at the region-level (i.e., explorations of different brain regions), FDG-PET may offer more information than florbetapir PET [40] ."}, {"section_title": "Sensitive biomarkers", "text": "To choose sensitive biomarkers for the discrimination of MCI from pMCI, multi-modal (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) and single-modality (MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET) analyses were performed using a different number of the ranked features (from 1 to 90) from each modality. The multi-modal analysis achieved better accuracy in discriminating MCI from NC and predicting pMCI or sMCI regardless of the number of ranked features used. Moreover, Fig. 1a and 1b make clear that, for the prediction of MCI/pMCI, the multi-modal results were far superior to the single-modality results with MRI, but only slightly better than those with florbetapir PET and FDG-PET, which further indicates that functional abnormalities in the brain may provide more helpful information for the prediction of MCI/pMCI than structural changes. When combining the three modalities (MRI + FDG-PET + florbetapir PET) in discriminating MCI from NC, the weight parameters optimized by a grid search approach were set to 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3 for MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET, respectively. When discriminating pMCI and sMCI in, the parameters were 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6, respectively. This suggests that the three modalities contribute differently, depending on the specific prediction, and may provide complementary contributions to the discrimination/prediction. In short, the combination of multi-modal information boosts the performance of discriminating MCI/pMCI, which has been reported in previous studies [20, 24] . Using a random forest classifier to combine MRI, CSF, and FDG-PET biomarkers, Gray et al. [20] achieved an accuracy of 74.6% in discriminating MCI from NC, which was better performance than single-modality biomarkers (67.3% for MRI, 61.7% for CSF, and 53.5% for FDG-PET). In [24] , Zhang and colleagues used a multi-kernel support vector machine (mkSVM) to classify cases as MCI or NC. They found that combining MRI, CSF, and FDG-PET biomarkers achieved an accuracy of 76.4%, while the singlemodality biomarkers attained accuracies of 72.0% (MRI), 71.4% (CSF), and 71.6% (FDG-PET). All these studies showed the effectiveness of combining biomarkers from multiple modalities. Table 4 and Fig. 3 show that for the prediction of MCI and pMCI, a small set of sensitive biomarkers (the top 6% of ranked features) could achieve comparable or even better prediction performance than using all 90 features. Such a phenomenon may suggest that the complete set of brain regions (i.e., all 90 features) includes redundant information, and using all features may be not helpful and may interfere with the prediction process. Thus, selecting a small set of sensitive biomarkers may be necessary to make predictions more effective.\nAs shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2 , sensitive biomarkers were identified for predicting MCI and pMCI. The middle temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, and the posterior cingulum, precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET were shown to be biomarkers for MCI and pMCI, indicating that changes in these regions may occur primarily in the progressive stage but not in the early (or stable) stage of MCI, consistent with findings in previous studies [7, 17, [41] [42] [43] [44] . Additionally, several biomarkers facilitated discrimination of MCI from NC but not pMCI from sMCI, such as the hippocampus and amygdala for MRI, the angular and paracentral lobule for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, posterior cingulum gyrus, and parahippocampal region for florbetapir PET. This indicates that these changes may occur during the progressive as well as the stable stage of MCI. Furthermore, several other biomarkers may be helpful for the recognition of pMCI, including the cuneus for MRI, the superior parietal and middle temporal lobes for FDG-PET, and the amygdala, putamen, superior frontal region, and thalamus for florbetapir PET. Many of these biomarkers have been indicated as significant in MCI patients in previous studies [10, 17, 43, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , and combining these biomark-ers could achieve effective predictions for MCI and pMCI patients.\nDespite these encouraging results, this study has some limitations. First, only three imaging modalities were investigated. Studies have indicated that imaging data or information from other sources, such as CSF, are also effective biomarkers for MCI prediction. The current study was limited to MRI, FDG-PET, and florbetapir PET because not all participants had information from other modalities available. Second, the modality-specific biomarkers for MCI/pMCI obtained in this paper were only based on the significance of the p-value obtained from the two-sample t-tests; other feature selection methods should be considered in future work."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "For predicting MCI/pMCI converters, the current study identified several modality-specific sensitive biomarkers, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, middle temporal, and inferior temporal lobes for MRI, the posterior cingulum, precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen for florbetapir PET. Combining these modality-specific biomarkers achieved satisfactory prediction results for MCI/pMCI. Further, the results suggested that FDG-PET may contribute more to accurate prediction of MCI/pMCI than florbetapir PET in region-level analyses. These results offer new insights into our understanding of patients with MCI/pMCI and may be important for the accurate and timely diagnosis of MCI/pMCI; future studies could usefully explore further these findings."}]
