[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This paper investigates widening access to the Internet and other advances in information technology (IT) across institutions of higher education and how these technologies have impacted the publishing productivity of academic life scientists. It builds upon the work of others, including Cole & Zuckerman (1984), Zuckerman (1991), Long (2001), Hamermesh & Oster (2002), Xie & Shauman (2003), Butler, Butler & Rich (2008), Kim, Morse & Zingales (forthcoming), and Agrawal & Goldfarb (2008). What distinguishes this study from others is that it looks at the emergence of these technologies across a wide range of institutions and is the first to use multiple indicators of IT. An institution's -connectivity\u2016 is measured using two indicators. The first of these, the adoption of BITNET, captures a technology that was a major forerunner to the modern day Internet. 1 Introduced in 1981, BITNET was superceded by the modern day Internet by the mid-1990s. In order to facilitate communication on the Internet, institutions adopted domain names which they registered on the Domain Name System (DNS) beginning in 1985; these registration dates provide our second IT indicator of connectivity. In addition, we look at two indicators of the availability of research-related IT: institutional access to JSTOR and off-campus access to electronic institutional library resources. Three hypotheses are examined. The first, termed the IT-enhancing hypothesis, is that IT, by creating a virtual scholarly community and by providing easier access to data and the research of others, enhances the publishing productivity of scientists, 1 Although the IT revolution can be dated to the creation of ARPANET by the Department of Defense in 1969, restricted access to ARPANET led others to develop their own networks. (National Science Foundation 2009). While BITNET was not the only one among these, nor the first, it became a leader during this period as discussed in the text. regardless of their location. The second, termed the -sectoral hypothesis\u2016 is that the IT revolution improves the career opportunities of faculty at secondary (lower-tiered) institutions relative to faculty at primary (higher-tiered) institutions. We argue that this differential effect is due to the fewer in-house colleagues and resources that individuals working in the secondary sector had prior to the introduction of IT. The third hypothesis, termed the -opportunity-enhancing effect,\u2016 is that women benefit more than men from opportunities made available through the revolution in information technologies. The hypothesis is based on the fact that family issues typically constrain the mobility of women more than the mobility of men. 2 To quote Fountain (2000, p. 47), -the capacity of information technologies to enable more flexible, family-friendly work arrangements may assist women to combine work and family in ways that offer new possibilities for professional career \u2026.\u2016 We note that the narrowing in the publishing gap between men and women observed by Xie & Shuman (2003), among others, is consistent with the second and third hypotheses. To wit, women, who are disproportionately represented at second tier institutions, have likely benefited from both the -sectoral effect\u2016 and the -opportunityenhancing effect.\u2016 To explore the impact of the IT revolution on publishing productivity, we append institutional-level data collected on IT indicators to individual-level data on full-time faculty in the life sciences at four-year colleges, medical schools and research institutions. The individual-level data come from the 1983, 1995, 2001, and 2003 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). 3 We focus on the life sciences because it is a large discipline and has the largest proportion of women in all of the natural sciences. Further, considerable interest surrounds career paths in the life sciences (National Research Council 1998, National Research Council 2005, and Teitelbaum 2008. Productivity is measured as the count of published articles. Each institution is assigned to a tier based on the quality of the institution's program in the life sciences."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "A burgeoning literature is shedding light on the role of information technologies in academia. It is no longer a matter of -location, location, location.\u2016 Instead, the longheld advantage of holding a position at a top academic institution is diminishing. Evidence comes from the work of Agrawal & Goldfarb (2008), who find that mediumranked research universities, but not the top research universities, benefited the most from the adoption of BITNET 4 during the 1980s in terms of increased publications in the field of electrical engineering. Another manifestation of the transformation in academia is the increase in the number of co-authored papers by individuals at different institutions (and in different countries), as well as in the number of co-authors per paper. For the top 110 universities in the United States, for example, Adams et al. (2005) report that the average number of authors per paper in the sciences grew by 53.4 %, rising from 2.77 to 4.24, over the period 1981-1999. The authors also identify a growing mean distance between coauthors at these top institutions, from 77.7 miles in 1981 to 159.4 miles in 1999. Both patterns are consistent with benefits relating to the diffusion of IT. In related work, Hamermesh & Oster (2002) compare publishing activity in three economics journals over the period [1970][1971][1972][1973][1974][1975][1976][1977][1978][1979] with publishing activity in the same journals over the period 1992-1996. The authors find that almost 20% of authors of jointly-produced articles are located at distant locations in the later period compared with 5% in the earlier period. They attribute these differences to new technologies such as email that lowered communication costs between the two time periods. Kim et al. (forthcoming) examine co-authorship patterns over the period  in the fields of economics and finance. Like other authors, they identify an increase in co-authorship overall, but especially at lesser-ranked institutions, consistent with a role for IT. Finally, Butler et al. (2008) examine collaboration across universities in the fields of economics and political science using publication data from three top journals in each field. In their paper, they measure the availability of IT based on a review of NBER papers published during the 1990s. They find that prior to January 1997, an e-mail address was never included in the address; since January 1999, almost all papers had an e-mail address. 5 Using this as an indicator of IT access, they find that IT increases collaboration and that the effect is stronger at lower-ranked universities. One further contribution of Butler et al. (2008) is that they explicitly examine gender differences in the effect of IT. Notably, however, they find no significant differences. Our research expands on these studies in several directions. For one, we examine the dissemination of technology across all four-year colleges, universities and research institutions, thereby using a much broader set of institutions than previous studies have used. Second, in contrast to earlier studies, we measure IT by the availability of multiple technologies instead of only one technology. Finally, and building upon the research conducted by Butler et al. (2008), we examine the impact of IT on gender differences in publishing in the present study of academic life scientists. 6 Our study is not without limitations. Given the design of the SDR, productivity is measured using publication counts, but the data do not provide information on coauthorship nor do they permit controlling for journal quality. Furthermore, the definition of a publication is not consistent over all survey years, nor is the number of years for which publication data are collected (two vs. five years). Nonetheless, this study provides an important step in examining the impact that the diffusion of information technology has had on publishing productivity in academia."}, {"section_title": "IT Data", "text": "The IT indicators examined here are drawn from four sources: 1) data on the adoption of BITNET; 2) data on the adoption of domain names (DNS); 3) data on the adoption of JSTOR; and 4) data on the availability of electronic library services. The first of these indicators reflect -connectivity;\u2016 the latter two reflect access to researchrelated IT. Data for these four indicators were collected for a set of 1,348 four-year colleges, universities and medical schools in the United States that had been in existence since 1980. 7 6 In preliminary work, we also studied the social sciences. 7 The universe of institutions was initially formed by a careful review of years of institutional data available in IPEDS. For further details see Levin et al. (2009). There were also a number of additional institutions in the SDR sample that were not in the IPEDS dataset because of how the institutional database was constructed. Data on the IT measures for these institutions were also collected so that they could be included in the subsequent individual-level analysis of publishing activity. The BITNET data capture the adoption of IT during the early years of our study (1980s). Conceptualized by the Vice Chancellor of University Systems at the City University of New York (CUNY), BITNET's first adopters were CUNY and Yale in May 1981 (BITNET history). Complete data for the period of BITNET adoptions, 1981BITNET adoptions, -1990 have been compiled from the Atlas of Cyberspaces. 8 In order to extend our analysis into later periods, we also include another indicator of IT access: namely, an institution's adoption of the domain name system (DNS) invented in 1984 (Griffiths, 2002). These data indicate when universities formally registered their domain names on the Internet (ALLWHOIS registry site, on-line). 9 The adoption of a domain name is an important measure of access since a domain name facilitates communications by substituting a simple name for the multi-digit IP address that was formerly needed. The first of the IT indicators that reflect electronic access to research materials is an institution's adoption of JSTOR. JSTOR provides a university with access to and usage of one or more collections of research articles (Schonfeld 2003). These data were provided to us through a research agreement with JSTOR and contain information on institutions participating in JSTOR from its inception in late 1996 through February 2007. 10 A second indicator of research-related access to IT is the availability of electronic library services. These data have been collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) since 1996 as part of its biennial surveys of academic libraries and indicate the ease of faculty access to IT-related services, not just the access of faculty at each institution to the Internet. For 1996, the survey asked, among other questions, about the availability of electronic access to library reference services from off campus. 11 Figures 1-7 depict the diffusion of IT across the set of 1,348 institutions for each of these four indicators, treating all institutions as a group as well as stratifying by In the case of BITNET, as shown in Figure 1, 31% of the 1,348 institutions studied had adopted the technology by October 1990, the last date for which complete data were collected. Figure 2 goes on to show that Research and Medical institutions were much more likely to be early adopters of BITNET and adopted it at a much faster rate than other institutions. Indeed, by October 1990, 81 % of Research and Medical institutions had adopted BITNET, compared to just 25 % of Masters-level and 13 % of Liberal Arts institutions. Further diffusion would likely have occurred if this technology had not become outdated. Figures 3 and 4 depict the diffusion pattern of domain names. This technology, first adopted by institutions in early 1985, was adopted by all institutions by June 2006. Research and Medical institutions were more likely to be early adopters and adopted at a much faster rate. Arts institutions initially adopted JSTOR at a faster rate than Masters-level institutions, a different pattern than seen for either BITNET or DNS. "}, {"section_title": "Individual-Level Analysis: SDR Data", "text": "We examine the impact of IT on the publishing rates of academic life scientists by matching their institutional affiliation to the IT indicators described above. Individuallevel data are drawn from the SDR surveys for 1983, 1995, 2001, and 2003. 12 The 1983 SDR, which counts publications for the period 1981-1982, provides information on publishing productivity before major changes in IT occurred. The 1995 SDR counts publications for the five previous years (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995) and thus provides information on publishing productivity for the period when BITNET was still in use and the Internet was in its formative stage. Indeed, the Web did not become available until 1993, and in the early years of the Internet the lack of good browsers made it difficult to conduct searches and e-mail was not yet in wide use. 13 Finally, data from the 2001 SDR (publication counts for 1995-2001) and 2003 SDR (publication counts for 1998-2003) provide information on publishing productivity during a period when access to the Internet by institutions of higher education was almost universal, as we have seen from Figures 3-7. In the later years, expansion of the Web was facilitated by the introduction of web browsers such as Mosaic (1993), Netscape (1994) and Internet Explorer (1995). The sample consists of full-time faculty in the life sciences holding doctorate degrees employed as assistant, associate, or full professors in four-year colleges and universities, and medical institutions. 14 These faculty members may be in one of a number of situations: they may hold a tenured or tenure-track position, may hold a nontenure track position, and/or may hold an appointment at an institution which does not have a tenure system. The sample excludes post docs as well as those indicating zero years at the present institution. Research and staff scientists who do not hold academic rank are also excluded. The 1983The , 1995, and 2003 SDR surveys includes information on the individual's year of Ph.D., marital status, race, citizenship, tenure status, and publication information. The surveys from 1995 on also include information on age, children, years at present job, and whether the individual changed employer between the survey date and two years prior. The data sets also include information about the individual's institution: whether it is public or private, whether or not it is a medical school and the institution's 1994 Carnegie code. The publication measure available in the SDR is the number of journal articles, the major method for disseminating scientific work in most fields. As indicated earlier, the specific publication information available differs by survey. The 1983 SDR has publication information for the period April 1981 -April 1983 (2 years). In this survey, respondents were asked to indicate -the number of publications you have authored or coauthored in the following categories during the past two years,\u2016 with -journal articles\u2016 being one of the categories that the respondent could check. Unfortunately, the question fails to restrict the answer to -refereed\u2016 publications. It is also vague as to whether the respondent is meant to include articles that have been accepted but are yet to be published. In contrast, in 1995 and later years, the survey question is worded more precisely: -Since\u2026 how many articles, (co)authored by you, have been accepted for publication in a refereed professional journal?\u2016 For 1995, the relevant publication period is from April 1990 -April 1995 (5 years); for 2001, the period is from April 1995-April 2001 (6 years); and for 2003, the period is from October 1998-October 2003 (5 years). In the analysis, we examine the number of publications that the scientist reported, adjusting for -exposure,\u2016 the period of time covered by the survey question (see discussion of Poisson estimation strategy to follow). We then relate the number of publications to the availability of IT immediately preceding the period of exposure. By way of example, if in 1995 an individual reported ten publications for a five year period, the individual's publication count is ten, the period of exposure is five and the IT variable takes on a value of 1 if the institution had access to IT in 1989 or earlier. The average annual publication flow is two. 15 In approximately nine percent of the cases, the scientist changed universities during the survey period. This complicates the analysis since we are interested in relating productivity to the IT regime available at the institution where the research was performed. To correct for this, we adjust publication counts, assuming a uniform distribution of output. We also adjust the measure of exposure to reflect time at the current institution. 16 The individual-level analysis includes controls for gender, citizenship, and race. Race is measured by a set of three dummy variables: underrepresented minorities, Asians, and whites, where whites are the omitted group. To account for differences in -career stage\u2016 17 and tenure status, individuals are classified into one of four groups: early-career stage is defined as on tenure track, but not yet tenured; mid-career is defined as tenured with less than 20 years experience at the current or past institutions; later-career is defined as tenured with 20 or more years of total experience. The fourth category (the omitted group in the regressions) includes those who are in non-tenure track positions or 15 An earlier version of this paper used the average annual publication flow as the dependent variable. 16 By way of example, if an individual worked at the current institution for three of the five years, the adjusted count is three-fifths of the total five-year count; the period of exposure is three. This adjustment method over attributes publication counts to the current institution if the current institution's research environment is weaker than the previous institution's; it under attributes publication counts, if the current institution is stronger. Sensitivity testing, discussed later, suggests that the results change little if movers are excluded from the sample. Our concerns are further reduced because the lag between paper submission and acceptance is approximately a year in the life sciences (Ellison, 2002a). at an institution without a tenure system. Family responsibilities are measured by an indicator variable where never-married takes on the value of 1; 0 otherwise. In the analyses conducted using the 1995, 2001, and 2003 SDR surveys, which also include information on the presence and age of children, a child indicator is also included that takes on the value of 1 if the individual has at least one child under age 6; 0 otherwise. Further, given evidence on the differential impact of children on women's and men's labor market outcomes (Xie & Shauman 2003), the child indicator is also interacted with gender. The models also control for whether the institution is private or public as well as the research tier of the institution. Specifically, we develop a four-tier system, ranking academic institutions according to the strength of their research environments in the life sciences. This classification system is more finely grained than the scheme used to differentiate with which the individual life scientist is associated, not the overall ranking of the university. Thus, we supplement the Carnegie categories with data from the National Research Council on the ratings of doctoral programs in various disciplines and use these to identify top research environments in the life sciences. We match the 1995SDR data with the 1993NRC rankings (National Research Council 1995 and the 1983 SDR with the 1982 NRC rankings (Jones, Lindzey & Coggeshall 1982). 18 We identify top medical schools, which were not ranked by the NRC in either report, by the amount of extramural research funding they received from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 19 The four tiers used in the individual-analysis are defined as follows: Tier 1: Doctoral-granting programs rated Distinguished or Strong by the NRC and/or medical schools that received substantial funding from NIH. Tier 2: Doctoral programs (rated Good, Adequate, Marginal and Not sufficient for graduate education by the NRC) and other research-oriented institutions. In terms of the Carnegie classification, this tier includes the code of 11, 12, 13, 14 (Research I and II, Doctoral I and II), Medical Schools (52) not already included in Tier 1.  features of the data: the differing periods of -exposure\u2016 during which researchers produced their publications, the overdispersion of the count data, and the fact that, in some cases, multiple individuals are located at the same institution. 21 First, to test whether IT (regardless of our indicator measure) -enhances\u2016 research productivity, we examine the impact of IT on publishing productivity using data on life scientists located in all tiers as well as stratified by tier. To test the -sectoral hypothesis,\u2016 we make use of results from the productivity regressions stratified by tier. Specifically, we difference the coefficients on IT from the regressions estimated separately by tier to obtain an estimate of IT's differential impact. 22 Finally, to examine the -opportunity-enhancing\u2016 hypothesis as to whether IT enhances women's productivity relative to men's, we estimate regressions of research productivity, stratified by tier, which include a measure of IT and an interaction term between Female and IT. Models are estimated for each SDR survey year, rather than pooling data over survey years, for two reasons. First, different indicators of IT are relevant to different periods. Second, many factors affecting productivity have changed over time, including 21 See discussions in Cameron & Trivedi (2008, pp. 560-561) and Wooldridge (2002, pp. 645-656). Specifically, the estimated results presented here were performed using STATA. We employed a quasi-maximum likelihood approach which maximizes the Poisson MLE and uses robust standard errors clustered around institutions. We also invoked the offset option to capture differing periods of exposure for individual researchers. In earlier work, we estimated models of average annual publication flows (publication counts divided by exposure) using ordinary least squares. Notably, signs and statistical significance of the IT variables are quite similar in both specifications, though Poisson is the preferred method given the count nature of the data. 22 An equivalent method of obtaining this -differential\u2016 impact is to estimate a regression of research productivity over two tiers, where tier is interacted with each covariate including IT. In this latter specification, the coefficient on IT*Tier directly provides the -differential\u2016 effect. The method used here was chosen for expository purposes. supply side factors such as the proliferation of journals, and demand side factors such as tenure/promotion requirements regarding published research. Looking within year effectively controls for these period effects. 1983 and 1995 but thereafter remained fairly stable with the exception that the percent of individuals in non-tenure track positions grew from 14% to 18%, reflecting the recent trend toward more -non-regular faculty\u2016 appointments (Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "We focus our comparisons of publishing productivity on the top three tiers, excluding individuals working at primarily teaching institutions. 24 For each SDR survey year, around 37-39% of individuals are located in a Tier 1 institution, 40%-43% in a Tier 2 institution, and 16%-18% in a Tier 3 institution.   Tables 5-9 for purposes of brevity. 26 With the exception of Model 1 of Table 5, Tier 4 is excluded from the publishing productivity analysis due to small sample size. order before discussing the IT-specific results. First, and consistent with Tables 2 and 3,   in Model 2 of Table 5 publication rates are significantly lower in Tiers 2 and 3 relative to Tier 1, even after controlling for other factors, including IT availability. Counts are also lower for women. As shown in Models 1 and 2 of Table 5, the gender difference is statistically significant for all models and periods estimated. These models, estimated over all tiers, nonetheless mask notable differences regarding the impact of gender by tier. As Table 6 shows, for Tier 2, the gender difference in publishing is statistically significant for all models and periods estimated. For Tiers 1 and 3, gender is statistically significant only in the earlier years. Tables 5 and 6 provide estimates of the relationship between publishing productivity and period-specific measures of IT to test the -IT-enhancing\u2016 hypothesis, holding gender and other personal and institutional characteristics constant. Model 1 of Table 5 shows that, when tier is omitted, both types of IT, IT-connectivity (as reflected by BITNET and DNS) and research-related IT (as reflected by access to electronic library resources and JSTOR), generally have a statistically significant impact on publishing productivity, providing support for the IT-enhancing hypothesis. The coefficient on IT, however, likely overestimates IT's -pure\u2016 effect because the adoption of IT is related to other factors that contribute to research productivity that vary by tier. To capture these, we re-estimate the equation, controlling for tier, thereby identifying any effects of IT separate from tier. As Model 2 shows, once tier is included, IT is no longer statistically significant except in the case Electronic Library Access in 2003. These results, along with an examination of pairwise-correlations of IT and tier, suggest the presence of substantial multicollinearity. Thus, it is particularly instructive to look at the impact of IT on publishing productivity within tier, as shown in Table 6. The results in Table 6 provide some support for the -IT-enhancing\u2016 hypothesis. Within Tier 1, the adoption of domain names (DNS) has a statistically significant effect in the 2001 regression and Electronic Library Access has a significant effect in the 2003 model. 27 Within Tier 3, the availability of BITNET has a statistically significant impact in 1983 and Electronic Library Access has a statistically significant effect in 2003. These results suggest, albeit weakly, that both types of IT-IT connectivity and research-related IT-influence publishing productivity. Within Tier 2, a puzzling result is the negative, statistically significant coefficient on DNS for 2001 and 2003.  Table 6). Table 8 provides estimates and standard errors of the differential effects for two general indicators of connectivity not discussed heretofore: whether the institution ever adopted BITNET and whether the institution was an early adopter of DNS. 28 Taken together, these findings provide some support for the sectoral hypothesis.  Table 6 implies that the publication counts of individuals at institutions with DNS were 58 percent [(exp (.46)-1) *100] higher than for individuals without this type of IT, controlling for demographic factors. 28 The definition of early adoption builds on Rogers (2003) who classifies -innovators\u2016 as being in the first 2.5% of adopters and -early adopters\u2016 making up the next 13.5%. Here we classify any institution that fell into the first 16% as being an early adopter.  Table 8, we see that IT,as measured by whether the institution ever adopted BITNET, had the expected impact on the publishing productivity of individuals at Tier 3 relative to Tier 1 institutions, but only in 1995. Furthermore, early adoption of DNS significantly increased publishing productivity in 2003: the differential effect is positive and statistically significant for Tier 3 vs. Tier 1 and Tier 3 vs. Tier 2. Finally, Table 9 compares the difference in the publication rate of women vs. men with and without access to IT within tier, thereby testing the hypothesis regarding the -opportunity-enhancing\u2016 effect of IT. Across alternative specifications and SDR years, the findings provide no support for this hypothesis. And, quite puzzling, the interaction has a negative significant effect in the 2003 model estimated for Tier 3, where IT is indicated by the adoption of JSTOR. We also performed several sensitivity tests. For example, we restricted the analysis to those who were at an early career stage and thus most likely to have been exposed to new technologies in graduate school or during post-doctorate appointments. The results were weak, likely due to the small sample size. Another concern mentioned earlier is that some researchers may have recently changed institutions and so publications early in the count period may reflect work done at a prior institution with different IT access. We found, however, that the results were not that different when the analysis was limited to those who had not changed institutions in the previous two years. We also estimated models that classify BITNET and the INTERNET (as measured by the presence of a domain name) as similar -connectivity\u2016 technologies. In these models, estimated using data for 1995, IT is specified as 1 if the institution had access to either BITNET or DNS. Once again, we found the results to be substantially the same as those reported in Table 6. Finally, using data from the 1983 and 1995 SDR, we also analyzed the impact of IT on the average annual publication flow at the institutional level, within tier, using a difference-in-difference approach. 29 IT is found to have a positive and significant (10 percent level) impact on an institution's average research productivity for Tier 2, consistent with the -IT-enhancing hypothesis.\u2016 The relationship is not significantly different from zero at conventional levels in the Tier 1 equation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study breaks new ground by examining the diffusion of multiple innovations in information technology across institutions of higher education. Consistent with the literature on diffusion of technology in other realms, we find that the diffusion patterns observed reflect, for the most part, the standard S-curve. We also find substantial variation in the pattern of diffusion by tier. The four IT indicators that we have developed-two reflecting -connectivity\u2016 and two reflecting -research-related IT\u2016-were then used to investigate the determinants of publishing productivity of life scientists in the SDR. These results provide limited support in favor of the -IT-enhancing\u2016 and -sectoral\u2016 hypotheses. No evidence is found, however, that IT significantly affected the opportunities of women relative to men within tier (the -opportunity-enhancing\u2016 hypothesis). What can explain these findings? First, the SDR does not provide publication information for the period from the mid-to-late 1980s. This means that the SDR data fail to capture the period when the adoption of IT may have had its most noticeable effects. It is exactly for this period that Agrawal and Goldfarb (2008) found that BITNET had a significant effect on publication productivity. Somewhat related, it is also possible that the early sectoral advantage that IT technologies provided did not persist over time. Second, it may be that IT has its greatest effect on co-authorship patterns, not on individual productivity. Our data are simply not up to testing this hypothesis. 30 Third, it may simply be that during the period studied, IT was not as critical to success in the life sciences as it was in other fields. 31 A testable hypothesis for future work is that the availability of connectivity may have been less important in the life sciences than in other fields such as the social sciences. 32 In the life sciences, much of the work is done in the laboratory where physical proximity is crucial. In contrast, connectivity may provide a 30 In a separate paper (Ding, , Levin, Stephan and Winkler, in process), we are exploring many of these issues by appending our measures of IT -connectivity\u2016 to longitudinal data  on the research productivity of life scientists. Advantages of these data are that they pre-date the IT revolution and span the period of the 1980s when connectivity was evolving. 31 One would, however, expect IT to have become increasingly important in the biomedical sciences as large databases, such as GenBank and the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, have become available through web access. 32 As mentioned earlier, due to the lack of publications data for the critical latter part of the 1980s, SDR data would not be well-suited for this purpose. greater advantage in the social sciences such as economics, where researchers can more often meaningfully collaborate at a distance.     reports poission coefficients and robust standard errors clustered around institutions (in parentheses).

Models 1 and 2 include the following control variables: race, citizenship, marital status, presence of small children (except for 1983 SDR), individual's career stage, and indicator of private (vs. public) institution (see Appendix A for precise specification). These models also adjust for exposure (time at current institution). Model 1 is estimated using individuals in all tiers.
