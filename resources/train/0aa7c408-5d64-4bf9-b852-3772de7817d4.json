[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Although cerebral amyloid deposition may precede cognitive impairment by decades, the relationship between amyloid deposition and longitudinal change in neuronal function has not, to our knowledge, been studied. The aim of this article was to determine whether individuals without dementia with high and low amyloid burden show different patterns of longitudinal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes in the years preceding measurement of amyloid deposition. Methods: Twenty-eight participants without dementia (mean age 6 SD, 82.5 6 4.8 y; 6 mildly impaired) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging underwent yearly restingstate 15 O-H 2 O PET scans for up to 8 y. 11 C-PIB images of amyloid deposition were acquired on average 10.8 6 0.8 y after the first CBF scan. 11 C-PIB distribution volume ratios of regions of interest were estimated by fitting a reference-tissue model to the measured time-activity curves. On the basis of mean cortical distribution volume ratios, participants were divided into groups with high or low 11 C-PIB retention. Differences in longitudinal rCBF changes between high-and low-11 C-PIB groups were investigated by voxelbased analysis. Results: Longitudinal rCBF changes differed significantly between high-(n 5 10) and low-(n 5 18) 11 C-PIB groups (P # 0.001). Greater longitudinal decreases in rCBF in the high-11 C-PIB group than in the low-11 C-PIB group were seen in right anterior to middle cingulate, right supramarginal gyrus, left thalamus, and midbrain bilaterally. Greater increases in rCBF over time in the high-11 C-PIB group were found in left medial and inferior frontal gyri, right precuneus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left postcentral gyrus. Conclusion: In this group of older adults without dementia, those with high 11 C-PIB show greater longitudinal declines in rCBF in certain areas, representing regions with greater decrements in neuronal function. Greater longitudinal increases in rCBF are also observed in those with higher amyloid load and may represent an attempt to preserve neuronal function in these regions."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The development of in vivo amyloid imaging agents provides the opportunity to investigate prospective changes in amyloid deposition as a potential early marker of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1) . Imaging studies have shown increased amyloid deposition in patients with AD and in some individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition thought to represent a transition between normal aging and AD (2) . Studies of individuals without dementia focus on the ability of 11 C-PIB and other amyloid imaging agents to differentiate between individuals who will and who will not progress to AD (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) . One challenge in the use of amyloid imaging in early identification of individuals at risk for cognitive impairment and AD is that as many as 10%-30% of individuals who are clinically healthy on cognitive testing show amyloid deposition in imaging (3) and postmortem studies (7, 8) .\nEvaluation of neuronal activity, using 15 O-H 2 O, in conjunction with imaging of amyloid deposition, might help clarify the significance of amyloid deposition in older adults without dementia. In view of the suggestion by Buckner et al. (9) that default brain activity in young adulthood may affect amyloid deposition later in life, in this study we evaluated changes in resting-state regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) that occur during the decade before measurement of amyloid deposition in older individuals without dementia. Such examination is important not only for improved understanding of the longitudinal pathophysiologic relationship between rCBF and amyloid deposition but also because of potential clinical implications, as joint analysis of rCBF and 11 C-PIB data may provide more diagnostic information than a single method alone.\nAs b-amyloid is associated with decreased resting rCBF in animal models (10) , we hypothesized that individuals with higher amyloid deposition detected by 11 C-PIB would exhibit different patterns of longitudinal rCBF change than those individuals with lower amyloid deposition. We predicted that the longitudinal changes in rCBF in subjects with high 11 C-PIB retention would involve regions that show decreases in rCBF in individuals without dementia who eventually progress to AD. These regions would include the anterior and posterior cingulate, insula, middle and superior frontal, and superior temporal regions as well as the caudate nucleus and thalamus (11) . In addition, we expected that at least some of the areas of change in longitudinal rCBF would spatially overlap regions of known high 11 C-PIB retention, as vessel narrowing and subsequent hypoperfusion related to amyloid angiopathy may occur in some regions of 11 C-PIB retention (12) ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "Data from 28 participants without dementia (6 with a score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] (13) Scale) from the neuroimaging substudy (14) of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who underwent both CBF and 11 C-PIB scans were included in the study. On the basis of the degree of amyloid deposition as determined by the mean cortical distribution volume ratios (DVRs) described later, participants were divided into groups with high 11 C-PIB retention and low 11 C-PIB retention.

High-and low-11 C-PIBretention groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, race, and education ( \u00bdTable 1 Table 1 ). All participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation in conjunction with each neuroimaging visit. The CDR Scale, typically informant-based, was administered in conjunction with the 11 C-PIB imaging study and was previously administered in conjunction with rCBF studies when participants scored 3 or greater on the Blessed-Information-Memory-Concentration (15) test.

Compared with the low-11 C-PIB-retention group, the high-11 C-PIB group showed a nonsignificant trend for lower scores on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). In addition, mean CDR scores were higher in the high- 11 C-PIBretention group (Table 1) than those in the low-11 C-PIB group.

In the years preceding measurement of amyloid deposition, both greater increases and greater decreases over time are observed in specific brain regions when individuals without dementia with high cortical 11 C-PIB retention are compared with individuals with low 11 C-PIB retention. The spatial distribution of rCBF changes in the high- 11 C-PIB group occurs primarily in areas with known amyloid deposition; however, not all areas that have been documented previously to have high 11 C-PIB retention show longitudinal rCBF changes. Differences in longitudinal rCBF change between the high-and low-11 C-PIB-retention groups are seen in some structures that have altered rCBF in individuals with MCI who progress to AD (11, 21) . Unlike these cross-sectional imaging studies, the high- 11 C-PIB-retention group in our study is composed of a mix of healthy elderly and individuals with a CDR of 0.5, of whom only 1 has a consensus diagnosis of MCI. These differences in sample characteristics may account for differences between our findings and those of studies of individuals with MCI who progress to AD.\nGreater declines in rCBF over time in the high-than in the low-11 C-PIB-retention group were found in the anterior cingulate gyrus extending to the right middle cingulate gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, the thalamus, and the midbrain. Decreased rCBF has been previously reported jnm051946-pm n 8/10/08\nin the anterior cingulate gyrus on SPECT of individuals who converted to AD (22) , and deficits in executive function, in which the anterior cingulate has been reported to play a role, are among those exhibited early in the course of AD (23) . In addition to the greater longitudinal decrease in the anterior cingulate for the high- 11 C-PIB-retention group, we also observed greater decreases over time for the high- 11 C-PIB group in the supramarginal gyrus and thalamus. CBF decreases in the supramarginal gyrus have been observed previously in cross-sectional studies comparing individuals with AD with controls (24, 25) and in longitudinal follow-up of individuals with AD (25) . SPECT studies have also shown early involvement of the thalamus in AD (22) . We also found greater longitudinal declines in midbrain rCBF in the high- 11 C-PIB group, indicating greater decreases in neural activity in this region. We did not observe significant group differences in longitudinal rCBF changes for the posterior cingulate gyrus, an area showing early decreases in rCBF (22, 25) and glucose metabolism (26) as well as increased amyloid deposition (27, 28) in individuals diagnosed with MCI and AD. Greater decreases in longitudinal rCBF in those with high amyloid deposition may represent the inability to further offset neuronal insult or neuronal death, a process that is also associated with decreased 18 F-FDG activity in areas with high 11 C-PIB deposition (1, 28, 29) . In addition to focal decreases in neural activity, several other mechanisms either alone or in combination may explain decreases in CBF. These include compromise of the lumina of small vessels due to amyloid deposition itself or vasoconstrictive properties of endothelin-1, a molecule formed during interaction of Ab with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (30) ; decreased synaptic integration (31) ; decreased choline acetyltransferase activity as an individual progresses toward AD (32) ; degeneration of indirect projections from the basal forebrain to cerebral microcirculation (33) ; and cell death due to amyloid toxicity (34) .\nWe also found some regions that showed greater longitudinal increases in rCBF in those with higher amyloid load, compared with those with low amyloid load. These regions included inferior and medial frontal, postcentral, and inferior parietal lobule regions and the precuneus. All these regions with greater longitudinal rCBF increases also showed greater amyloid deposition in the high- 11 C-PIBretention group in a voxel-based analysis. In one 11 C-PIB PET study of individuals without dementia, the precuneus was reported to be the first region showing significant amyloid deposition (3) . In addition to precuneus and posterior cingulate, the frontal regions have also shown pronounced 11 C-PIB retention in prior studies (1, (4) (5) (6) 27, 28) . Notably, these neocortical regions also demonstrate early amyloid deposition in pathologic studies (7, 8) .\nAlthough decline in neuronal function has been extensively documented, especially once an individual has been diagnosed with AD, accumulating evidence indicates potential increases in regional brain activity in the very early stages of cognitive impairment. Relative increases in rCBF FIGURE 1. Scatterplot of association between age and mean cortical DVR. With 2-group K-mean cluster analysis, 2 clusters of individuals were identified: one with higher 11 C-PIB retention and another with lower 11 C-PIB retention, as determined by mean cortical DVR. have been found in frontal regions in individuals who later progress to dementia, compared with controls and individuals with MCI who remain stable (21) . Functional MRI studies of individuals with MCI also indicate initial increases in neuronal function early in the disease process (35) . Moreover, neuropathologic studies of cognitively intact individuals whose postmortem findings are consistent with AD show hypertrophy of neuronal nuclei, nucleoli, and cell bodies in several brain regions, as compared with controls (36) . These changes, which may be a marker of the resistance of the brain to the effects of amyloid deposition, would likely be associated with increased rCBF in view of increased metabolic demands. Although the concurrent relationship between rCBF and amyloid deposition has not yet, to our knowledge, been reported, our findings of greater longitudinal increase in rCBF in some brain regions of individuals with increased amyloid load is consistent with these other observations of increased neuronal activity in individuals with no or early MCI.\nAlthough the specific mechanisms related to these longitudinal changes in rCBF remain unclear, either amyloid deposition itself or one of the pathophysiologic processes associated with amyloid deposition may play a role in the observed changes. One possible explanation for the pattern of greater longitudinal increases and decreases in rCBF in association with amyloid deposition may be that greater decreases in rCBF across time represent a response to neuronal insult that subsequently leads to neuronal death, whereas greater longitudinal increases in rCBF represent an attempt to preserve neuronal function despite an increase in amyloid load. These increases in rCBF, possibly representing neuronal plasticity changes, may play a role in the maintenance of cognitive function until such processes are overcome by increasing pathophysiology. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that the pattern of longitudinal rCBF changes in those with high 11 C-PIB retention differs from those with low 11 C-PIB retention. In this group of older adults without dementia, those with high 11 C-PIB deposition show a decline in rCBF over the previous years, probably reflecting decrements in neuronal function. However, in the same group, there is also a greater increase in rCBF over time seen in other areas, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms aimed at preserving brain function are invoked in the setting of amyloid deposition. The spatial distribution of these changes corresponds to regions typically showing high amyloid deposition; however, not all areas of known amyloid deposition show changes in rCBF. Concurrent evaluation of longitudinal changes in rCBF and amyloid deposition with changes in cognitive status will be required to investigate in detail the interplay between CBF and amyloid deposition and their possible clinical implications. Further development, refinement, and application of different physiologic and molecular probes, in concert with longitudinal and perhaps more focused and refined clinical observations, will bring us closer to understanding the pathophysiology of MCI and AD and may aid in determining which individuals at risk for AD are most likely to progress to disease."}]
