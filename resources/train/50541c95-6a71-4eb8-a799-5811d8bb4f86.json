[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Diatoms are unicellular algae with an absolute requirement for silicic acid to form their frustules. They constitute a major component of phytoplankton communities, being responsible for ~40% of all marine carbon fixation (Nelson et al., 1995). Diatoms are the main contributors to the silica-rich deposits in deep-sea sediments and are thought to influence the present and past global climate via their influence on the biological pump of CO 2 from the atmosphere into the ocean interior (Nelson et al., 1995;Sarmiento et al., 1998;Matsumoto et al., 2002). The composition of phytoplankton communities and abundance of diatoms within them are related to specific ecological parameters of the water masses where they live (e.g., temperature, sea-ice cover and nutrient availability), and hence in the case of diatoms, their frustules can be used as biotic proxies for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoceanographic reconstructions. In order to evaluate the role of diatoms in the biological pump and the cycling of silicon, it is essential to thoroughly understand their ecology and the processes that the living biocoenoses undergo from their initial production in the euphotic zone to their eventual preservation in the ocean sediments (e.g. Varela et al., 2004;Grigorov et al., 2014). This knowledge is also required to validate paleorecontructions based on the diatom sedimentary record (e.g. Leventer et al., 1993;Taylor and Sjunneskog, 2002; Armand and Leventer, 2010). The Southern Ocean is regarded as having one of the highest diatom biomasses of the global ocean. Despite its high-nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regime, massive diatom blooms occur every year during spring and summer associated with specific areas, such as oceanographic fronts (e.g. Honjo et al., 2000;Moore and Abbott, 2002), coastal areas of Antarctica (e.g. Wefer et al., 1988, Bathmann et al., 1991Arrigo et al., 1999) and the retreating sea ice edge (e.g. Smith and Nelson, 1986;Sullivan et al., 1988). As a result of this relatively high diatom productivity (Pondaven et al., 2000), large amounts of biogenic silica accumulate in the Southern Ocean sediments, mainly south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), where about 30% of the global opal marine accumulation occurs (Tr\u00e9guer and De la Rocha, 2013). Moored sediment traps are one of the few available tools for monitoring particle fluxes in the open ocean over extended periods of time. They provide a means to determine the magnitude and timing of phytoplankton blooms, document species succession and estimate the remineralization of labile components throughout the water column. The use of sediment traps has contributed significantly to our understanding of diatom ecology in the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctic systems (e.g. Leventer and Dunbar, 1987;Fischer et al., 1988;Leventer and Dunbar, 1996;Abelmann and Gersonde, 1991;Ishikawa et al., 2001;Suzuki et al., 2001;Pilskaln et al., 2004;Ichinomiya et al., 2008;Romero and Armand, 2010). However, these studies are scattered in space and time, and large regions of the Southern Ocean, including the Australian Sector, remain undocumented. During the Australian multidisciplinary ACE CRC SAZ Project (Trull et al., 2001a), the main hydrological zones of the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean were instrumented with sediment trap mooring lines. The central goal of this experiment was to determine the origin, composition and fate of particulate matter transported to the ocean interior. This research yielded important results, including the demonstration that particulate organic carbon (POC) export in the Southern Ocean is similar to the global ocean median (Bray et al., 2000;Trull et al., 2001b). Here, as part of the ACE CRC SAZ project, we report on the biogenic particle fluxes registered by two sediment traps deployed in the southern Antarctic Zone (60\u00b0 44.43\u00b4S; 139\u00b0E 53.97\u00b4S) over a year (November 2001to September 2002 in order to 1document the magnitude, composition and seasonal distribution patterns of the settling particle fluxes, with particular focus on diatoms and their specific composition; and (2) assess the effects of dissolution and physical processes in the water column on the diatom assemblage composition by comparing the assemblages registered by the 2000 and 3700 m sediment traps. An improved understanding of diatom ecology and changes that the diatom assemblages undergo during their sinking through the water column should lead to a better interpretation of proxy records in the Southern Ocean."}, {"section_title": "Oceanographic setting", "text": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) flows eastward around Antarctica driven by strong westerly winds connecting the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Several circumpolar jets or fronts divide the ACC into distinct zones ( Fig. 1a), each one characterized by specific hydrological and biochemical properties (Orsi et al., 1995). The fronts coincide with strong current cores of the ACC defined by contours of sea surface height (SSH). Each of these fronts consists of multiple branches or filaments, where their position varies rapidly over time (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2002and 2009a. From north to south, these fronts and zones are the Subtropical Front (STF), the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ), the Subantarctic Front (SAF), the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), the Polar Front (PF), the Antarctic Zone (AZ) and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF) (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a, b). The surface waters of the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean are nitrate and phosphate rich and their concentrations remain fairly uniform across the ACC (Bostock et al., 2013). In contrast, silicic acid (Si) content shows a marked south to north gradient. Highest Si concentrations are reached south of the Polar Front Zone (up to 70 \u03bcM), whereas the Subantarctic Zone waters exhibits low Si values (1 to 5 \u03bcM) (Coale et al., 2004;Bostock et al., 2013). Despite the relatively high macronutrient concentrations, Southern Ocean surface waters are often characterized by relatively low phytoplankton biomass. Light limitation related to deep mixing (Sakshaug and Holm-Hansen, 1984) and extremely low concentrations of trace metals such as iron (De Baar et al., 1995;Johnson et al., 1997;Fitzwater et al., 2000;Martin et al., 1990;Boyd et al., 2000) seem to be the main causes for this \"high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll\" (HNLC) regime. Sea ice seasonality off East Antarctica is considered linked to patterns of oceanic currents, which in turn are related to sea floor topography (Massom et al., 2013). Seasonal sea-ice advance occurs from early autumn through early spring followed by retreat from late spring through summer (Comiso et al., 1984;Kimura and Wakatsuchi, 2011;Massom et al., 2013). Our study site, station 61 S (60\u00b0 44.43\u00b4S; 139\u00b0E 53.97\u00b4S), is located within the southern Antarctic Zone (AZ-S; Parslow et al., 2001), between the southern branch of the PF (59\u00b0S) and the southern front of the SAACF (Rintoul and Bullister, 1999;Rintoul and Sokolov, 2001). The mooring site is within the same region where the first open-ocean iron enrichment experiment in the Southern Ocean (Southern Ocean Iron Release Experiment -SOIREE) was conducted (Boyd et al., 2000) and can be considered representative of the region between the PF and the SACCF (between 54\u00b0S and 62\u00b0S) (Trull et al., 2001c). Despite surface waters rich in macronutrients (i.e. silicate, phosphate and nitrate), the algal biomass accumulation is considered low (<0.5 \u03bcg/L) (Parslow et al., 2001;Popp et al., 1999;Trull et al., 2001c). Copepods, mainly large calanoid copepodites, dominate the zooplankton community at the study site. Grazing pressure is considered low (<1% of the phytoplankton standing stock removed per day) and is thought not to greatly influence the development of the annual bloom (Zeldis, 2001). Very low iron concentrations (0.1-0.2 nM; Sohrin et al., 2000;Boyd et al., 2000) appear to be responsible for the low primary production. The study area is far from the influence of coastal waters and just north of the maximum winter sea-ice extent (Fig. 1b;Massom et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field experiment", "text": "Site 61 S was instrumented with a mooring line equipped with three McLane Parflux time series sediment traps (Honjo and Doherty, 1988) placed at 1000, 2000 and 3700 m depth in a water column of 4393m (Fig. 1c). Each trap was paired with an Aanderaa current meter and temperature sensor. The trap sampling cups were filled with a buffered solution of sodium tetraborate (1 g L -1 ), sodium chloride (5 g L -1 ), strontium chloride (0.22 g L -1 ), and mercury chloride (3 g L -1 ). Cup rotation intervals were synchronized between traps and were established based on anticipated mass fluxes. The shortest sampling intervals were 8 days and correspond with the austral summer and autumn, whereas the longest interval was 55 days corresponding with austral winter (Table 1). No samples were recovered from the shallowest trap owing to equipment malfunction. The two deeper traps completed their collection sequence as programmed without any instrumental failures providing a continuous time-series for 317 days (November 30, 2001to September 29, 2002 divided into 21 collecting intervals. Owing to the low particle fluxes registered at the onset and end of the experiment insufficient material remained for diatom analysis of cup 1 of the 2000 m trap and cups 1, 2, 19, 20 and 21 of the 3700 m trap (Table 1). After recovery, sediment trap cups were removed, capped on board and stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark until they were processed. The original samples were sieved through a 1mm nylon mesh in order to remove the largest swimmers, and only the fraction <1 mm was analyzed. Then, they were split into 10 equal fractions using a McLane WSD-10 wet-sample divider. One complete split was used for microplankton analysis. A detailed description of the geochemical analytical procedures is given by Trull et al. (2001b) and Bray et al. (2000). Component fluxes are reported for individual cups along with average values over the collection or deployment period for each component (Table 1). As the collection period was shorter than a calendar year, annual mean estimates were determined and are presented in Table   1. These annual estimates take into account the fact that the unobserved days occurred in winter when fluxes were low, and were obtained by using the flux for the last winter cup (#21 in 2002) to represent mean daily fluxes during the unobserved period. In order to investigate the correlation between time series, a correlation matrix was calculated (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Siliceous microplankton sample preparation and analysis", "text": "Each diatom fraction sample was refilled with distilled water to 40 ml, from which 10 ml was subsampled and buffered with a solution of sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8) and kept refrigerated for future calcareous nannoplankton analysis. The remaining 30 ml was treated with hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate and concentrated hydrochloric acid in order to clean the sample of organic matter and calcareous components following the methodology of Romero et al. (1999Romero et al. ( , 2000. The resulting sediment slurry was stored in bottles filled with distilled water. Microscopic slides were prepared following the decantation method outlined by Flores and Sierro (1997). This method produces random settling of the diatoms for quantitative microscopic purposes. The dried cover-slip was permanently mounted onto a glass slide with Norland optical adhesive 61 mounting medium (Refractive index: 1.56). Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using a Olympus BH-2 compound light optical microscope at 1000x magnification with phase-contrast illumination. A minimum of 400 specimens were counted per sample. Each diatom valve was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Scanning Electron Microscope observations of selected samples were used to verify taxonomic identifications made with the LM. The recommendations of Schrader and Gersonde (1978) were used as a basis for the counting of diatom valves. We did not include the counts of the girdle bands of Dactyliosolen antarcticus in the determination of relative abundances. The microplankton counts were transformed into daily fluxes of specimens m -2 d -1 following the formula of Sancetta and Calvert (1988) and Romero et al. (2009) where \"F\" is the daily flux of specimens, \"N\" the number of specimens, \"A\" the total area of a Petri dish, \"a\" the analysed area, \"V\" the dilution volume, \"S\" the split of the cup, \"d\" the number of days of collection and \"T\" the aperture area of the sediment trap. The diatom species diversity was estimated applying Shannon's diversity index (H\u00b4) to the relative abundance data (H\u00b4= -\u2211 p i log 2 p i , where p = n1/N, n1 = number of specimens of one taxon and N the total number of specimens). Large values of H indicate greater diversity. The annualized diatom valve flux for the 2000 m sediment trap was estimated following the same procedure as for the component fluxes ( Table 1). The temporal overlap of diatom fluxes between 2000 m and the 3700 m traps occurred between December-May (172 days) (Table 1). This overlap was used to estimate the sinking velocities of diatom valves and to track the alteration of settling diatom assemblages between traps. The sinking settling velocities for the main diatom taxa were calculated from the time lag between associated peaks in both traps and the vertical distance between traps. We used a squared-chord distance as the metric for assessing the similarity between the diatom assemblages of both traps (Ortiz and Mix, 1997). Squared chord distance values can range between 0.0 and 2.0, with 0.0 indicating identical proportions of species within the assemblages being compared."}, {"section_title": "Satellite imagery, meteorological and oceanographic data", "text": "Weekly mean sea surface temperature (SST) data for the period 2001 to 2002 was extracted from the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis database (Reynolds et al., 2002). The monthly averages of the upper 300 m thermal structure for the 2001-2002 period (Fig. 2) were obtained for the sampling location from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 (Locarnini et al., 2010 Satellite-derived monthly chlorophyll-a concentration and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) estimates were obtained from NASA's Giovanni program (Acker and Leptoukh, 2007) (Fig. 2). The pigment concentration record was then used as a proxy for surface algal biomass accumulation. The overall chlorophyll-a levels were low (0.07-0.30 mg/m 3 ) and similar to previous observations in the study area (Trull et al., 2001c). The increase in the algal biomass commenced in September 2001 and reached its highest levels in November 2001, coinciding with a maximum in the insolation levels ( Fig. 2). Pigment concentration declined through summer and reached its lowest levels in autumn and winter (March to August 2002)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Bulk composition", "text": "Total fluxes of particulates at both traps were highly seasonal, with maxima registered during the austral summer (up to 1151 mg m -2 d -1 at 2000 m and 1157 mg m -2 d -1 at 3700 m) and almost negligible fluxes during winter (up to 42 mg m -2 d -1 at 2000 m and below detection limits at 3700 m) (Fig. 2). The fluxes of total particulates at 2000 and 3700 m depth showed similar seasonal variations and were closely correlated (R 2 = 0.82; Fig.  4). Particulate fluxes were slightly higher at 2000 m (261 \u00b1 mg m -2 d -1 = deployment average \u00b1 standard deviation) than at 3700 m (216 \u00b1 337 mg m -2 d -1 ). Biogenic silica (SiO ) was the dominant bulk component, regardless of the sampling period or depth (deployment average = 76% at 2000 and 78% at 3700 m). The highest relative contribution of opal was registered from the end of summer through early-autumn at both depths (  Table 2. Total mass flux showed a strong correlation with POC at both sediment traps (R 2 = 0.86 at 2000 m and R 2 = 0.87 at 3700 m). BSiO 2 fluxes were also highly correlated with POC at both depths (R 2 = 0.83), whereas CaCO 3 and POC fluxes exhibited the lowest values (R 2 = 0.24 at 2000 m and R 2 = 0.63 at 3700 m). The molar POC/PN ratios were relatively low (Table 1), and thus similar to surface Southern Ocean particles and phytoplankton (Copin-Montegut and Copin-Montegut, 1983)."}, {"section_title": "Composition of the biogenic opal fraction", "text": "The biogenic opal fraction was composed of diatoms, silicoflagellates, radiolarians and the dinoflagellate Actiniscus pentasterias. Diatoms were, numerically, the dominant siliceous plankton group registered by the traps with a mean flux between 67 x 10 6 and 76 x 10 6 valves m -2 day -1 at 2000 m (annualized mean and deployment average, respectively). Mean diatom flux at the 3700 m trap yielded higher values (deployment average = 132 x 10 6 valves m -2 day -1 ) due to the lower sampling duration (172 days) over the winter season (Table 1). Silicoflagellates and radiolarians were three and four orders of magnitude lower than diatoms (not shown), whereas only one specimen of A. pentaserias was indentified in the lower trap. At both depth levels, total diatom fluxes showed strong seasonal variations that closely followed total mass seasonality with Pearson correlation coefficients of r = 0.88 for 2000 m and r = 0.81 for 3700 m (Fig. 4). Diatom frustules from 61 taxa were identified over the entire experiment and are listed in Table 3 together with their relative contribution for the whole sampling period. The seasonal changes in the diatom flux and main species at mooring site 61\u00b0S are plotted in Figure 5. Diversity index values (H\u00b4) followed the same seasonal trend as total diatom flux at both depths, with highest values registered during austral summer and lowest during winter (Fig. 5). The squared-chord distance between the sediment trap diatom assemblages at 2000 and 3700 m was 0.003, indicating highly similar proportions of species within depths. The dominant species of the diatom assemblage was Fragilariopsis kerguelensis with a mean flux between 53 x 10 6 and 60 x 10 6 valves m -2 day -1 at 2000 m (annualized mean and deployment average, respectively). This species contribution ranged from 37% to 96% of the total assemblage at 2000 m (average relative contribution for the overlapping period between traps = 72%; Table 3) and from 31% to 82% at 3700 m (average relative contribution for the overlapping period between traps = 68%) ( Table   3). The diatom flux peaks at both depths can be attributed to an increased flux of F. kerguelensis, with exception to a peak in late January at 2000 m when Fragilariopsis pseudonana dominated the settling assemblage (39%). Secondary contributors to the diatom assemblage at 2000 and 3700 m were Thalassiosira lentiginosa (average relative contribution for the overlapping period between traps = 5% and 7%, respectively), Thalassiosira gracilis var. gracilis (6% and 7%), Fragilariopsis separanda (3% and 2%), Fragilariopsis pseudonana (4% and 1%), Fragilariopsis rhombica (2% and 2%), Fragilariopsis curta (1% and 1%) and Azpeitia tabularis (1% and 1%) ( Table 3 and Fig.   5). It is worth noting that some large and/or entangled frustules of some diatom taxa, such as Thalassiothrix (Hallegraeff, 1986), could have been be retained in the 1 mm screen mesh, and therefore, underrepresented in this study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures of some of the most relevant taxa are shown in Fig. 6."}, {"section_title": "Diatom settling velocities", "text": "The calculation of the sinking velocities of the main diatom taxa was only possible for the \"particle bloom\" period, i.e. from December to March, when distinct peaks were registered in both sediment traps ( "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Quality check of downward particle fluxes", "text": "The use of sediment traps has greatly enhanced our understanding of particle transfer in open ocean environments. However, laboratory and field experiments have shown that the measurement of downward particle fluxes can be subject to several hydrodynamic biases (e.g. Gardner, 1980;Baker et al., 1988, Yu et al., 2001. Therefore, an assessment of the trapping efficiency is needed prior to interpreting the results of any sediment trap experiment. Our mooring line at site 61\u00b0S was maintained taut by the distribution of floats along the line and at the mooring head. Measured mean current speeds at both trap levels were always lower than 10 cm s -1 that is, as a rule of thumb, considered the threshold at which trapping efficiency decreases significantly (e.g. Baker et al., 1988, Honjo et al., 1992, Yu et al., 2001, Heussner et al., 2006. On the basis of global comparisons, these conditions suggest that fluxes registered by the traps were unlikely to be significantly biased by under-or over-trapping (Honjo. 1996;Yu et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Variability of total mass flux and composition of particles", "text": "The seasonal variability of the vertical particle transfer at site 61\u00b0S appears principally controlled by seasonal changes in the euphotic zone productivity. A significant increase in chlorophyll-a concentration from October 2001, approximately two months before any significant warming or stratification occurs ( 2), and that maximum total particle and diatom fluxes were registered at the beginning of January 2002 (Figs 3 and 5), a time lag of about two months between peak production in the surface waters and onset of particle export in the study area can be assumed. This feature is in agreement with the observations of Buesseler et al. (2001) in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean who reported a similar delay in the delivery of the surface bloom to the ocean interior. Contrastingly, algal biomass reached its annual minimum during the austral winter (June-September) ( Fig. 2) and very low particle and diatom export fluxes were registered by the traps (Fig. 3 and 5). These low chlorophylla concentration and flux values appear to be driven by two factors: (i) insufficient sunlight as a result of the low solar angle and shortened day length that reduced the ability to increase biomass and (ii) intense vertical mixing that transported phytoplankton below their critical depth, i.e. depth at which the rate of photosynthesis equals the rate of respiration (Fig. 2). In terms of particle composition, silica-rich and carbonate-poor particulate fluxes registered by the traps mirrored the dominance of diatoms in the waters south of the Antarctic Zone, south of Tasmania. The composition of the settling material is consistent with that of the surface sediments in the region. Opal content in the surface sediments of the Southern Ocean increases from north to south, being the dominant component south of the APF. In contrast, CaCO 3 is dominant north of the SAF and decreases southward (Honjo et al., 2000). Total mass and POC fluxes provided the strongest correlation at both sediment traps (Table 2). As BSiO 2 dominated the mass fluxes throughout the sampling period, changes in the BSiO 2 flux directly affected POC fluxes, suggesting that diatom valve sedimentation plays an important role in controlling the organic carbon export to depth at the AZ site. On the other hand, the small CaCO 3 fluxes and lower correlation values with POC at both sediment traps suggest that CaCO 3 had a lesser influence on the POC export. However, as the carrying capacity of POC per CaCO 3 unit could not be quantified, the role of CaCO 3 in controlling the transfer of organic carbon to depth remains unknown."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal trend of diatom fluxes and species composition", "text": "The annual diatom fluxes registered by the 2000 m sediment trap (Table 1) fall within the range of those estimated by Fischer et al. (2002) in the AZ of the eastern Atlantic (20 x 10 6 valves m -2 d -1 ) and those reported by Grigorov et al. (2014) in the Ross Sea Gyre (93 x 10 6 valves m -2 day -1 ). The diatom fluxes recorded at site 61\u00b0S are therefore comparable in magnitude to previously reported diatom data sets of the AZ in the Southern Ocean. Although several factors, such as grazing, dissolution and lateral advection, can influence diatom flux (Boltovskoy et al. 1993), the similar seasonal patterns, with a two month offset between primary productivity and diatom flux variations (Figs. 2 and 5a) suggest that the primary signal of the phytoplankton bloom in the overlying water masses is registered by the traps. About two-thirds of the annual diatom export fluxes at each trap depth were registered during January and February (Fig. 5). A markedly seasonal pattern is characteristic of high latitude systems (e.g. Wefer et al., 1988;Dunbar et al., 1998;Honjo et al., 2000;Fischer et al., 2002;Pilskaln et al., 2004;Romero and Armand, 2010)  The seasonal diatom flux was mainly driven by changes in the flux of the large, heavilysilicified and bloom-forming F. kerguelensis, a prominent member of the diatom assemblages in the iron-limited Southern Ocean waters (Smetacek, 1999;Abelmann et al., 2006). Large abundances of F. kerguelensis in phytoplankton blooms have also been previously reported in our study area during the SOIREE experiment (Gall et al., 2001;Trull and Armand, 2001), in the AZ of the south-west Atlantic (Hart, 1934) and in the vicinity of open-ocean fronts in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors (Bathmann et al., 1997;Laubscher et al., 1993;Grigorov et al., 2014). The relative contribution of F. kerguelensis at both S traps (68-80%; Table 1) is consistent with its distribution in the Southern Ocean surface sediments where its maximum abundances (70-83%) are found between the Polar Front and the maximum summer sea-ice edge (Crosta et al., 2005). Fischer et al. 2002and Grigorov et al. (2014) reported lower relative abundance and fluxes of this species in sediment traps in the AZ of the Atlantic sector (29%; 6 x 10 6 valves m -2 d -1 ) and in the Ross Sea Gyre (22%; 20 x 10 6 valves m -2 d -1 ), respectively. However, these sites were under the influence of seasonal ice, where seaice affiliated taxa such as smaller Fragilariopsis species and Chacetoceros spp., are known to often dominate the diatom assemblages . At the onset of the summer particle \"bloom\", H\u00b4 rises significantly due to the burst of reproduction and sedimentation of most of the diatom taxa ( The AZ-S site is remote from the direct influence of sea-ice in summer (Massom et al., 2013; Fig. 1b), which makes the occurrence of the sea-ice affiliated diatoms Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis curta during January (Fig. 5b) puzzling. The distribution of F. cylindrus in the modern Southern Ocean is constrained to the north by the maximum summer sea ice edge (Semina, 2003;Esper et al. 2010), whereas F. cylindrus appears limited by the maximum extension of sea ice during winter Esper et al., 2010). Likely explanations for the presence of these species at site 61\u00b0S are either (i) the occurrence of an iceberg in the vicinity of our study area or (ii) the advection of a transient bloom produced in a region under the influence of sea ice. Rich sea-ice affiliated diatom communities have been found in association with free-drifting icebergs (e.g. Smith et al., 2011), however this explanation is unlikely since our site is remote from any known iceberg pathway (Gladstone et al., 2001). Taking into account a time lag of about two months between peak production and particle export, a healthy and neutrally buoyant bloom could cover a much larger distance than that estimated for a sinking particle (detailed in 4.5). Sea-ice coverage west of ~90\u00b0E can reach latitudes well above 61\u00b0S (Massom et al., 2013;Fig. 1b). We hypothesize that the pulses of F. curta and F. cylindrus could correspond to the sedimentation of a diatom bloom that was either advected from an area upstream the ACC under the influence of seasonal sea ice or transported northward by Antarctic Surface Water currents (AASW) produced by the seasonal retreat of the sea ice, south of our study. At the end of the diatom export maximum (i.e. February-March), Thalassiothrix antarctica contributed more significantly to the flux via increased abundances (Fig. 5b). This species is a large, slow-growing diatom distributed within discrete layers of the water column (Kemp et al., 2000). Such diatoms are considered k-strategists (Kemp and Villareal, 2013) and fall within Group 2 defined by Qu\u00e9guiner (2013). High abundances of Thalassiothrix antarctica have been reported within and south of the APF (Laubscher et al., 1995;Bracher et al., 1999) and associated to a subsurface chlorophyll maximum in the PFZ south of Tasmania (Kopczynska et al., 2001;Parslow et al., 2001;Gomi et al., 2010) and in Prydz Bay (Quilty et al., 1985). We suspect that Thalassiothrix antarctica develops in parallel to Group 1 diatoms, as a result of them inhabiting the pycnocline discontinuity, exploiting deep nutrients and undergoing low rates of primary productivity under low-light conditions (Kemp et al., 2000(Kemp et al., , 2006Qu\u00e9guiner, 2013). The abrupt drop of the photosynthetically active radiation levels to less than half their peak values from February to March (Fig. 2a) and/or the occurrence of a vertical mixing event may have produced both light and/or nutrient limitation leading to the rapid flocculation and sinking of T. antarctica during the summer-autumn transition. Post-March diatom export decreases significantly (Fig. 5a) due to the reduction to lowest levels of light and the concomitant intensification of mixing of the water column ( Fig. 2a,b). The \"post-bloom\" diatom assemblage is characterized by low diversity values (Fig. 5a) mainly due to the high relative abundance of F. kerguelensis (up to 96% in September). The remaining assemblage is subsequently composed of large and heavily silicified centrics such as Thalassiosira lentiginosa, Azpeitia tabularis and Thalassiosira oliveriana. These are typical open ocean diatoms (Crosta et al., 2005;Romero et al., 2005) with presumed lower nutrient requirements than the summer bloom-forming species."}, {"section_title": "Transfer to depth", "text": "Our results suggest that a fast and relatively undisturbed downward transport of particles occurred between 2000 and 3700 m ( Fig. 3 and 4). The similar BSi and POC content in both traps (Table 1) indicates that little silica dissolution and remineralization occurred between 2000 and 3700 m. Such a result is consistent with previous sediment trap studies that reported minimal alteration of the silica and organic carbon fluxes below the mesopelagic-bathypelagic boundary (~2000 m) (Takahashi, 1986;Honjo et al., 2009). However, the high Si/C at both depth levels also implies that organic matter is recycled faster than opal before reaching the traps, and this must occur at mesopelagic depths. We interpret this as the remineralization of the settling material by the microbial community and by the zooplankton that preferentially feed on organic matter (Honjo, 2009). High Si/C ratios are characteristic of the iron-limited systems of the Southern Ocean where large and highly silicified species (e.g. Fragilariopsis kerguelensis) dominate the diatom assemblages. In this regard, the average POC content (1.4%) of our samples at 2000 m is very low, and the average BSi/POC molar ratio for the entire collection period was less than 0.1 for both traps, in comparison to an average of ~1 for a compilation of deep Southern Ocean traps (Honjo et al., 2008) and a median of ~2 for a global compilation (Lampitt and Antia, 1998). This makes it clear that the trap samples have experienced very strong losses of organic carbon, consistent with previous studies suggesting that Southern Ocean waters south of the Polar Front can be described as low carbon export regimes (Lam and Bishop, 2007). The sinking velocities of the major diatom taxa during the \"particle bloom\" indicate rapid sedimentation of the diatom assemblages between the upper and lower traps (210 m d -1 ). These settling speeds are very similar to those estimated by Honjo et al. (2000) in the AZ of the Pacific Sector and are equal, or greater than, those observed in high productivity areas at lower latitudes (Honjo, 1996). In contrast, based on the time delay The pulse of Thalassiothrix antarctica in early March at both depths coincides with an upturn of the POC fluxes (Table 1). Thalassiothrix antarctica cells are about 60 times larger (in estimated biovolume) than F. kerguelensis (Cornet-Barthaux et al., 2007), and therefore, have the potential to contribute significantly to the annual organic carbon export even at background concentrations (Goldman 1993;Goldman and McGillicuddy, 2003;Qu\u00e9guiner et al., 2013). During winter, the lower sinking rates and high area/volume ratios of single diatom cells may facilitate the recycling of the valves and remineralization of organic matter in the upper water column. The enrichment of dissolution-resistant diatoms (e.g. Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, Thalassiosira oliveriana, Azpeitia tabularis) during the winter months observed in our traps could, therefore, be partially related to enhanced, selective dissolution of more lightly silicified species (e.g. Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Fragilariopsis pseudonana, Chaetoceros spp.). With regard to the comparison of the annual diatom assemblage between traps, their highly similar abundance proportions, as revealed by the low squared chord distance score, indicate that both traps registered diatom assemblages from the same source. Moreover, the latter results further support the idea that silica BSi dissolution below 2000 m is minimal at the AZ-S site."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The main objective of our study was to document the variability in the magnitude, timing and composition of particle and diatom export fluxes to the deep sea in the southern Antarctic Zone (AZ-S) within the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean. To examine this issue, we studied the year-round dynamics of particle flux from November 2001 through September 2002. The overall fluxes of biogenic particles to the mid-and deep water column in the AZ-S were markedly seasonal with peak fluxes occurring during the austral summer and very low export during winter. This seasonal pattern is mediated by algal productivity. Comparison of satellite and particle flux data suggests a delay of about two months between peak production and onset of particle export. The biogenic opal fraction largely dominates the export throughout the year, and is mainly delivered by diatoms. Carbonate and organic carbon are secondary components. Diatom seasonal fluxes followed the seasonality of the biogeochemical particle fluxes at both depths and their magnitude (67-76 x 6 valves m -2 day -1 ) is similar to previously published data recorded in the AZ of other sectors of the Southern Ocean. The diatom assemblages recovered at our mooring site are typical of the open ocean waters of the Antarctic Zone (Crosta et al., 2005) and their seasonal succession agrees well with the conceptual scheme proposed by Qu\u00e9guiner 2013       \u03bcm; h, i = \u03bcm; c, e, j = 5 \u03bcm; a, b, g, k, l = 10 \u03bcm.
