Rosen's static model is frequently used to assess the benefits of policies targeting public goods and externalities. The logic is simple. Homebuyers implicitly purchase the right to consume a bundle of local public goods when they buy a house. It follows that a hedonic price function for housing can be used to infer buyers' willingness to pay for polices that would alter the provision of public goods. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.\nOne of the main complications with using housing markets to infer the willingness to pay for public goods is that the market clearing process can present endogeneity problems for estimation. 1 As heterogeneous households sort themselves across an urban area they also vote on the provision of local public goods, they interact with their neighbors, and their collective actions may increase congestion and degrade the natural environment.\nThese mechanisms have the potential to confound reduced form estimators for the willingness to pay by inducing correlation between the public good of interest and latent attributes of households and neighborhoods. Goldstein and Pauly (1981) first called attention to this problem, labeling it \"Tiebout bias\" since it arises from the sorting mechanism in Tiebout's (1956) conceptual model of residential sorting and local public goods provision. Rubinfeld, Shapiro, and Roberts (1987) , Epple and Sieg (1999) , and Epple, Romer, and Sieg (2001) were among the first to develop strategies for estimating households' preferences for public goods in a way that accounted for Tiebout sorting. Subsequent studies addressed peer effects in addition to modeling sorting based on public goods (e.g. Calabrese et al. 2006 , Bayer and Timmins 2007 , Ferreyra 2007 , Walsh 2007 .\nA recent wave of empirical research has sought to estimate the willingness to pay for public goods without modeling sorting behavior by instead placing hedonic price functions within the econometric framework for program evaluation (Imbens and Wooldridge 2009 ).\nThis approach treats Tiebout bias as an omitted variable problem to be addressed using instruments, panel data, and regression discontinuity designs. The most common strategy is to use a plausibly exogenous source of temporal variation in the quality of a public good to identify how the quality change was capitalized into housing prices. These \"capitalization effects\" are then interpreted as welfare measures. 2 Researchers have relied on this logic in order to draw strong conclusions about important problems such as the value of a statistical life (Davis 2004) , the benefits of the Clean Air Act (Chay and Greenstone 2005) , and homeowners' willingness to pay to reduce their exposure to crime risk (Linden and Rockoff 2008, Pope 2008 ). More generally, over the past decade the hedonic program evaluation framework has become a leading approach to measuring the public's willingness to pay for public goods, with numerous applications published in the top general interest and field journals in economics (see Parmeter and Pope 2012 for a survey).\nWhile it is routinely asserted that \"capitalization effects\" measure the willingness to pay for public goods, the recent program evaluation studies have not provided any evidence to 2 Consistent with recent program evaluation studies, we use the word \"capitalization\" to describe how shocks to amenities at a point in space cause prices to change over time. This description differs from an earlier literature that used \"capitalization\" to describe the equilibrium spatial relationship between prices and amenities at a point in time (see Kanemoto 1988 for an example and references). We define capitalization formally in section 2. support this claim. That is, none of the studies that have interpreted capitalization effects as welfare measures have developed models of the capitalization process to support their interpretations. In order to understand capitalization effects, one would need to use Rosen's (1974) model to conduct an appropriate comparative static analysis of how changes in public goods affect housing market equilibria.\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the validity of interpreting capitalization effects as welfare measures when the price functions that clear a market for a differentiated good arise from the equilibrium sorting process described by Rosen. In the first half of the paper we extend Rosen's (1974) conceptual model to express the capitalization effect for a public good as a general function of structural parameters describing household preferences, production technology, and market institutions. We find that the capitalization effect does not have a specific welfare interpretation in this environment. When there is an exogenous shock to the spatial distribution of a public good, the gradient of the hedonic price function will generally adjust in order to clear the housing market. This adjustment drives a wedge between the average capitalization effect and the average household's willingness to pay.\nFor example, an improvement in the quality of public education will change the shadow price of access to public schools. The shadow price adjusts because the demand for school quality is downward sloping and/or because the composition of households in a given neighborhood changes. An improvement in school quality may also change what people are willing to pay for complementary housing attributes such as locations near public parks. The problem is that the capitalization effect conflates the public's willingness to pay for the improvement in school quality with changes in the shadow prices of school quality and other housing attributes. This type of conflating appears to be a general feature of the hedonic equilibrium model. It even occurs in simple specifications for consumer preferences such as the linear-quadratic-normal model considered by Epple (1987) and Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2004) .\nIn the second half of the paper we investigate the empirical implications of \"conflation bias\" in the willingness to pay for public goods. We develop and demonstrate a methodology for testing whether capitalization effects reveal welfare measures. Given a parametric specification for the hedonic price function, we derive sufficient conditions for interpreting the marginal capitalization effect experienced by a household as a measure of that household's marginal willingness to pay. Importantly, these conditions can be tested within the hedonic program evaluation framework. Our main test relies on having a research design for identifying the gradient of the equilibrium price function both before and after the shock to public goods that defines the capitalization effect.\nOur empirical demonstration of the methodology uses a boundary discontinuity design to estimate parents' valuation of public school quality before and after there were large changes in publicly reported measures of academic performance. This research design exploits a series of laws that create spatial discontinuities in the way that children are assigned to public schools. Children living in physically similar houses in the same neighborhood are sometimes assigned to different schools where students tend to score better or worse on standardized exams. These assignment laws underlie our strategy for estimating the shadow price of school-level academic performance. We estimate shadow prices in 10 housing markets: five metropolitan areas (Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Fairfax, and Portland) each observed at two points in time (2003 and 2007) that were chosen because they bracket substantial changes in the measures of test scores that were reported to parents and the general public. Prior studies such as Black (1999) and Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) have used the same research design to estimate the shadow price of public school test scores in a single metro area at a single point in time. Their results provide a baseline for comparison. Our study is the first to provide evidence on variation in the shadow price of public school test scores across time and space.\nWe find that the average shadow price of a 1% increase in test scores increased by 28% between 2003 and 2007. This average reflects considerable heterogeneity across markets.\nChanges in the shadow prices of test scores and other housing attributes are conflated with homebuyers' valuation of school quality, causing our estimates for capitalization effects to understate hedonic measures of the willingness to pay by as much as 75%.\nOverall, the evidence from our conceptual and empirical models suggests the bias in interpreting capitalization effects as measures of the willingness to pay for public goods is of first-order importance. Our work raises the bar for future research. In order to use capitalization effects to draw credible inferences about consumer welfare, the analyst must first demonstrate that the evolution of the price function supports their interpretation.\nThe next section provides context for our study and explains our research design.

We define public goods broadly to include any nonmarket goods and services conveyed to homeowners through their choice of a neighborhood. Examples include local public goods (such as school quality), urban and environmental services (such as crime rates and air quality), and variables describing the demographic composition of the community (such as race and educational attainment).\nVirtually all reduced-form studies in the literature pose a version of the following model, Greenstone and Gallagher 2008 , Baum-Snow and Marion 2009 , Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein 2010 . With the exception of Black (1999) , these studies exploit sources of temporal variation in g. This variation is used to estimate an econometric model specified in terms of fixed effects, first differences, or difference-in-differences. For example, suppose p, g, and h are observed again after the distribution of g has changed. h and \u03b5 may have changed as well. Differencing the data produces a panel model,\n, for example. Equation (2) describes how prices adjusted to the change in g, controlling for concomitant changes in h. This is the standard first differences model used in the literature. Some studies also use instruments for g \u2206 to address possible correlation between g \u2206 and \u03b5 \u2206 . Notice that the identified parameter, \u03c6 , is not necessarily the same as 1 \u03b8 in equation (1). We refer to \u03c6 as the \"capitalization effect\" because it describes how the change in g was capitalized into housing prices. Our interest lies in analyzing how this effect can be interpreted when (1) is the correct model."}, {"section_title": "The Welfare Interpretation of Capitalization Effects", "text": "The interpretation of \u03c6 begins with the interpretation of 1 \u03b8 . It is standard to translate 1 \u03b8 into a welfare measure by appealing to hedonic theory. First, the price function is assumed to be continuously differentiable. Differentiating with respect to g defines the marginal price function for g. The marginal price paid by the buyer of house j is defined by a ( ) j j g p\ntriplet. 3 Next, buyers and sellers are assumed to satisfy the smoothness conditions of Rosen's (1974) In contrast, Rosen (1974) does not interpret \u03c6 . He considers market equilibrium, not the adjustment process that would follow an exogenous change in product attributes. Studies that estimate capitalization effects have addressed this knowledge gap by assuming that the gradient of the price function is constant over the duration of the study period (i.e. Greenstone 2005) to list only a few. 5 In these studies, the gradient is assumed to be fixed for 10 to 20 years, spanning large changes in g, h, and potentially \u03b5 . 6\nGiven the importance of developing credible estimates of MWTP for public goods, it is surprising how little is known about the evolution of hedonic price functions. None of the studies invoking TCGA have tested it or provided evidence to validate it. Nor can we find any prior studies that explain what (if anything) must by assumed about preferences in order to guarantee that a hedonic gradient will be invariant to the types of changes in public goods, wealth, and information that occur over 10-20 year periods."}, {"section_title": "Related Evidence from Previous Studies", "text": "Three sets of studies have considered issues that relate to our research question. First, 5 For example, Chay and Greenstone (2005, p. 418) conclude that their analysis \"demonstrates that quasi-experimental approaches can be effective in estimating parameters derived from economic models (e.g. MWTP)\" and that welfare calculations based on their estimates for capitalization effects, \"suggest that the mid-1970s TSPs nonattainment designation provided a $45 billion aggregate gain to homeowners in nonattainment counties.\" 6 The length of the study period and the sizes of the changes in variable are dictated by the instruments needed to support the analyst's preferred identification strategy. theory papers by Lind (1973) and Starrett (1981) ask whether a policy that alters the distribution of a public good will produce changes in land values that reveal the social benefits of the policy. Their answer is 'no', not if heterogeneous households react to the policy by moving. Sieg et al. (2004) reach the same conclusion in a numerical simulation. One might expect their common finding-that price changes do not reveal welfare effects-to extend to our hedonic setting. However, this is an intuitive leap. The models developed by Lind, Starrett, and Sieg et al. relax some of the smoothness conditions that support equilibria with a one-to-one mapping between marginal prices and MWTP in Rosen's model.\nTherefore, their results do not have direct implications for the relationship between capitalization and MWTP in environments based on Rosen (1974) .\nSecond, Palmquist (1988 Palmquist ( , 1992 considers how hedonic price functions could be used to measure welfare effects for changes in environmental quality. His 1988 paper explains how Hicksian welfare measures could, in principle, be constructed from data on an individual's choices before and after a quality change, if such data were available and if it were possible to identify price functions before and after the change. In the special case where the change is \"localized\", Palmquist (1992) conjectures that it might be possible to construct welfare measures from the ex-ante price function. 7 Neither paper addresses the assumptions needed to support TCGA; nor do they consider whether it is possible to recover MWTP from data on price changes following a non-marginal change in quality.\nFinally, a few empirical studies have reported evidence of temporal instability in the pa-7 By \"localized\", Palmquist means that the quality change has no impact on the equilibrium price function. Subsequent to Palmquist's work, it has been recognized that localized changes can trigger tipping effects via Tiebout sorting that produce large changes in equilibria (Sethi and Somathathan 2004 , Card, Mas, and Rothstein 2008 , Banzhaf and Walsh 2013 . For example, Banzhaf and Walsh (2008) find that increasing emissions of toxic air pollutants alters neighborhood demographics by increasing emigration in general and increasing emigration of wealthier households in particular. rameters used to characterize gradients of housing price functions. For example, Brookshire et al. (1985) found that a shock to information about earthquake risk changed the implicit price of earthquake risk over a 6-year period, and Beron, Murdoch, and Thayer (2001) reported annual changes in the implicit price of visibility in Los Angeles between 1980 and 1995. However, the evidence from these studies looks dubious when viewed through the lens of the modern program evaluation literature. The problem is that their research designs do not use modern tools for addressing omitted variables."}, {"section_title": "Our Research Design", "text": "A direct way to test the hypothesis of a time-constant gradient is to identify singleperiod price functions before and after a change in the distribution of public goods. While there is no methodological panacea for overcoming omitted variable bias in cross-section data, Sandra Black's (1999) boundary discontinuity design is generally viewed as a credible strategy for mitigating the problem. For example, Greenstone and Gallagher (2008 p.997) include it among their short list of papers \"demonstrating that it is possible to identify research designs that mitigate the confounding that has historically undermined the credibility of conventional hedonic approaches to valuing nonmarket goods.\" 8 Black (1999) "}, {"section_title": "Hedonic Equilibria and the Capitalization of Market Shocks", "text": "This section reviews the primitives of Rosen's model in the context of a housing market, characterizes equilibrium, and defines restrictions on preferences and technology that guarantee the marginal price schedule will be unaffected by exogenous changes in nonmarket attributes of a private good."}, {"section_title": "Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium", "text": "Price-taking households are assumed to be free to choose a house with any combination of physical attributes (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft) in the neighborhood that provides their desired bundle of public goods.

To isolate the capitalization effect for house j, we condition on x and divide the change in P by the change in g,\nThis difference quotient provides a general expression for the parameter estimated in the hedonic program evaluation literature.\nBecause j \u03c6 depends on two (potentially different) price functions, it is not the measure of MWTP from Rosen (1974) . To convert j \u03c6 into MWTP, we must restrict preferences and technology to assure that the capitalization effect will equal the partial derivative of the pre-shock and/or post-shock price functions. Severity of the restriction depends on the size of the shock. If the change in the distribution of g is small, then we need only restrict 2 1 a a = and 2 1 b b = . Under this condition, the difference quotient in (9) approaches the partial derivative in (4a) as\napproaches zero for all j. 12 In the limit, pre-shock MWTP equals post-shock MWTP which equals the capitalization effect. This is intuitive.\nAn infinitesimal change in a single attribute will not alter the shape of the hedonic price function; equilibrium prices will simply increase by MWTP. This special case is consistent with Palmquist's (1992) characterization of localized externalities.\nHowever, as noted earlier, empirical studies typically analyze large shocks. In this case, three restrictions are jointly sufficient to establish a welfare interpretation for the capitalization effect. We state this formally as ASSUMPTION 1.\ni. ii.\niii.\nCondition (i) restricts preferences, income, and technology to be constant over the duration of the study. Condition (ii) implicitly restricts the shapes of supply and demand curves so that the marginal price of g does not depend on its level. Condition (iii) further restricts supply and demand such that changes in g do not affect the hedonic gradient. We discuss violations of each condition after proving the theorem. THEOREM 1. If assumption 1 holds for a shock to g, then the capitalization effect, \u03c6 , reveals the pre-shock MWTP, which equals the post-shock MWTP.\nProof. Consider any house, j, with characteristics x x j = for which j g changes from \n,\u03c9 x f = .\nIt follows from the Mean Value Theorem that\nThe second term measures pre-shock MWTP and the third term measures post-shock MWTP, as defined by the first-order conditions from Rosen (1974) . QED.\nAlternatively, if assumption 1 is violated, the Mean Value Theorem generally implies\nFor example, suppose conditions (ii) and (iii) hold, but the shock to ( ) \u03c9 \u03c9 = ). Condition (ii) restricts the curvature of its gradient. This restriction avoids problems that can occur if the gradient depends on g. To see this, notice that movement along a nonlinear price function will generally change marginal prices. If an increase from 1 j g to 2 j g corresponds to a change in its price, then the capitalization effect cannot simultaneously equal ex ante MWTP and ex post MWTP, since the two measures of MWTP differ. 13 The strength of condition (ii) is underscored by Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim's (2004) finding that the hedonic gradient is generically nonlinear in g. 13 Empirical capitalization studies typically assume\n. If the standard model were generalized to allow for heterogeneous local average capitalization effects, then condition (ii) could also be relaxed. For example, if equation (2) were to include polynomial functions of g \u2206 , then condition (ii) would adjust to match the highest order polynomial; e.g.\nin the case of a quadratic. We thank a referee for pointing this out.\nFinally, consider condition (iii). The only obvious restriction on market primitives that\nis that the demand for g is perfectly elastic. If the demand is downward sloping, then a positive shock to g will decrease individual MWTP (changing \u03c9 ).\nUtility should also be separable in g and x. Otherwise, a shock to the distribution of g could change the implicit prices of the elements of x. If g is the crime rate, for example, we must be willing to assume that changes in crime do not affect the willingness to pay for security systems, fences, or proximity to city parks. These restrictions on own and crossprice elasticities also apply to elements of x that are subject to exogenous shocks. A change in the relative price of any attribute violates 0 = \u2202 \u2202 g \u03c9 and can drive a wedge between MWTP and the capitalization effect for any other attribute.\nConditions (i)-(iii) are obviously strong restrictions. They seem unlikely to be satisfied in most applications. If they are violated, then the hedonic gradient may be unstable, producing a wedge between the identified capitalization effect and the policy-relevant measure of MWTP. 14 We illustrate this with a brief example using a version of Tinbergen's (1959) linear-quadratic-normal model."}, {"section_title": "Example: Linear-Quadratic-Normal Model", "text": "Suppose the housing stock is fixed, utility is quadratic, and preferences and housing characteristics are normally distributed.

The first term to the right of the equality in (14) is a parameter defining MWTP in the new equilibrium. 17 The second term is a \"price effect\" arising from a change in the implicit price of g. The third term is a \"substitution effect\" arising from changes in the implicit prices of other housing attributes that affect utility and, in some sense, serve as substitutes for g. The last term reflects the bias from correlation between changes in observed and unobserved variables. the market clearing mechanism that Rosen described, adjusting to clear the market following the change in ( ) g T and any concomitant changes in market primitives. Summing the price and substitution effects defines the conflation bias in interpreting a capitalization effect as a parameter of a hedonic price function. The direction of the bias is indeterminate.\nUsing IV \u03c6\u02c6 to predict MWTP at a house j may produce an estimate that falls outside the range of values for the true MWTP for the occupants of j in the pre-shock and post-shock equilibria. 18, 19 To establish a mapping between capitalization effects and welfare measures, some additional restrictions will be needed.\nAt least two sets of conditions are sufficient to translate capitalization effects into MWTP. The first set of conditions follows directly from assumption 1. If assumption 1 is satisfied, the hedonic gradient must be time-constant. Adding the usual orthogonality restriction on the econometric error term gives us (15) SUFFICIENT CONDITION 1. \n. 19 From the perspective of welfare measurement, conflation bias is more problematic than the standard complications with interpreting local average treatment effects (LATE). In the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, LATE can identify parameters that are \"structural\" in the sense that they are invariant to policy changes operating through z (see Heckman 2010) . In contrast, capitalization effects for public goods are not policy invariant. The market clearing function of the hedonic gradient makes capitalization effects endogenous to changes in implicit prices of non-market goods that will, in turn, vary with the policy change operating through z.\nThe second set of conditions replaces TCGA with additional restrictions on the data. It can be seen from (14) \nIf the instrument is randomized in the sense that it is orthogonal to the initial level of the public good, and to the initial levels of the control variables, and to changes in those variables, then the capitalization effect identifies MWTP in the post-shock equilibrium, even if the gradient changes. 20 This identification argument is implicit in regression discontinuity designs such as Greenstone and Gallagher (2008) , where the instrument is a policy that induces a g \u2206 \"treatment\" for observations that lie above a certain 1 g threshold. If treatment is randomized with respect to 1 h and h \u2206 , then focusing on observations in a very small neighborhood around the threshold may approximately identify ex post MWTP.\nHowever, the policy relevance of ex post MWTP still depends on the nature of the instrument and the evolution of the hedonic gradient. For example, consider a policy that produces a large improvement in g , driving MWTP to zero. Knowing 2 \u03b8 (but not 1 \u03b8 )\ndoes not allow us to distinguish the hypothesis that people were made better off by the policy from the alternative hypothesis that people were indifferent to the improvement that occurred. Now imagine a second random event causes g to deteriorate, increasing MWTP. Data from periods two and three could be combined to recover 3 \u03b8 . In principle, 20 The requirement that z be orthogonal to h \u2206 arises because of the potential endogeneity of h \u2206 in equation (2) when (13) is the true model (e.g. h \u2206 may be correlated with the 1 h term that is omitted from (2)). It follows that if z is correlated with some of the elements of h \u2206 then the IV capitalization model will generally provide an inconsistent estimator for ex post MWTP. Condition (16) can be relaxed to allow correlation between z and h \u2206 if additional instruments are available for the endogenous elements of h \u2206 , consistent with the usual logic for two stage least squares estimation with multiple endogenous variables. Thus, studying the evolution of price functions is essential to understanding the mapping between capitalization effects and the willingness to pay for public goods."}, {"section_title": "Evidence on the Evolution of Hedonic Price Functions", "text": "The 40-year history of research on valuing school quality is a microcosm for the broader literature on using housing markets to value public goods. 23 Because a household's access to a public school has traditionally been determined by whether the household lives in the attendance zone for that school, property values should reflect what parents are willing to pay for their children to attend schools where students score higher on standardized tests. 24\nEarly studies appeared to confirm this intuition. Then researchers noted a potential source 21 The approach suggested here would serve as a quasi-experimental analog to Palmquist's (1988) proposal for using hedonic price functions to calculate welfare measures for quality changes. 22 This is similar to Chetty's (2009) \"sufficient statistics\" for quasi-experimental welfare measurement 23 Kain and Quigley (1975) is among the early contributions. Recent applications include Downes and Zabel (2002) , Figlio and Lucas (2004) , Reback (2005) , and Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) . 24 The American Housing Survey provides strong evidence that school quality affects where many movers decide to live. Between 14% and 18% of recent homebuyers surveyed between 2003 and 2007 specifically cited \"good schools\" as one of the reasons they chose to move into their neighborhood. A steady 7% cited good schools as the main reason.\nof confounding-schools with higher test scores tend to be located in more exclusive neighborhoods. Subsequent studies refined the research design to mitigate confounding from omitted neighborhood amenities. This work began with Black (1999) . She argued that school quality shifts discretely as one crosses an attendance zone boundary, but other amenities do not. Therefore, the composite price effect of all unobserved amenities that are common to houses on both sides of a boundary can be absorbed by a fixed effect for the \"boundary zone\". By focusing on sales that occurred near a boundary and including fixed effects for each boundary zone, Black forced the identification to come from price differentials between similar houses located on opposite sides of a boundary.\nBayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) refined Black's approach to control for correlation between preferences for schools and preferences for the demographic characteristics of one's neighbors. The problem stems from sorting. If preferences for school quality are correlated with demographic characteristics, such as race or education, then similar types of households will tend to locate in the same attendance zones. This helps to explain why neighborhood racial composition also tends to shift discretely as one crosses an attendance zone boundary. Since prospective homebuyers may care about the characteristics of their neighbors, one must control for the demographic composition of the neighborhood in order to isolate the implicit value of academic performance. 25 We use the boundary discontinuity design for valuing school quality to estimate singleyear price functions for five metropolitan areas at five-year intervals. Then we calculate MWTP for school quality in each year, test TCGA, and compare estimates for MWTP to capitalization effects following changes in test scores that occurred over the first four years of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Throughout the application, we follow the data collection and econometric procedures outlined by Black (1999) and Bayer, Ferreiria, and McMillan (2007) . Readers are referred to their papers for additional background. The remainder of this section briefly summarizes NCLB and the data sets we have assembled."}, {"section_title": "No Child Left Behind", "text": "The No Child Left Behind Act was one of the most sweeping reforms in the recent history of public education. Beginning in 2003, it required states to implement accountability systems that measure student performance in reading and math. Standardized testing is done in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during high school. State test scores are used to determine if each school is making \"adequate yearly progress\" toward the goal of having every student attain state-specific standards for minimum competency in reading and math by 2014. Schools that do not make adequate yearly progress face a series of repercussions.\nWhile test scores have trended up since NCLB was enacted, its impact on the quality of education has been debated. Advocates argue that school quality will be improved by tracking performance, publicizing results, and sanctioning poorly performing schools.\nCritics argue that NCLB creates perverse incentives to teach to the test, to lower standards, to expel poorly performing students, or even lie when reporting scores. Several authors have investigated these issues. The emerging consensus seems to be that NCLB has improved performance, despite its flaws. For example, Dee and Jacob (2011) identify the impact of NCLB on test scores from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP). A key feature of their research design is that changes in NAEP scores should be unaffected by the perverse incentives of NCLB. They find that NCLB produced large and broad gains in NAEP math scores of 4 th and 8 th graders, especially in the bottom decile of the achievement distribution. 26 These results suggest that the upward trend in NCLB scores is consistent with alternative metrics for judging school quality.\nNCLB scores are the official source of public information about school quality, and they are easily observed. Every school is required to track the share of its students who achieve proficiency in each subject.

We use this same approach in Fairfax and Portland, where children are still assigned to schools based on the attendance zones where their parents live. However, school-specific assignment is no longer the norm. Since the mid-1990s, there has been an explosion of state and local regulations mandating \"open enrollment\" at the school district level. In an open enrollment area, parents are free to send their 26 Mean increases in the NAEP math test scores were approximately 1-8 points from the start of NCLB to 2007 for 4 th and 8 th grade math scores. In a related study, Neal and Schanzenbach (2011) find that NCLB increased reading and math scores for fifth graders in the middle of the achievement distribution in the Chicago Public School system. 27 States were not required to start reporting test scores until 2006. Some states did not report scores in 2003.\nchildren to any public school within the district. There is evidence that parents take advantage of these laws by sending their children to schools outside the zone where their house is located (Reback 2005 also be more likely than attendance zone boundaries to overlap with features of the urban landscape. Therefore, we control for property tax rates and we use visual inspection to exclude boundaries that overlap with landscape features such as rivers and highways."}, {"section_title": "Data and Summary Statistics", "text": "We assembled data on test scores, neighborhood characteristics, and houses sold during the 2003 and 2007 school years. 29 The scores that we use are combined rates of math and reading proficiency reported by states under NCLB. We matched each housing sale with lagged scores for the relevant school or school district. 30 Houses sold during the 2003 28 Dhar and Ross (2009) discuss tradeoffs between studying attendance zone boundaries and district boundaries. For example, district boundaries may have the advantage of being perceived as more permanent by homebuyers, but they are also more likely to overlap with property tax rates and neighborhood demographics, underscoring the importance of controlling for these variables in a regression. While interesting, the distinction between attendance zone and district boundaries does not affect our main empirical findings. 29 The 2003 31 Scores are not directly comparable across study areas because each state has its own testing system. 32 Annual block group data were obtained from Geolytics. Their data are developed using information from the decennial Census, annual Census surveys, postal records, and actuarial tables of births and deaths. 33 The mean 2003 score is slightly different than the corresponding mean in Table 1 . This is because area on a 0.4 acre lot. It was located in a block group where 23% of the neighborhood was nonwhite, 24% was under 18 years of age, 85% of houses were owner occupied, 1% of houses were vacant, and 0.37 was the normalized measure of population density. The average ratio of assessed to taxed value called a \"tax rate\" was 112.\nColumns 3-5 summarize the subsample that we use in the boundary discontinuity regressions. Column 3 reports means over houses located within 0.2 miles of a boundary.\nWhile this cuts the sample in half, there are almost no changes in the characteristics of the average house (comparing columns 1 and 3). Column 4 reports the difference in mean characteristics of houses located on the \"high score\" and \"low score\" sides of a boundary, and column 5 reports T-statistics on the differences. Differences in scores are large and statistically significant whereas differences in housing characteristics tend to be small and insignificant. Like Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) , we find differences in the racial composition of homeowners on the high and low-score sides of a boundary. This underscores the importance of controlling for demographics during the estimation. Notice that Philadelphia is one of four areas to have a significant increase in the price elas- The evidence in panel A is tentative because we have not controlled for correlation between school quality and unobserved amenities. Positive correlation seems likely. To see this, first note that household income is a strong predictor of a child's academic performance. 35 Now consider a household's location choice problem. If homebuyers appreciate low crime rates, access to parks, and scenic views, they will bid up prices in neighborhoods with those amenities. Wealthier parents who can afford to live in high-amenity neighborhoods will have children who perform better on standardized tests. Therefore, our inability to control for crime, parks, and views will produce an upward bias on the OLS estimator for the test score coefficient. Boundary fixed effects can mitigate this problem by absorbing the price effect of unobserved amenities in each boundary zone. 35 Correlation between household income and academic performance reflects a web of interaction between several underlying factors. Income is correlated with parental education and ability which, in turn, may help to explain the quality of the early parenting environment. Income is also correlated with the education and ability of the parents' of the child's peers, and so on. While positive correlation between income and test scores is sufficient to develop intuition for the endogeneity problem in our model, understanding the underlying causal mechanisms is critical to the development of effective education policies. See Heckman (2008) for a summary of the evidence.\nPanel B reports regression results after adding boundary fixed effects. Consistent with intuition, the coefficients of variation increase and the test score coefficients decrease. 36 Comparing panels A and B reveals that boundary fixed effects decrease most of the elasticities by more than 50%.\nNCLB scores are not directly comparable across states because each state develops its own tests. Nevertheless, since the state-specific scores represent different proxy measures of the same underlying variable-school quality-they can be compared in terms of a common proportionate change. The elasticities in columns 6-10 are remarkably similar across the five metro areas in 2003. They suggest a 1% increase in math and reading proficiency would increase property values by 0.12% to 0.27%. In comparison, Black (1999) reports an increase of 0.42% for Boston in 1993-1995 and the results from Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) indicate an increase of 0.12% for San Francisco in 1990.\nIn 2007 our range of point estimates for the test score elasticity is wider: 0.04 to 0.57. housing characteristics that serve as substitutes or complements for school quality; and (vi) 36 The impact on the test score coefficients of including the boundary fixed effects is quite similar (in percentage terms) to the results reported by Black (1999) and Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007) . Coefficients on the control variables are generally consistent across metro areas with the usual signs and plausible magnitudes. Results are suppressed for brevity and will be provided upon request. Like Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan we find that, more often than not, inclusion of the boundary fixed effects decreases the magnitudes of the coefficients on neighborhood demographics. changes in the stock of housing. Parsing out the relative importance of these and other potential contributing factors would require estimating a demand system for school quality and other attributes of houses and neighborhoods-a challenge that we leave for future research. 37 Regardless of what drives the temporal instability of the hedonic price function, Epple (1987) , Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2004) , and Kuminoff, Smith, and Timmins (2013) for an overview of the challenges with hedonic demand estimation. 38 As noted earlier, there are too few repeat sales to support a micro data analysis. Our use of block group averages provides greater resolution than recent studies that defined the unit of observation as a census tract median or a county average (Chay and Greenstone 2005 , Greenstone and Gallagher 2008 , Baum-Snow and Marion 2009 with changes in NCLB scores across the block groups within a metro area (e.g. crime rates). While this is certainly possible, it seems unlikely that localized amenities (other than school quality) would change sharply as we cross an attendance zone boundary.\nBased on this logic, adding boundary fixed effects to the regression will mitigate potential confounding by absorbing the capitalization of changes in all unobserved variables that are common to both sides of a 0.2-mile boundary zone. 39 As an exploratory exercise, we repeated the estimation using a Oaxaca decomposition that added baseline test scores as controls:\n. This specification replaces the assumption that 0 = \u2206\u03b8 with the assumption\nDoing so improved our results for Fairfax and Detroit. The implied test score elasticities were positive and significant for Fairfax in 2007 and Detroit in 2003 and 2007, though they still understated our preferred estimates from panel B by 45% to 62%. However, results for the other three metro areas were statistically insignificant, making it difficult for us to draw general conclusions about the relative performances of the two models. Investigating Oaxaca-type extensions of the standard capitalization model would be an interesting area for further research.\nTo implement our panel data version of the boundary discontinuity design we first drop all houses located more than 0.2 miles from a boundary. Then we aggregate the micro data on either side of each boundary. Finally, we add fixed effects for each boundary zone and estimate the resulting first-differenced model, Overall, comparing the results in panels A and C of table 3 (without boundary fixed effects) and comparing the results in panels B and D (with boundary fixed effects) suggests that the price function gradients changed over time and that these changes created wedges between capitalization effects and hedonic price function parameters. We ran additional robustness checks to investigate the possibility that these wedges are influenced by aggregation bias (moving from micro data to block groups or boundary zones) and/or sample selection bias (moving from the full metro area to 0.2 mile boundary zones) and found evidence against both explanations. Details are provided in the online appendix."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Welfare Measurement", "text": "The results from our single-year regressions suggest that hedonic price functions adjusted to changes in housing market conditions. These changes matter for evaluating the benefits of public education. Overall, these results seem to confirm the predictions from our theoretical and econometric models. Shocks to the spatial distribution of public goods and changes in market fundamentals cause the hedonic price function to adjust, driving a wedge between capitalization effects and welfare measures. Rosen's (1974) A key challenge for future research is to develop research designs that mitigate endogeneity problems without undermining the economic interpretations of the identified parameters. One strategy is to carefully model the mechanisms that cause variables to be endogenous within a well posed structural model of the sorting process (e.g. Epple, Romano, and Sieg 2006, Ferreyra 2007) . Another option is to adapt tools from the program evaluation literature to refine the design of a structural sorting model (e.g. Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan 2007, Galiani, Murphy, and Pantano 2012) . A third possibility is to refine the econometric tools of the program evaluation literature to mitigate omitted variable bias in a way that maintains a consistent link to an equilibrium description of the structural model."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our application to valuing public school quality illustrates how this can be done.

Cols. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are simply the means and standard deviations for the 3 different samples of data. The boundary zone sample includes all houses located within 0.20 miles of the boundary of another school attendance zone. Col. 4 reports the difference in means between houses located on the \"high\" test score side of a boundary with the corresponding mean for the \"low\" test score houses on the opposite side of the boundary. Col. 5 provides a T-statistic on the difference in these means. Cols. 8 and 9 report correlations between the change in test scores and levels and changes in all other variables for the full sample of census block group data. housing characteristics (square feet, number of bathrooms, age, lot size, number of bedrooms) and neighborhood characteristics measured at the block group level (population density, percent nonwhite, percent under 18, percent owner occupied, and percent vacant). In cols. 1 through 10, the dependent variable is the natural log of the sale price of the house. All control variables are interacted with a dummy for sales made during the 2007-2008 school year. In cols. 11 through 20 the dependent variable is the change in the natural log of the average sale price in a census block group or a 0.2 mile boundary zone. See the text for additional details. "}]
