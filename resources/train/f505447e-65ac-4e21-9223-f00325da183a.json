[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Summary Report 1995 is the twenty-ninth in a series of reports on research doctorates awarded by U.S. colleges and universities. Like its predecessors, this report presents trends in doctorate production in the United States, describing the general demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients and the seven broad fields in which they earned their degrees. Each of the seven broad fields consists of several \"major\" fields (e.g., biological sciences is a major field within the broad field of life sciences, psychology is a major field within the broad field of social sciences). The doctorate recipients themselves report their field of study and are counted accordingly. For a list of the fields discussed in this report, see the inside back cover and the specialties list in Appendix D. (Note: These field groupings may differ from those used by federal sponsors of the survey.) The first section of Summary Report 1995 presents brief narratives of key survey findings, accompanied by figures showing selected trend data. The numbers and percentages from which the figures were drawn are provided in a set of tables following the first section; relevant tables are referenced at the bottom of the figures. This section also includes major findings from data presented in tables but not in figures. Although the main body of the report is similar in content to last year's, Summary Report 1995 presents a special section on non-U.S. citizens that focuses on the contribution of leading non-U.S. countries of originChina, India, Taiwan, and Koreato what, until this year, has been a growing population of non-U.S. citizens earning doctorates from U.S. colleges and universities. Supplementary tables on 1995 doctorate recipients are given in Appendix A, and trend data on the 1985-1995 Ph.D. cohorts are presented in Appendix B. Appendix C provides technical notes that include nonresponse rates and other information related to tables and figures in the body of the report. Appendix D contains a copy of the survey questionnaire. Additional information is available from the Doctorate Records Project upon request. For a cost, the project offers tables on the baccalaureate origins of Ph.D.s by major field of doctorate and tables on the doctoral specialties of Ph.D.s by citizenship, race/ethnicity, and gender. Customized tables can also be prepared at cost.

This first part of the Summary Report on trends in doctorate recipients examines the trends behind this overall increase. The first three sections that follow focus on trends by gender, race/ethnicity (for U.S. citizens), and broad field. The section examining broad fields has subsections on gender and race/ethnicity. The first three sections are followed by sections examining time-to-degree, financial support during graduate school, postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients, and sectors of employment for doctorates who have definite employment commitments at the time the doctorate is earned. This year data on citizenship status is presented in a second part of the report focusing on the contribution of China, India, Taiwan, and Korea to the growth of non-U.S. Ph.D.s. Non-U.S. citizens account for much of the growth in the numbers of Ph.D.s in the past decade, and the growing number of Ph.D.s who are citizens of these four Asian countries account for most of the growth among non-U.S. Ph.D.s. The second part of the report examines the trends behind these increases. It also notes, however, that the number of non-U.S. Ph.D.s declined between 1994 and 1995 and suggests this may be the beginning of a new trend. \"Ph.D.\" is used in this report to refer to the Doctor of Philosophy degreeand recipients of this degreeand to any of the other doctoral degrees covered by the survey. Over 88 percent of the degrees earned in 1995 were the Doctor of Philosophy. More than two-thirds of the remaining degrees were Ed.D.s or other doctorates in education. A full list of included degrees can be found inside the back cover.  Field of Doctorate Of the seven broad fields profiled in this report, life sciences has the largest number of Ph.D.s, though engineering has had the fastest recent growth. (See Table 2, page 22.) All broad science and engineering fields reached new highs in 1995. Following life sciences (7,913 in 1995) were physical sciences (6,806 Ph.D.$), social sciences (6,623 Ph.D.$), and engineering (6,007 Ph.D.$). Among the nonscience fields in 1995, education produced 6,546 Ph.D.s, compared to 5,061 in humanities and 2,654 in professional/other fields. The number of doctorates in humanities reached its highest level since 1973. Professional/other fields was the only broad nonscience field to break its previous record number of doctorates (2,583 in 1994). The annual number of engineering doctorates grew the fastest over the past decade, by 89.7 percent. During that period, physical sciences grew at 50.2 percent, humanities at 47.6 percent, professional/other fields at 40.2 percent, life sciences at 36.9 percent, and social sciences at 14.9 percent. Education declined by 2.8 percent since 1985.  "}, {"section_title": "Field of Doctorate", "text": "In 1995 the number of doctorates awarded to men surpassed those to women in five of seven broad fields. Women continued to earn the majority of doctorates in education, with 62 percent of all doctorates. For the first time, women also outnumbered men in social sciences (3,362 to 3,261). They were near parity in the humanities. Women remained substantially outnumbered in the fields of life sciences (42 percent of Ph.D.$), physical sciences (22 percent), and engineering (12 percent). Although the number of women Ph.D.s has increased in every broad field over the past 30 years, men have experienced major declines since the early 1970s in the social sciences, humanities, and education. The number of doctorates earned by men in the social sciences has stabilized in recent years, and their numbers in humanities have slowly risen. The decline of male doctorates in education has continued, though, decreasing again from 2,618 in 1994 to 2,514 in 1995. The number of education doctorates awarded to men in 1995 was about half the number in 1975.  \nRacial and ethnic minorities received almost 13 percent of all doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1995. As a group they accounted for more than 16 percent of doctorates in education and in engineering each. They accounted for 9 to 13 percent of Ph.D.s in each of the remaining broad fields. In 1995 blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians earned their largest numbers of doctorates in the field of education, followed by the social sciences. Life sciences and engineering were the leading fields among Asians. Among blacks, 44 percent of all doctorates were in the field of education in 1995. Blacks received more than 10 percent of all Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens in that field. The overall decline in the number of black Ph.D.s from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s can be accounted for by the sharp drop in black Ph.D.s in education during that period. The subsequent increase over the past decade is partially accounted for by the rebound in black Ph.D.s in education but also by increases across all broad fields. The largest numerical increases in the past decade have been in education, life sciences, and social sciences. The largest percentage increases have been in engineering and life sciences. In 1995 almost two-thirds of doctorates earned by Asians were in the broad fields of life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences. Asians received 11 percent of Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens in engineering, about 6 percent in physical sciences, and more than 5 percent in life sciences. Trends among Asians, though, have been driven by advances in almost every field. The numbers of Asians in social sciences and engineering have almost tripled in the past decade and more than doubled in each of the other fields except education. In 1995 almost half of the doctorates earned by Hispanics were in education or social sciences. Another 30 percent received their Ph.D.s in life sciences and humanities. The largest numerical increases among Hispanics in the past decade have been in social sciences and life sciences. The largest percentage increases, though, have been in engineering and physical sciences. American Indians also have had increases in every field except education. Their numbers in the past decade, though small, have increased 10-fold in engineering, tripled in physical sciences, more than doubled in humanities, doubled in professional fields, and increased by about half in life and social sciences.   "}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "Men -a-Women"}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Total time to degree (TTD) measures the total number of years between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the Ph.D. Registered time to degree (RTD) gauges the amount of time a person was enrolled in educational programs between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the Ph.D. RTD includes work on master's degrees, enrollment in nondegree programs, and time spent working on the doctorate, including the dissertation. RTD does not count time off during this period. Neither TTD nor RTD distinguishes between full-and parttime enrollment. Median TTD has increased steadily since 1991, from 10.5 to 10.9 years, nearly three years longer than the median for 1970 graduates (8.0 years). Median RID has been stable at 7.2 years since 1992, after growing to that level from 5.6 years in 1970. (See Table 8, page 28.) Both TTD and RID varied considerably by field. In 1995 doctorate recipients in education had the longest median TTD (19.9 years), while those in physical sciences had the shortest median TTD (8.4 years). The longest median RID was in the humanities (8.4 years), and the shortest median RID was in engineering (6.4 years). Time to degree was longer for women than for men, but the difference was often minimal within the same broad field. (See Table 9, page 29.) Blacks had the longest time to degree of all U.S. racial/ethnic groups, largely because their highest percentage of degrees was in the field of education. Both permanent residents and U.S. citizens exhibited longer timeto-degree rates than did temporary residents.  20 24 Median Years to Doctorate NOTE: The method of median computation has been revised since 1994.

SOURCE: National Research Council, Survey of Earned Doctorates."}, {"section_title": "14 Financial Support", "text": "As in the previous three years, university funding (mostly via teaching and research assistantships) was the primary source of graduate school support for the majority of 1995 Ph.D.s (53 percent). (See Table 10, page 30.) Another 36 percent of Ph.D.s were primarily supported by personal resources (their own earnings, family contributions, loans) and the remaining 11 percent by resources from federal or state governments, nonfederal competitive fellowships, businesses, and employers. The type of primary support varied greatly by field. University sources were most common in physical and life sciences and engineering (as reported by well over half of recipients). Personal resources were easily the most typical in education (as reported by 78 percent of recipients). Overall, a majority (58 percent) of male Ph.D. recipients cited university funding as their primary source of support. Of female Ph.D. recipients, roughly equal numbers relied on personal resources (46 percent) and university funding (44 percent). The differences between men and women largely disappear within fields, though several variations are noteworthy: a higher percentage of women than men in engineering cited federal funding as a primary source of financial support; higher percentages of men than women cited university support in life and social sciences. Among U.S. citizens, a majority of Asians cited university support as primary, while personal support was cited as primary among blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and whites. Differences among demographic groups are partially accounted for by the distributions of these groups across broad fields. Within fields, differences of note include (1) high percentages of university support for Asians in physical sciences, engineering, and professional/other; (2) higher-than-average percentages of federal support for Asians in life sciences, for blacks in physical, life, and social sciences, and for Hispanics in sciences, engineering, and education; and (3) very high levels of \"other\" support for blacks, and to a lesser degree Hispanics, in the sciences, engineering, and humanities.  Almost half (47 percent) of all Ph.D.s in 1995 reported debt related to their combined undergraduate and graduate education. The majority of those with debt reported owing more than $10,000. Doctorate recipients in engineering were the least likely to have incurred educational debt (38 percent), while those in social sciences were the most likely (60 percent). Almost two-thirds of social science Ph.D.s with debt owed more than $10,000, and over one-fifth owed more than $30,000. By contrast, more than half of the indebted Ph.D.s in physical sciences and about half of those in life sciences and engineering owed $10,000 or less. (See Table 11, page 31.) Men and women reported debt in equal proportions and had similar distributions across levels of debt. Among U.S. citizens, Hispanics were the most likely of racial/ethnic groups to have educational debt and to report the highest level of debt. (See Table 12, page 31.) Non-U.S. citizens were much less likely to have incurred debt than U.S. citizens, the majority of whom were indebted. Temporary residents were more likely than permanent residents to report debt and to report a very high level of debt; this is surprising in that temporary residents rely less than permanent residents on personal sources of support, the category that includes loans. neering Sci. Sci."}, {"section_title": "ities tion Other", "text": "See "}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Plans", "text": "The proportion of Ph.D.s reporting definite postgraduation commitments at the time the doctorate is earned declined from about two-thirds in the 1970s and 1980s to about three-fifths in 1995. (See \"Definite commitments,\" page 142.) Of those Ph.D.s in 1995 who did report having definite postgraduation commitments, 70 percent planned to be employed while 30 percent planned postdoctoral study. (Postdoctoral appointments are considered to be study rather than employment in this report.) The proportion of new Ph.D.s with postdoctoral study plans has steadily increased since 1975, when only 17 percent planned further study. (See Table 13, page 32.) Doctorate recipients in professional/other and education fields were the most likely to have work plans (97 and 96 percent, respectively), followed closely by humanities Ph.D.s (92 percent). Study plans were by far the most common in life sciences (65 percent). The majority of Ph.D.s in every major demographic group planned to work rather than pursue further study after graduation. However, women were even more inclined toward employment than were men. Among the aggregate of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, blacks had the largest proportion with work plans (about 83 percent), and Asians had the largest proportion with study plans (49 percent, up from 35 percent in 1990). (See Table 14, page 33.) These patterns are explained mainlyand for blacks and women, entirelyby the fields in which these different groups tend to earn degrees. "}, {"section_title": "Employment Sector", "text": "In 1995, as in earlier years, academe was the primary employer of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who had definite commitments for employment in the United States after graduation. The proportion of Ph.D.s intending to work in academe has fluctuated over the last two decades. In 1975, 60 percent of U.S. citizens and permanent residents with employment commitments were headed for academia. By 1985, the proportion had declined to 49 percent; it rose again to 54 percent in 1995. The number of new doctorates with academic commitments rose from about 6,500 in 1985 to almost 7,500 in 1995. (See Table 15, page 34.) Plans for employment in industry (including self-employment) increased from 13 percent of Ph.D.s in 1975 to 20 percent of Ph.D.s in 1995. \"Other\" employment sectors (namely K-12 schools and nonprofit organizations) also showed an increase, from 14 percent in 1975 to 17 percent in 1995, though the percentage is down from 19 percent in 1994. The sector of planned employment for Ph.D.s varied by field. In 1995 academic employment plans were most predominant in the humanities (83 percent) and professional/other fields (73 percent). Industry was most frequently reported among engineers (62 percent) and physical scientists (44 percent). There was a small increase in academic employment among physical scientists in the last year, however, so that the academic and industrial sectors are almost equal now for that broad field. Academic employment plans were more prevalent among women (60 percent) than men (49 percent), while the proportion of men in industry (27 percent) was more than twice that of women. The proportion of doctorates with definite commitments in academia has been consistently higher for women than men. However, the actual number of men with academic commitments was greater than for women until 1992. In 1992 the number of women with definite commitments for academic employment was 3,636, while the number for men was 3,596. This trend has continued: In 1995, 3,866 women and 3,559 men had definite commitments for employment in academia The majority of Ph.D.s among every racial/ethnic group but Asians reported plans to work in academe. Asians favored industry (51 percent) over academic employment (38 percent).

Thus, the percentage of new Ph.D.s with definite commitments for work or study declined during this period. In the past decade the most striking feature of the postgraduation status of new Ph.D.s has been the increase in the number and percentage still seeking employment or postdoctoral study at the time their degrees are earned. While this is true of U.S. Ph.D.s as well, it has been even more significant for non-U.S. Ph.D.s, who have been overrepresented among those still seeking work or further study at graduation. Less pronounced, but still notable, has been the increasing number and percentage of new Ph.D.s who have postdoctoral study appointments. For citizens of the four leading non-U.S. countries, the percentage seeking work or further study has increased substantially, largely at the expense of the percentage of those with definite employment commitments. The percentage of doctorate recipients with postdoctoral study plans has been relatively stable for citizens of these four countries. While a shift toward industry has also been made by Indians, the movement of Chinese Ph.D.s has been draniatic. In 1985, 76 percent of Chinese Ph.D.s with employment commitments had them in academia and 14 percent had them in industry. In 1995, 33 percent had commitments in academia and 60 percent in industry (overwhelmingly in the U.S.). This has surely resulted from the change in visa status and, consequently, postgraduation location for most Chinese. There has been a simultaneous shift in postgraduation location to the U.S. by the increasing number of Chinese still seeking work or study at the time they earned their degrees. Not all non-U.S. citizens seek to stay in the U.S. Most Taiwanese and Koreans return home after graduation, whether they have definite commitments or are still seeking. For Taiwanese the percentage with definite commitments in the U.S. has declined over time, while the percentage with academic or postdoctoral study positions abroad have increased.

This may presage a new downward trend among non-U.S. citizens. Other evidence of this downward trend includes a decline in non-U.S. citizens enrolled in U.S. graduate schools from 1992 to 1993 and 1993 to 1994.' The next three sections review trends in the numbers of doctorates, broad fields of doctorates, and financial support for graduate education. The sections that follow these explore characteristics of the labor market for new Ph.D.s by examining postgraduation location by visa status, postgraduation commitments for employment or study, postgraduation employment sectors, postgraduation employment and study by location, and the postgraduation location of doctorates still seeking work or further study at graduation. Finally, data presented here is reviewed by country.  Koreans were more distributed across broad fields. While they approximated the average for all non-U.S. Ph.D.s in engineering and physical sciences, they had less than the average for non-U.S. Ph.D.s in life sciences (14 percent versus 21 percent) and more representation in the social sciences (16 percent versus 11 percent) and professional/other fields (11 percent versus 5 percent).  The Survey of Earned Doctorates asks doctorate recipients to list all sources of financial support during graduate school. The percentages noted below are those of all doctorates who reported a source. Doctoral students typically have more than one source of fmancial support, so categories of support add to more than 100 percent. Doctorates from China and India had higher-than-average percentages with university support, at 99 and 98 percent, respectively, in,1995, and lower-than-average percentages with personal support, at 26 and 31 percent, respectively. Very low percentages of Chinese and Indians reported foreign government support in 1995. While only 1 percent of Indian Ph.D.s have reported foreign government support since data were first collected in 1987, the percentage of Chinese students reporting foreign government, as well as personal, support has varied. The percentage of Chinese students reporting foreign government support declined from a high of almost 20 percent in 1988 and 1989 to only one percent in 1995. Meanwhile, the percentage of Chinese students reporting personal support increased from 16 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 1995.      :       "}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Employment and Study by Location", "text": "For Chinese Ph.D.s with definite commitments in 1995, the largest portionalmost 60 percentplanned postdoctoral study in the U.S. The second largest groupat more than 20 percentsecured positions in industry in the U.S. This latter group grew from about 5 percent in 1985. Meanwhile, the proportion with academic positions, especially abroad, declined from 1985 to 1995. These changes resulted from the shift among Chinese from temporary to permanent visa status, which has allowed the overwhelming majority of Chinese to stay in the U.S. following graduation. Indians also tend to have commitments in the U.S. but these commitments are more widely spread over different sectors. Over the past decade, about half of Koreans with definite employment or postdoctoral study commitments had them in the U.S. (although 71 percent of Koreans seeking work or study at the time they earned their degrees in 1995 were doing so abroad, as noted below). However, Koreans with definite commitments shifted from academic positions abroad to postdoctoral study positions in the U.S., postdoctoral study abroad, and industry abroad. The percentage of Koreans with academic positions abroad decreased from 27 to 12 percent from 1985 to 1995. At the same time, the portions of Koreans securing postdoctoral study positions in the U.S. and abroad rose by about 10 percentage points each. The percentage of Korean Ph.D.s with commitments to work in industry abroad also increased from 6 to 12 percent.

"}, {"section_title": "68", "text": "Off. T   Iry EST COPY AVNLABLI The number of doctorates awarded annually by U.S. colleges and universities grew by one-third from 1985 to 1995. During that period, the number of doctorates granted to non-U.S. citizens doubled, the growth in non-U.S. citizens accounting for almost two-thirds of the growth in the total number of doctorates awarded. The increase among non-U.S. citizens, moreover, was spurred by rapid increases in the numbers of doctorates awarded to citizens of the four leading countries of origin among non-U.S. citizensChina, India, Taiwan Each of these four countries is keydue to country size and/or pace of economic growthto the rapid development and industrialization of east and south Asia. Russell Cheetham, vice president for East Asia at the World Bank, called this growth \"a defining event for the world economy\" in the late twentieth century and the growing numbers of citizens from these four countries attaining doctorates in the U.S. has simultaneously become a key characteristic of U.S. higher education at the end of the twentieth century. 2 While these four countries are significant in both the industrialization of Asia and the growing numbers of non-U.S citizens receiving Ph.D.s in the U.S., the economies, policies, and education systems of these four countries differ substantially enough from one another that they generate remarkably different trends among their citizens in numbers, fields, sources of financing for graduate education, employment status, and whether they intend to stay in the U.S. following graduation. These differences can be summarized as follows: 1. China and India: Doctorates from China and India continue to grow in number; have high concentrations in the physical and life sciences and engineering; receive higher-than-average levels of university support and lower-than-average foreign government support; stay in the U.S. for some time after receiving their Ph.D.s, regardless of visa status; have growing numbers and percentages seeking work or further study at graduation and, more and more, doing so in the U.S.; and are shifting their job market expectations toward U.S. industry. The growth in the number of Chinese attending and receiving doctorates from U.S. colleges and universities has occurred at the same time that China has experienced phenomenal economic growth, at 10 percent or more of gross domestic product annually. Trends among Chinese, though, also track the changing course of China's study-abroad program and recent events in Chinese politics. Initiated in 1978 as part of Deng Xiaoping's \"Four Modernizations\" program for agriculture, industry, defense, and science, the Chinese study abroad program sent scholarsmainly visiting scholars in nondegree programsabroad to learn science and technology in more advanced Western 7' facilities and bring home the knowledge gained to help China develop. In 1982 the government increased the percentage of those sent abroad who were graduate students in degree programs. By 1989, however, the government realized that, by contrast with visiting scholars, graduate students tended to stay in the U.S. after completing their degrees, thereby generating a low return on the government's investment.3 As one student of the process observed, \"The prospects of mismatched positions, low ranks, little funding, and housing problems were strong disincentives to return: the 'push.' Opportunities to save money while working and studying abroad 'pulled' students. The political climate was also a concern for many, especially in 1987 with the purge of Hu Yaobang and several prominent intellectuals and also with the hardline taken against the 1989 democracy movement.\"\u00b0 In response to this brain drain, or \"delayed return problem,\" the government reduced the proportion of graduate students in its statefinanced program in the late 1980s, though at the same time it liberalized its policies on allowing \"self-financed\" students to go abroad. Despite Chinese \"reverse brain drain\" policies instituted recently, the number of Ph.D.s from China has continued to increase and they are staying in the U.S. following graduation.' In the process, as we have seen, they have also shifted sources of support, relying less on the Chinese government and more on personal and university resources. The politics and economy of India have so far generated similar trends. While not as robust as that in China, economic growth in India has recently been substantial, currently at 8 percent annual growth in gross domestic product. In addition, Indian entrepreneurs and government agencies have begun to move beyond India's decades-old import substitution policies to more high-tech and export-driven industries. One result has been the development of an \"Indian Silicon Valley\" in the Bangalore area and the investment of government funding in software technology parks. Still, this growth is recent and not yet substantial enough to create the level of change and opportunities that would lure Indians earning Ph.D.s in the U.S. back to the subcontinent. Thus, the number of Indians receiving Ph.D.s in the U.S. increased over the past decade and may continue to do so; the large percentage of Indians staying in the U.S. after graduation will likely stay high, at least for some time; and the percentage of Indians seeking positions in the U.S and obtaining them in U.S. industry will likely continue to increase.        \"Total\" includes those reporting \"postdoctoral study\", \"employment\", \"seeking\", and a small number not shown who reported definite commitments but did not report whether they have employment or postdoctoral study.

A-1 and TABLE A-2: Tables A-1 and A-2 display data for the most recent year by subfield of doctorate. The subfields correspond to the fields on the questionnaire's Specialties List located at the back of this report. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"include individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields. Table A-1 presents data by doctoral specialty and gender. Table A-2 displays doctoral specialty by citizenship and race/ethnicity. For a detailed description of the racial/ethnic variable, see the explanatory note for Table A-4.   TABLE A-3: Table A-3 is composed of three 2-page tables. The first table includes data on all doctorate recipients for the most recent year; the other two tables present the same data by gender. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Terms requiring definition are as follows: Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is obtained by subtracting the month/year of birth from the month/year of doctorate. (See note on next page.) Median Time Lapse: \"Total time\" refers to the total calendar time elapsed between the month/year of baccalaureate and the month/year of doctorate; \"registered time\" refers to the actual time in attendance at colleges and universities between receipt of the 100 Appendix A baccalaureate and the doctorate. Enrollment includes years of attendance not related to a recipient's doctoral program. NOTE about medians: The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations whenever available; if months are missing, only years are used in the calculations. Medians presented in all earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results. While differences are small (usually one-or two-tenths of a year), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20-24 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown SED data to be a reasonable indicator of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate, although results vary by sector. (The SDR, also conducted by the National Research Council, is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering, and humanities fields.) Refer to the footnote on page 139 in Appendix C for additional information on Ph.D.s who reported definite commitments at the time they completed the SED questionnaire. In Table A-3 the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment After Doctorate\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 23.4 percent of all engineers had postdoctoral study plans, 67.9 percent planned to be employed, and 8.7 percent did not report their postgraduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided. The data on study plans show that 8.1 percent of all engineers planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 13.4 percent, research associateships; 0.9 percent, traineeships; and 1.0 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. These percentages sum to 23.4 percent, the proportion of engineers who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to 67.9 percentthe proportion of engineering Ph.D.s who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item 20: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 20: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite.) Revisions to the questionnaire format beginning in 1990 appear to have resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity through 1993, when the rate was 15.1 percent. The questionnaire was revised again in 1994 and, subsequently, nonresponse has dropped the past two years to 11.9 percent in 1994 and 10.7 percent in 1995.

See inside back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; refer to the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977 it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget 112 (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980 the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In Table A-4, Ph.D.s who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or other Hispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as American Indian in this report.) NOTE about median age and time lapse (to doctorate): The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations whenever available; if months are missing, only years are used in the calculations. Medians presented in all earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results. While differences are small (usually one-or two-tenths of a year), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. See note on Table A-3 for definitions. In the section on \"Graduate School Support,\" a recipient counts in more than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note in Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections of Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table A-3. The reader is referred to the explanatory note in Table A-3 for additional  information.   TABLE A-5: Table A-5 displays data reported in item 17 on sources of financial support received during graduate school, by broad field and gender of recipient. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED.

Because a student counts once for each of his/her sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) Beginning with Summary Report 1990, federal research assistantships (RAs) have been aggregated with university RAs and shown under \"University Research Assistant\" in this table. (Focus groups of doctoral candidates have indicated uncertainty as to the source of their RA funding; it is therefore likely that some RAs incorrectly identified support provided by the federal government as university rather than federal.) The reader is advised not to compare sources of support data presented in the 1990-1995 Summary Reports with data in earlier reports because percentages appear higher for university support and lower for federal support in tables where all RAs are aggregated as \"University Research Assistants.\" The data in Table A-5 should be interpreted as follows: 168 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences in 1995 reported financial support from federal fellowships or traineeships during graduate school. This number is 3.4 percent of the male physical sciences Ph.D.s who answered the question on sources of support and 13.7 percent of all males in any field who reported federal fellowship or traineeship support.
