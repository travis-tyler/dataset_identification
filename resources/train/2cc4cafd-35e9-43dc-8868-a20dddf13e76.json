As little or no prevention effects can be detected among false at-risk subject in conventional trial durations, the higher the fraction of this group in trials, the more challenging to demonstrate intervention efficacy. Sample size power calculations are especially problematic as these estimates are often based on longitudinal trajectories of cognitive or functional outcomes among those who developed MCI versus those who retained normal cognitive status during follow-up in prior studies. In reality, when recruiting at-risk subjects, some proportion of subjects will not experience cognitive decline as expected, reducing power to detect intervention efficacy.\nBiofluid and imaging biomarkers are extensively evaluated as early indicators of pathological processes in clinical AD, 5 but assessing these biomarkers is expensive and often challenging to apply widely among presymptomatic older adults. Recent findings suggest neuropsychological test results (ie, involving less invasive methods and interviews only) might have as high discriminatory ability as biofluid or imaging biomarkers in stratifying at risk subjects. 6 It would be advantageous to use noninvasively collected clinical variables to identify accurately those at high risk for developing MCI within conventional trial durations. The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) was established by the National Institute on Aging (NIA, U01 AG016976) in 1999 to facilitate collaborative research among Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs) across the United States. NACC developed and maintains a large relational database of standardized clinical and neuropathologic research data called the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and standardized neuropsychological test results. Data are uploaded to the central repository from each ADC, with data cleaned and ready to be distributed to research communities (https://www.alz.washington.edu/). This dataset contains over 30,000 subjects (December, 2016). We applied big data analytics approaches to this rich dataset to derive the best model for distinguishing those developing MCI within a 4-year follow-up period from those retaining normal cognition. Previous study concluded that it is more cost effective to improve specificity than sensitivity. 3, 4 Therefore, we aimed to select the model with the highest specificity in the current study. By estimating weights of selected variables, we also developed a risk score calculator based subjects baseline characteristics to obtain the probability of conversion to MCI within 4 years."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We used the clinical variables collected in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data The best model (the highest specificity with high AUC) is marked bold fonts.

"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Model", "text": "Our aim is to differentiate between those who converted to MCI and/or dementia within 4 years versus those retaining normal cognition. We compared discriminatory abilities indicated by Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC AUC) by using the following classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). For each classifier, we examined the following univariate feature selection methods: Information Gain (InfoGain), 7 \u03c7 2 -test (Chi2), 8 minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (mRMR), 9 Gini-index (Gini), 10 BLogReg, 11 Fisher score, 12 and Kruskal-Wallis test (KW). 13 Briefly, InfoGain analysis first calculates the information gain for each clinical variable independently and then the features with specified numbers of highest information gains are selected as informative variables. \u03c7 2 uses \u03c7 2 test to estimate the independence between clinical variables and diagnostic categories. A high value of \u03c7 2 statistic indicates the failure of the hypothesis of independence of the 2 variables, indicating the high associativity of clinical variables and diagnostic categories. The mRMR selects the variables one-by-one where the selected variables are maximally relevant to the diagnostic categories and their dependence between each other is minimized. The Gini feature selection uses the Giniindex as the measurement of dependence between clinical variables and diagnostic categories. The BLogReg models the feature/label dependence based on an improved sparse logistic regression algorithm. The Fisher score feature selection is based on a so-called Fisher criterion to select variables. This criterion prefers the feature presentation where the distance of the same type of subjects is minimized while the distance of different type of subjects is maximized. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric statistical test method to detect the independence between clinical variables and diagnostic categories. It is a nonparametric method applicable to non-Gaussian distributions but may require more samples. The above methods are implemented by the software package FeatureMiner. 14 In addition to the above univariate feature selection approaches, jointly feature selection method based on L1-norm regularizer such as LASSO is another popular approach to simultaneously select features and learn feature weights. We use the liblinear 15 implementation of sparse Logistic Regression in our experiment (listed as LR-LASSO in Table 1 ). The parameters of LR-LASSO are tuned by 5-fold cross-validation and subsampling in the same way as in the univariate feature selection approach.\nOur first experiment is to find the best trade-off between the number of selected clinical variables and the discriminative power of the classifiers trained on these variables. We first examined the gain in ROC AUC by selecting top 10, 15, 20, and 25 variables. Preliminary study showed that after selecting 15 variables, there were little further gains in AUC by increasing the number of variables to predict MCI converters, that is, ROC AUC stabilizes after 15 variables (see Fig. 1 ). Therefore, we used 15 variables as the number of candidate variables for ROC AUC for each model. *Those who received diagnosis of dementia without observing MCI incidence within 4 years from baseline. These subjects were included when outcome is overall MCI, assuming that they experienced MCI stage within 4 years, before having the diagnosis of dementia. In the past 4 weeks, did the subject have any difficulty or need help with traveling out of the neighborhood, driving, or arranging to take public transportation. 0 = Normal 1 = Has difficulty, but does by self 2 = Requires assistance 3 = Dependent 8 = Not applicable (eg, never did) We randomly split 7026 subjects into 5 folds and used 4 folds for training and 1 fold for testing (ie, 20% of the data is for testing). We repeated the 5-fold cross-validation 100 times and then averaged over trials. We compared the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC of each model for identifying converters. We first assessed incidence of overall MCI conversion, followed by limiting the outcomes to incidence of amnestic MCI or to incidence of nonamnestic MCI. Our focus was to find predictors of MCI incidence, but some subjects received diagnoses of dementia without prior incident MCI incidence (MCI skippers). These subjects were included as incidence of overall MCI if the transition to dementia occurred within 4 years from baseline assessment, presupposing that these subjects went through an undetected MCI stage prior to diagnoses of dementia. If responses to questionnaire items are yes/no, we created one dummy variable. If responses are categorical with multiple response categories, we created multiple dummy variables with the lowest category as a reference group. Other variables were treated as continuous variables in all models.\nSince we used cross-validation and subsampling, the feature weights are random variables derived from multiple trials. We applied bootstrap method to estimate the mean value and the SD of the feature weights. Once we estimated the mean value and the SD, we generated the 95% confidential intervals using these values and a standard approach: Let the number of bootstrap loops be n, the empirical mean value be \u03bc and the SD be \u03c3. The lower bound x -and the upper bound x + of the 95% interval is given by\nUsing the weights, we were able to estimate the probability of each subject converting to MCI by using his or her information for the selected variables. Given a new subject, we first use the 100 SVM models to predict his/her affiliation of normal or MCI. Then we could estimate the probability of this patient converting to MCI by counting how many SVM models give positive predictions. Similarly, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated as described above. Probability calculators in excel formats were generated. Table 2 shows baseline characteristics of the overall study cohort, incident MCI groups, and subjects retaining normal cognition. Mean age (SD) of the total sample used here was 76.0 (10.0) with 66.1% female. Table 1 shows top-10 models with the highest AUC for predicting each outcome (MCI, aMCI, and naMCI). AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are shown. There were not large differences in AUC across models within each outcome as shown in Tables 2. For overall MCI, AUC was around 0.76 in all models and for aMCI around 0.77. For naMCI, AUC was slightly lower, ranging from 0.72 to 0.73. In addition to AUC, the specificity is of significant importance for cost-effective trial enrichment design. 4 Therefore, we chose the model with best specificity among the top-10 AUC models. The chosen models are exhibited in Table 1 with bold fonts."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Tables 3A-C shows the 15 variables selected as predictors of outcomes and their descriptions. Tables 4A-C summarize predictor variables specific to aMCI (Table 4A) , naMCI (Table 4B ), common to both subtypes (Table 4C) and those selected only when overall MCI (including MCI skippers) was an outcome (Table 4D) . We also list weights for each variable in Supplemental table (Table S1a-c; Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/WAD/ A187), where weights are averaged weights over the 5-fold cross-validation which were repeated 100 times. Predictor variables specific for aMCI incidence included older age, lower logical memory immediate and delayed recall scores (latter with a higher weight than the former), clinician's impression of subject's memory decline, difficulty in travelling independently, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) nondopaminergic deficiency indicators, and an indicator that subjects had motor neuron disease. However, the motor neuron disease variable has a very low weight (0.002) compared with other selected variables (see supplemental Table 1b, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A187). For example, one rank before this variable has weight of \u22120.015 (verbal fluency category animals) and therefore there is a large gap in importance in predicting an aMCI outcome between the 14th and 15th variables. For aMCI outcome, 14 variables are sufficient. naMCI specific variables included more frequent falls, disease status at enrollment [not being proband (those with first degree relatives being diagnosed as AD)], motor slowing, lower Boston naming test scores, lower length of digit span backwards, impairment in CDR's judgment/problem solving component, and having tremor. Variables selected across both MCI subtypes included (from high to low weights in order) UDS cognitive status based on UDS neuropsychological test results, informant's report of a decline in subject's memory, lower category fluency vegetables score, lower digit symbol scores, higher Trail B scores (ie, taking longer time to complete), higher CDR sum of box, impairment in memory component of CDR and category fluency animals. Finally, using these selected variables and weights generated from models, we created Excel calculators which estimate probability of converting to MCI, aMCI, and naMCI diagnoses within 4 years, given specific characteristics of subjects with 95% CI of the probabilities."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "As clinical trials increasingly target presymptomatic subjects, enriching study populations with those likely to convert to MCI within conventional trial durations may reduce required sample sizes and costs associated with evaluating study participants. 3, 4 NACC UDS is used in all NIH-funded Alzheimer disease centers in the United States and the approach shown in this study may be useful for selecting candidate subjects for preclinical trials from the NACC sampling pool. In addition to enriching clinical trial samples, it proved possible to create a short battery of selected variables and associated weights for screening atrisk subjects when administering long batteries such as UDS is not feasible. Our results showed that we could achieve over 75% AUC and over 70% specificity in distinguishing incidence of MCI within 4 years from those who remained normal cognition without invasive and costly indicators such as biofluid or imaging biomarkers.\nThe selected variables predicting MCI incidence, which include age, CDR sum of boxes and CDR memory score, cognitive domains that tap memory (logical memory immediate and delayed test scores) and executive functions (Trail B, category fluency), attention (digit symbol), informant's report of subject's memory decline, are all wellestablished predictors of MCI. Two financial management abilities-managing taxes and paying bills-are also known FAQ items which decline early in the course of dementing disorders. [16] [17] [18] [19] For predicting conversion to MCI, aMCI, and naMCI, useful predictor variables included items from the UPDRS, history of falls, presence of tremor (captured in UPDRS), bradykinesia, hypomimia, and speech changes. The selection of motor slowing is consistent with previous findings where decline in walking speed was an early indicator of cognitive impairment. [20] [21] [22] The inclusion of motor items among our useful variables emphasizes the utility of a careful, standardized motor evaluation, much of which is captured by the widely used and easily implemented UPDRS scale. This result may reflect the impact of forebrain amyloid burden on motor function. 23 One recent study applied a multimodal SVM method to identify those who converted from normal cognition to MCI or AD (vs. stable normal) within 24 months using Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study participants. 24 Applying the modalities which include selected features of MRI, AV45-PET, and FDG-PET, they showed 70% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, and 67% specificity in predicting MCI converters. Also using ADNI cohort, another study 25 examined the predictive ability of FDG-PET a priori specified ROI in identifying MCI converters. This study obtained 82% AUC ROC, identifying 11 subjects who received diagnosis of MCI or AD dementia within 4 years out of 54 initially healthy control subjects. After including results of Trail Making Test B, the AUC improved to 93.4%. In another study of ADNI participants, 26 the authors used a model combining MRI & FDG-PET measures to achieve 81.2% accuracy (80.0% sensitivity, 82.4% specificity) in predicting MCI converters within 4 years. Unlike past studies, we used only clinical variables and obtained the possible combination of items with each variable weighted to maximize prediction of MCI converters. During ADC consensus conferences, clinicians and neuropsychologists gather all clinical information available, including those obtained in previous assessments and establish clinical diagnoses. Experienced clinicians weigh all the available information and provide the best possible judgment. Our approach can be regarded as an algorithmically operationalized summary of clinical judgments predicting clinical MCI incidence within 4 years. Based on estimates obtained from these models, we generated user friendly Excel spreadsheets which return the probability of developing MCI, aMCI, and naMCI with 95% CIs.\nClearly selecting a population to maximize treatment benefit (predictive enrichment, for example, selecting those with high amyloid burden for antiamyloid trials) is critical. If not, the trial is likely to fail because of lack of benefits among the experimental group. It is ideal if our proposed risk calculation approach based solely on clinical variables could be combined with a biomarker-based enrichment strategy. This will likely ensure the efficacy shown in clinical outcomes (not just biomarker modifications) as well as reduction in cost of following false positive subjects longitudinally.\nLimitations of our analyses include potential sampling bias. Those enrolling in ADC cohorts are not representative community samples, even when subjects exhibit normal cognition. Therefore, application of probability calculators to non-NACC data might not be valid. The education level of this group, for example, is likely above the population average. This may limit generalizability of our study results. Even though standard criteria and procedures are applied across all ADCs, there may be some variability in selection and diagnoses factors among centers. 27, 28 The neuropsychological (NP) test battery in UDS used in the current study (Version 2.0) was replaced by new tests in March of 2015 (Version 3) 29 as part of an effort for NACC to use nonproprietary cognitive tests (see detail: https://www.alz. washington.edu/WEB/researcher_home.html). Once data with Version 3 NP test battery are accumulated, we plan to construct an equivalent calculator based on the new battery. We will post our current conversion probability calculator on the NACC researcher website, after permission from NACC, for wider use among AD center researchers. Considering uncertainty in psychological distress posed by disclosing estimated probability of getting MCI diagnosis, 30 our plan is to release the calculator only for research purposes."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Using only noninvasively collected clinical variables, we achieved over 75% ROC AUC for identifying subjects converting to MCI within 4 years of initial evaluations.
