[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In coastal ecosystems, accelerated sea level rise and an increase in storm frequency and intensity are two major impacts expected to result from climate change (Ashton, Donnelly, and Evans, 2008;Bender et al., 2010;Harvey and Nicholls, 2008). In the next century, the rate of global sea level rise is anticipated to be several times higher than that measured over the past century (Cazenave and Nerem, 2004;Church and White, 2006;Overpeck and Weiss, 2009;Pfeffer, Harper, and O'Neel, 2008;Rahmstorf, 2007). The U.S. northeast coast experiences a rate of relative sea level rise greater than the global average because of substantial regional variations in glacial isostatic adjustment effects and oceanographic processes (Sallenger, Doran, and Howd, 2012;Tamisiea and Mitrovica, 2011). Along the U.S. Atlantic coast, the highest rates of subsidence occur from southern Massachusetts to Virginia (Engelhart, Peltier, and Horton, 2011), and predicted changes in ocean circulation, driven by climate change, could potentially add meters of dynamic sea level rise along the northeast coast during the next century (Hu et al., 2009;Yin, Schlesinger, and Stouffer, 2009). Furthermore, the frequency and extent of severe coastal storms are expected to increase (Bender et al., 2010), and large surge levels may cause significant damage to coastal infrastructure and alteration of ecosystems (Irish et al., 2010;Kirshen et al., 2008;Lin et al., 2010;McInnes et al., 2003). Our objective was to explore how widely accessible data and tools can be used for highly localized assessments of inundation risk. As case studies, we modeled inundation risk from predicted sea level rise and storm surge at 97 sentinel sites in two coastal, northeastern U.S. national parks-Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO), and Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS)-using a variety of data sources, predicted scenarios, and physical models. The definitions of two terms used throughout this article are essential to understanding the project. Sentinel sites are locations of natural or cultural resources or critical infrastructure of special importance to the National Park Service (NPS). Examples include piping plover habitat, historic buildings, and bridges. At risk refers to the likelihood of inundation because of sea level rise or storm surge. However, some sites and associated resources predicted to be at risk of inundation would not necessarily be negatively affected by it. For example, a building may be unaffected by a brief period of inundation from storm surge. In other cases, natural or cultural resources or infrastructure may be severely affected if inundated. Therefore, risk (of inundation) does not equate to ''impact'' in our study. In either case, however, an understanding of the vulnerability of each sentinel site to inundation will allow park resource managers to develop appropriate management and mitigation strategies for these sites and areas of concern. Coastal zone scientists have used a variety of quantitative models to assess the effect of sea level rise and storm surge on coastal inundation and flooding. Several hydrodynamic models are used to model inundation from rising sea levels. Examples include MIKE 21 and MIKE FLOOD (Sto. Domingo et al., 2010), ADCIRC (Lin et al., 2010), LISFLOOD-FP (Lewis et al., 2011), and ANUGA (Van Drie, Milevski, and Simon, 2010). The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) relies on a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) model, HAZUS-MH, to estimate the physical, economic, and social impacts of large-scale flooding events (Scawthorn et al., 2006a,b). Other GIS-based methods have been applied as well (Brown, 2006;Hennecke and Cowell, 2000). A thorough review of sea level and storm surge inundation models is provided in Murdukhayeva (2012). Parkwide and regional-scale assessments of sea level rise and storm surge risk have been conducted previously in these two national parks (CACO, ASIS). The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) technique was applied at Cape Cod National Seashore (Hammar-Klose et al., 2003) and at Assateague Island National Seashore (Pendleton, Williams, and Thieler, 2004). The CVI method combines a number of physical variables to classify the relative vulnerability of 1.5-km shoreline segments to sea level rise effects. Gutierrez, Williams, and Thieler (2007) studied potential shoreline changes from sea level rise along the United States. Mid-Atlantic coast. The CVI and shoreline-change assessments provide a useful and robust overview of coastal vulnerability at landscape scales (1.5 km stretches of coast). Our study assesses risk at specific locations, thus provides a more-resolute evaluation of inundation. All vulnerability models and methods rely on elevation data, which are often limited in their vertical accuracy and cause large ranges of uncertainty in the results (Gesch, 2009). The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is the largest-scale, readily available, topographic data set for the entire United States, but with a vertical accuracy (root mean square error [RMSE]) of 2.44 m (Gesch, 2007), it is of little value in assessing inundation risk at specific sites. Our study relied on two sources of high-accuracy elevation data for sentinel sites: Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data and real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) data. Our assessment also integrated output for three sea level rise scenarios and four storm surge scenarios from several modeling approaches. For sea level rise, we used a ''bathtub inundation'' model with tidal-orthometric datum conversion and the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). For storm surge, we used the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites were calculated for each modeled scenario, and an index was developed to estimate overall inundation likelihood at each sentinel site. This overall index of inundation likelihood was an additional tool for prioritizing long-term management and climate change adaptation plans in the national parks."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "A goal of this research was to develop a process to assess sea level rise and storm surge inundation risk at specific locations in coastal environments.

The CACO is located on the outer (eastern) portion of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. It encompasses 123 km of ocean, marsh, and inner bay shorelines and contains a variety of marine, estuarine, and upland, terrestrial ecosystems with relatively varied topography for the coastal zone. The ASIS is located on the Delmarva Peninsula and lies within the boundaries of two states, Maryland and Virginia. It has 60 km of shoreline on an undeveloped barrier island with long stretches of dunes, beaches, and marshes. These study areas represented two different types of coastal ecosystem landscapes: a peninsular glacial moraine (CACO) and a barrier island (ASIS)."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Sentinel sites are locations of natural, cultural, and infrastructural resources of special importance to the NPS and were identified by park managers. At CACO, the 63 sentinel site locations included groundwater-monitoring wells, lighthouses, visitor centers, and historical monuments and sites, e.g. the Marconi Site and historic Marindin shoreline survey markers (Marindin, 1891). At ASIS, sentinel sites were locations of 34 newly installed or frequently used geodetic survey markers, which are critical for ongoing research on the island geomorphology. We measured the elevation of sentinel sites using RTK GPS (Trimble R8 GNSS), which provided elevation estimates with average vertical RMSE values of 3.5 cm for CACO and 0.7 cm for ASIS. Digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from LIDAR data obtained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the NPS from aircraft-mounted laser sensors. LIDAR data are typically accurate to 0.15-1 m (Gao, 2007). The horizontal resolutions of CACO's and ASIS's DEMs were 1 m and 2.5 m, respectively. The reported vertical accuracy of the DEMs for CACO and ASIS was 15 cm RMSE. To validate these accuracy estimates, we calculated the vertical RMSE using highaccuracy (,2 cm vertical and horizontal error) ground-control points that were available in each park. For CACO, the vertical RMSE of the DEM was 0.53 m using 35 existing geodetic control points. For ASIS, the vertical RMSE was 0.33 m using 1179 control points. The SLAMM model requires a DEM layer, a slope layer (derived from the DEM), a detailed land-use layer, parameters for tidal ranges (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], 2007), and if known, accretion rates for marshes. The land-use layer was created by merging the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) data (NOAA, 2006) and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data (USFWS, 2010) and recoding them to SLAMM categories, as specified by the SLAMM 6.0.1 Beta Users Manual (Warren Pinnacle Consulting, 2010). The source data for NWI were aerial photography (CACO in 1993 andASIS in 1988), and the source data for C-CAP were 2006 Landsat imagery. Some model parameters, such as marsh accretion rates, were obtained from Surface Elevation Table (SET) data (J. Lynch, personal communication; NPS, 2009). When these and other parameters (i.e. beach sedimentation rate, frequency overwash) were unknown or unavailable, SLAMM's default settings were used. Using default parameter settings could strongly sway the rates of inundation predicted by SLAMM (Scarborough, 2009), but we were limited by data availability for our case study sites."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Scenarios and Models", "text": "Three scenarios were selected to represent the current range of sea level rise predictions for the year 2100: rises of 0.6 m (IPCC, 2007), 1 m (Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009), and 2 m (Pfeffer, Harper, and O'Neel, 2008). The scenarios represent reasonable estimates of low, medium, and high predictions of sea level rise for this region. For example, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has adopted sea level rise scenarios in the range of 1-2 m to guide their planning policies (Gregg, 2010). Elevation data set accuracies also affected our choice of scenarios; based on the recommendations of NOAA (2010), vertical accuracies were sufficiently high for ASIS that inundation mapping could be performed for the scenarios: 0.6 m, 1 m, and 2 m. Only the 1 m and 2 m scenarios could be modeled for CACO because of the amount of uncertainty in the LIDAR DEM for this area (vertical RMSE\u00bc0.53 m). These two scenarios for CACO and all three scenarios for ASIS were modeled using two different sea level rise models. The first modeling approach, the bathtub model, involved creating a planar water surface representing the sea level rise scenario that is added to the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) tidal elevation. Modeling sea level rise or storm surge beyond the MHHW tidal elevation represents the worstcase inundation scenario. These water surface elevations were calculated using VDatum software (NOAA, 2011), which performs elevation conversions between NAVD88 (an orthometric datum) and tidal datums. The second approach used to evaluate sea level rise inundation was the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Using linear relationships and decision-tree rules, SLAMM calculates water elevation and computes inundation and habitat response over large areas. The SLAMM incorporates the temporal rate of the sea level changes (Mcleod et al., 2010). The output maps show expected habitat classes and areas of inundation based on the different rates and magnitudes of sea level rise associated with each modeled scenario. Sentinel-site locations were mapped over the output, and a change matrix was created for each one to show the shift from initial land-cover class to the final, predicted land-cover class."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Scenarios and Models", "text": "The four selected scenarios for storm surge are associated with the Saffir-Simpson Category 1-4 hurricanes. The SLOSH model, a forecast model for hurricane-induced water levels for the Gulf and Atlantic coasts (Jelesnianski, Chen, and Shaffer, 1992), was used in conjunction with the Applied Science Associates, Inc. (ASA), Inundation Toolbox-Interpolation Tool (Isaji and Knee, 2009). The SLOSH model displays the expected surge heights along coasts. Surge heights are not uniform along the coastline but depend on the hurricane track, wind speed, and topography and bathymetry at the point where the storm makes landfall (FEMA, 2003). Storm surge heights were derived for the Providence, Rhode Island/Boston, Massachusetts, and Ocean City, Maryland, storm basins in SLOSH and were interpolated to a raster surface of the same extent and resolution as the DEM, with the ASA Toolbox. Elevations from the DEM were compared with the elevations from the storm surge surfaces and probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites were calculated using the z-score uncertainty technique (described below). The uncertainty technique incorporated errors associated with the elevation data sets and known sources of error that are unique to the water surface modeled by SLOSH. A site was considered at risk from inundation if it had an elevation less than or equal to the water surface elevation that was predicted for that location. To account for topographic features that might prevent inundation of inland areas, only raster cells adjacent to the ocean or contiguous with other inundated cells were included in the risk maps. ArcGIS 10 software was used for all geospatial data processing (ESRI, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Probabilities of inundation for sentinel sites were calculated for each of the sea level rise scenarios (0.6 m, 1 m, and 2 m) and storm surge scenarios (Category 1-4 hurricanes). The land surface elevation and modeled water surface were compared, and probabilities of inundation at sentinel sites were calculated using the z-score inundation uncertainty technique described by NOAA Coastal Services Center (2010a). The standard normal cumulative-distribution function was used to calculate probabilities of inundation and the certainty of the prediction given errors associated with the data and models (Ott and Longnecker, 2010). Standard scores, or z-scores, were calculated at each sentinel site using the formula: where RMSE Total is calculated as follows: The RMSE for LIDAR DEMs is calculated as follows: where x LIDAR is the elevation from LIDAR at a single location, and x GPS is the elevation as determined by GPS in the same location. The RMSEs for the GPS survey elevations were reported by Trimble Software. The RMSEs for water surfaces were reported by VDatum. An area was considered at risk from inundation if it had an elevation less than or equal to the water surface elevation predicted for that location and was contiguous with other inundated pixels. Because high topographic features might prevent inundation of low-elevation areas further inland, we retained inundated locations that were contiguous with flooded areas but did not retain inland sites that were low elevation but were separated from the coast by a landscape feature higher than the inundation elevation (see Figure 2). Descriptive statistics were calculated for each risk estimate variable (e.g. probability of inundation with 1 m sea level rise, inundation depth at 2 m sea level rise), and the variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Because data were usually nonnormally distributed, we performed pairwise comparisons using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, and where there were three or more groups in a comparison, we used the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. A principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the large number of risk measures to a smaller number of variables to develop a composite measure of inundation risk at sentinel sites. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software package R (R Development Core Team, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Inundation Mapping", "text": "Estimates of the extent of sea level rise using the bathtub model are shown for selected parts of CACO ( Figure 2) and ASIS ( Figure 3).

Change matrices (Tables 7 and 8) show the number of sentinel sites in each habitat class initially and their expected conversions because of sea level rise. At CACO, only two scenarios were modeled because the vertical accuracy of the LIDAR data (the primary input driving the model) was inadequate to support the 0.6-m scenario. In the Undeveloped dry land category, 10 sentinel sites experienced conversions to the Transitional marsh category, one sentinel site converted to Estuarine beach, and one sentinel site converted to Open ocean after 2 m of sea level rise (Table 7). In ASIS, many sentinel sites were in the Undeveloped dry land class (24 of 34 total sites [71%]) and experienced conversions to Transitional marsh (n \u00bc 9; 38%), Estuarine beach (n \u00bc 1; 4%), Ocean beach (n \u00bc 3; 13%), and Open ocean (n \u00bc 11; 46%) with 2 m of sea level rise.

We used PCA to reduce the large set of correlated risk variables to a set of uncorrelated variables or principal components ( Table 9). The first principal component (PC1) explained 63% of the total variation in risk measures at CACO and 58% of the total variation in risk measures at ASIS. In all cases, inundation probabilities had a negative loading, and RTK GPS elevations had a positive loading on PC1 (Table 9). Nearly all variables had similar loading values on PC1, thus PC1 represents a ''size'' effect (August, 1983) and can be used as an index of the overall risk of inundation. The other principal components had high loadings on only one or two variables and reflected specific risk factors. Furthermore, they did not predict overall variation well and, therefore, were not candidates for an overall risk index. The range of PC1 values for each park was separated into five quintiles. Large, positive PC1 scores for sentinel sites indicated that inundation was very unlikely; large, negative PC1 scores indicated that inundation was very likely (Table 10).

The metadata for each of the two LIDAR-derived DEMs reported a 15 cm vertical RMSE. To validate these accuracy estimates, we calculated the vertical RMSE using ground control points of high quality and accuracy (,2 cm vertical and horizontal accuracy) collected using survey-grade GPS. Our estimates of the RMSE of the LIDAR data were two to three times larger than the RMSE values reported in the metadata. This result had many implications in our study. We were unable to reliably model the 0.6-m sea level rise scenario at CACO based on the uncertainly of the LIDAR DEM used in the modeling (NOAA, 2010). These results suggest that it is prudent to independently test the accuracy of DEMs used in inundation modeling."}, {"section_title": "Quality of the RTK GPS Data", "text": "The high accuracy of the elevations measured with RTK GPS was an important asset for this project. The GPS field surveys allowed us to collect accurate elevations of sentinel sites that were hidden from LIDAR signals and sensors (NOAA CSC, 2010b). For example, we surveyed elevations of groundwater monitoring wells located in forests with heavy canopy cover. Furthermore, because these elevations were measured with great accuracy using the RTK GPS (RMSE values of 0.6-8.7 cm), inundation probabilities could be calculated with greater certainty. The application of RTK GPS is a promising solution to elevation uncertainty issues in sea level rise inundation risk assessments. It is important to note, however, that RTK GPS protocols require operating a GPS base station at a location that has been surveyed to within a few millimeters. For this reason, a network of accurate geodetic control sites within 5 km is a requirement for RTK GPS measurement at sentinel sites (Murdukhayeva 2012). The use of high accuracy RTK GPS data helped minimize the error in estimating inundation risk. Because the error associated with each sentinel site elevation was low, there Table 9.

Many of the sentinel sites had probabilities of inundation of either 0 (very unlikely) or 1 (very likely) when the RTK GPS elevation values for the sentinel sites were used. Murdukhayeva et al. (2012) found that this was not the case with probabilities of inundation calculated using elevations at sentinel sites based on LIDAR data, rather than the more accurate RTK GPS; many probabilities of inundation were in the range of 0.25 to 0.75 (rather than 0 or 1). Using higheraccuracy elevation data for sentinel sites resulted in greater certainty regarding the likelihood of inundation."}, {"section_title": "Variable", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Habitat-Change Modeling", "text": "The SLAMM maps with aggregated land-cover classes can provide useful information for assessing habitat transition under various sea level rise scenarios. In presenting the SLAMM output in maps, however, it is important to recognize the uncertainty of habitat predictions because of uncertainty in input elevation and land cover. The SLAMM model is constrained by the quality of the data driving it (e.g. LIDARderived DEMs). It was not possible to integrate high-accuracy RTK GPS elevations into the model to enhance the results. Another important baseline data set for the SLAMM model is initial land-use classification. In this study, initial land-use conditions were obtained, in part, from National Wetlands Inventory maps created using aerial photography from 1988 (ASIS) and 1993 (CACO). Those maps did not reflect changes during the past two decades. Furthermore, there is no way to quantitatively determine the uncertainty associated with a SLAMM prediction. These factors and others limit the utility of the output results (Kirwan and Guntenspergen, 2009;Scarborough, 2009), particularly for park managers developing mitigation strategies. Higher-resolution elevation data and current land use data sets are becoming more widely available and should address these deficits. For the risk assessment, we were first interested in predicting changes from land to open water (i.e. inundation). The SLAMM results indicated that CACO had one site (1-m scenario) and three sites (2-m scenario) convert to open water, whereas, at ASIS, four sites (1-m scenario) and 12 sites (2-m scenario) are predicted to convert to open water. The bathtub model predicts greater amounts of inundation (Table 6). At CACO, three (1-m scenario) and 11 sites (2-m scenario) have probabilities of inundation .75%, and at ASIS, 11 (1-m scenario) and 32 (2-m scenario) sites have probabilities of inundation .75%. This difference in results supports the argument for bathtub models over estimate inundation (Mcleod et al., 2010;NOAA, 2010), but it may also indicate that SLAMM underestimated inundation. An important finding of our study was that the use of multiple methods provided us a robust range of inundation possibilities across plausible sea level scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Inundation Modeling", "text": "Bathtub modeling is a relatively straightforward technique that can be used with off-the-shelf geospatial data, but the resulting inundation surfaces can be inaccurate (Mcleod et al., 2010;Poulter and Halpin, 2008). Typically, that inaccuracy derives from subtle land barriers that are not discerned in the DEM and can impede inland water flow. Similarly, structures that permit water flow under the topographic surface, such as culverts below roads, can contribute to error in modeled inundation surfaces. Future human modifications of the landscape as adaptation measures to sea level rise are not included in simple bathtub models nor are changes to coastal geophysical processes because of sea level rise, for example breeching of barrier beaches that would significantly change tidal dynamics of lagoon systems behind the barrier (Anthony et al., 2009). By using high-quality LIDAR data for our DEMs and by excluding pixels that were not connected to the coast, our bathtub model results can serve as a preliminary assessment of potential inundation regions in these study areas. One of the most valuable products of this assessment is the range of storm surge heights modeled by SLOSH (Table 4). Those surge heights can be used for predictions of hurricane impacts in the near future. For example, the SLOSH model predicted extensive inundation in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and the salt marsh sites in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The potential damage to a sentinel-site resource under conditions of storm surge inundation varies depending on the nature of the site. Buildings or historical artifacts could face extensive damage, whereas certain habitats or hard infrastructure (roads, geodetic monuments) might not be damaged at all during a brief period of inundation. Therefore, it is important that the NPS evaluate risk for each site and develop mitigation plans accordingly."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Sentinel Sites", "text": "For the most part, Cape Cod's sentinel sites were located inland, on relatively high elevations; 39 of the 63 sentinel sites (62%) had elevations .5 m above the MHHW, and, as a result, many sites are not at risk from sea level rise or storm surge inundation. For example, the base of Highland Lighthouse (Truro, Massachusetts) is located at 39.34 m NAVD88 or 38.41 m above MHHW (Figure 8). Although we understand that inundation modeling does not identify those sites .5 m above the MHHW as at risk, they could face other impacts of changing coastal patterns (erosion, etc.). Several sites that were found to be at risk are very close to current tide levels. For example, one sentinel site at CACO, a culvert near Wellfleet Harbor, was almost submerged at high tide on our survey trip (Figure 8). One polyvinyl chloride (PVC) survey marker in Pleasant Bay and National Geodetic Survey (NGS) monuments at the Provincetown airport are at risk as well. These findings agree closely with the results of the Hammar-Klose et al. (2003) Coastal Vulnerability Index assessment. In their study, 1.5-km segments of shoreline were ranked as being of low to high vulnerability, using an index that combined geological and physical variables. The high-vulnerability sentinel sites, as ranked by the composite Inundation Index we derived from the PCA, tend to appear immediately inland of those shoreline segments with a high CVI vulnerability rank. At Assateague Island, all of the sentinel sites were at low elevations ,2.6 m. Many of them are at risk from sea level rise and storm surge from large hurricanes. The CVI assessment and spatial pattern of the overall Inundation Index at ASIS correspond with each other (Pendleton, Williams, and Thieler, 2004). Disagreement occurs at points near the Chincoteague Inlet, Virginia. The CVI rated that shoreline as low vulnerability because of high accretion rates, and the Inundation Index rated sentinel sites in that area as high vulnerability because of the low elevations. It is inappropriate to compare the frequency of inundation at sentinel sites between the national parks in our study because resource managers at CACO and ASIS chose very different kinds of sites to serve as sentinel sites. The CACO sites consisted of a variety of historical and natural resources, as well as important infrastructure. The ASIS sentinel sites were monumented reference locations at low elevations. If the CACO resource managers had, like those at ASIS, selected only sentinel sites used to monitor sea level rise then those two sets of sentinel sites would have had more comparable landscape placement, and the frequency of inundation could have been quite similar despite the very different geomorphology of the two parks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Directions for Future Work", "text": "This study assessed inundation risk at 97 sentinel sites located in two northeastern U.S. coastal national parks. Rigorous revalidation of the LIDAR-derived data inputs was essential to making appropriate use of the models. The methodology we used can be applied at other coastal parks and can be repeated at the same parks with improved data, alternate scenarios, or additional sentinel sites. We used three different modeling approaches because we were interested in inundation and habitat changes under various sea level rise scenarios as well as inundation from storm surges. Each model provided unique information that served our management needs. Depending on the resource issues and management needs of other coastal sites, all three models may or may not be required. Our choice of models was driven by the goal to make our methods transportable to other coastal settings and implementable using off-the-shelf data. Accurate elevation data, such as that provided by LIDAR technology, are an essential requisite for inundation modeling. These analyses could not be performed with coarse data, such as the NED. All the models suffer from the na\u00efve assumption that coastal geomorphology does not change as sea level rises or storm surge overwashes inland features. As coastal barrier/lagoon systems breach or dune systems wash away, inundation dynamics will change, and those changes are not accounted for in the models we have chosen. Models of sea level rise and storm surge are continually being refined, and inundation probabilities can be recomputed as new models are developed. Scenarios for sea level rise are evolving as new data from satellite altimetry and ice-melt studies are acquired. The U.S. National Weather Service updates SLOSH's storm-surge predictions for regional basins following large hurricane events. The LIDAR data are being acquired for large regions of the United States coast to evaluate sea level rise and storm-surge risk. For example, the USGS recently completed an extensive LIDAR acquisition for coastal counties of the northeast United States. The use of RTK GPS technology to collect accurate elevations at sentinel sites is a promising undertaking that will improve predictions of inundation risk based on different possible scenarios and models. The growing network of stable, permanent, and accurate geodetic control sites to form a backbone of base station locations makes it possible to greatly expand the areas where rapid collection of high-resolution elevation data with RTK GPS are possible (Murdukhayeva et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "POSTSCRIPT", "text": "We visited 11 sentinel sites at ASIS immediately following Hurricane Sandy to determine the accuracy of our inundation modeling. Peak surge was 29 October 2012 at 1730. The Ocean City, Maryland, tide gauge (1.5 km from the closest sentinel site) recorded a surge elevation of 1.4 m NAVD88. We inspected each sentinel site for signs of inundation, such as sand scouring and evidence of wrack. Seven sites were at elevations above 1.4 m, and of those, five (71%) were not inundated. The two that did flood were very close to the surge elevation (1.5 m and 1.7 m). No sentinel sites above 1.9 m were inundated. Four sites were below the surge elevation, and of these, three (75%) were flooded. The site that did not flood was within a meter or two (horizontally) of the wrack line. The mean (6SE) PC1 inundation index score for flooded sentinel sites was 0.59 6 0.48 (n\u00bc 5), and the mean (6SE) PC1 score for sites that did not flood was 2.97 6 0.94 (n \u00bc 6). The flooded sites had a significantly lower inundation index (i.e. higher risk of inundation) than did nonflooded sites (Wilcoxon two-sample test, V \u00bc 26, p \u00bc 0.025)."}]
