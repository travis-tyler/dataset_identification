Numerous prior studies have examined whether antihypertensive treatment may aid preventative efforts, but results have been mixed [4] . There have been no published trials specifically for antihypertensive medications in the prevention of dementia, but there have been several secondary analyses of cognitive measures from trials involving primary cardiovascular outcomes. Although some of these studies have suggested potential benefits of antihypertensive medications in the prevention of dementia [5] , others have found no effect [6] . One complexity involved in these studies is the diversity of available antihypertensive medications, which may work through a number of disparate physiological pathways, and may have pleiotropic effects on systemic and central nervous system pathways involved in neurodegeneration. Another difficulty lies in the fact that most prevention trials do not include biomarker outcomes, but rather rely on clinical outcomes such as progression to dementia or cognitive decline. Thus, the putative mechanism behind any potential preventative effect is typically speculative.\nAngiotensin II AT 1 -receptor blockers (ARBs) may be of particular interest in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as findings from multiple observational studies [7] [8] [9] [10] and experimental trials [11, 12] have suggested that these drugs may prevent or delay cognitive decline to a greater degree than other antihypertensive medicines [13] . Although these clinical associations are promising, the potential mechanism responsible for these observations remains unclear. Animal studies have suggested that AT 1 -receptor blockade may attenuate cognitive impairment by reducing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels [14] [15] [16] , and that angiotensin II may exacerbate age-related changes in A\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) [17, 18] . Furthermore, human autopsy studies have found that antemortem use of ARBs is associated with reduced A\u03b2 and tau pathology in AD patient brains postmortem [19] , and that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are increased in AD patient brains [20] . These studies suggest blockade of angiotensin II production with ACE inhibitors, or signaling with ARBs, may attenuate AD pathophysiology. However, ACE activity can aid in the enzymatic degradation of A\u03b2 [21] , and recent studies have found that lower cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of ACE are associated with increased A\u03b2 retention and brain atrophy [22, 23] . Thus, it has been hypothesized that ARBs may be more beneficial than ACE inhibitors in the prevention of AD by reducing AT 1 -receptor signaling without interfering with ACE-mediated A\u03b2 degradation [24] . To date no studies have investigated CSF biomarkers of A\u03b2 or P-tau in patients taking ARBs versus other antihypertensive medicines.\nThe present study sought to leverage data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study to investigate whether taking ARBs may be associated with attenuation of CSF biomarkers of AD during the prodromal phase of the disease. Our own work and that of others indicates that the vascular contribution to dementia may become increasingly important in advancing age, as very-old adults exhibit greater cerebrovascular pathology at autopsy [25] , and the relationship between markers of vascular aging and markers of Alzheimer's pathophysiology is particularly salient in those with the most advanced age [3, 26] . Finally, recent data indicate that substantial age-related increases in cerebral A\u03b2 retention occur in a cumulative fashion in the general population [27] . Thus, we hypothesized that vascular protective factors, such as use of ARBs, may exert greater effects with aging, potentially stabilizing age-related changes in CSF biomarkers and leading to a cumulative attenuation of AD pathology over time."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Participants were followed with serial clinical assessments at varying intervals for different lengths of time, ranging from 6 to 96 months (mean=28.4). Criteria for MCI and dementia set forth by the ADNI study are described in detail elsewhere [28] . A subset of 124 participants underwent serial LP for evaluation of longitudinal change in CSF biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Procedures", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and genetic biomarkers-All participants underwent lumbar puncture and AD biomarkers were assayed from obtained CSF samples, including amyloid beta (A\u03b2 ) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) [29] . When available, data from multiple assays of a single sample were averaged to provide more robust estimates. Biomarker profiles were determined using previously reported cutoff values for CSF AD biomarkers in ADNI [30] : A\u03b2 1-42 , \u2264 192 pg/mL and P-tau, \u2265 23 pg/mL. All but two participants who were total tau (T-tau) positive were also P-tau positive, so all analyses were limited to P-tau. Samples were available for baseline and both 12 and 24 month follow-up on a participant subset (n=124).\nParticipants also underwent baseline venipuncture. Blood samples were used to determine apolipoprotein E (APOE)-\u03b54 carrier status, and participants were divided into those with versus without one or more copies of the APOE-\u03b54 allele. Those carrying the APOE \u03b52/\u03b54 genotype (n=12) were excluded given the ambiguity associated with the presence of both an allele imparting increased risk (\u03b54) and an allele with a possible protective impact (\u03b52).\nBlood pressure assessment-Seated brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressures were obtained during the sample visit as the lumbar puncture and pulse pressure was calculated as systolic minus diastolic pressure.\nAntihypertensive medications-Medications were reviewed at the time of baseline lumbar puncture and participants were divided into those taking antihypertensive medications versus those who were not. All major classes of antihypertensive medications were evaluated, including ARBs (Table 1) , \u03b1-adrenergic blockers, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, direct vasodilators, and other mechanisms of action. In total over 140 antihypertensive drugs were screened. For all analyses, patients taking ARBs were compared with those taking other antihypertensive medicines (O-antiHTN) or no antihypertensive medicines (No-antiHTN).\nVascular Risk Factors-Participant vascular risk factor burden was determined during clinical interview and physical examination at study entry. For the purposes of the present study, participant medical history data was screened for vascular risk factors up to the date of baseline lumbar puncture using criteria derived from the Framingham profiles for risk of stroke and myocardial infarction [31] . Vascular risk factors included the following: a history of cardiovascular disease (i.e., myocardial infarction, intermittent claudication, angina, heart failure, or other evidence of coronary disease), dyslipidemia (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or hypertriglyceridemia), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, evidence of carotid artery disease, and transient ischemic attack or minor stroke.

For longitudinal analyses, biomarker values were logtransformed due to kurtosis outside of acceptable range (+1 and -1). Raw values were used for cross-sectional analyses due to normalized distribution in this larger data sample. Both controlled and uncontrolled analyses were conducted. For all controlled analyses, covariates were limited to those demonstrated to influence CSF biomarker values in prior studies, including age [32] , BMI [33] , and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status [34] , as well as gender. To investigate group differences and group x time interactions for CSF biomarker values among antihypertensive medication groups over all three time-points, a linear mixed models analysis was conducted with unstructured covariance structure and maximum likelihood estimation. Time was entered as a random effect, and group, group x time, age, BMI, and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status entered as fixed factors. Chi-square analyses examined whether the antihypertensive medication groups differed in the proportion of individuals exhibiting CSF biomarker values that were above or below established thresholds, and to compare across groups the proportion of participants who progressed to dementia over follow-up. Cox regression was used to compare the rate of progression to dementia, after controlling for age, gender, education, APOE4 carrier status, and BMI. All analyses were two-tailed with alpha set at p < .05.\nIn order to investigate whether use of ARBs was associated with an attenuation of agerelated decreases in CSF A\u03b2 in the larger cross-sectional sample, we employed multiple linear regression, ANCOVA with post-hoc least significant difference (LSD) tests, and chisquare analyses. All analyses investigated the relationship between age (continuous for regression analyses; age tertiles for ANCOVA and chi-square) and CSF biomarkers in all three medication groups, after controlling for gender, APOE-\u03b54 carrier status, and BMI. A small subgroup of participants (n=24) in the No-antiHTN group had no known history of hypertension or treatment with antihypertensive medicines but exhibited blood pressure levels consistent with stage II hypertension on baseline exam (systolic > 159 mmHg or diastolic > 99 mmHg).

The longitudinal findings specifically indicated that older adults taking ARBs showed an attenuation of CSF A\u03b2 1-42 reduction and P-tau accumulation over 24 months, relative to those taking other antihypertensive drugs or not taking antihypertensive drugs, potentially suggesting that ARBs may reduce cerebral amyloidosis and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Cross-sectional findings indicated that although age was strongly associated with a reduction in CSF A\u03b2 in individuals taking other antihypertensive medicines or no antihypertensive medicines, there was no relationship between age and CSF A\u03b2 in those taking ARBs. Additionally, participants taking ARBs had higher CSF A\u03b2 1-42 levels than the other groups in the center age tertile (70-75 years) and showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher levels than those taking other antihypertensive medications in the older age tertile (76-91 years). Finally, participants taking ARBs were less likely to progress to dementia relative to those not taking antihypertensive medications, despite the increased vascular risk factor burden and lower educational attainment in the ARBs group. Together these findings could suggest that ARBs may attenuate age-related reduction in CSF A\u03b2, potentially indicating decreased cerebral A\u03b2 retention which may contribute to the reduced cognitive decline observed in patients taking these medications.\nCollectively, these results are consistent with several prior studies suggesting a protective effect of ARBs in Alzheimer's dementia [7, 8, 13] , and animal studies indicating reduced cerebral A\u03b2 deposition in transgenic mice treated with ARBs [14] . The findings are also consistent with neuropathological studies indicating fewer neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in medicated hypertensive patients [35] , particularly those taking ARBs [36] , compared to unmedicated hypertensives or normotensives.\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to account for the apparent protective effect of ARBs, including their role in remodeling of cerebral microvasculature [36] , inducing neural differentiation and DNA repair [37] , reversing oxidative stress and inflammation, and preventing ischemic brain injury [38] . Animal studies have suggested that ARBs may also directly impact A\u03b2 accumulation [14, 16] , which is consistent with the present study findings. Wang and colleagues (2007) investigated 55 antihypertensive medications representing all drug classes in a transgenic mouse model (Tg2576) of AD, and reported that treatment with only one drug, valsartan (an ARB), improved A\u03b2 clearance and disrupted the formation of high-molecular-weight oligomeric peptides [14] . Sample size limitations in the present study precluded examination of the differential influence of specific drugs within the ARBs class of antihypertensives. Future clinical trials assessing the influence of ARBs on change in CSF AD biomarkers with age may further elucidate which specific drugs have the most salient effects on AD pathophysiology.\nMechanistic studies in animals have suggested that ARBs may reduce A\u03b2 levels through changes in enzymatic degradation and modification [16, 39] or increased cellular turnover [19, 39, 40] . The hemodynamic effects of ARBs may also play a role in their relationship with AD biomarkers. We have recently reported that brachial artery pulse pressure is associated with both reduced CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and increased P-tau [3] , an effect that may be related to hemodynamic influences on the perivascular and/or transvascular clearance of A\u03b2 [41, 42] . In the current study, patients taking ARBs exhibited intermediate pulse pressure values that fell between those taking other antihypertensive medications and those in the no treatment group, suggesting that reduced pulse pressure may only partially account for the study findings. Another possibility is that ARBs improved cerebral blood flow. Reduced cerebral blood flow is found in AD patients [30] , where it is associated with regional A\u03b2 deposition [43] . Some studies suggest that taking ARBs may lead to cognitive benefits through improved cerebral blood flow [44, 45] . Future experimental studies may provide greater insight into the mechanisms behind the ARBs-induced attenuation of cerebral A\u03b2 retention.\nThe strengths of the current study include the large sample of participants with CSF biomarkers and longitudinal subgroup analysis. Limitations include the retrospective design and limited information regarding the duration of use of antihypertensive drugs and history of untreated hypertension. Another limitation is that participants were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, as they would be in a randomized clinical trial, but rather were assigned based on medication indications and other uncontrolled factors (e.g., access to healthcare). This creates a potential confound by indication whereby the participants in each medication group differ in meaningful ways beyond their medication regimen, which may account for any observed group differences. Importantly, we may infer that participants taking ARBs or other antihypertensive medicines were put on these drugs to treat hypertension, which is consistent with the observed group differences in blood pressure. We were unable to identify any other clinical or demographic differences between ARBs users and those taking other antihypertensive medications, except for gender and education, which were included as a covariates in all analyses.\nA review of treatment guidelines suggests that older hypertensive patients may be put on ARBs after failure to adequately control blood pressure with first and second line agents (thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers, respectively) [46] , but patients are more frequently started on ACEIs due to greater affordability. Thus, ARBs users may represent a subgroup with more severe hypertension prior to treatment control. As mentioned above, ARBs users exhibited lower educational attainment, which may represent a proxy measure of lower socioeconomic status and greater disease risk. These confounds would seem to increase rather than decrease the risk of cerebral amyloidosis and dementia in this patient subgroup, which is the opposite direction of the observed effects. However, a decline in blood pressure has also been observed prior to the diagnosis of dementia, despite the fact that baseline hypertension is a risk factor for dementia and is associated with cerebral amyloidosis [1, 3] . We conclude that although we cannot rule out the possibility that our findings represent the spurious result of a confound by indication, the expected direction of the confound is remains unclear. Consequently, the present study findings must be interpreted with caution until results are available from randomized controlled trials investigating ARBs in the prevention of cerebral amyloidosis and dementia. There are currently at least two ongoing trials involving the treatment of AD patients with ARBs, and cerebral amyloid retention will be included as outcome measures in these trials. Our findings suggest a small but cumulative effect of ARBs on A\u03b2 retention and progression to dementia, potentially indicating that future trials focusing on early intervention and prevention may be of greatest benefit.\nAnother important limitation of all studies involving the ADNI sample is that this group of participants is comprised of individuals recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada with variable sampling bias and methodology, and inclusion/exclusion criteria that limited cerebrovascular disease. Variability in recruitment methods may result in a heterogeneous participant sample that may not be representative of the general population of older adults treated or untreated for hypertension regardless of antihypertensive medication class. For these reasons, replication of the study findings may be warranted, as the generalizability of these findings could be limited. Finally, variable length of follow-up may limit interpretation of our findings regarding the impact of ARBs treatment on progression to dementia. Despite these limitations, the study findings may have major treatment implications since hypertension is very common in older adults at risk for AD, yet most of the participants in this study were taking other antihypertensive drugs instead of ARBs. The current study findings suggest that greater use of ARBs to treat hypertension in the elderly might reduce the incidence of dementia through attenuation of age-related cerebral amyloid retention. Among those ages 70-75, participants taking ARBs exhibited higher CSF A\u03b2 , with a non-significant trend toward higher levels at ages 76-91 years (A). There were also nonsignificant trends towards fewer A\u03b2 .02"}]
