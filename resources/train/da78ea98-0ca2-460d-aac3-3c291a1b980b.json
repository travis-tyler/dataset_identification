Downstream of island plateaus, such as those at Kerguelen (Blain et al., 2001 (Blain et al., , 2007 , Crozet ice melt (van der Merwe et al., 2011) , glacial runoff (Hawkings et al., 2014; van der Merwe et al., 2015) and melting icebergs (Duprat et al., 2016) . Primary production downstream of subantarctic island systems is typically dominated by diatoms (Smetacek et al., 2004; Qu\u00e9guiner, 2013) , a microphytoplankton group generally considered to promote carbon export out of the mixed layer directly by sinking (Smetacek, 1985; Newton, 1995, 1999) or indirectly by sustaining faecal pellet-productive food webs (Smetacek et al., 2004; Manno et al., 2014) . Maiti et al. (2013) demonstrated an inverse relationship between primary production and export efficiency in the Southern Ocean, contrasting with the positive relationship between primary production and export prevailing in most of the global ocean (Laws et al., 2011) . These so called high biomass, low export regimes (HBLE, Lam and Bishop, 2007; Lam et al., 2011) appear to be characterized by enhanced heterotrophic microbial activity Christaki et al., 2014) and intense reprocessing and fragmentation of particulate matter by zooplankton. On the Kerguelen Plateau for example, net community production (NCP) was estimated to be 6.6 mol m \u00c0 2 yr \u00c0 1 (Jouandet et al., 2008) , although only a small fraction of this NCP was exported out of the mixed layer (Rembauville et al., 2015b) . Annual records of particulate organic carbon (POC) export fluxes derived from moored sediment traps have been published for productive, naturally-fertilized waters downstream of Crozet (Salter et al., 2012) , Kerguelen (Rembauville et al., 2015a,b) and South Georgia (Manno et al., 2015) . Irrespective of depth (300-2000 m), annual POC export from these island systems exhibits low variability and is typically o100 mmol C m \u00c0 2 yr \u00c0 1 . This finding contrasts with the high levels of productivity associated with these naturally fertilized systems. Identifying the dominant export vectors from such systems is therefore necessary to advance our understanding of the mechanistic relationships between production and export in the Southern Ocean. A significant positive relationship between POC fluxes and Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica winter stages highlighted its important role as a carbon export vector from the Crozet bloom (Salter et al., 2012) . Similarly, quantification of diatom and carbon fluxes from the Kerguelen bloom indicated that 60% of annual carbon export was due to short term ( o2 week) export events of Chaetoceros Hyalochaete and Thalassiosira antarctica resting spores (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . Moreover, Salter et al. (2012) and Rembauville et al. (2015a) observed that species-specific diatom ecology (spore formation, protection from grazing through the acquisition of a thick frustule) impacts not only the magnitude of carbon fluxes, but also the Si:C export stoichiometry over annual scales, corroborating previous suggestions (Smetacek, 1985; Smetacek et al., 2004; Salter et al., 2012; Assmy et al., 2013) . Downstream of South Georgia, faecal pellets were reported to dominate ( $ 60%) the second POC export peak often observed in MarchApril (Manno et al., 2015) . However, the contribution of diatoms to bathypelagic POC flux at South Georgia has yet to be addressed.\nThe waters downstream South Georgia exhibit a large and recurrent phytoplankton bloom (Ward et al., 2002; Borrione and Schlitzer, 2013) characterized by interannual variability in the seasonal pattern (unimodal versus bimodal chlorophyll a peaks, Park et al., 2010; Borrione and Schlitzer, 2013) . The bloom is dominated by microplankton diatoms (Korb and Whitehouse, 2004 ) with a major contribution of Fragilariospsis kerguelensis, Chaetoceros Hyalochaete, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica and Corethron (Korb et al., 2008 . The productive waters downstream of South Georgia support a very large biomass of mesozooplankton , macrozooplankton (Atkinson et al., , 2009 , mesopelagic fish (Collins et al., 2012) and top predators (Boyd et al., 1994) , with significant implications for the amount of POC export out of the mixed layer (Huntley et al., 1991) . Upstream of South Georgia, the lack of iron limits phytoplankton growth and phytoplankton biomass is one order of magnitude lower than that is observed downstream of the island (Korb et al., 2008) . Although the contribution of naked dinoflagellates to microplankton biomass is higher than in naturally-fertilized waters, the diatom species Fragilariospsis kerguelensis, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., small Thalassionema nitzschioides and Chaetoceros Hyalochaete species still dominate the microplankton assemblage . Korb et al. (2012) hypothesized that differences in diatom community structure upstream and downstream of South Georgia would impact the magnitude of POC export. However, these hypotheses have yet to be addressed by a detailed analysis of diatom export assemblages and elemental fluxes around South Georgia.\nIn the present study we report diatom and biogeochemical fluxes from two annual sediment trap deployments in varying productivity regimes upstream and downstream of South Georgia. The objectives are (i) to describe spatial and temporal patterns of diatom export assemblages, (ii) to differentiate full and empty frustules to estimate the contribution of specific diatom groups to carbon fluxes and Si:C export stoichiometry and (iii) to compare mixed layer, sediment trap and surface sediment data to describe changes in diatom assemblages as a function of depth."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trap deployments and chemical analyses", "text": "Bottom-tethered moorings were deployed at two sites (P2 and P3) for periods of approximately 12 months between January and November 2012.

Each sediment trap (McLane Parflux conical sediment traps, 0.5 m 2 surface collecting area, McLane Labs, Falmouth, MA, USA) was equipped with 12 sample cups and fitted with a plastic baffle mounted in the opening to prevent the entrance of large organisms. Prior to deployment, the sample cups were filled with a preservative seawater solution of NaCl-buffered HgCl 2 . Traps were deployed at a depth of 1500 m (P2, water depth 3200 m) and 2000 m (P3, water depth 3800 m), and the sample carrousel was programmed to rotate at intervals of 15 days in austral summer and 30 days in austral winter (Table 1) . Sample cups for April, July, October (P2) and August (P3) were missing on recovery (unscrewed from the carrousel). Prior to splitting, \"swimmers\" (i.e. zooplankton organisms that can enter the receiving cups while alive) were carefully removed: samples were first wet-sieved through a 1 mm nylon mesh and the remaining swimmers were hand-picked under a dissecting microscope. Large aggregates, fragments of moults and empty tests retained by the mesh were returned to the sample. Samples were split in replicate fractions using a McLane rotary sample splitter (McLane Labs, Falmouth, MA, USA). Replicate fractions were vacuum-filtered through preweighed and precalcinated (450\u00b0C, 4 h) Whatman GF/ F filters for POC analyses. Salt content was removed from the filters by a short distilled water rinse and they were dried at 60\u00b0C. For POC determination, filters were treated with 2 N H 3 PO 4 and 1 N HCl to dissolve the carbonate fraction. POC was measured by combustion in an elemental analyser (CHN). For biogenic silica (BSi) analyses, replicate fractions were vacuum-filtered through 0.4 mm Nuclepore filters. Prior to BSi extraction, the material was pretreated with 10% H 2 O 2 and 1 N HCl to remove organic particle coatings (Mortlock and Froelich, 1989) . BSi was determined by a time-series extraction experiment in a 0.5 M NaOH solution at 85\u00b0C for 5 h (DeMaster, 1981 ). An aliquot of each sample was taken for silicic acid analysis every hour and the BSi content was estimated from the intercept of the extraction time-series (DeMaster, 1981) ."}, {"section_title": "Remote sensing and derived oceanographic variables", "text": "Satellite-derived surface chlorophyll a concentration (MODIS Aqua, 4 km, 8-days composite, level 3 product) for the sediment trap deployment period was accessed at http://oceancolor.gsfc. nasa.gov/cms/.

"}, {"section_title": "Diatom enumeration, identification and biomass", "text": "Diatom enumeration and identification was performed using a biological counting technique that does not include any chemical treatment before counting (Salter et al., 2012) and thereby allows the separate enumeration of full and empty cells (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . A 1/8 aliquot of each sample was gently homogenized and 2 mL withdrawn and diluted in a final volume of 20 mL of artificial seawater (salinity \u00bc 34 PSU). A modified pipette tip with a large aperture was used to avoid breakage of larger species such as Thalassiothrix antarctica. The diluted sample was placed in a Sedgewick-Rafter counting chamber (Pyser-SGI S52, 1 mL volume). One quarter to one half of the chamber (depending on diatom abundance) was observed with an inverted microscope with phase contrast (Olympus IX70) at 400 \u00c2 magnification.\nDiatoms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level following Hasle and Syvertsen (1997) . The relatively low magnification imposed by the counting technique and presence of organic material occasionally obscuring the valve face limited species-level identification for some taxa. Consequently certain species were classified as follows: Fragilariopsis separanda and Fragilariopsis rhombica were grouped as Fragilariopsis separanda/rhombica; all the Pseudo-nitzschia species (mainly Pseudo-nitzschia lineola and Pseudo-nitzschia heimii) were grouped as Pseudo-nitzschia spp.; the genera Haslea and Pleurosigma were grouped as Pleurosigma; species of the genera Banquisia and Manguinea and Membraneis challengeri and Membraneis imposter were grouped as Membraneis. Unidentifiable centric species o 20 mm and large centric species were denominated as Small centric (o20 mm) and Large centric (4 20 mm), respectively. This arbitrary size classification was chosen to differentiate small centric species, typically attributable to the Thalassiosira genus, from genera such as Azpeitia and Actinocyclus comprising the large centric species. All of the whole, intact and recognizable frustules were counted ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). For each sample, 4 300 cells were counted, except in sample cups #1, 2, 7 and 8 from the less productive site P2 where only $ 100 cells were counted. Full and empty cells were enumerated separately (e.g. Assmy et al., 2013; Rembauville et al., 2015a) . We considered cells as full when plasts were clearly visible and intact ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The empty:full export ratio of a given species was defined as the ratio of empty cells to full cells following integration over the complete sediment trap record. Although broken frustules and debris were present (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), they were not enumerated in the samples. We estimate that the relative abundance of broken frustules is o 15%. Diatom export assemblages were compared between the two sites using Shannon's diversity index (\n, where n is the total number of species and p i the proportion of individuals of species i) and Pielou's evenness index ( \u2032 = \u2032 \u2032 J H H / max , where H\u2032 max is the maximal possible value of H', equal to ln (n)). Both indexes were calculated on total (empty and full) cell numbers following integration over the complete sediment trap record.\nFull diatom fluxes were converted to carbon fluxes using previously published species-specific biomass values for diatoms in the vicinity of the Kerguelen Plateau (Cornet-Barthaux et al., 2007) which were considered as a good analogue for South Georgia diatom populations. For species not listed in Cornet-Barthaux et al. (2007) , 10 representative individuals of each species were measured and biovolume was calculated following Hillebrand et al. (1999) . Carbon content was then calculated using the MendenDeuer and Lessard (2000) equation for diatoms (C \u00bc0.288 \u00c2 V 0.811 ).\nFor Chaetoceros Hyalochaete resting spores (CRS) and Thalassiosira antarctica resting spores (TRS), 100 randomly selected individuals were measured. Biovolume was calculated and carbon content was estimated using the Kuwata et al. (1993) carbon:volume relationship for CRS and the Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000) formulation for TRS. The mean carbon content ( 7 standard deviation) was 2407101 pgC cell \u00c0 1 and 1018 7460 pgC cell \u00c0 1 for CRS and TRS, respectively. The list of diatom species and the corresponding carbon content is reported in Table 3 .\nTo describe the change in diatom assemblage with depth, we compared the annual sediment trap record from P3 with mixed layer diatom assemblage from multiple summer surveys (February 2002 , 2003 and January 2005 at the P3 trap location (Korb et al., 2008) and surface sediment diatom assemblage from a core located very close to the trap (42\u00b009.2\u2032S-41\u00b010.7\u2032W, 3760 m, Allen et al., 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Biogeochemical fluxes", "text": "was observed in February, associated with the highest SST in summer (3.5\u00b0C, Fig. 2a ).

During winter total diatom fluxes were o1 \u00c2 10 6 cell m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 . Diatom fluxes in spring (November) were characterized by Fragilariopsis kerguelensis (39% of total cells), Fragilariopsis separanda/rhombica (50%), Thalassiosira lentiginosa (12%), Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (10%) and Dactyliosolen antarcticus (2%). Summer fluxes contained mainly F. kerguelensis (41% of total cells), Thalassionema nitzschioides (16%),\nand Thalassiosira gracilis (7%, Fig. 3b-h ). When integrated over the deployment period, empty diatoms constituted 91.1% of the total diatom flux at P2 (Table 2 ). F. kerguelensis dominated ( 440%) the empty, full and total diatom export assemblage (Table 3) . Almost all species were preferentially exported as empty cells (empty:full ratio 4 1) with the exception of Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica and Navicula sp. that exhibited empty:full ratios close to 1 (Table 3) . At P3, total diatom flux displayed highest values in spring (November) and summer (January). The highest flux of 6 \u00c2 10 7 cell m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 observed at the end of January was one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding maxima at P2 (Fig. 4) . In spring, the total cell flux of 8 \u00c2 10 6 cell m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 was close to that observed at P2 during the same period. Diatom fluxes were dominated by full cells of CRS, mainly exported during one short event in mid January (3.8 \u00c2 10 7 cell m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 , Fig. 4b ). CRS accounted for 42.7% of the total diatom export integrated over the complete record at P3 (Table 3) . Concomitant to the significant flux of CRS in January (63% of total cells in this sample), a noticeable export peak of Eucampia antarctica (3%), Navicula sp. (3%) and TRS (1%) was also observed ( Fig. 4b , f, g, and l). However, their relative contribution to annual diatom export was much lower ( o 3%). Some species were observed in both spring and summer such as F. kerguelensis, T. nitzschioides, F. separanda/rhombica, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., T. gracilis, and T. lentiginosa (Fig. 4c, d , e, i, j and k). Conversely, other species were observed primarily in summer such as CRS, E. antarctica var. antarctica, Navicula sp. and TRS (Fig. 4b , f, g, and l).\nAt P3 approximately half (51.5%) of the diatoms were exported as empty cells when integrated over the deployment period, lower than the corresponding value at P2 (91%). The diatom assemblage of full cells at P3 was dominated by CRS (87.9%, Table 3 ). Empty cells were mostly represented by F. kerguelensis (55.6%), followed by T. nitzschioides (15.9%) and F. separanda/rhombica (5%) ( Table 3) .

Between the mixed layer and the sediment trap depth (2000 m) there are notable decreases in the contribution of Pseudo-nitzschia (20-2%), Thalassiothrix antarctica (10-1%) and E. antarctica (8-2.5%). Conversely, F. kerguelensis relative abundance is similar between the mixed layer and the sediment trap depth (30%), while the contribution of C. Hyalochaete increases (11-42%) and is present as resting spores in the trap samples. In surface sediments (Allen et al., 2005) , CRS represents 80% of the diatom assemblage, followed by F. kerguelensis (10%) and TRS (3%). Fig. 4 . Diatom fluxes at P3.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Table 2 ). The missing samples are from a period of low background flux with no notable surface chlorophyll a features (Fig. 2) . Consequently we decided not to include the linear interpolation of missing samples and present integrated fluxes of chemical and biological constituents as a conservative approximation of annual flux. At P3, the sediment trap deployment location is positioned in the center of a cyclonic circulation feature originating from the northern South Georgia shelf (Meredith et al., 2003) . The area downstream of South Georgia is fertilized by continuous benthic iron supply from the South Georgia shelf system, resulting in higher dissolved iron concentration when compared to the waters upstream of the island (0.3 nM versus o0.05 nM in spring, Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012) . This natural iron fertilization mechanism has been suggested to support the large and recurrent phytoplankton blooms observed downstream of South Georgia (Fig. 1 , Ward et al., 2002; Borrione and Schlitzer, 2013) . The regional differences we report in deep-ocean POC fluxes at P2 and P3 are therefore consistent with the varying levels of chlorophyll a biomass observed around South Georgia resulting from differences in iron supply.\nDeep-ocean POC fluxes at the productive P3 site lag the strong surface chlorophyll a peak (6 mg L \u00c0 1 ) by one month and exhibit no notable peaks in the time preceding surface biomass maxima. Time lags of 1-2 month between production and export have been observed previously in the Southern Ocean (Honjo et al., 2000; Buesseler et al., 2001; Rigual-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015a,b) . During a shallow sediment trap deployment (289 m) over the central Kerguelen Plateau (Rembauville et al., 2015b) , CRS also dominated carbon export and was exported one month after the surface chlorophyll a peak, a pattern very similar to what we observe at P3 despite a much deeper sediment trap depth (2000 m). Highest BSi: POC ratio was observed in spring (September/October) at both sites. Very similar patterns in export stoichiometry have been observed in other naturally fertilized area of the Southern Ocean and were attributed to changes in the diatom community structure across the season (Rembauville et al., 2015a; Salter et al., 2012) . There are no comparable peaks in either surface biomass (o2 mg L \u00c0 1 throughout the year) or deep ocean POC flux at station P2 upstream of South Georgia. Despite strong differences in surface phytoplankton biomass, primarily mediated by iron supply (Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012; Borrione and Schlitzer, 2013) , the amount of POC reaching the deep-ocean differs by a factor of o2 between the two sites. This is consistent with a scenario of enhanced carbon remineralization downstream of South Georgia (Cavan et al., 2015; Le Moigne et al., 2016) . The annual POC fluxes observed at South Georgia are remarkably similar (o100 mmol m \u00c0 2 yr \u00c0 1 ) to those measured at other naturally iron-fertilized sites in the Southern Ocean (Salter et al., 2012; Rembauville et al., 2015b) . at 1031 m, Honjo et al., 2000) . The homogeneity of the deep ocean POC fluxes, despite contrasted surface primary production, highlights the inverse relationship between primary production and export efficiency in the Southern Ocean (Maiti et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Seasonality of diatom fluxes", "text": "The majority of studies examining diatom export fluxes in the Southern Ocean have used a micropaleontological technique, originally developed for sediment samples (Funkhouser and Evitt, 1959) . To remove organic and detrital material the micropaleontological technique includes a chemical oxidation step to \"clean\" and isolate the diatom frustules. This treatment separates all frustules into single valves and may selectively damage and dissolve the frustules of certain species. Furthermore, the micropaleontological technique generally considers broken frustules (Schrader and Gersonde, 1978) . In the present study a direct observation of samples was favoured to meet the objective of distinguishing full and empty frustules (e.g. Armand et al., 2008; Assmy et al., 2013; Rembauville et al., 2015a) in order to calculate the relative contribution of different diatom species to total POC flux. The two techniques are likely to give slightly different results (Abrantes et al., 2005; Rembauville et al., 2015a) and therefore the comparison of diatom flux data between studies must take into account these different analytical approaches.\nDespite the methodological considerations described above, a comparison of diatom export fluxes from different oceanographic zones reveals quite consistent patterns. The highest total diatom flux at P2 equals 1. . Despite the high primary production levels at these naturallyfertilized sites (P3 and A3), diatom valve fluxes remain lower than those reported in the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ) with fluxes of $ 10 9 valves m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 (Suzuki et al., 2001; Pilskaln et al., 2004) .\nThese massive diatom export fluxes in the SIZ are attributed to changes in light availability and melt waters input during sea ice retreat that favors production and export of POC by diatoms (Smith and Nelson, 1986; Annett et al., 2009; Romero and Armand, 2010) . In addition to iron supply, silicic acid availability also plays an important role in diatom productivity (Mengelt et al., 2001; Poulton et al., 2007) . Lower diatom fluxes of 2.5 \u00c2 10 7 valves m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 were observed (Salter et al., 2012) in the iron-fertilized productive waters downstream of Crozet (Polar Frontal Zone, PFZ) and may be explained by the lower silicic acid concentration and higher temperature north of the Polar Front (Pondaven et al., 2000; Whitehouse et al., 2012) . The similarity of diatom export assemblages observed in sediment traps is in stark contrast with the observed differences in surface waters assemblages. In the surface lightly silicified species (e.g. Chaetoceros Hyalochaete, Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) are dominant upstream of South Georgia, compared to more robust and highly silicified species (Corethron pennatum, Thalassiothrix antarctica, Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica) downstream . In the sediment traps, with the notable exception of resting spores and neritic species (Chaetoceros Hyalochaete, E. antarctica var. antarctica and Navicula sp.), the diatom species export assemblage is comparable at both sites. The slightly lower evenness at P3 (Table 2 ) reflects the dominant contribution of CRS to the total diatom flux. Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Thalassiosira gracilis, Thalassiosira lentiginosa and Thalassionema nitzschioides are abundant at both sites (Table 3 ). All of these species (with the exception of Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) are considered to have robust and highly silicified frustules. Preferential grazing pressure on lightly-silicified species in the upper ocean (e.g. Smetacek et al., 2004; Assmy et al., 2013) and mesopelagic BSi dissolution (Nelson et al., 1995; Ragueneau et al., 2000 Ragueneau et al., , 2006 may explain the dominance of highly-silicified species to bathypelagic diatom flux assemblages. Additionally, horizontal advection could homogenize variability in the surface signal (Siegel and Deuser, 1997; van Sebille et al., 2015) . The absence of Chaetoceros Hyalochaete vegetative stages from the sediment trap record at both sites despite its presence in the mixed layer in summer (Korb et al., , 2008 could be explained by the preferential dissolution of the weakly silicified vegetative frustules and/or conversion into resting spore below the mixed layer at P3 (Rynearson et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Si:C export stoichiometry", "text": "It has been suggested previously that diatom species-specific sensitivity to grazing pressure and the presence of certain life cycle stages can impact the Si:C export stoichiometry through the differential export of full or empty cells (Smetacek et al., 2004; Salter et al., 2012; Assmy et al., 2013) . In the South Georgia trap samples resting spores were almost exclusively exported as full cells. Culture experiments suggest CRS are poorly grazed by copepods, and may even lower the grazing rate (Kuwata and Tsuda, 2005) , potentially contributing to their export from the mixed layer as full cells. Navicula sp., E. antarctica var. antarctica and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were exported with relatively low empty:full of o5, in good agreement with previous findings from the Kerguelen Plateau (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . These species were also associated with highest POC fluxes in the PFZ in the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean (Rigual-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015a,b) , highlighting their potential role in carbon export.\nWith the exception of the resting spore export event at the end of summer, the dominance of empty F. kerguelensis in spring, autumn and winter at South Georgia and Kerguelen confirms its key role in the silicon pump (Smetacek et al., 2004; Salter et al., 2012; Assmy et al., 2013) . The seasonal evolution of the BSi:POC ratio is similar at P2 and P3 (except in summer) and reflects comparable diatom community composition. However, the lower BSi:POC ratio in summer at P3 can be attributed to the sinking of carbon-rich diatom resting spores containing neutral lipids (Doucette and Fryxell, 1983; Kuwata et al., 1993) . These findings support an emerging view (Salter et al., 2012; Rembauville et al., 2015a) that the flux of carbon rich resting spores/stages are of particular importance in setting the Si:C export stoichiometry characterizing naturally-fertilized island systems in the Southern Ocean.\nCertain species that were preferentially exported as full cells at 289 m at Kerguelen were only found as empty cells at both P2 and P3 sites (Thalassiothrix antarctica, Chaetoceros dichaeta and Proboscia inermis). These species are either very large (T. antarctica, P. inermis), or exhibit spiny setae (C. dichaeta), which are thought to confer some protection from grazing (Smetacek et al., 2004) . Other processes such as microbial degradation of the cellular content during sinking (Grossart and Ploug, 2001; Twining et al., 2014) might contribute to the high empty:full ratio observed for these species in deeper samples. Alternatively, the more abundant krill population at South Georgia , which is able to feed on larger phytoplankton species (Gran\u013ai et al., 1993) , might explain the higher empty:full ratio observed for these species when compared to Kerguelen. These findings suggest that differences in upper trophic level ecosystem structure modulate the role a particular diatom species plays in carbon and BSi flux, limiting species-level generalizations between regions."}, {"section_title": "Resting spore formation and carbon transfer to the seafloor", "text": "Resting spores comprising bathypelagic (4 1500 m) flux around South Georgia were present almost entirely as full cells and accounted for 41.7% of the annual POC flux. Similar observations were made at 289 m over the Kerguelen Plateau (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . These findings suggest that their importance as a POC vector persists throughout the water column. To examine changes in the occurrence of CRS as a function of depth upstream of South Georgia we combined our sediment trap dataset with mixed layer (Korb et al., 2008) and sediment (Allen et al., 2005) assemblage data (Fig. 5) . We make these comparisons cautiously for several reasons: (i) mixed layer data are from January and February, averaged over three years (Korb et al., 2008) , and are unlikely to represent seasonal integrals of diatom communities, (ii) surface sediments integrate over several years, averaging any inter-annual variability, and (iii) different diatom counting techniques were used. Given the considerations described above these data comparisons should be considered only as a semi-quantitative analysis of the relative importance of CRS at different depth horizons. There is a significant increase in the proportion of Chaetoceros Hyalochaete from the mixed layer to sediment (10-80%). Chaetoceros Hyalochaete species were only observed as vegetative stages in the mixed layer and resting spores below 1500 m. This could be due to either (i) resting spore formation had not occurred at the time of the sampling in the Korb et al. (2008 Korb et al. ( , 2010 ) studies or (ii) resting spore formation occurs below the mixed layer (e.g. Rynearson et al., 2013) . The increase in CRS through the mesopelagic and into the sediments supports a scenario whereby they become increasingly important vectors of carbon through selective preservation of their robust frustules.\nConsidering the significance of resting spores as a deep-ocean carbon vector upstream of South Georgia, it is of interest to assess the factors triggering spore formation. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated the role of macronutrient and trace metal limitation for resting spore formation in diatoms in laboratory experiments (Garrison, 1981; Sanders and Cibik, 1985; Kuwata et al., 1993; Oku and Kamatani, 1997, Sugie et al., 2010) . Chaetoceros Hyalochaete vegetative stages were observed in the summer upstream and downstream of South Georgia (Korb et al., , 2008 , although only present in export assemblages downstream. A difference in nutrient utilization at the two sites could explain the difference level of resting spore formation. It is generally reported that nitrogen limitation is the most important factor driving resting spore formation (McQuoid and Hobson, 1996, Sugie et al., 2008) , although these observations were only made for low latitude diatom populations where nitrate is seasonally depleted. In the Southern Ocean, and more specifically south of the Polar Front, nitrate concentration is always 420 mmol L \u00c0 1 in summer, even in very productive areas (Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012; Whitehouse et al., 2012; Blain et al., 2015) . It therefore seems unlikely that nitrate limitation can explain the regional differences in resting spore formation. Downstream of South Georgia, silicic acid drawdown over the summer ranges between 20 and 35 mmol L \u00c0 1 and summer mixed layer values are o5 mmol L \u00c0 1 (Whitehouse et al., 2000; Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012; Whitehouse et al., 2012; Borrione and Schlitzer, 2013) . In contrast, upstream of South Georgia mixed layer concentrations remain at $ 20 mmol L \u00c0 1 upstream (Korb et al., 2008; Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012) at 1000 m) (Nielsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012) suggesting a scenario whereby a formerly iron-replete community moves into limitation. The limitation by silicic acid and iron in summer has already been observed in two other naturally-fertilized systems of the Southern Ocean where resting spore formation is an important process for the export of carbon out of the mixed layer: the Crozet Plateau (Salter et al., 2012) and the Kerguelen Plateau (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . These data suggest that iron and/or silicic acid limitation in summer might trigger resting spore formation in high latitude diatoms species, although this hypothesis requires further investigations."}, {"section_title": "Possible limitations of the present dataset", "text": "Partitioning carbon export across diatom species vectors is dependent on carbon:volume relationships (e.g. Rynearson et al., 2013) , which can exhibit variability among species (MendenDeuer and Lessard, 2000) and life cycle stages (Kuwata et al., 1993) . In the present study we tried to minimize this artifact by using species-specific relationships and where necessary distinct values for vegetative and resting stages (for Chaetoceros Hyalochaete and Thalassiosira antarctica). The variability of the biovolume among individuals of a given species and the uncertainty on the carbon:volume relationship result in a coefficient of variation for resting spore carbon content of 40%. This certainly affects the precision of our estimates. However, it is unlikely to alter our main conclusion that Chaetoceros Hyalochaete resting spores contribute to a significant fraction of bathypelagic carbon fluxes downstream of South Georgia.\nThe calculated diatom contribution to carbon export accounts for o50% of the measured carbon flux at P3 and only 2% at P2. This indicates that flux vectors not quantified here contribute significantly to carbon export at both sites. Faecal pellets (Manno et al., 2015) and/or other plankton groups (e.g. radiolarians Lampitt et al., 2009 ) are likely to be important components of carbon flux budgets. Nevertheless, we outline that the export of diatom spores makes a significant contribution to POC export at P3. At this same site, annual POC export in 2010 was $ 100 mmol m \u00c0 2 y \u00c0 1 (Manno et al., 2015) , approximately two times higher than what we report for the 2012. This highlight the need to address inter annual variability of deep ocean POC fluxes (e.g. Salter et al., 2010; Nodder et al., 2016) before robust conclusions can be drawn about a particular system. We associate the BSi:POC ratio with diatom community composition and empty:full cell ratio based on co-occurrence patterns. An accurate partitioning of biogenic silica fluxes amongst diatom species would require knowledge of the BSi content per frustule for different species and these data are currently unavailable (Jungandreas et al., 2012) . Additionally, broken frustules and debris, as well as other siliceous plankton (radiolarian, silicoflagellates) were not quantified here and certainly contribute to BSi fluxes (Supplementary Figure 1) . However, despite the technical difficulties, partitioning elemental fluxes across species vectors (e.g. Salter et al., 2014; Rembauville et al. 2016 ) is an important endeavor for establishing the links between biological diversity and biogeochemical fluxes. However, despite the technical difficulties, partitioning elemental fluxes across species vectors (e.g. Salter et al., 2014; Rembauville et al., 2016) is an important endeavor for establishing the links between biological diversity and biogeochemical fluxes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Diatom export fluxes over a complete seasonal cycle are now available from the three major naturally iron-fertilized Southern Ocean island systems: South Georgia (this study), Crozet (Salter et al., 2012) and Kerguelen (Rembauville et al., 2015a) . Despite strong regional differences in bloom dynamics and sediment trap deployment depths (289-3160 m), annual POC export is of the same order of magnitude at each site (40-100 mmol m \u00c0 2 d \u00c0 1 ). A similar mechanism of diatom resting spore formation and subsequent export to depth is observed at all three sites. In the naturally fertilized sites of South Georgia and Kerguelen, partitioning carbon fluxes across diatom species indicates that 40-60% of annual POC export beneath the mixed layer can be attributed to resting spore-driven export. Furthermore, consistent seasonal patterns of diatom export assemblages emerge from the comparison of these systems that appear to exert significant control on Si: C export stoichiometry. Silicon-rich fluxes consisting of empty Fragilariopsis species (\"silica sinkers\") are observed throughout the year with highest relative abundance in winter and spring. Conversely, carbon-rich fluxes are observed in summer and contain resting spores and other species exported with a high proportion of full cells such as Eucampia antarctica var. antarctica, and Navicula sp. (\"carbon sinkers\"). The selective preservation of the robust resting spore frustules as a function of depth highlights the increasing importance of resting spores as carbon vector into the bathypelagic ocean and ultimately the sediments. They may thus play a critical role in sequestering atmospheric CO 2 from these naturally iron fertilized systems over climatically relevant timescales. The exact environmental triggers for resting spore formation, and their subsequent export to depth, requires further investigation."}]
