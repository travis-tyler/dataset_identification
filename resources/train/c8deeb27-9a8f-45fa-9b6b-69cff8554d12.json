The upper reaches of the watershed extend into Delaware, while the river fl ows west through Maryland and into the Chesapeake Bay.

The area is notable for its extensive and important marine natural resources, including oyster bars, fi sh spawning and recruitment areas, and abundant blue crabs. On land, the Choptank watershed is dominated by agricultural uses, but also features important \"working waterfront\" areas and expanding urban and suburban development. The population centers are Easton, Cambridge, and Denton, Maryland. The Choptank watershed was selected by NOAA as a Habitat Focus Area (HFA) for the Habitat Blueprint Program. As such, NOAA plans an integrated set of activities combining resources from multiple programs to leverage the full weight of its eff orts (Figure 1.2).

This understanding can aid in assessing the impacts caused by these changes, helping coastal resource managers make more informed decisions.\nThe shoreline addressed here can be identifi ed as the place where the land meets the Chesapeake Bay within the Choptank watershed. Here, we address the shoreline of the Choptank River and Little Choptank River from the Chesapeake Bay to the upper reaches of tidal infl uence. The shoreline described here will address the tidal and estuarine portions of the watershed. In natural systems, the shoreline is typically a dynamic place, both in terms of coastal geomorphology as well as biological and ecological patterns. Natural shorelines provide a diversity of habitat which serves multiple ecological functions. Natural shorelines provide habitat for many species, particularly juvenile fi shes, invertebrates, and shorebirds. Man-made shorelines typically support a diff erent assemblage of species than those found in natural conditions. Natural shoreline also provides physical services, such as reducing wave energy and erosion. Furthermore, natural coastal ecosystems can provide fi ltration services, such as reducing nutrient and contaminant inputs to near-shore habitats. Many species components and ecosystem habitats can be aff ected by shoreline condition. Man-made or hardened shorelines can alter habitats and species distributions as well as reduce the dynamic nature of the geomorphology. Typical natural shoreline components include wetlands, beaches, and vegetated banks. The shoreline of the watershed is dominated by salt and brackish water marshes. Typical man-made shoreline components include riprap, bulkheads, groin fi elds and marinas, with riprap being the most common in the watershed. There are many research groups investigating shoreline condition and its eff ects on biology and ecology. These groups include federal agencies, state agencies, academic programs and non-profi ts. A group of researchers led by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and sponsored by the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science have recently completed a fi ve year (2010-2015) investigation into the eff ects of shoreline change on ecology and biology for Mid-Atlantic coastal ecosystems, including the Chesapeake Bay. Here we report on the most recent information on the shoreline composition for the Choptank watershed.  \nSubmerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is an important component of many estuarine ecosystems, including the Choptank River. These underwater grasses grow in shallow waters and provide crucial protective habitat for juvenile blue crabs and fi nfi sh, as well as food for waterfowl. The presence of SAV helps improve water quality by improving bottom sediment stability, absorbing wave energy, uptake of nutrients, and producing dissolved oxygen (Virginia Institute of Marine Science, 2016b).\nThe Choptank River complex includes important spawning and juvenile habitat for numerous anadromous fi sh species, including striped bass (Morone saxatilis), river herring (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), and hickory shad (Alosa mediocris), as well as resident fi sh such as white perch (Morone Americana) and forage fi sh such as bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) and Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). In turn, these fi sh support ecological and economic services to the community. One of the goals of the Habitat Focus Area (HFA) designation is to achieve \"sustainable and abundant fi sh populations\" (NOAA, 2015). Knowledge of the current status of habitat distribution, monitoring programs, and fi sh population levels is crucial to inform management decisions and prioritize future research eff orts. The objective of this chapter is to describe the available datasets and spatial layers related to fi sh in the Choptank River complex, spatial patterns, and temporal trends.\nThe eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) has long been a key component of the Choptank estuarine ecosystem, and has contributed to the local and regional economy. Oysters provide reef habitat where other species aggregate, as well as a food source for estuarine fi shes and invertebrates. They have been harvested fi rst by Native Americans, and from the Colonial 1600s up to the present day. At the scale of an individual organism, oysters play a role in linking pelagic and benthic food webs by making available a portion of the organic material they fi lter as dense, mucus-bound deposits, which are consumed by other species (Newell, 1988). At the population and ecosystem scale, oysters can play a \"bottom-up\" role in mitigating the adverse eff ects of estuarine eutrophication by fi ltering organic and inorganic particles and limiting turbidity and phytoplankton blooms. This can enable greater light penetration through the water column, and benefi t other components of the estuarine ecosystem, such as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (Kennedy, 1991), which provides valuable habitat for fi sh, crabs, and other species. At the same time, oysters can be adversely impacted by the secondary eff ects of eutrophication, such as hypoxia. Therefore, the relationship between oyster populations and water quality is complex and depensatory: healthy oyster populations can provide a net benefi t to water quality, but are adversely aff ected by poor water quality. Chesapeake Bay oyster populations are a small fraction (often cited as 1%) of historic levels throughout the greater Chesapeake Region. Based on landings data, since 2013 oyster harvest has increased to approximately 2.5% of historic levels. Even still, at current population levels oysters no longer provide the level of ecosystem services that they once did. The historic decline of oyster populations in the Choptank HFA parallels that in the greater Chesapeake, and has been attributed to many factors, including overharvest, pollution and sedimentation, altered hydrology and salinity, habitat loss, and oyster diseases, such as Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) and MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni). These trends are not unique to the Chesapeake, but have been observed in many other estuarine ecosystems over a parallel time period ( u Ermgassen et al., 2012)."}, {"section_title": "DATA SOURCES AND METHODS", "text": "The land cover data used in this report (Figure 2.1) is produced as part of NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). C-CAP is a nationally standardized, raster-based data set that covers coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands for the coastal U.S. Data are derived from the analysis of remotely sensed Landsat imagery. This analysis includes analyzing each 30x30 meter Landsat imagery pixel, and classifying the entire pixel as a particular standardized land cover type (i.e. cultivated crop, high intensity developed, estuarine emergent wetland, etc.). It is important to note that land cover does not necessarily equate to land use; some categories such as evergreen forest can be diffi cult to determine whether they are natural or anthropogenic occurrences based on C-CAP data alone. There are two types of fi les available from the C-CAP program: individual dates of land cover that supply a wall-to-wall map for each area, and change fi les that compare one date to another in order to highlight what type of land cover change occurred between those dates. For more information about the C-CAP, and to access the data visit: coast.noaa.gov/dataregistry/search/collection/info/ccapregional C-CAP fi les for the eastern United States are available for 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2010. These fi les were obtained and then clipped to the Choptank River sub-basin watersheds (12 Digit Watershed Boundary Dataset). The Watershed Boundary Dataset was obtained through the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service Geospatial Data Gateway: https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov. For each sub-basin, land cover cell counts were calculated in square kilometers. The impervious surface data (2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness) was obtained from the Multi Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) and is available at http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_data. php. This data comes as 30x30 meter pixel cell counts. Each cell in the data set has an impervious value, which is the percentage of the cell that contains impervious surface. All cells for each impervious value (e.g. 0, .01, .02, \u2026 1) were multiplied by the area (900 m 2 ), and then summed to determine the total square kilometers of impervious surface for a sub-basin. Some pervious land covers, such as turf grasses, behave similarly to impervious surfaces, but are not counted as impervious surface in this data set.  \nThere are two important datasets which describe the shoreline conditions of the Choptank watershed. The fi rst is the Digital Shoreline Situation Report (SSR), which was produced by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), Comprehensive Coastal Inventory Program (CCI) in 2005(Berman et. al., 2005. The shoreline base-map used for this eff ort was developed by using photo-interpretation techniques applied to digital orthogonal quarter quadrangle aerial photographs. Shoreline structures were identifi ed by fi eld survey from small boats and GPS location tracking. The SSR is collected for the shorelines of Chesapeake Bay. The SSR identifi es 1,227 kilometers of shoreline for the Choptank River. Man-made structures compose 318 km or 26% of this area. Details are provided in The second important data source we analyzed for the Choptank watershed is the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) which is produced by NOAA's Offi ce of Response and Restoration (NOAA OR&R, 2007). The ESI assesses and ranks shorelines for sensitivity to oil spills and other hazards. It is produced through photo image interpretation, but does not feature an in-situ survey component. ESI is a national program which is updated periodically on a regional basis. The Chesapeake Bay region is currently being updated.  \nSAV distribution in the Choptank River is currently measured on a yearly basis by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) SAV mapping program. This program uses a consistent aerial photography methodology to assess the extent of SAV growth throughout the Chesapeake Bay at a scale of 1:24,000. The imagery is scanned, analyzed, and processed to create vector digital data from which GIS programs can calculate areal extents of SAV beds (Orth et al., 2015). In addition to aerial cover, VIMS also estimates the density of each SAV bed. VIMS has also analyzed the available historic aerial imagery for the Chesapeake Bay. For the Choptank, the fi rst year a complete aerial survey record was available is from 1978. After that, VIMS was able to produce yearly aerial survey data available starting from 1984 through 2014. Prior to 1978, all available data on SAV coverage is from ground sampling surveys conducted at varying intervals and sampling scales by various researchers as far back as the 1930s (Orth et al., 2015).

Good water quality is essential for healthy habitats and important for biodiversity, recreational use, aquaculture, and human health. Excess nutrients and sediment loads may degrade the water quality of the river. For example, these loads can stimulate algal blooms, reduce dissolved oxygen, block sunlight and increase the possibility of a hypoxic event, all of which threaten healthy aquatic fauna and fl ora in the river. Accordingly, monitoring and assessment of water quality is very important to ensure sustainable use of the Choptank River. We focus here on the long term monitoring  for the Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Segments of the Choptank River (Figure 4.1), for nutrients and sediment loads, and chemical and physical parameters. These parameters (DO, TN, TP, CHLA, TSS, Secchi disk depth, salinity and temperature) have been used traditionally as indicators of the impact of anthropogenic activities on water quality (Mason et al., 2011). Additionally, we assessed the present situation of the water quality of the Choptank River. This was done by comparing the results of these parameters with the established and published threshold values for the Chesapeake Bay. Although the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) is the main authority responsible for monitoring water and habitat quality in the Choptank River, other agencies (state, federal and non-governmental agencies (NGOs)) are also involved.

Reducing the loads from agricultural lands is considered one of the main challenges to the state of Maryland, and many regulations and programs were developed, such as The Water Quality Improvement Act in 1998, the Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans (SCWQPs), and Best Management Practices (BMPs). All these measures aim to reduce the nutrients and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay rivers. The USGS estimates water quality trends and nutrient and sediment loads from non-point sources by monitoring the non-tidal rivers of the Chesapeake Bay. There are 150 non-tidal monitoring stations in the Chesapeake Bay, but only two are in the Choptank River (Upper Choptank sub-basin ET5.0 and Tuckahoe Creek TUK0181) ( Figure 4.1), where monitoring is conducted on a monthly basis. Station ET5.0 has a long term monitoring history from 1984, while at TUK0181 monitoring started in 2005. Data for the TN, TP and TSS loads for the two stations were acquired from the USGS (http://cbrim.er.usgs. gov/loads_query.html).

The water quality criteria for shallow water DO (year round) was 5 mg/l, below this value waters were impaired or failed to meet the criteria. Summer (June -September), bottom dissolved oxygen (BDO) was considered healthy (good) if levels were 5 mg/l or greater, impaired (poor) if levels were less than 3 mg/l, and fair if levels were between 3 mg/l and 5 mg/l (U.S. EPA, 2000 andMason et al., 2011). TN concentrations met the water quality criteria when it was < 0.65 mg/l, while TP met the water quality criteria at < 0.037 mg/l. The TSS threshold was 15 mg/l and CHLA was 15 \u03bcg/l. Secchi disk depth criteria were diff erent for the diff erent salinity regimes, consequently for the tidal fresh area (0 to 0.5 ppt) it was 0.85 meters, for oligohaline (salinity of 0.5 to 5 ppt) it was 0.65 meters, and for mesohaline (salinity of 5-18 ppt) it was 1.625 meters (US EPA, 2000;Lacouture et al., 2006;Wazniak et al., 2007;."}, {"section_title": "Trend Analysis", "text": "Non-tidal and tidal water quality data were tested for linear trends from 1984-2014, except for TP and TSS parameters, due to a laboratory change in 1998 (Wazniak et al., 2007).

The annual mean for each parameter was compared with the established threshold values and if it met the criteria was scored as one and if failed was scored as zero. The scores for each station were summed and divided by six resulting in an index value ranging from zero to 1. Zero indicated that the station did not meet the water quality criteria and would not be expected to support seagrasses or fi sheries, while a score of one indicated that the station met all water quality criteria and should support ecosystem services. An assessment of the water quality for the tidal stations were developed based on the water quality index (WQINDX).

Chapter 5: Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity INTRODUCTION Benthic organisms can be a useful indicator of environmental quality in aquatic ecosystems due to their limited mobility and sensitivity to low levels of oxygen on the bottom and accumulation of environmental contaminants in sediments (Gray, 1979;Bilyard, 1987;Dauer, 1993). The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), fi rst developed for fi sh species by Karr (1981), is a measure of community health. It has since been adapted to evaluate benthic community condition in a variety of regions and water bodies, including freshwater streams in Tennessee (Kerans and Karr, 1994), urban streams in the Puget Sound basin (Morley and Karr, 2002), and the Chesapeake Bay (Weisburg et al., 1997). The B-IBI is dependent on habitat, salinity, and season, and integrates multiple parameters, such as total abundance/ biomass, species diversity, and prevalence of pollution tolerant/sensitive taxa relative to reference communities/conditions. In the Choptank watershed, there are two monitoring programs, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP)/Versar and the Maryland Biological Stream Survey, that measure B-IBI in tidal and non-tidal waters, respectively. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the available B-IBI data for the Choptank watershed, spatial patterns, and temporal trends."}, {"section_title": "DATA SOURCES AND METHODS Tidal", "text": "A B-IBI was developed for the Chesapeake Bay to assess the status and condition of summer benthic communities in tidal waters of the Bay (Weisburg et al., 1997;Alden et al., 2002). Since 1984, Versar, in conjunction with the State of Maryland and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) CBP, has conducted yearly bay-wide benthic monitoring from July-September. The sampling design has changed over time as program objectives have evolved (Llans\u00f3 et al., 2013). Fixed sites have been sampled since 1984; initially 70 sites were visited multiple times per year, but since 1989, 27 fi xed sites are sampled once annually, with three replicate samples taken at each site. A probability based sampling component was added in 1994 to assess benthic community condition at randomly selected sites throughout the Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tributaries. While the fi xed sites are used to identify temporal trends, the stratifi ed-random selected sites are sampled to assess bay-wide patterns and spatial variability. In each of ten strata, 25 randomly selected sites are allocated each year, with one sample collected at each site. Four types of gear are used to collect samples depending on habitat type and whether the site is fi xed or probability based (Llans\u00f3 et al., 2013). At fi xed stations, a 0.025 m 2 hand operated box corer is used in the nearshore shallow habitats, while a 0.0225 m 2 Wildco box corer is used in the deepwater (>4 m) habitats. Probability based samples are collected with a 0.044 m 2 surface area Young grab. Organisms are sieved Scientists prepare the Young Grab for sampling. Photo credit: NOAA CCMA COAST through a 0.5 mm screen and are further processed back in the lab to sort and identify taxa to the lowest possible taxonomic level. In addition, water quality parameters are also collected at each sampling site (e.g., temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen). Metrics that are included in the calculation of the overall B-IBI score vary by habitat (Llans\u00f3, 2002) (Llans\u00f3, 2002). These thresholds, called \"Restoration Goals\" (Ranasinghe et al., 1994), were established as the 5th (or 95th) and 50th (median) percentile values of reference sites, and were derived for each habitat, based on sediment type (sand, mud) and salinity (tidal freshwater, oligohaline, low/high mesohaline, polyhaline) (for details, see Llans\u00f3, 2002). The overall B-IBI score is then calculated by averaging the scores for all individual 1-5 metrics. The Chesapeake Bay Benthic Monitoring Program classifi es benthic community condition into four levels: \"meets goals\", \"marginally degraded\", \"degraded\", and \"severely degraded\" according to the following breakpoints (CBP, 2012; Llans\u00f3, 2002 (Llans\u00f3 et al., 2003). However, for this report we follow the criteria used by the CBP. The tidal B-IBI metric is incorporated into the spatially explicit Chesapeake Bay Health Index (BHI), which integrates multiple parameters of Bay status, including water quality and area of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (Williams et al., 2009). Tidal B-IBI values were coded for condition based on the aforementioned criteria used by the CBP. The data was then analyzed separately for fi xed and randomly selected stations. The mean \u00b1 standard error (SE) B-IBI for each fi xed station was calculated and plotted by year. As the data was slightly skewed and not-normally distributed, a Mann-Kendall nonparametric test was used to determine if there was a temporal trend in the time series. In addition, a Spearman's correlation was used to test for association between B-IBI score and the observed dissolved oxygen (DO) for all individual samples, as benthic communities can be sensitive to DO levels (Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995). For the randomly selected stations, condition levels were plotted in ArcGIS to qualitatively assess spatial variation of B-IBI in the Choptank. Randomly selected sites were classifi ed by the previously defi ned regions of interest (Upper/Middle/Lower Choptank, Tred Avon, Harris Creek, Little Choptank, see Chapter 1, Figure 1.2), and within each region the percent occurrence of B-IBI surveys was calculated by condition level. In addition, a Spearman's correlation was used to test for association between B-IBI score, depth, and observed DO at the time of the survey."}, {"section_title": "Non-tidal", "text": "Non-tidal benthic community monitoring is conducted by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).

For the one Sentinel Site in the study area, the observed B-IBI was plotted by year, and linear regression was used to determine if there was a temporal trend in the time series. The remaining surveys were classifi ed into groups by the regions of interest (Upper/Middle/Lower Choptank, Tred Avon, Harris Creek, Little Choptank), and within each region the percent occurrence of B-IBI surveys was calculated by condition level."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Tidal", "text": "There are two fi xed tidal stations in the Choptank that have been monitored since 1984 ( Figure 5.1).

Within the pre-defi ned areas of interest, a higher proportion of sites within the Little Choptank and Upper Choptank were \"degraded\" or \"severely degraded\". However, there was only a total of nine surveys within the Upper Choptank area ( Figure 5.6).

In addition to the uneven distribution of MBSS surveys by year, due to the focus of the sampling on freshwater streams, the survey locations are unevenly distributed across space within the Choptank HFA. The majority of MBSS sites are located in the Upper Choptank ( Figures 5.9 and 5.10). While there was a greater proportion of sites classifi ed as \"poor\" or \"very poor\" in the Little and Lower Choptank, this should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was much lower for these subregions. Approximately 44% of surveys in the Upper Choptank had a B-IBI score in the \"good\" range. The majority of surveys classifi ed as \"very poor\" were located in the upper reaches of the watershed from the border between Caroline and Queen Anne's County south to Greensboro (Figure 5.9). CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND DATA GAPS B-IBI is an indicator of benthic quality and may be a useful indicator for oyster restoration planning and implementation in the HFA. Benthic organisms also serve as food for many fi sh species such as striped bass, Atlantic croaker, spot, and white and yellow perch. Currently, long-term monitoring sites in tidal areas are limited to the Choptank mainstem, and only a handful of randomly selected sites have been sampled in tributaries where oyster restoration is occurring (Harris Creek, Tred Avon River, Little Choptank River). However, as an extension of work that was recently completed in three other Chesapeake watersheds , NOAA's Cooperative Oxford Lab (COL) is conducting additional monitoring and characterization of the Tred Avon River and Kings Creek. The health of each system will be evaluated using a suite of observations on water quality and living resources, including B-IBI. This additional data will provide important information on benthic condition within relatively under-sampled areas of the HFA. MBSS monitoring data is used by the state of Maryland to identify impaired streams and watersheds that may be aff ected by stressors (Southerland et al., 2009). In non-tidal areas of the Choptank watershed, the MBSS sampling eff ort varies widely by year ( Figure 5.7); the years with the highest sampling eff ort tended to occur in earlier years of the study (1990s). In more recent years, sampling eff ort tended to be relatively lower, with \u22646 sites/year sampled within the HFA from 2011-2014.

In the Choptank, 71 percent of the individual SAV bed areas had a density rating of moderate to dense (greater than 40% coverage of the bed area). SAV beds do not appear to occur in appreciable amounts upstream of Dickinson Bay (Orth et al., 2015), although citizen groups have reported patches of horned pondweed growing in the vicinity of Bow Knee Point and Chancellors Point in the early season (Karrh, 2012). The dominant species of SAV found in the Choptank estuary is widgeon grass, but also sago pondweed in some locations. In very shallow areas, horned pondweed is an important species in the early growing season (Orth et al., 2015;Karrh, 2012;Kemp, 2015). In the Little Choptank River there was close to 100 hectares of SAV coverage in 2014. The largest growth areas were near the mouth in the vicinity of Cators Cove and Hills Point Cove.

Starting in the late 1960s, more thorough surveys were conducted on a regular basis lasting through the mid 1970s. Wild celery (Valisneria americana) was documented to occur in the Choptank in 1933. Wild celery is considered to be particularly valuable as a food source for waterfowl. It was noted to occur in the Choptank in only one other survey since, in 1968, and then only at one sampling station out of 146. Three other species were documented in 1939: redhead grass (Potamogeton perfoliatus), widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima), and eel grass (Zostera marina). Surveys conducted in the 1950s and in the 1960s also added Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), Elodea Canadensis, and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) to the list of species documented as growing in the Choptank. In the Little Choptank four species have been documented since the 1960s: redhead grass (Potamogeton perfoliatus), widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima), eel grass (Zostera marina), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus). Sampling programs starting in 1968 and continuing through the mid 1970s noted redhead grass (Potamogeton perfoliatus) as a dominant species in the Choptank River estuary, with some beds recorded at stations almost as far upstream as the Warwick River mouth. After 1972 all occurrences were recorded at stations in the lower estuary near Dickinson Bay, Todds Bay, and Broad Creek. This species was not found to occur at any stations in the Little Choptank during this time period. Widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima) was commonly found during this time period at stations in the Lower Choptank and Little Choptank rivers. It was also found in 1972 up near the Warwick River, but never since. Eel grass (Zostera marina) was noted at a few stations in the Choptank and Little Choptank until 1972, but not thereafter. Sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) was recorded at a small number of stations prior to 1973, mostly around Armstrong Bay and Trippe Bay, but also near Broad Creek. Horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) was noted to be in high abundance in 1972 and in 1976 in the Lower Choptank River. No occurrences of horned pondweed were recorded for the Little Choptank. Elodea Canadensis was found to occur in the Choptank River at stations in the vicinity between Dickinson Bay and Goose Creek through 1972.

The Juvenile Striped Bass Seine Survey has been conducted in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay since 1954 (http://dnr2.maryland.gov/fi sheries/Pages/striped-bass/juvenile-index.aspx). The annual survey documents year-class success for young-of-the-year striped bass and relative abundance of other fi sh species. Sampling is conducted monthly from July-September at 22 fi xed stations per year, although the frequency of sampling and locations of some stations has changed over time. The stations are allocated among four major spawning and nursery areas in the Bay: Potomac River, Head of the Bay area, Nanticoke River, and Choptank River, with four stations currently sampled in the Choptank. During each round of sampling, replicate seine hauls are taken at each site. In addition, auxiliary stations are occasionally sampled to enhance spatial coverage, although these are not included in survey indices. A 30.5 x1.24 m bagless beach seine with 6.4 mm bar mesh is laid out perpendicular to the beach and swept with the current for a target sample area of 729 m 2 . All fi nfi sh are identifi ed to species and counted, with striped bass and other select species measured and identifi ed as age 0 or age +1. Select community metrics (total abundance, species richness) and abundance of key species (striped bass, white perch, yellow perch, Atlantic menhaden) were plotted over time to show general temporal and spatial patterns. Key species were selected with input from project partners due to their ecological and economic importance. The University of Maryland conducted seine and trawl surveys in the Upper Bay, Choptank, and Patuxent Rivers from 2010-2013 (MD DNR, 2014), with the majority of the sampling eff ort occurring in 2012 and 2013. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the catch effi ciency of Atlantic menhaden using beach seine and midwater trawl methods. Six sites were designated in the Choptank River along a salinity gradient. Seine hauls were conducted using the same protocol as MD DNR. Simultaneous mid-water trawls were conducted <0.5 km off shore of the beach seine locations. The duration of the trawl was 20 minutes, with the net fi shed from surface to bottom in 2 minute step increments. All fi sh caught in the gear were identifi ed to species and counted. In addition, lengths and aggregate weights were measured for Atlantic menhaden, Bay anchovy, and alosines. Fish counts from the UMD survey were mapped by year and gear for striped bass, white perch, yellow perch, and Atlantic menhaden. Sites that fell outside the study area or appeared to have erroneous coordinates were removed from display. When stations were sampled multiple times over the course of a season, a yearly mean was calculated for map display. The FHEP of MD DNR conducted estuarine fi sh community surveys in three tributaries of the Choptank River: Broad Creek (2012-2015), Harris Creek (2012-2015), and the Tred Avon River (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015) (MD DNR, 2014). The objective of the study was to evaluate summer nursery and adult habitat for recreationally important fi nfi sh and evaluate the infl uence of watershed development on total fi nfi sh abundance, species richness, presence-absence, and abundance of target species. Sites were sampled every two weeks from July-September. Typically, four evenly spaced haul seine and bottom trawl sample sites were located in the upper two-thirds of each sub-estuary (to reduce infl uence of mainstem waters), with trawls conducted off shore but adjacent to seine sites (MD DNR, 2014). All fi sh were identifi ed to species and counted. In addition, striped bass and yellow perch were separated into juveniles and adults, while white perch were separated into three size/life stage categories (juveniles, small adults, and harvestable size, i.e., >200 mm). Annual means (\u00b1SE) of striped bass, white perch, and Atlantic menhaden were calculated for each site and plotted to show trends over time (Note: yellow perch were excluded due to low frequency of occurrence). In addition, means over the 2012-2015 period were computed and plotted in ArcGIS to show general spatial patterns. Non-tidal fi sh community monitoring has been conducted by MD DNR as part of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). The goals of the MBSS are to assess current condition and changes in ecological resources of Maryland's 1st through 4th order non-tidal streams, as well as provide an inventory of biodiversity and identify eff ects of stressors on the natural resources .

The intensity of fi sh community sampling varies over the Choptank HFA, with the Middle-Lower Choptank mainstem, Tred Avon River, and Harris and Broad Creeks receiving the majority of the eff ort. The Little Choptank is relatively less characterized than other parts of the Choptank-Little Choptank River complex. There are advantages and disadvantages to various fi sh gears that are used in the Choptank surveys. Seines, which are deployed in the only long-term dataset (MD DNR Striped Bass Juvenile Seine Survey), are limited to shallow, nearshore environments. Conversely, trawls must be used in deeper off shore areas. As an extension of work that was recently completed in six other Chesapeake watersheds (Leight et al., , 2015, NOAA's Cooperative Oxford Lab (COL) is conducting additional monitoring and characterization of the Tred Avon River and Kings Creek. Fish abundance will be estimated by seine and otter trawl surveys, and individual fi sh will be sampled to measure a suite of parameters related to fi sh health, including fi sh body fat index, external fi sh parasites, fi sh macrophage aggregates, and fi sh disease. This work will provide additional insight on overall ecosystem health."}, {"section_title": "CHOPTANK OYSTER DISTRIBUTION Historic Oyster Habitat", "text": "Mapping Chesapeake Bay oyster bars dates back to the early 1900s when Charles C. Yates mapped 769 natural oyster bars over six years (1906)(1907)(1908)(1909)(1910)(1911)(1912) resulting in what is now well known as the Yates Survey (Yates, 1911(Yates, , 1913. Areas were mapped and documented with their bars names, representing a total area of 872 km\u00b2. However, the Yates Survey was conducted to defi ne regulatory boundaries, not necessarily to map all oyster habitat, so comparisons between the Yates Survey and modern habitat surveys are not warranted.  (Smith et al., 1997) (1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980)(1981)(1982)(1983) and the Acoustic Survey by Maryland Geological Survey and NOAA Chesapeake Bay Offi ce (2003-2014) (MD iMAP, 2016b). The total area surveyed in the Chesapeake Bay was 11,324 km\u00b2, and of this 931 km\u00b2 were oyster habitats. This area is further classifi ed by origin, anthropogenic (man-made) and biogenic (natural) using the CMECS. Bay wide, anthropogenic origin oyster habitats had an area of 21.61 km\u00b2 of which only 0.085 km\u00b2 was classifi ed as anthropogenic oyster reefs (size \u2265 4,096 millimeters), while the rest were mainly anthropogenic oyster rubble (4,096 millimeters > size > 64 millimeters) (21.08 km\u00b2). On the other hand the biogenic oyster habitats had an area of 749.96 km\u00b2 of which only 1.54 km\u00b2 were classifi ed as biogenic oyster reefs (size \u2265 4,096 millimeters) and the rest were mainly biogenic oyster rubble (4,096 millimeters > size > 64 millimeters). In the Choptank basin oyster habitats (anthropogenic and biogenic) were estimated to cover an area of 75.55 km\u00b2 (Figure 8.2). This represents 9.8% of the total area of Maryland Chesapeake Bay oyster habitats. Anthropogenic oyster habitats were 12.72 km\u00b2 of which only 2,349 m\u00b2 were classifi ed as anthropogenic oyster reef and the rest were mainly anthropogenic oyster rubble. Meanwhile the biogenic oyster habitats were 52.96 km\u00b2 of which only 0.91 km\u00b2 were classifi ed as biogenic oyster reefs and the rest were biogenic oyster rubble. When comparing historic and recent oyster habitat it is important to consider the diff erence in scale of measurement. This is evident between Figures 8.1 and 8.2 where the latter is more detailed using a fi ner scale. It is also important to remember that the historic surveys and modern surveys were conducted for diff erent purposes using diff erent methods, so comparisons of the results are not warranted."}, {"section_title": "CHOPTANK OYSTER MANAGEMENT Historic Overview", "text": "Management of oysters in Maryland's Chesapeake Bay dates back to the year 1820, when the Maryland legislature enacted the fi rst oyster law prohibiting both dredging in the state and transporting oysters with ships not owned by Maryland residents (Kennedy and Breisch, 1983). Ten years later the One-Acre Planting Law was enacted, allowing Maryland citizens to plant and grow oysters on one acre of barren bottom water, promoting oyster culture as a management tool. Over the 19th century, more laws were passed and diff erent management measures were established to manage oysters, including seasonal closures, size limits, licensing, and leasing for oyster culture. Oyster production peaked in 1884 at 15 million bushels, but these management measures did not prevent the subsequent decline of oyster populations and harvest. With the beginning of the twentieth century oyster culture was encouraged, expanding acres for lease to reach 500 acres via the Haman Oyster Culture Law (1906) and the Price Campbell Bill (1912). New management measures were also developed, such as a fuel tax on work boats and shell tax from the packing houses, to fund the planting program. Controversy over leasing increased and confl icts between the oyster fi shermen and the oyster culture communities arose. The Shepherd Bill (1914) was enacted, which limited the expansion of the oyster leasing. Additionally, the Maryland Conservation Commission was developed in 1916 (a predecessor of the MD DNR) and for the fi rst time Reserve Areas were used as a tool to manage Chesapeake Bay oysters. An Oyster Management Plan was developed in 1943 and another adopted in 1948, both with the aim to increase oyster production (Kennedy and Breisch, 1983). The plans were not fully implemented and did not achieve their objectives. However, they did lead to the establishment of an annual oyster seed and shell planting program as a management practice to maintain oyster fi sheries."}, {"section_title": "Recent Management Eff orts", "text": "In recent decades, The management of oyster populations has become no less complex, with the emergence of challenges such as oyster diseases, seasonal hypoxia (lack of oxygen), fl ood events resulting in high freshwater infl ow, and climate change eff ects. As a result, a series of oyster management plans and agreements (CBP, 1989(CBP, , 1994(CBP, , 2000(CBP, , 2004 for the Chesapeake Bay were developed and adopted by local states (MD, VA, PA, DC) and the Chesapeake Bay Commission. The main objective of these plans was to protect, restore and enhance the oyster resources for long term ecological and economic benefi ts. These plans addressed oyster problems such as: 1) declining harvest due to overfi shing; 2) recruitment; 3) disease mortality; 4) low production from leased grounds; 5) habitat degradation; 6) shellfi sh sanitation problems; 7) market stability; and 8) repletion eff orts. One of the most important outcomes of these plans is using the oyster sanctuaries (25% of the remaining oyster bar habitat) as a management tool. According to MD DNR, \"sanctuaries are areas where the wild harvest of oysters is prohibited\" (MD DNR, 2010). They are areas where oyster populations are expected to increase in size and in density, producing disease resistant oysters which will function as key spawners and also enhance the ecosystem services in the Bay. More recently President Obama issued Executive Order 13508 in May 2009 for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed (FLCCB, 2010). As a result the Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay developed a strategy to restore the watershed. One of the main outcomes of this strategy was to \"restore native oyster habitat and populations in 20 tributaries out of 35 to 40 candidate tributaries by 2025\" (U.S. EPA, 2010). Restoration goals and metrics have been further refi ned to evaluate the success of these eff orts (CBP, 2011). In the most recent Chesapeake Bay Program Watershed Agreement (CBP, 2014) the stated oyster restoration goal was to restore native oyster habitat and population in 10 tributaries by 2025 and ensure their protection. Within the Choptank HFA (NOAA/CBO, 2015a), establishment of \"oyster sanctuaries\" is one of the main management measures (MD DNR, 2010). There are 13 oyster sanctuaries and two oyster reserves in the Choptank River watershed covering an area of 177.29 km\u00b2 (43,809 acres) (Figure 8.3), of which Harris Creek, Tred Avon and Little Choptank sanctuaries represent 42% and were selected for restoration projects (MIORW, 2013(MIORW, , 2015a. Public Oyster Fisheries Areas were also established in the Choptank watershed, covering an area of 151.94 km 2 (37,545 acres) (Figure 8.3).

Eleven long-term oyster monitoring sites in the Choptank HFA (Tarnowski, 2015;Smith et al., 1997 Oyster Diseases and Mortality Throughout its range, the eastern oyster is susceptible to many infectious diseases and parasites which can cause mortality of individuals, and adverse impacts on the growth and reproduction of populations. Causative agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoans (Ford and Tripp, 1996). For some diseases, the etiological agents are still unknown. In the Choptank HFA, two of the major diseases aff ecting oysters are Dermo, caused by protozoan Perkinsus marinus, and MSX, caused by protozoan Haplosporidium nelsoni. In some years, either or both of these diseases can infect oysters in the Choptank and increase natural mortality in populations. These two diseases are monitored by the MD DNR's annual oyster survey, by sampling 30 oysters from locations known as \"disease bars\", ten of which are within the Choptank HFA. Dermo is assessed for both prevalence within a sample (reported as percent infected), and intensity (reported on a numeric scale from 0 to 7) (Tarnowski, 2015). Both pathogens are aff ected by environmental conditions including temperature and salinity, so the prevalence and eff ects of these diseases are highly variable between years and locations. Ideal conditions for Dermo are temperatures from 25 to 30 degrees C and salinities greater than 15 ppt, and MSX is intolerant of salinities below 10 ppt (Ford and Tripp, 1996). Because of its intolerance of low salinities, MSX tends to be more prevalent in the Choptank region during dry years, with higher than average salinities, whereas it may be more continually present in higher salinity areas of the Lower Chesapeake. Figure 8.14 depicts the annual prevalence of Dermo in the Choptank HFA, averaged across ten \"disease bar\" sample locations from 1990 to 2014 (Tarnowski, 2015). Annual average prevalence varies from 26% in 2005, to 98% in 2002. Figure 8.15 illustrates the spatial variation among Choptank sub-estuaries. Dermo prevalence is high in all areas in some years (e.g., 2001-2002), but since 2008 is apparently much lower in Harris Creek than in the other areas. The assessed intensity of Dermo infections also varies among years and locations. When assessed on a 0-7 scale and averaged across the ten \"disease bars\" in the Choptank region (Figure 8.16), it varies from 4.1 in 2001 to 0.7 in 2005. Among sub-estuaries, Dermo intensity has been higher in all locations in some years (e.g., [2000][2001][2002], but apparently lower in Harris Creek from 2008 to 2014 (Figure 8.17).  1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 (Tarnowski, 2015).  The protozoan causing MSX disease, Haplosporidium nelsoni, is more strongly associated with high salinity conditions than is the Dermo pathogen (Ford and Tripp, 1996). Therefore, MSX in the Choptank region is less prevalent, and generally peaks only in dry years with less freshwater infl ow and higher estuarine salinities. Figure 8.18 depicts the annual prevalence of MSX in the Choptank HFA, averaged across ten \"disease bar\" sample locations from 1990 to 2014 (Tarnowski, 2015). Prevalence has been very low since 2011, but there are notable peaks in 2009, 2002 (peak of a four-year epizootic from 2001-2004), and 1992. In the years when MSX is prevalent, it appears to aff ect the higher salinity areas such as the Little Choptank, adjacent to the Chesapeake mainstem, more than lower salinity tributaries such as the Tred Avon (Figure 8.19). Although MSX is only sporadically signifi cant in the Choptank region, both MSX and Dermo contribute substantially to natural mortality. Figure 8.20 depicts annual natural mortality in the Choptank HFA, averaged across sample locations from 1985 to 2014 (Tarnowski, 2015). The inter-annual variability of mortality ranging from 4% to 9% over the past ten years (2005-2014) is dwarfed by the marked mortality event of 2002, when the average annual mortality peaked at 86% at ten sites in the Choptank region and was estimated at 58% for the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay (Tarnowski, 2015) (Figures 8.20 and 8.21). Much of this mortality can be attributed to Dermo and MSX, which peaked at 98% and 48% prevalence (respectively) in the Choptank HFA in that year. Diseases are not the only factors contributing to natural mortality. In waters of the upper Chesapeake, where salinities are typically at the lower portion of the oyster's optimal range, fl ood events can drop salinities to well below optimum for extended periods of time. In other areas, periodic low DO conditions can aff ect mortality and growth."}, {"section_title": "HARVEST OF OYSTERS", "text": "Because of the importance of oysters in the early economy and cultural life of Maryland, their fi sheries have been the subject of state legislation and political management as early as the 1820s. The harvest of oysters in Maryland peaked in the late 1800s to meet growing demand, following the depletion of oyster populations in southern New England (Kennedy and Breisch, 1983). Bay-wide harvest levels are now at a small fraction of their peak, often cited as around 1% (NOAA/CBO, 2015b). The long term trend in the Choptank region generally parallels that of the greater Chesapeake, although the Choptank remains one of the major oyster harvesting regions in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay. From 1985 to 2014, the Choptank (including tributaries and Little Choptank) accounted for approximately 32% of the harvest from Maryland's Chesapeake Bay (Tarnowski, 2015).
