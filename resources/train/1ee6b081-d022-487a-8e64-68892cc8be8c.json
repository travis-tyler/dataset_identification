[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Biological investigations of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are important to understand the virus and help to propose appropriate responses to the pandemic. Scientists have been able to ob-tain genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and have started analysis of these data. Reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank sequence database (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512) shows that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus having a length of 29,903 nucleotides. Comparative genomic analysis results obtained in 1, 2, 3 suggest that the COVID-19 virus may be originated in bats. Other studies show that pangolins may have served as the hosts for the virus 4,5 . Andersen et al. 6 furthermore believe that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus or constructed in a laboratory but has a natural origin. A study in 7 using machine learning unsupervised clustering methods corroborates previous findings that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the Betacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family 8, 9 . The whole genome analysis results also indicate that bats are more likely the reservoir hosts for the virus than pangolins. Another study in 10 demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 may have resulted from a recombination of a pangolin coronavirus and a bat coronavirus, and pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host for the virus.\nSince the first cases were detected, the COVID-19 virus has spread to almost every country in the world and has been linked to the deaths of more than 404,000 people of over 7 million confirmed cases 11 . Tracing the evolution and spread of the virus is important for developing vaccines and drugs as well as proposing appropriate intervention strategies. Monitoring and analysing the viral genome mutations can be helpful for this task. Due to a strong immunologic pressure in humans, the virus may have mutated over time to circumvent responses of the human immune system. This leads to the creation of virus variants with possible different virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility 12 . This paper reports all point mutations occurring so far in SARS-CoV-2 and presents exemplified implications obtained from the analysis of these mutation pattern data. Four types of mutations, which include synonymous, nonsynonymous, insertion and deletion, are detected. We use 6,324 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected in 45 countries and deposited to the NCBI GenBank so far and create a spreadsheet dataset of all mutations occurred across different genes. Eleven protein coding genes of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, namely ORF1ab, spike (S), ORF3a, envelope (E), membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid (N) and ORF10. The order of these genes and their corresponding length are illustrated in Fig. 1 .\nThe genes S, E, M, and N produce structural proteins that play important roles in the virus functions. For example, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) region of the S protein can bind to a receptor of a host cell, e.g. the human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, enabling the entrance of the virus into the cell 13 . Predictions of protein structures may help understand the virus's functions and thus contribute to developing vaccines and therapeutics against the virus. In this paper, to evaluate the possible impacts of genomic mutations on the virus functions, we propose the use of the SSpro/ACCpro 5 methods to predict protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility 14 . These predictors were built using deep learning one-dimensional bidirectional recurrent neural networks incorporated in the SCRATCH-1D software suite (version 1.2, 2018) 15 . By comparing the prediction results obtained on the reference genome and mutated genomes, we are able to assess whether the detected mutations have the potential to change the protein structure and solvent accessibility, and thus lead to possible changes of the virus characteristics. Because of the functional importance of structural proteins, we only report the prediction results of these proteins in this study. The next section reviews related works in the literature. We then present materials and methods for SARS-CoV-2 mutation detection, and protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction. Next we summarize statistics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations so far and implications of these mutations. Details of mutations in nonstructural ORF genes and structural S, E, M and N genes are presented after that. A full SARS-CoV-2 mutation spreadsheet report is provided in the Data Availability section."}, {"section_title": "RELATED WORKS", "text": "Since the first genomes were collected in December 2019, there have been many findings on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2. For example, Phan 16 analysed 86 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from the the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and found 93 mutations over the entire viral genome sequences. Among them, there are three mutations occurring in the RBD region of the spike surface glycoprotein S, including N354D, D364Y and V367F, with the numbers showing amino acid (AA) positions in the protein. That study also reveals three deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from Japan, USA and Australia. Two of these deletion mutations are in the ORF1ab polyprotein and one deletion occurs in the 3' end of the genome. Likewise, a study in 17 shows that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes may have undergone recurrent, independent mutations at 198 sites with 80% of these are of the nonsynonymous type. Alternatively, a SNP genotyping study in 18 discovered highly frequent mutations in the genes encoding the S protein, RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein. Those high-frequency SNP mutations are worth further investigations for vaccine development because they may be linked to the virus transmissibility and virulence. Tang et al. 19 investigated 103 genomes of COVID-19 patients and discover mutations in 149 sites of these genomes. The study also shows that the spike gene S consistently has larger dS values (synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) than other genes. In addition, two major lineages of the virus, denoted as L and S, have been specified based on two tightly linked SNPs. The L lineage is found more prevalent than the S lineage among the examined sequences.\nKorber et al. 20 tracked the mutations of spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2 because it plays an important role in mediating infection of targeted cells and is the focus of vaccine and antibody therapy development efforts 21 . They detected 14 mutations in the spike protein that are growing, especially the mutation D614G that rapidly becomes the dominant form when spread to a new geographical region. Likewise, Hashimi 22 analysed the mutation frequency in the spike protein S of 796 SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from the GISAID and GenBank databases. The study found 64 mutations occurring in the S protein sequences obtained from multiple countries. It suggests that the virus is spreading in two forms, the D614 form (residue D at position 614 in the S protein) takes 68.5% while the G614 form takes 31.5% proportion of the examined isolates. Koyama et al. 23 on the other hand found several variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may cause drifts and escape from immune recognition by using the prediction results of B-cell and T-cell epitopes in 24 . Typically, the mutation D614G occurring in the spike protein is found prevalent in the European population. This mutation may have caused antigenic drift, resulting in vaccine mismatches that lead to a high mortality rate of this population.\nA recent situation report 25 by Nextstrain 26 on genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus using 5,193 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes shows that SARS-CoV-2 on average accumulates changes at a rate of 24 substitutions per year. This is approximately equivalent to 1 mutation per 1,000 bases in a year. This evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is typical for a coronavirus, and it is smaller than that of influenza (average 2 mutations per 1,000 bases per year) and HIV (average 4 mutations per 1,000 bases per year). Shen et al. 12 conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from 8 patients with COVID-19 and found no evidence for the transmission of intrahost variants as well as a high evolution rate of the virus with the number of intrahost variants ranged from 0 to 51 around a median number of 4. Pachetti et al. 27 examined 220 genomic sequences of COVID-19 patients from the GISAID database and discovered 8 novel recurrent mutations at nucleotide locations 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations at locations 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 are mostly found in Europe while those at locations 17746, 17857 and 18060 occur in sequences obtained from patients in North America. Likewise, a study in 28 on 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences discovered 116 mutations. Among them, the mutations at position C8782T in the ORF1ab gene, T28144C in the ORF8 gene and C29095T in the N gene are common."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Detection", "text": "We use 6,324 sequence records downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database on 2020-06-17. The latest collection date for the samples from which the sequences were derived was on 2020-06-05. The data, which were collected in 45 countries, include both nucleotide sequences and protein translations of coding genes. A proportion of the 6,324 records have sequences of only few proteins, i.e. these records do not annotate all 11 proteins (ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, S, E, M and N). The number of available sequences is thus different from one protein to another (see column \"Avai Num\" in Table 1 ). Genome sequences that do not specify country or AA sequences that contain letter \"X\" representing an unknown AA are excluded in our calculations. We use the genome obtained from the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512 as the reference genome. For the mutation detection purpose, we apply a dynamic programming algorithm to protein AA sequences to get global pairwise alignments between a reference sequence and a query sequence. Specifically, we use the Python Bio.pairwise2.align.globalms function (https://biopython.org/docs/dev/api/Bio.pairwise2.html) where a match is given 2 points, a mismatch is deducted 0.5 points, 2 points are deducted when opening a gap, and 1 point is deducted when extending it. Gaps are then inserted into nucleotide sequences corresponding to the resulted protein sequence alignments. Using the resulted pairwise alignments, we are able to compare query sequences and the reference sequences at each position and identify locations of insertion, deletion, synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Structure and Solvent Accessibility Prediction", "text": "Virus protein structure plays a key role in its functions and a change in structure shape may affect its functions, virulence, infectivity and transmissibility, possibly resulting in non-functional proteins. Protein secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding patterns, which make an intermediate form before the protein folds into a three-dimensional shape composing its tertiary structure. Eight types of protein secondary structure defined by the Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure (DSSP) include 3 10 helix (G), \u03b1 helix (H), \u03c0 helix (I), hydrogen bonded turn (T), extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet conformation (E), residue in isolated \u03b2-bridge (B), bend (S) and coil (C). The DSSP tool assigns every residue to one of the eight possible states. In a reduced form, these 8 conformational states can be diminished to 3 states: H = {H, G, I}, E = {E, B} and C = {S, T, C} 29 . The protein secondary structure represents interactions between neighboring or near-by AAs as its functional three-dimensional shape is created through the polypeptide folding. We thus determine a change in protein secondary structure if any change happens in the structures of the mutated AA and its 10 neighboring AAs compared to those of the reference sequence. In detail, we consider 5 AAs ahead and 5 AAs behind the mutated AA. The same approach is applied when considering a change of the protein relative solvent accessibility. Solvent-exposed area represents the area of a biomolecule on a surface that is accessible to a solvent. Accordingly, a residue is considered as exposed if at least 25% of that residue must be exposed, denoted as the \"e\" state. Alternatively, the residue is determined as buried, i.e. the \"b\" state. There have been various protein secondary structure prediction programs in the literature and many of those were developed based on artificial intelligence models using protein AA sequences such as JPred4 30 , Spider2 31 , Porter 5 32 , RaptorX 33 , PSSpred 34 , YASSPP 35 and SSpro 14 . In this paper, we use the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility prediction methods SSpro/ACCpro 5 14 within the SCRATCH-1D software suite (release 1.2, 2018) 15 . These predictors were built using the bidirectional recursive neural networks and a combination of the sequence similarity and sequencebased structural similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank 36 . Prediction results of 8-class structure (SSpro8 predictor) and 25%-threshold relative solvent accessibility (ACCpro predictor) are used for statistics on protein secondary structure and accessibility changes. We however also report in the spreadsheet supplemental information prediction results of 3-class structure (SSpro predictor) and relative solvent accessibility on 20 thresholds, ranging from 0% to 95% with a 5% step (the ACCpro20 predictor within the SCRATCH-1D software). Table 1 summarizes statistics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations so far. \"AA Length\" indicates the length of the protein AA sequence derived from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. \"Avai. Num\" denotes the number of records among 6,324 NCBI GenBank records that have the complete sequence of the corresponding protein. \"No. Mu\" refers to the number of sequences that do not have any mutations compared to the reference sequence. \"No. Mu Rate\" is the ratio between \"No. Mu\" and \"Avai. Num\". \"Delete\" means the number of deletion mutations occurring in the AA sequences of the protein. This number may be larger than the number of sequences having deletion mutations because an AA sequence may have more than one deletion. Likewise, \"Insert\", \"Nonsyn\" and \"Syn\" show the number of insertion, nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations occurring in the protein AA sequences. \"Nonsyn/Syn\" demonstrates a ratio between the number of nonsynonymous mutations versus the number of synonymous mutations. \"Struct Change\" means the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have protein secondary structure change potential based on the SSpro8 predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Similarly, \"Acc Change\" refers to the number of nonsynonymous mutations that have potential to change the protein relative solvent accessibility based on the ACCpro predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Insertion and deletion mutations alter protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility by default so that they are not included in the structure and solvent accessibility change statistics. Table 1 shows that the ORF3a and ORF8 proteins have the number of nonsynonymous mutations significantly larger than that of the synonymous mutations. In contrast, this ratio in proteins E, M, ORF7b and ORF10 are very small (less than 1). These proteins could be targeted for vaccine and drug development as they have less variations than other proteins. These findings are supported by results presented in Figs. 2-4 where we plot the number of insertion, deletion and nonsynonymous (Fig. 3) , entire regions before and after the spike at position 614 are almost unchanged. Fig. 4 presents variations of multiple proteins. In addition to proteins E, M, ORF7b and ORF10, we find from Fig. 4 that proteins ORF6 and ORF7a are also relatively stable without a large number of variations at any particular locations. This is justified by data in the column \"No. Mu Rate\" in Table 1 , which shows the ratio between \"No. Mu\" and \"Avai. Num\", i.e. the ratio between the number of sequences having no mutations in a specific protein versus the total number of available sequences of that protein. Proteins E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 have a large number of sequences with no mutations, therefore their ratios are very large, respectively of 0.98, 0.90, 0.98, 0.97, 0.99, and 0.99. This is because the size of these proteins is relatively small (see data in the column \"AA Length\" in Table 1 ). These proteins are considered as most stable when compared to other proteins, which have the ratios of less than 0.8. These results are consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2 "}, {"section_title": "-4.", "text": "Protein N has 1,927 nonsynonymous mutations but 1,678 of them are likely to make changes in protein secondary structure, making a ratio of 87.08%. This is considerably larger than those of protein S (4.42%), protein M (24.79%) and protein E (64.29%). The number of solvent accessibility changes of protein S is larger than its structure changes: 184 vs 164. This however is opposite in other structural proteins: E (7 vs 18), M (8 vs 30) and N (37 vs 1,678). "}, {"section_title": "Gene ORF1ab", "text": "The ORF1ab polyprotein has 7,096 AAs.

One insertion mutation occurs in sequence MT449656, collected in USA: CA on 2020-04-13, at position -230F.

The first case of this mutation was collected on 2020-01-23 and its latest case was on 2020-04-07.

Alternatively, mutations H146Y (24 cases), V483A (11 cases), E554D (14 cases), P681L (16 cases) and S939F (11 cases) all occur only in USA or mutation L8V (4 cases) occurs only in Hong Kong (refer to the spreadsheet data, which can be found in the Data Availability section). We identify the RBD region within the residue range Arg319-Phe541 of protein S based on a study in 38 . In the RBD region only, the number of nonsynonymous mutations is 53 and that of synonymous is 46, making a ratio of 1.15. This is much smaller than the ratio of 5.54 for the entire gene S, suggesting that the RBD region may have been optimized for binding to a receptor of a host cell. This is complemented by Fig. 9 showing all deletion mutations in gene S being outside the RBD region. Note that the difference of these ratios is partly due to the large number of D614G mutations (3, 089) , which is outside the RBD region. Table 11 summarizes nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD region occurring in 2 or more sequences. Notable mutation in this region is V483A occurring in 11 isolates all collected in USA. The first and latest collected dates of these isolates were respectively 2020-03-05 and 2020-04-05, suggesting that the first isolate may have spread to others having the same mutation V483A.

There could be a connection between this isolate with other isolates obtained in USA, Greece and Australia. Information presented in Tables 2-15 is extracted from the generated mutation data. In these summary tables, \"First Date\" and \"First Country\" information is useful for identifying when and where the mutations were possibly originated while the \"Distribution\" information shows how such mutations have spread to different countries.\nThe generated mutation data also allow us to observe the evolution of the virus. We can point out which mutations are still active or no longer active based on the \"Latest Date\" information presented in Tables 2-15 . For example, in gene S (Table 10) , the latest date of D614G was on 2020-06-05 (same as the latest collection date of the entire genome dataset used in this study), indicating that this mutation is still active. The latest date of P681L was on 2020-04-03, showing that this mutation may no longer occur. Mutations are still active mean they have evolutionarily adapted to varying environments while inactive mutations may have not. This kind of information is useful for further research on vaccine and drug development as ongoing changes of the viral proteins need to be focused and addressed rather than inactive mutations. Our analysis shows that the G form at location 614 in protein S becomes increasingly popular compared to the D form. Among 4,434 sequences of the S protein, 3,089 sequences have the mutation D614G, taking Through the mutation analysis, we are able to detect regions of the viral genomes that are stable and can be targeted for vaccine and drug development, such as those coding for proteins E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. In addition, this study presents results obtained by the use of deep learning recurrent neural networks for protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions. These results are useful for further research on SARS-CoV-2 protein structure changes. In particular, among 3,089 D614G mutations, our prediction results show that none of these mutations is likely to make changes in the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. This mutation has attracted much attention of researchers as it may affect the virulence and infectivity of the virus and our finding has contributed to understanding this mutation."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Analysing the virus genome sequences and their proteins is crucial for understanding the virus and proposing appropriate approaches to respond to and control the pandemic. This paper has reported all point mutations of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus's first genomes were obtained in December 2019. A SARS-CoV-2 mutation spreadsheet dataset is built using a large number of genome sequences (6,324) obtained across 45 countries. This dataset can enable scientists to monitor the evolution and spread of the virus although the use of these data needs to be corroborated with patients' clinical data and travel history for substantiated confirmations. We also predict the secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility of the virus proteins to evaluate whether the detected mutations have a potential to change the virus characteristics. The mutation D614G in protein S is unlikely to change either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility based on the prediction results. These protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility change potentials are predicted results based on deep learning recurrent neural networks, which need to be experimentally verified. They however provide important insights about the virus and prompt further experimental biochemistry and molecular biology research into the genomic regions of these mutations. A future work focusing on impacts of the mutations on protein functions would be worth investigating. The function impacts can be determined via wet lab experiments or using low-cost computational tool such as PROVEAN 39 ."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY", "text": "The dataset generated and analysed during the current study is available in the bioRxiv repository, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.171769v2.supplementary-material."}]
