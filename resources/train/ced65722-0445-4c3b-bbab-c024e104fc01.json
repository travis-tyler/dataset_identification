INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. The hippocampus is known to play important roles in consolidating information from short-term memory to long-term memory and is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage in the progression of AD. Hippocampal measures extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have been widely studied to detect the status of AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal stage of AD) [1] - [4] or infer cognitive status [5] . These hippocampal measures include: (a) total volumes [2] , [3] , (b) subfield volumes [1] , [4] , (c) surface deformations [5] using surface-based morphometry (SBM), and (d) gray matter (GM) measures using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) [3] .\nThe first two types of measures are highly summarized size measures and may not be able to capture detailed regional changes. The second two types are detailed measures of hippocampal morphometry and have the potential to localize the structural changes in hippocampus. The hippocampus is composed of multiple subfields [6] , and the neuron loss is not uniformly distributed on the whole hippocampus [7] . \u2020 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/how to apply/ADNI Acknowledgement List.pdf.\nMany hippocampal studies have indicated that subfields play an important role in brain functions, e.g., cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) related to autobiographical memory retrieval [8] , CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) involved in memory encoding and early retrieval [6] , and subiculum and CA1 predominantly affected for AD patients [9] . However, this critical subfield information is typically not addressed by the existing SBM and VBM studies [3] , [5] . To bridge this gap, we propose a SBM framework that maps hippocampal regional changes onto it subfields and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to identifying regional subfield changes in MCI and AD.\nThe complex folding anatomy of hippocampus presents analytical challenges, and the hippocampal subfield information is often difficult to extract. Most existing subfield studies employed manual segmentation [10] - [12] or semi-automated segmentation [1] , [13] , coupled with high-field MR technologies (e.g., 4-9.4T) and/or postmortem samples. They often require long scan time and thus is not applicable to large-scale studies. Among very few tools available for hippocampal subfield studies, FreeSurfer (http://freesurfer.net/) recently released a promising routine (http://freesurfer.net/fswiki/HippocampalSubfieldSegmentation) for subfield segmentation [14] . But FreeSurfer tends to yield noisy boundary of the entire hippocampus, which is not suitable for detailed shape analysis [2] , [15] . FIRST (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl/list.html) [16] , an integrated surface registration and segmentation tool developed as part of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL), has produced satisfactory segmentation results of the entire hippocampus for detailed shape studies (e.g., [17] , [18] ); but it does not offer capability for segmenting subfields. Cong et al. [15] integrated the subfield segmentation results from FreeSurfer, the hippocampal segmentation results from FIRST, and a powerful spherical harmonics (SPHARM) shape modeling method [19] , [20] , and developed an approach to build a surface atlas of hippocampal subfields from MRI scans.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel SBM framework for identifying hippocampal subfield changes related to a certain condition of interest (e.g., age, gender, or diagnosis). We employ the method by Cong et al. [15] to create a surface atlas of hippocampal subfields, use the SPHARM technique to register each individual hippocampus to this atlas, and perform statistical shape analysis on the surface manifold using random field theory [21] , [22] . The major strengths of this framework are as follows: (a) it performs detailed hippocampal shape analysis, (b) it embraces, rather than ignores, the important hippocampal subfield information, and (c) it analyzes regular MRI scans and is applicable to large scale studies. We demonstrate its effectiveness via an application to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set [23] ."}, {"section_title": "II. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "We follow the three-step pipeline described in [15] : (a) automatic segmentation of the hippocampus (by FIRST) and subfields (by FreeSurfer), (b) modeling hippocampal surfaces using SPHARM, and (c) creating surface atlas of hippocampal subfields. We apply this pipeline and create a surface atlas of hippocampal subfields using all healthy control (HC) participants in the analyzed ADNI data. After that, we register all the individual hippocampal surface to this atlas, and extract surface signals. Finally, we perform statistical shape analysis of these surface signals using random field theory to identify hippocampal subfield regions related to conditions of interest including age, gender, and diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "A. Test Data", "text": "The data used in this study were downloaded from the ADNI database [23] . One goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adniinfo.org. We downloaded baseline 3T MRI scans of 172 HC, 267 early MCI (EMCI), 140 late MCI (LMCI), and 108 AD participants aging between 55 and 90, along with demographic and diagnostic information. All the raw data are 3D T1-weighted scans with 1.2 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm 3 voxel resolution, and dimension of 196 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 256."}, {"section_title": "B. Hippocampal Surface Modeling", "text": "Automatic hippocampal segmentation is conducted by FIRST. Topology fix is performed on the binary segmentation results to make sure that each hippocampal surface has spherical topology. The SPHARM method is used to model each surface as follows: (a) Spherical parametrization is first performed to establish a bijective mapping between each surface location v = (x, y, z)\nT and a pair of spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03d5) while minimizing area distortion. This mapping can be represented as:\nT . (b) Each parameterized surface is then expanded using spherical harmonics (i.e., Fourier basis functions on the sphere): T can be calculated up to a user-desired degree, and estimated by solving a set of linear equations in a least squares fashion [24] . (c) After that, the hippocampal surface can be reconstructed with these estimated coefficients. Using more coefficients leads to a more detailed reconstruction. (d) These SPHARM surfaces can be registered together by aligning their first order ellipsoids (FOEs) (see [15] for details)."}, {"section_title": "C. Hippocampal Subfield Mapping and Atlas Construction", "text": "FreeSurfer is used to segment out 8 hippocampal subfields: hippocampal tail, CA1, CA2-3, CA4-DG, fimbria, hippocampal fissure, presubiculum, and subiculum. Since the subfield segmentation process is based on a Bayesian model, each subfield segmentation result is represented as a probability map. We employ the SPHARM basis functions to expand these probability maps, using the same spherical parameterization described above. As a result, for each subfield and each surface location, there is an associated probability value. By comparing the reconstructed probability values from each subfield, each surface location can be labeled by the subfield with the largest probability value.\nTo facilitate comparison among hippocampal surfaces, we use all the HC data and create a surface atlas to represent an average normal hippocampus. Our method is as follows: (1) let the atlas be the first surface; (2) register each surface to the atlas by aligning their FOEs; (3) let the atlas be the mean of all the data; (4) repeat (2) and (3) until the atlas converges. Each atlas surface location is labeled by the most popular subfield carried by the HC participants. As a result, no atlas surface location is labeled by fimbria and hippocampal fissure. Following a general delineation in [25] , we also combine presubiculum and subiculum into one joint subfield denoted as SUB. Consequently, we have five hippocampal subfields shown on the atlas surface in this study (see Figure 1) , which is in accordance with prior studies [4] , [10] , [11] , [26] ."}, {"section_title": "D. Statistical Shape Analysis on the Surface", "text": "We use x t to denote the atlas, and x to denote an individual surface registered to the atlas. Although the deformation field \u03b4(x) = x \u2212 x t can be used to describe the individual shape, there are three related elements (corresponding to x, y, z coordinates) in \u03b4(x) that are needed to capture local shape changes. For simplicity, we look at only the deformation signal along the surface normal direction to reduce the number of variables considered for each surface location. We apply heat kernel smoothing, which generalizes Gaussian kernel smoothing to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds [27] , to smooth the surface signals and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We use a kernel size of 5mm full-width-half-max (FWHM) in the smoothing.\nWe perform statistical surface analysis to detect: (a) age or gender effect on surface deformation, and (b) group difference (HC vs EMCI, HC vs LMCI, and HC vs AD) on surface deformation after removing the age and gender effects. We consider the following general linear model (GLM):\nwhere the dependent variable y is our surface signal; X = (x 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x p ) are the variables of interest such as Group; Z = (z 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z k ) are the variables whose effects we want to exclude, such as Age and Gender; and\nT and \u03f5 are the coefficients. The goal is to test if X is significant (i.e., \u03a8 \u0338 = 0) for some y \u2208 \u2202\u2126, where \u2202\u2126 indicates the atlas surface manifold. We use SurfStat [22] to test our GLMs. SurfStat is a Matlab toolbox for the statistical analysis of univariate and multivariate surface and volumetric data using linear mixed effects models and random field theory (RFT, for multiple comparison correction) [28] . Figure 1 is the resulting surface atlas colormapped with five hippocampal subfields. Shown in Figure 2 are example T-maps (maps of t statistics) and P-maps (maps of p values, only significant p-values shown, corrected by RFT at both vertex and cluster levels) of selected analyses. Shown in Table I are the numbers of significant surface vertices in each of five analyses."}, {"section_title": "III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Shown in", "text": "Below we briefly review the results of three diagnostic effects (covaried for age and gender) on surface signals. (1) HC vs EMCI: There was no significant shape change on the entire surface. (2) HC vs LMCI: LMCI demonstrated significant atrophy patterns in 25% of tail, 38% of CA1, 30% of CA2-3, 32% of CA4-DG, and 55% of SUB. (3) HC vs AD: AD demonstrated significant atrophy patterns in 49% of tail, 87% of CA1, 50% of CA2-3, 94% of CA4-DG, and 84% of SUB. While SUB was among the top atrophy regions at both LMCI and AD stages, CA1 and CA4-DG showed modest atrophy at the LMCI stage but severe atrophy at the AD stage.\nRegarding the age, it affected 83% of SUB, 50-56% of Tail, CA1 and CA2-3, and 39% of CA4-DG. The overall pattern was similar to diagnostic effects of LMCI and AD. As to the gender, it affected 47-62% of Tail and CA1, 14-16% of CA2-3 and SUB, and 5% of CA4-DG."}, {"section_title": "IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "A computational framework has been presented for surfacebased morphometric analysis of hippocampal subfields. The major strengths of this framework are as follows: (a) it performs detailed hippocampal shape analysis, (b) it embraces, rather than ignores, the important hippocampal subfield information, and (c) it analyzes regular MRI scans and is applicable to large scale studies. We have demonstrated its effectiveness by applying it to the ADNI data. After controlling the effects of age and gender, we have identified that pre-subiculum and subiculum were among top atrophy regions at both LMCI and AD stages, and CA1 and CA4-DG showed modest atrophy at the LMCI stage but severe atrophy at the AD stage. In this initial effort, we have embraced and mapped the subfield information in hippocampal morphometric analyses. One future direction is to use this important subfield information to guide hippocampal surface registration and facilitate more accurate and robust modeling and analysis of the hippocampal 3D structure.
