Linear mixed models were also used to test the longitudinal association between NfL and [ 18 F]FDG in amyloid positive (Ab1) and negative (Ab2) subjects. Results: Higher concentrations of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid NfL were associated with reduced [ 18 F]FDG uptake in correspondent brain regions.

These would greatly assist therapeutic trial stratification and the clinical management of patients, particularly when disease-modifying drugs become available. Blood-based biomarkers for neurodegeneration can also be used to identify downstream effects on neurodegeneration in clinical trials on drugs with disease-modifying potential [1, 2] . In AD phase I-II trials, for example, these biomarkers may be valuable for decision-making on whether to continue phase III drug development. Both molecular imaging (e.g., amyloid beta [Ab], tau, and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography [PET]) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; Ab, total tau [T-tau], and phosphorylated tau at 181 (P-tau)) based biomarkers accurately identify and track AD pathophysiology [3] . Nonetheless, PET imaging is costly, and access is restricted to specialized centers and implausible to be implemented widely in a general routine assessment of cognitive complaints. CSF sampling is becoming more accepted in clinical routine, but a lumbar puncture may still be regarded as an invasive procedure. Therefore, a blood-based measure would have substantial practical advantages for both clinicians and patients.\nRecent advancements in proteomic assays have demonstrated the potential use of plasma Ab to identify brain Abpositive individuals with moderate-to-high accuracy [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nThe measurement of T-tau in plasma has limited diagnostic value, albeit being slightly but significantly increased in patients with AD [9] but promising data are emerging on P-tau [10] . The most replicated blood biomarker for AD is neurofilament light chain (NfL). NfL is abundantly expressed in large myelinated axons and is promptly released into the CSF and blood under axonal distress and degeneration. Indeed, concentrations of NfL are higher in patients with AD compared with age-matched control subjects [11] . Furthermore, in familial AD studies, NfL appears to be altered around one decade before symptom onset [12, 13] . However, NfL is a disease-unspecific marker, as elevations are observed in other neurodegenerative disorders [14, 15] , inflammatory conditions [16] , and in acute traumatic brain injury [17] . Although the diagnostic specificity of NfL is lacking, the semiautomated measurement of NfL in blood offers the possibility of multiple sample collections to monitor disease progression and potentially treatment response.\nThere are limited studies evaluating longitudinal measures of blood NfL in sporadic AD [18, 19] . Furthermore, associations between blood NfL, particularly longitudinal measurements, and established imaging biomarkers for AD are few [11, [19] [20] [21] with no detailed investigation of the association between blood NfL and glucose hypometabolism as measured by [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]FDG) PET. The decreased uptake of [ 18 F]FDG is understood to largely reflect neurodegeneration, more specifically, synaptic damage [22] , and has become an essential tool in the evaluation of suspected AD and related disorders [23, 24] . AD exhibits a characteristic pattern of glucose hypometabolism, involving the precuneus/posterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobule as well as posterolateral and medial aspects of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex [25, 26] . This metabolic signature has been shown to predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia [27] .\nIn this study, we have investigated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of plasma NfL with glucose metabolism as measured by [ 18 F]FDG PET in cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We hypothesized that higher levels of plasma NfL would be associated with greater brain hypometabolism, mainly in those Ab positive, reflecting the underlying physiological and neurodegenerative processes."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "This study uses data obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu), which was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W.

Linear models and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used for demographic comparisons and for cross-sectional analyses, adjusting for age, sex, and group (CU ! CI), where appropriate. We performed linear mixed effect (LME) regression models, using the nlme package, to compare the progression in plasma NfL between groups: (1) CU versus CI and (2) CU Ab2 versus CU Ab1, CI Ab2, and CI Ab1. The LME included plasma NfL as the dependent variable, the interaction between the independent variables time and group, the covariates sex and age at baseline NfL, and a random intercept. The 95% confidence intervals were estimated based on the estimated fitted value across the distribution from thousand simulations of the model that includes all variations except theta. All tests mentioned previously were two-sided with a significance level of P , .05. LME was also performed at the voxel level to check the association between plasma NfL and [ 18 F]FDG. Two models were applied using VoxelStats [34] . First, the model tested the association between [ 18 F]FDG and plasma NfL, adjusting for baseline age, sex, collection time point and time difference between the plasma measurement, and the [ 18 F]FDG acquisition, with a random intercept and accounting for the repeated measures of the longitudinal data. In the second model, we examined the longitudinal association between the interaction of plasma NfL with time in relation to [ 18 F]FDG, also adjusting for age, sex, and time difference between NfL and [ 18 F]FDG. Here, time was treated as a categorical variable. Both models were performed in the CU and CI groups. Voxel-based linear models were also used to examine the cross-sectional association of both plasma NfL and CSF NfL with [ 18 F]FDG. The models were corrected for age at biofluid collection, sex, and time interval between biofluid and PET acquisition. These analyses were also performed within the CU and CI groups.

Although their ubiquitous and unspecific increase in many neurologic conditions limit their diagnostic value, they have potential as a biomarker of disease progression. Therefore, associations between NfL with established biomarkers of AD (e.g., [ 18 F]FDG) are fundamentally important to interpret NfL plasma levels. Unlike other potential blood biomarkers, the correlation of NfL in blood and CSF has been consistently high across various studies [14, 16, 37] . Likewise, in this study we found an excellent correlation between NfL quantified in the plasma and CSF compartments. Remarkably, using a voxelwise approach, we have shown that the association between regional glucose metabolism with either plasma or CSF NfL levels converge to the same regions. The fact that these associations were present in both CI and CU groups further reinforces the potential use of plasma NfL as a surrogate measure for CSF NfL or neurodegeneration.\nLongitudinally, we have shown that there is a group effect of NfL progression, in which CI participants displayed higher concentrations of plasma NfL over 24 months compared with CU participants. However, the NfL rate of change was not statistically different between these two groups. In line with a recent report [19] , group stratification based on Ab status showed that Ab1 subjects present greater changes in plasma NfL over time compared with CU Ab2 subjects. This finding suggests that increases in plasma NfL are able to detect Ab-related neuronal injury at an early stage. This is also supported by previous studies in familial AD [12, 13] , Down syndrome [38] [39] [40] , and unbiased proteomics in CU Ab1 individuals [41] .\nRegarding the anatomic distribution, to our knowledge, this is the first study at the voxel level showing that within both CU Ab1 and CI Ab1 subjects metabolic abnormalities occur in AD-related cortical regions. This supports a framework in which NfL combined with a biomarker of Ab might convey AD-related neurodegeneration. Indeed, among Ab2 subjects, the association between plasma NfL and [ 18 F]FDG did not conform to patterns seen in AD, suggesting that neuronal injury was because of other causes than AD.\nThe present findings also revealed that increases in the association between plasma NfL and glucose metabolism over 24 months were only detected in Ab1 CI subjects. This result is in line with a previous study that demonstrated that the presence of both Ab and neurofibrillary tangle pathology is necessary to increase brain hypometabolism over a 2-year period [42] . Although we did not have access to tau-related data in our study, it is very likely that most Ab1 participants are also tau positive (T1, i.e., neurofibrillary tangle positive). This was evidenced by postmortem studies showing that over 80% of MCI and AD subjects pathologically classified as probable or definite AD-according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease criteriaalso showed Braak stage 3 [43, 44] . In fact, we have previously shown that plasma NfLs are highest in postmortem cases with Braak stage V/VI [18] . Thus, it is important to highlight that plasma NfL may be able to track neurodegenerative changes that do not necessarily reflect detectable clinical decline in the same period of time.\nCertain methodological aspects limit the interpretation of our findings. It is relevant to mention that the period of biofluid collection and PET imaging acquisition was not invariably the same, although models accounted for the time difference between measurements. The reduced sample size of some of the groups could also have an impact on the results as not all the subjects included in the LME models had longitudinal data. In addition, other important biomarkers of neuronal function/dysfunction such as neurogranin, T-tau, and P-tau were not assessed in the present study. Finally, certain demographic differences were found between the groups; these, however, were accounted for in our statistical models.\nIn conclusion, this study adds further evidence that plasma NfL is reflective of CSF NfL but more importantly reflects longitudinal neurodegeneration, indexed by FDG PET. In the ADNI cohort, increased plasma NfL in Ab1 participants was associated with advanced glucose hypometabolism, with longitudinal changes confined to CI Ab1 individuals."}]
