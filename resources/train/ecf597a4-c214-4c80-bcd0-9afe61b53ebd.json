[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The literature has repeatedly documented aggregate R&D appears pro-cyclical: it co-moves positively with aggregate output over time. 1 Many researchers have taken such pro-cyclicality as evidence questioning the conventional Schumpeterian view that suggests innovative activities, including R&D, should be concentrated during downturns when their opportunity cost as forgone output is low. 2 This paper investigates whether aggregate R&D's pro-cyclicality truly reflects the timing of R&D and, more importantly, what are the causes and consequences of such procyclicality. We are motivated by the fact that the business cycle itself is a co-movement phenomenon: it is characterized by extensive co-movement of various sectors, which contributes significantly to aggregate volatility . To investigate whether co-movement matters to aggregate R&D's pro-cyclicality, we decompose aggregate R&D and real GDP into those at the industry level and hence the covariance between aggregate R&D growth and real GDP growth into a \"within-industry\" and a \"cross-industry\" components. The former reflects how each industry's R&D co-varies with its own output, and the latter captures how R&D and output co-move across industries. Applying such decomposition exercises to the case of the U.S., we find the cross-industry component accounts for 94.37% of the covariance between aggregate R&D growth and real GDP growth. In other words, the observed pro-cyclical aggregate R&D is largely an inter-industry co-movement phenomenon, just as the business cycle itself. What drives such inter-industry co-movement of R&D and output? In exploring this question, our findings point to capital-good industries -Machinery, Electronics, and Transportation Equipment. They are major R&D performers; their R&D co-varies positively and strongly with many other industries' output, accounting for all of the observed inter-industry R&D-output co-movement. When examining the inter-industry input-output linkage as a potential factor, our findings once again highlight the role of capital-good industries: they demand large shares of output from as well as supply significant amount of input for most of other industries; moreover, the strength in their R&D's co-movement with other industries' output rises in the strength of the input-output linkage. Based on these findings, we propose input-output linkage as a propagation mechanism causing synchronized output responses to variations in capital-good R&D, giving rise to the observed inter-industry R&D-output comovement. We estimate the strength of such input-output propagation, and apply our estimates to approximate aggregate R&D's cyclicality in the U.S. Our approximation exercises suggest the input-output propagation explains over 50% of the observed aggregate R&D's pro-cyclicality and amplifies aggregate fluctuations by about 15%. The importance of the input-output linkage for macroeconomic outcome has long been recognized. It has been proposed by Horvath (2000) as an important factor for short-run fluctuations, and by Jones (2011) as a helpful element explaining long-run national income. 3 However, our results suggest the input-output linkage matters not only for short-run cycles and long-run growth per se, but also for the link between the two. In particular, for understanding this link the cyclicality of innovation activities by industries that serve as input-output network \"hubs\" should be the key. In the case of the U.S., capital-good industries are broad demanders and key suppliers for other industries, so that variations in their R&D are accompanied by synchronized fluctuations in other industries' output. As a result, lower capital-good R&D during downturns amplifies short-run fluctuations on the one hand, and hinders long-run growth of the entire economy on the other hand, both through the input-output propagation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 carries out the decomposition exercises. Section 4 explores input-output linkage in driving interindustry co-movement between R&D and output. Section 5 estimates the strength of input-output propagation and investigates its quantitatively significance. We conclude in Section 6."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Two data sources are combined to construct a disaggregated industry panel of R&D and output. Data on R&D by industry is taken from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that publishes nominal R&D expenditures for 22 industry groups mostly at the level of approximately two-digit 1987 SIC. 4 The NSF publishes both company-financed and federal-financed R&D. Only data on company-financed R&D are used for the purpose of this paper. Some industry-year observations are suppressed to avoid disclosure of individual firms' operations. However, in all but three of these observations, either company-financed R&D or total R&D is suppressed, but not both. Following Shea (1998), we use growth in total R&D to interpolate gaps in the series of company-financed R&D. The three observations where company-financed R&D and total R&D are both suppressed are R&D by Textile and Apparel (SIC 22 and 23) in 1989, R&D by Rubber (SIC 30) in 1991, and R&D by Other Equipments (SIC 361-364, 369) in 1991. We interpolate 4 Starting from 1999, R&D industries are defined according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) instead of the SIC. To make the year-to-year comparison more convenient, the NSF transforms the 1997-1998 R&D-by-industry series under the SIC into those under the NAICS. Unfortunately, the concordance behind the transformation remains confidential. Moreover, it is claimed that \"the estimates for 1997 and 1998 (after transformation) are not necessarily representative of the NAICS categories of industries in those years\u2026as it may involve a large number of errors.\" (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srs01410/). these three gaps using growth in company-financed R&D based on the original NSF publications back in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. 5 Following Barlevy (2007), we convert the R&D series into 2000 dollars using the GDP deflator. Alternative deflators from the R&D Satellite account published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) generate similar results. All details are available upon request. Data on manufacturing output are taken from the NBER manufacturing productivity (MP) databases that provide production data for 469 four-digit manufacturing industries from 1958 to 1996, and recently extended to 2005. Our results are robust to leaving the extended part of the data out of the analysis. The MP data are aggregated to the R&D industries defined by the NSF. Output is measured as real value added, as the deflated value added using shipment-valueweighted price deflator. 6 Data on non-manufacturing output is from the series of GDP by industries published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Table 1 decomposes aggregate R&D and real GDP in the U.S. from 1958 to 1998 into those by non-manufacturing sectors and by 21 manufacturing industry groups. Manufacturing industries are further divided into those of non-durable goods and of durable goods. Column 2 lists each industry's average share of aggregate R&D; Column 3 reports its average share of real GDP. According to Column 2, R&D in the U.S. is overwhelmingly dominated by the manufacturing sector that accounts for 92.19% of the observed total R&D expenditures, among which 25.65% is from non-durable manufacturing industries and 66.54% is from durable manufacturing industries. By contrast, only 20.52% of real GDP is from the manufacturing sector, among which non-durable manufacturing industries take 8.07% and durable manufacturing industries take 12.45%. Two factors contribute to the dominance of manufacturing R&D on aggregate R&D in the U.S. reported by the NSF. First, producers of intermediate goods and capital goods are usually also active innovators. In the U.S., the manufacturing sector is an important provider of intermediate goods and capital goods for the rest of the economy. For example, Long and Plosser (1987) report that the manufacturing sector constitutes over 40% of the production cost of the construction sector. Second, the Survey of Industrial Research and Development (SIRD), on which the NSF R&D series are based, was designed in the 1950s when the U.S. economy was largely manufacturing based. 7 Hence, SIRD has most likely missed a significant amount of ongoing R&D by non-manufacturing firms. Nonetheless, many researchers have documented procyclical aggregate R&D for the case of the U.S. based on the NSF R&D data. Thus, we proceed to explore the causes of pro-cyclical aggregate R&D employing the NSF R&D data, and discuss in following sections the potential influence of such data limitation on our results."}, {"section_title": "Decomposition", "text": "Following Shea (1996) and Comin and Philippon (2005), we approximate the growth rate of aggregate R&D, denoted as R, and that of aggregate output, denoted as Y, as the weighted averages of R&D growth and output growth by N disaggregated industries: (1) and are industry i's long-run shares of aggregate R&D and aggregate output. Let and to be 1-by-N vectors whose elements are and ; let , and to be N-by-N variance-covariance matrixes of industry R&D, of industry output, and between industry R&D and industry output; let to denote the variance of aggregate R&D growth, to be that of aggregate output growth, and to be the covariance between aggregate R&D growth and aggregate output growth. Then, , , and are approximately: (2) (2) decomposes the variances of R and Y and their covariance into \"within-industry\" components from the diagonals of \u03a9's and \"cross-industry\" components from the off-diagonal elements of \u03a9's. The \"within-industry\" components reflect how R&D growth and output growth vary or co-vary within each industry, weighted by their R&D shares and output shares. The \"cross-industry\" components capture the inter-industry co-movements of R&D growth, of output growth, and between R&D growth and output growth, weighted by their R&D shares and output shares."}, {"section_title": "Decomposition Results", "text": "We apply (2) to our industry panel of R&D and output. The decomposition results are summarized in Table 2. Aggregate R&D and real GDP are decomposed into two groups in Panel A as manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, into three groups in Panel B as non-durable manufacturing industries, durable manufacturing industries, and non-manufacturing sectors, and into 22 groups in Panel C as 21 manufacturing industry groups and non-manufacturing sectors. Column 2 lists the observed variance and covariance; Column 3 reports the approximated variance and covariance based on (2); Columns 4 and 5 present the within-industry and crossindustry components. Column 6 summarizes the fractions of the variances and covariance attributable to the cross-industry components. Column 7 reports the averages of the pair-wise correlation coefficients between industry output growths, between industry R&D growths, or between industry R&D and output growths. Table 2 suggests the following. First and unsurprisingly, output co-moves positively across industries. For example, according to Panel C, the pair-wise correlation coefficients of industry output growth average 0.4908; inter-industry output co-movement accounts for 64.35% of the volatility in real GDP growth. This is consistent with the existing literature that documents the business cycle as a \"co-movement\" phenomenon. For example,  observe most sectors in the U.S. to move up and down together over the business cycle; Shea (1995) documents inter-industry employment co-movement at the three-digit SIC level accounts for about 95% of the volatility in total U.S. manufacturing employment; he also reports quantitatively similar results hold for output. Second, R&D does not co-move as much across industries. The pair-wise correlation coefficients between industry R&D growths are negative both in Panel A and in Panel B. This suggests inter-industry R&D co-movement dampens rather than facilitates aggregate R&D volatilities. In Panel C with the decomposition conducted at approximately the two-digit SIC level, the average pair-wise correlation coefficient turns positive, but is very small quantitatively; inter-industry R&D co-movement accounts for only 13.56% of aggregate R&D volatilities. Third, R&D and output co-move positively across industries. The pair-wise correlation coefficients between industry R&D growth and industry output growth are positive in all three panels, although relatively small quantitatively. However, such co-movement plays a dominant role in driving pro-cyclical aggregate R&D: its share of the approximated covariance between aggregate R&D growth and real GDP growth is 50.63% in Panel A, 91.25% in Panel B, and 94.37% in Panel C of Table 2. Put differently, at the approximately two-digit SIC level, interindustry R&D-output co-movement accounts for 94.37% of the pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D, but inter-industry output co-movement takes only 64.35% of volatilities in real GDP. This result suggests inter-industry co-movement is a key factor in explaining the pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D, even more so than its role in accounting for aggregate output volatilities documented by  and Shea (1995)."}, {"section_title": "Pro-cyclical Aggregate R&D and the Schumpeterian View", "text": "The literature has taken pro-cyclical aggregate R&D as evidence against the conventional Schumpeterian view (Aghion et al., 2005;Barlevy, 2007;Francois and Lloyd-Ellis, 2009). This view argues, as long as innovation competes with production for resources, a rational entrepreneur who balances innovation and production inter-temporarily would choose to perform more R&D when the return to output, the opportunity cost of R&D, is low. 8 Under the representative-firm paradigm, this view contradicts the observed pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D. Now consider a framework of heterogeneous firms, and let our sample industries represent firms that produce various products and engage in innovation. Then (2) suggests the average timing of R&D, as whether an industry's R&D is concentrated when its own output is low or high, is reflected by the \"within-industry\" component. Based on these findings, we argue the conventional Schumpeterian view should be examined at the detailed industry level or at the firm level, to uncover how various producers choose the timing of innovation, and to shed light on when and why the Schumpeterian theory fails the data."}, {"section_title": "Source of Comovement", "text": "We proceed to examine the source of inter-industry R&D-output co-movement that dominates pro-cyclical aggregate R&D. Two factors have to be considered: a size effect, as bigger industries have more influence on total comovement, and a comovement effect arising from either the R&D end or the output end, as an industry's contribution to total comovement depends on how its R&D co-moves with others' output as well as on how its output co-moves with others' R&D. We move our analysis to a more disaggregated level of 22 industry groups. Define a 22by-22 matrix C, whose (i, j) element equals , the correlation coefficient between and have the same mean; so do and . In higher moments, however, the distributions on the R&D end differ greatly from those on the output end: in Panel A, is clustered around the mean; but the distribution of is more spread out, displaying fat tails on both sides. Panel B shows similar patterns for and . Figure 1 delivers a message similar to that suggested by Table 3: industries differ little in how their output co-moves with others' R&D, but differ greatly in how their R&D co-moves with others' output. This message suggests we should focus on the R&D end to explore the source of the comovement."}, {"section_title": "Capital-good R&D", "text": "We combine the size effect with the comovement effect, defining the following two variables: (3) is the sum of the share-weighted co-variances between industry i's R&D and other industries' output. is that between industry i's output and other industries' R&D.   Capital-good R&D dominates inter-industry R&D-output co-movement due to both the size effect and the comovement effect. Capital-good industries are the biggest R&D performers: according to Table 1, altogether they compose only 5.87% of real GDP but account for 50.45% of aggregate R&D. Moreover, capital-good R&D tends to co-moves positively and strongly with most other industries' output. 9 This is shown in Figure 2, which plots the matrix of correlation coefficients between industry R&D growth and output growth. Again, the diagonals are set to zeros to focus on inter-industry comovement. In For example, the mean correlation coefficient is only 0.0507 for the entire matrix, but equals 0.0927 for Machinery, 0.1826 for Electronics, and 0.215 for Transportation Equipment."}, {"section_title": "Input-output Matrixes", "text": "What drives inter-industry co-movement between R&D and output? The literature has provided several hypotheses on the causes for comovement, including aggregate shocks, inputoutput propagation, or geographical propagation (Shea, 2002). Under the aggregate-shock hypothesis, R&D and output co-move positively due to common aggregate shocks, assuming R&D and output respond in the same direction. However, Figure 1 and Figure 2 both display great cross-industry heterogeneity on the R&D end of the comovement, therefore providing little support for aggregate shocks as a key driving force. Under the input-output propagation hypothesis, a shock to a particular industry is propagated to the rest of the economy through factor-demand linkages, so that fluctuations in aggregates are obtained as synchronized responses to shocks in certain industries that serve as broad suppliers or demanders. The input-output propagation can cause downstream R&D and upstream output to co-move positively: for example, a positive technology shock to Electronics raises Electrical R&D, as electrical companies attempt to develop such technology into further productivity gain; at the same time, such positive technology shock can generate higher demand for factor inputs, so that output by upstream industries such as Metals rises. 10 Input-output propagation can drive upstream R&D and downstream output to co-move positively: for example, a negative demand shock to Transportation Equipment reduces Transportation Equipment output as well as its demand for factor inputs such as Rubber, which tightens borrowing constraints by Rubber companies so that Rubber R&D declines. 11 To examine the factor-demand linkages among our sample industries, we examine two indicators following Shea (1993): the ultimate-demand share (UDS) and the ultimate-cost share (UCS). The UDS of industry I for industry J is the share of J's output ultimately embodied in the final demand for I. The UCS of industry Y for industry X is the production cost of X ultimately originating in Y. By definition, the UDS captures the impact of a downstream industry on an upstream industry as a demander; and the UCS reflects that of an upstream industry on an downstream industry as a supplier. We construct UDS and UCS based on the 1992 make Our results are robust to considering direct linkages only or taking off capital-good flows. Details are described in the appendix. Each row indicates an upstream or input industry; each column indicates a downstream or use industry. In particular, an (i,j) entry in the UDS matrix equals the UDS of industry j for industry i; and that in the UCS matrix is the UCS of industry i for industry j. The diagonals are set to zeros in order to focus on inter-industry linkages. Only shares greater than 2% and 4% are plotted. In Figure 3, the UDS matrix shows several vertical patterns, suggesting a few key industries demand output from most other industries in relatively large shares; these are Food (SIC 20 and  According to the network analysis, they serve as input-output network \"hubs\" in our sample (Carvalho, 2010). This is consistent the strong positive co-movement between capital-good R&D and other industries' output reported in Table 4, and suggests the possibility input-output linkage propagates capital-good R&D variations to output responses by the rest of the economy. It is difficult to directly compare our UDS and UCS with the input-output structure the literature has documented for the U.S. economy, which are produced either at different aggregation levels, in a commodity-by-commodity format, or incorporating only direct flow of intermediate goods. Nonetheless, Shea (1993) reports, based on the 1972 input-output tables, Transportation Equipment demands large output shares from many other industries, consistent with the pattern shown by our UDS matrix. Jones (2010) shows, with a commodity-by-industry cost-share matrix, a few key inputs are used by many industries in significantly ways, consistent with the patterns displayed by our UCS matrix. Similar patterns in the UCS matrix is also documented by Carvalho (2010) with a commodity-by-commodity cost-share matrix at roughly four-digit SIC level for the U. S. economy in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997."}, {"section_title": "The Comovement Strength and Input-output Linkage.", "text": "To investigate the relationship between input-output linkage plotted in Figure 3 and the strength of inter-industry co-movement displayed in Figure 2, we estimate the following: is the correlation coefficient between R&D growth by industry i and output growth by industry j. The first letter of the subscripts of UDS and UCS denotes the upstream industry, and the second letter denotes the downstream industry. For example, is the ultimate demand share of industry j for industry i; is the ultimate cost share of industry i for industry j. Given that R is indexed by i and Y is indexed by j in (4), UDSji and UCSij reflect the influence of the R&D industry on the output industry; conversely, UDSij and UCSji represent that of the output industry on the R&D industry. Table 5 summarizes the OLS results of (4). Row 2 reports those for the full sample; the sample size is 462. Neither of the estimated coefficients on UDSij and UCSji is statistically significant, but those on UDSji and UCSij are both positive and statistically significant at the 5% level or above. This suggests input-output linkage does contribute to the strength of the interindustry co-movement between R&D and output, but the causality runs from the R&D industry to the output industry only. In particular, R&D and output co-move more strongly, when the R&D industry either constitutes, from upstream, a bigger share of the production cost of the output industry or demands, from downstream, a higher percentage of the products by the output industry. Then we divide the full sample into two sub samples, one containing R&D by five capital-good industries, and the other including R&D by 17 non-capital goods industries. The sample size is 105 for the first sample and 357 for the second sample. The results are robust to pooling the two samples together but allowing the coefficients to differ for capital-good R&D and non-capital-good R&D. We re-run the OLS regression of (4) for each of the two sub samples. Row 3 of Table 5 reports, for the sub sample of capital-good R&D, the estimated coefficients on UDSji and UCSij are both positive and significant at the 1% level; they are also bigger in point estimates compared to those for the full sample. For the sub sample of noncapital-good R&D, however, none of the estimates are statistically significant. This suggests the relationship between input-output linkage and the strength of inter-industry co-movement comes entirely from capital-good R&D. This once again points to capital-good R&D as a key element for inter-industry R&D-output co-movement and to input-output propagation as a potential explanation."}, {"section_title": "Propagation", "text": "Our results in Section 4 are consistent with the input-output propagation hypothesis, under which capital-good R&D fluctuations are propagated by input-output linkage to the rest of the economy as synchronized output responses.

The estimate on \u03c3 is 0.0549, significant at the 1% level, suggesting a 10% increase in industry R&D growth is associated with about a 0.5% increase in industry output growth after controlling for common aggregate shocks and inter-industry input-output propagation. This estimate would be 0.0686, significant at the 5% level, if controlling for aggregate shocks only. As a comparison, regressing real GDP growth on a constant and aggregate R&D growth in the U.S. over the sample period generates an estimated coefficient of 0.2083 on aggregate R&D growth, significant at the 5% level. This suggests the pro-cyclicality of R&D is much milder at the industry level and after controlling for the input-output propagation, consistent with our decomposition results reported in Table 2. However, Panel A, Column 2 of Table 6 reports neither of the estimates on or are statistically significant. Nonetheless, recall the estimation results of (4) suggest input-output linkage contributes to the strength of co-movement related to capital-good R&D only. Therefore, we run the OLS regression of (5) again, allowing and to differ for capital-good R&D and for non-capital-goods R&D. The results are summarized in Panel A, Columns 3 and 4, of Table   6. For capital-good R&D, the estimates on and are both positive and statistically significant at the 1% level; in particular, a 10% higher UDS-weighted growth in capital-good R&D is associated with 14.61% higher growth in upstream output, and a 10% higher UCSweighted growth in capital-good R&D is with 24.63% higher downstream output growth. For non-capital-good R&D, however, none of the estimates on and is statistically significant. Consistent with the estimation results of (4), the results reported in Panel A of Table 6 suggest the input-output linkage propagates capital-good R&D only. Moreover, note that aggregate shocks directly influence industry output and capital-good R&D. With input-output propagation, its impact on capital-good R&D would be propagated to other industries' output, causing further influence on industry output. We specify capital-good R&D as: . \u03b7 represents the direct impact of aggregate shocks on capital-good R&D and is allowd to differ by capital-good industry; \u00b5 captures capital-good R&D variations driven by industryspecific shocks. Combining (6) with (5) gives: , where (7) estimates how input-output linkage propagates industry-specific capital-good R&D variations to other industries' output variations, controlling for the impact of aggregate shocks and the within-industry R&D-output co-variation.

Apparently, the calculated value depends crucially on , the approximated variance-covariance matrix between output by 22 industries and R&D by five capital-good industries. We apply four approximations on to evaluate the quantitative significance of aggregate shocks, industry-specific shocks, and input-output propagation to the pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D. The results are summarized in Note that, the direct impact of aggregate shocks on capital-good R&D would be propagated to other industries' output via input-output linkage, causing further comovement between capital-good R&D and other industries' output.

It gives a covariance of , accounting for 50.30% of the observed total co-movement and 47.45% of the observed total covariance. In sum, Table 7 suggests that the input-output propagation helps to account for 57.90% of the inter-industry R&D-output comovement, and 54.62% of the cyclicality of aggregate R&D. Moreover, the input-output propagation of capital-good R&D can amplify the volatilities in aggregate output. Panel B of Table 7 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion: Consequences", "text": "What do our results imply on the consequences of pro-cyclical aggregate R&D? First, pro-cyclical aggregate R&D reflects an amplification effect on the short-run cycle, caused by the input-output propagation of pro-cyclical capital-good R&D; we estimate its quantitative significance to be about 15%. Second, our results imply input-output structure has significant influence on the impact of short-run cycles on long-run growth. Among our sample industries, capital-good industries serve as input-output network \"hubs\"; as a result, lower capital-good R&D during recessions hinder long-run growth of not only capital-good industries themselves but also other industries through the input-output propagation. In summary, input-output linkage amplifies the impact of the business cycle in the short-run and, in principle, propagates it into the long-run. However, not all industries display pro-cyclical R&D. For example, Table 1 suggests Petroleum Refining R&D is counter-cyclical, which is also documented by Ouyang (2010a). Higher Petroleum Refining R&D during recessions can also cause synchronized output increases in its upstream and downstream industries, dampening the short-run business cycle and promoting long-run growth of itself and its related industries through the input-output propagation. Likely, the dampening effect of counter-cyclical Petroleum Refining R&D is 16 Only contemporaneous relationship between output and R&D is estimated in this paper, because our experimentation with R&D lags suggest lagged effect of capital-good R&D on other industries' output is usually statistically insignificant. However, this does not imply capital-good R&D cannot influence other industries' output with lags: including lagged effect in an annual panel tends to reduce the sample size and the degrees of freedom of the estimation; moreover, it is hard to determine the lag length for innovative activities to have real return: some innovation project may generate prompt return, while others can take decades to have real outcome. dominated by the amplification effect of pro-cyclical capital-good R&D, not only because the latter takes higher aggregate R&D share, but also because capital-good industries possess stronger input-output linkage with the rest of the economy. This suggests, once again, the inputoutput structure of an economy is an important factor for understanding the link between shortrun cycles and long-run growth. What determines the cyclicality of industry R&D is beyond the scope of this paper, and has been explored by Ouyang (2010aOuyang ( , 2010bOuyang ( , and 2010c. We should also be aware of the potential influence on our results of the sample selection bias of the NSF R&D survey. As pointed out earlier, the NSF R&D data has most likely missed a significant amount of on-going R&D by non-manufacturing industries. If those non-reported R&D is in fact counter-cyclical, then the dampening impact of counter-cyclical nonmanufacturing R&D may dominate the amplification effect of pro-cyclical capital R&D because, according to Figure 3, non-manufacturing industry group also display high UDS and UCS with the rest of the economy. It is also possible that, with improved R&D data in the future, we find the amplification effect of some industries' pro-cyclical R&D and the dampening effect of other industries' counter-cyclical R&D fully cancel out, so that the net effect of short-run cycles on long-run growth through the R&D channel is in fact zero."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Pro-cyclical aggregate R&D has been taken as evidence against the conventional Schumpeterian view arguing entrepreneurs innovate more when producing less. We decompose aggregate R&D and real GDP in the U.S. into those by industries at various levels. Perhaps surprisingly, we find pro-cyclical aggregate R&D is in fact a co-movement phenomenon. For example, at the approximately two-digit SIC level, only 5.63% of the pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D reflects within-industry R&D-output co-variation, but 94.37% is caused by inter-industry co-movement. The quantitative significance of such co-movement in driving aggregate R&D pro-cyclical is even greater than its accounting for aggregate volatilities long recognized in the literature. When exploring driving forces for inter-industry R&D-output co-movement, our findings point to the importance of capital-good R&D, namely, R&D by Machinery (SIC 35), Electronics (SIC 36), and Transportation Equipment (SIC 37). In particular, capital-good R&D co-moves with other industries' output, causing all of the observed co-movement and driving aggregate R&D pro-cyclical. Moreover, we find input-output linkage contributes to the strength of such comovement, and the causality runs from capital-good industries to others. We propose inputoutput linkage as a mechanism that propagates variations in capital-good R&D to other industries' output, and estimate the strength of this propagation. Our results suggest input-output propagation helps to account for over 50% of the pro-cyclicality of aggregate R&D, and amplifies aggregate output volatilities by about 15%. We posit an economy's input-put structure should be an important factor for the link between short-run cycles and long-run growth.

Data Appendix: The Construction of the Ultimate Demand"}, {"section_title": "Shares and the Ultimate Cost Shares", "text": "This appendix describes the construction of the ultimate demand shares and the ultimate cost shares. The base technique follows Shea (1991). Lawson (1997) provides details on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)'s 1992 input-output tables. Bonds and Aylor (1998) discuss the associated 1992 capital flow tables."}, {"section_title": "Input-Output and Capital Flow Tables", "text": "The BEA's input-output tables detail the production and consumption of goods in the U.S. economy, using data from the Census Bureau. The tables are published every five years. To construct the demand and cost matrices, we use the 1992 version of three of the BEA's tables: the make table, the use table, and the capital flow table. The make table details the production of goods by industries. Each row of the make table shows the production of goods for a particular industry, while each column shows the distribution of production of a commodity over industries. This setup gives the make table an industry-by-commodity format, with row i, column j denoting the production of commodity j by industry i. The use table explains the consumption of commodities by industries, by government, and by other non-producing entities. Each row of the use table gives the distribution of consumption for a particular commodity by various industries, while each column gives the consumption of various commodities by a particular industry. Therefore, row i, column j is the consumption of commodity i by industry j, giving the use table a commodity-by-industry format. The BEA assigns each commodity to a BEA input-output commodity category, which is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. From there, the BEA assigns each firm to a BEA input-output industry category based on the type of commodity which composes the majority of its production. For example, a firm primarily engaged in the production of For the BEA industries and commodities with no corresponding SIC code, we leave the industries and commodities in the BEA format. This procedure yields a 32-commodity-by-72industry use table with row i, column j as the amount of commodity i consumed by industry j. We refer to this transformed use table as , with superscript CI denoting the commodity-byindustry format. After this conversion procedure, we follow Shea (1991)  Construction of uses the BEA's industry shares assumption. For example, suppose 80% of the produced value of cell phones come from the cell phone industry and the remaining 20% is produced by the computer industry. If the insurance industry buys 100 dollars worth of cell phones, then the BEA industry shares assumption assigns 80 dollars of this purchase to the cell phone industry and 20 dollars to the computer industry. is the basis for calculating both the ultimate demand shares and the ultimate cost shares. We first detail the construction of the ultimate demand shares followed by the ultimate cost shares. To add detail about the flow of capital goods to , we turn to the BEA's capital flow We construct the 22-industry-by-58-industry capital flow matrix, , by equation  As noted by Shea (1991), construction of the cost shares is more complicated. The interindustry cost linkages require the estimation of implicit rental costs of capital which, in general, is unequal to the purchase price of capital. To estimate the inter-industry cost linkages, we convert the industry-by-industry capital flow matrix, , into a matrix of implicit rental costs. This estimation involves the following steps: We re-create the capital flow matrix, , at a more disaggregated level. We call  table up to the set of aggregated SIC industries or the single make table commodity. Table A1 displays the result of this mapping procedure for commodities we apply it to. For example, Table A1 shows the capital flow table has data for SIC codes 3491 (Industrial Valves), 3494 (Valves and Pipe Fittings, Not Elsewhere Classified), and 3498 (Fabricated Pipe and Pipe Fittings) as separate commodities. After our aggregation procedure these three commodities are combined into a single commodity. Our aggregation procedure yields a 124-commodity-by-63-industry capital flow matrix after removal of the Real Estate industry. We append a row of zeros and a column of zeros to , giving a final size of 125-commodities-by-64-industries, with the final column and final row as zeros. Again, we append the column of zeros because the capital flow table omits the capital purchases of government and other non-producing entities. We append the row of zeros because only a subset of industries produce capital goods. Similarly, we adjust the make table to be 125-industries-by-125-commodities, as opposed to the 22-industry-by-22-commodity . We call this new make table . The rules for reclassification are as follows: first, if a particular commodity in corresponds to exactly one reclassified commodity in , then it is assigned to that reclassified commodity of : the majority of commodities in the make table fall into this category. For the remainder of the make table commodities, where a single make table commodity maps to multiple reclassified commodities, we split the output of the make table commodity over the reclassified commodities proportional to the categories the make table commodity corresponds to in the original capital flow table. We document these cases in Table A2. For commodities present in the make table and not present in the capital flow table, we classify them into an Other commodity. For example, when reclassifying the output of make table commodity 420800, we assign 75% of the output to commodity 3491, 3494, and 3498 and the remaining 25% to the Other commodity. We construct the 125-industry-by-64-industry capital flow matrix, , according to equation (A8). We then convert into an industry-by-industry capital stock matrix, , following Abel and Blanchard (1986). We denote the depreciation rate of capital The matrix is 125-industries-by-64-industries. Following Shea (1991), we use the top marginal tax rate of u = 0.34. We proxy the opportunity cost of borrowing by the interest rate on 10 year U.S. treasuries, as in Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994), which sets r = 0.0701. Unlike Shea (1991) and Hall and Jorgenson (1967), we ignore the investment tax credit and potential carryovers because in 1992, the only investment tax credits available were for specific assets the consumption of which we are unable to distinguish in the make table or the capital flow table. These credits were the rehabilitation credit, the energy credit, and the reforestation credit. The rehabilitation credit applies to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of certain old or historic structures. The energy credit is for generation of alternative energy. The reforestation credit is for reforestation expenses. Calculating the present discounted value of capital consumption for each asset, , depends on the tax rules. The 1992 tax rules stipulate different depreciation methods for an asset as a function of an asset's estimated service life. If an asset had an estimated service life of 3-10 years, 200% declining balance depreciation was used, switching to straight line depreciation when the value of straight line depreciation exceeded the 200% declining balance method. For assets with an estimated service life of 11-20 years, 150% declining balance depreciation was used, switching to straight line depreciation when the value of straight line depreciation exceeded the 150% declining balance method. For assets with an estimated service life of over 20 years, straight line depreciation was the only allowable method. We obtain data on the estimated service life for capital goods for various assets from the BEA's Depreciation Estimates (BEA 2010b). Using the estimated service life for each capital good, we calculate the discounted present value of each asset according to the appropriate tax rules. We discount the tax deduction with a discrete formula once a year with a discount rate r = 0.0701. With the estimated matrix of rental costs of capital, , we can compute the cost shares. Let be a 22-by-22 matrix composed of the producing industries of . Let be a 22-by-22 matrix created by recategorizing to match the classification of . We create the estimated 22-industry-by-22-industry cost flow matrix, , using equation (A13).
