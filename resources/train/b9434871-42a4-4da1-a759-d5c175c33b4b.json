[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report uses data from the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study to profile undergraduates who were enrolled in U.S. postsecondary institutions in the academic year 1995-96. The report begins with an essay that explores the extent to which undergraduates work while they are in school. This essay found that 79 percent of undergraduates reported working while in school; half worked to help pay for their education and 29 percent considered themselves primarily employees who were also taking classes. Working students were employed an average of 25 hours per week, with 20 percent of full-time students also working full-time. Working students noted that working limited their class schedules, and about 25 percent reported that work adversely affected their academic performance. A negative effect was also found between work and one-year persistence. Students who worked fewer hours were more likely than those who worked more hours to borrow to pay for their educations. The report's data tables are grouped into those on the essay's topic; supplemental data about work; enrollment and attendance; degree program, field of study, and grade point average; student characteristics; financial aid; and educational aspirations and community service. (Appendix contains a glossary, technical notes, and methodology 1 to 15 hours (table 5).1 Taken as a whole, more than one in four Students Who Work reported that work adversely affected their academic schedule or academic performance. The relationship between work and one-year persistence was assessed among Students Who Work by determining who attended for a full academic year (i.e., eight or more months) in 1995-96 relative to the number of hours they worked while enrolled. The amount that students worked was clearly related to the number of months enrolled, especially among first-year students. About one in five first-year students who worked full time were not enrolled for a. full academic year, compared with about one in twenty who worked 1 to 15 hours (figure 6). This pattern was found even after controlling for factors related to persistence such as attendance status, financial aid receipt, institution type, and income. The results also suggested that students who did not work at all while enrolled had higher rates of enrollment interruption than those working '1 to 15 hours. When the work intensity of Students Who Work was analyzed relative to borrowing patterns, undergraduates who worked fewer hours were more likely to borrow than those working more hours. For example, nearly one-half (46 percent) of students working 1 to 15 hours per week borrowed, compared with about one-third of students working either 16 to 20 hours (36 percent) or 21 to 34 hours (36 percent) and about one-quarter of those working full time (table 6). Students who work long hours may have more limited time not only for studying but also for integrating themselves into campus life. While borrowing results in debt that must be repaid when students finish their education, choosing to work intensively in lieu of any borrowing may adversely affect students' academic performance, as well as reduce their chances of completing their degree altogether."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This report provides a detailed overview of approximately 16.7 million undergraduates enrolled in all postsecondary education institutions in the year 1995-96, from July 1 to June 30. It begins with an essay focusing on undergraduates who worked while they were enrolled in school. The essay is followed by a compendium of tables and summary of findings divided into several sections, including the following: The report is based on data from the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96), a survey representing all students (including graduates) enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Its primary purpose is to provide detailed information on how students and their families pay for postsecondary education.2 In addition to detailed financial aid information, the survey provides comprehensive data on enrollment, attendance, and student demographics. There are several sources of data within the survey, including institution data, financial aid records, national loan files, student interviews, and parent interviews. Variables presented in the report are defined in the glossary (appendix A). This report is based on institutional records of approximately 41,400 undergraduates from 832 institutions. About 27,000 undergraduates also were interviewed by telephone. 2For more information, consult the NPSAS:96 methodology report: The 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey Methodology Report (NCES 98-073) (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1998). It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ed.gov/NCES/."}, {"section_title": "UNDERGRADUATES WHO WORK", "text": "In the decade between 1985-86 and 1995-96, undergraduate charges for tuition, room, and board increased 23 percent at public colleges and 36 percent at private colleges.3 As a percentage of family income, these charges grew from about 12 to 15 percent at public colleges and 32 to 42 percent at private colleges.4 While federal financial aid has kept pace with increases in tuition and fees over the same time period, a smaller proportion of federal aid has been distributed in the form of grants and a larger proportion in the form of loans.5 Faced with increases in education costs, many undergraduates rely heavily on work to help pay for their postsecondary education. Recent reports indicate that most undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary education work while enrolled, and many work full time.6 This may be especially true for students who are reluctant to borrow for fear of not being able repay their education debt. This essay is based on about 21,000 telephone interviews with undergraduates who worked while they were enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-96. Unlike earlier studies of student employment, this study makes a distinction between undergraduates who work primarily to pay for their schooling and those who have established employment that they have combined with postsecondary study. The essay begins by discussing the employment, enrollment, and demographic differences between these two groups of undergraduates. The remainder of the essay focuses entirely on undergraduates who work to help pay for their education. The discussion includes the extent to which students' parents expected them to work; how likely students were to report that work limited their academic program or adversely affected their academic perform-  Statistics, 1994).\nance; how work was related to financial aid receipt, especially to borrowing; and how work intensity was related to persistence in the 1995-96 school year.\nthat work had a positive effect on their academic performance (22 percent) than students working 21-34 hours (12 percent) or 35 or more hours (10 percent). In summary, more than one-third of Students Who Work reported that work limited their class schedule, and about the same proportion reported that work had a negative effect on their academic performance. Furthermore, among those who worked more than half time (21 or more hours), roughly half reported that work adversely affected their performance. Taken as a whole, therefore, these results indicate that more than one in four undergraduates who identify themselves as students who work to pay for education expenses are adversely affected by the amount they work.\nlated to persistence. The same analysis also showed that working 14 or fewer hours per week had a positive effect on persistence in a multivariate model compared to working 15-33 hours. The results of this report imply that the methods students choose in paying for their postsecondary education can have an impact on their persistence and eventual degree attainment. Among undergraduates who were enrolled in 1995-96, those who identified themselves as students who worked to pay for their education expenses differed in their likelihood of borrowing and how much they borrowed relative to how much they worked. Overall, slightly more than one-third of Students Who Work (35 percent) had taken out a student loan, borrowing an average of $4,150 (table 6). Students who worked 15 or fewer hours, however, were more likely to borrow than students who worked more hours (46 percent versus 26 to 36 percent who worked more hours). In addition, among those who borrowed, students who worked 15 or fewer hours borrowed more on average than those who either worked 21-34 hours or 35 or more hours, but not more than students who worked 16-20 hours. These patterns for the rate of borrowing held even when analyzed separately for students in public 4-year colleges and those in private, not-forprofit 4-year institutions.25 Table 6Among undergraduates who worked to help pay for school expenses,* the percentage receiving financial aid, and among those who received that type of aid, the average amount received, by the average hours worked per week while enrolled: 1995-96 25In public 4-year institutions, among those working to pay expenses, 48 percent who worked 1-15 hours borrowed, compared with 35 percent of students who worked 35 or more hours. In private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, the proportions borrowing were 64 percent and 45 percent, respectively, among students working 15 or fewer hours or 35 or more hours. The amount borrowed, however, for either of these groups did not differ significantly (NPSAS:96 Undergraduate Data Analysis System).\n29S. Cuccaro-Alamin and S. Choy, Postsecondary Financing Strategies, and L. Horn, Undergraduates Who Work While Enrolled.\n\nStudy). For undergraduates who identify themselves as Students Who Work, the purpose of work is to help them achieve their educational goals, and for these students, the impact of work on their academic program can be more directly assessed. This study focused primarily on these undergraduates. Students Who Work made up about one-half of the undergraduate population, and they were more likely to be dependent, enrolled in a 4-year institution, and attending full time than Employees Who Study. Students Who Work reported working an average of 25 hours per week. They were relatively evenly distributed across the work spectrum, with similar proportions reporting that they worked full time as working 15 or fewer hoursabout one in four in each group. Working intensity was associated with where students were enrolled and whether they attended full time or part time. Students in 4-year institutions or students attending full time (regardless of where they were enrolled) were more likely to report working 15 or fewer hours and less likely to report working 35 or more hours than their counterparts enrolled in 2-year institutions or those attending part time. How much students worked was strongly related to how often they reported that work limited their schedule or negatively affected their performance. Students working 15 or fewer hours were much less likely than students working more hours to report that work limited their class choices, their class schedules, the number of classes they could take, or access to the library. In fact, as the number of hours worked while enrolled increased, the likelihood of students reporting such limitations rose. The same was also true for the likelihood of dependent students reporting that work had a negative effect on their academic performance. Overall, the results indicated that more than one in four Students Who Work felt that work adversely affected their academic program. In addition to examining the relationship between work intensity and student-reported effects, the study also analyzed the relationship between work intensity and the persistence of students in 1995-96. It was limited to undergraduates meeting the following criteria: Students Who Work, enrolled in the fall of 1995, had a bachelor's or associate's degree objective, and did not attain their degree in 1995-96. Whether or not these students enrolled for fewer than eight months was the outcome measured. A clear relationship between length of enrollment and working full time was found when compared with working 15 or fewer hours. This was apparent for both first-year and continuing students. One in five first-year students working full time did not attend for a full year, compared with one in twenty among those working 15 or fewer hours.\nEven when controlling for related factors such as attendance status, income, and institution type, students who worked full time had lower persistence than those who worked 1-15 hours. Given the relationships between work intensity and persistence, it is important to understand the relationship between working and borrowing, especially if borrowing enables a student to work less. In this study, there was some indication that students may substitute working for borrowing. Students who reported working 15 or fewer hours were far more likely to borrow (47 percent versus 26 percent) and also borrowed more on average ($4,344 versus $3,810) than their counterparts working full time. The differences in the proportions working 15 or fewer hours versus 35 or more hours were also found for students in either public 4-year institutions or private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Students who work long hours have more limited time not only for studying but also for fully integrating themselves into campus life. In a study of college retention, Astin reported that \"the largest negative effect on retention is working full time as a student.\"33 While borrowing results in debt that must be repaid when students finish their postsecondary education, choosing to work intensively in lieu of any borrowing may increase a student's chance of not finishing his or her degree. In fact, based on the results of this study, it appears that borrowing enough to reduce the number of hours a student needs to work to no more than 15 hours per week may increase a student's chances of completing her or his degree.  Among undergraduates who worked while they were enrolled, almost two-thirds (63 percent) identified themselves as students who worked primarily to pay for their education; the remaining working undergraduates identified themselves primarily as employees who were also enrolled in postsecondary education (table 1.2). Among undergraduates who worked while enrolled, 91 percent reported working either all the weeks they were enrolled (69 percent) or most of the weeks they were enrolled (22 percent; table 1.3). In 1995-96, about one in ten (11 percent) undergraduates reported participating in an apprenticeship, internship, or cooperative education program, ranging from about 5 percent for first-year beginning students to 26 percent of seniors (table 1.4). Undergraduates in 2-year institutions were less likely to have participated in internships than those in less-than-2-year or 4-year institutions (3 percent versus 8 percent and 12 percent; table 1.4).

The other important employment variable distinguishes between working undergraduates who considered themselves primarily students who worked to help pay for their education expenses and those who considered themselves primarily employees who were also enrolled in postsecondary education.8 Most of the analysis is based on students who worked to pay for their education expenses. One-year persistence rates for the 1995-96 school year were estimated using an indicator of whether or not students were enrolled for a full academic year (eight months or more). The analysis was based on students who were enrolled in the fall of 1995, had an associate's or bachelor's degree objective, and who had not yet attained the degree. Those who had fewer than eight months of enrollment were considered to have interrupted their enrollment. Other variables include whether or not students' parents expected them to work and the number of hours they expected, whether or not students were working on campus or in workstudy jobs, and how students reported that work limited their schooling or affected their academic performance."}, {"section_title": "HOW MUCH DO UNDERGRADUATES WORK?", "text": "Four of five undergraduates (79 percent) reported working during their 1995-96 enrollment (figure 1).9 Those who reported working tended to do so for their entire enrollment: about 90 7Students were asked: \"About how many hours did you work per week while you were enrolled (July 1, 1995through June 30, 1996?\" 8Students were asked: \"While you were enrolled and working would you say you're primarily a student working to meet expenses or an employee who's decided to enroll in school?\" 9This is a slightly higher rate than the 77 percent reported in 1989-90 in L.

Students Who Work reported working an average of 25 hours per week while they were enrolled, substantially fewer hours than the 39 hours per week reported by Employees Who Study.

"}, {"section_title": "Location of Employment", "text": "Previous research on student employment has determined that the location of a student's job may affect his or her education outcomes. In a review of studies conducted since 1975, Pascarella and Terenzini reported that there is consistent evidence demonstrating that off-campus employment has a negative effect on year-to-year persistence and on bachelor's degree attain-ment, while part-time employment on campus has a positive influence.19 It is thought that working on campus facilitates students' integration into campus life and that working off campus inhibits it. In 1995-96, fewer than one in five Students Who Work were employed on campus (15 percent); however, there were strong relationships between work intensity and the likelihood of oncampus work (table 3). In general, the more hours students worked (up to 34 hours), the less likely they were to be employed on campus.20 For example, 37 percent of students working 15 or fewer hours worked on campus, compared with 16 percent working 16-20 hours and 6 percent working 21-34 hours. Similar to the pattern found for working on campus, students who worked 15 or fewer hours were also much more likely to have work-study jobs (23 percent) than were students who worked more hours (2 to 9 percent).21 This relationship would be expected because most workstudy jobs are located on campus, and most are no more than half time.22 Table 3Among undergraduates who worked to help pay for school expenses,' the percentage who were employed on campus and the percentage who had work-study jobs, by the average hours worked per week while enrolled: 1995-96 Students Who Work were asked about the limitations that work imposed on their academic program. These limitations included restricting the choice of classes, limiting the number of classes, limiting time in which classes can be scheduled, and having less access to the library (table 4). About 40 percent of Students Who Work reported that their work schedule limited their class schedule, and 36 percent reported that their choice of classes was reduced. It is clear from these results that the more hours students worked, the more likely they were to report any one of the four limitations. For example, for each of the four limitations, less than one-quarter (15 to 22 percent) of students working 15 or fewer hours reported that work imposed the limitation, compared with 41 percent or more of students working full time. Parallel to these findings, the more students reported working (up to 34 hours), the more likely they were to indicate that working had a negative effect on their academic performance (table 5).23 Those working more than 15 hours per week were at least twice as likely to say work had a negative effect. About 17 percent of students working 15 or fewer hours reported that work had a negative effect on their academic performance, compared with 34 percent of those working 16-20 hours, 46 percent of those working 21-34 hours, and 55 percent of those working 35 or more hours.

Persistence in 1995-96 The final analysis examines the likelihood of not attending for a full academic year in relation to undergraduate work intensity while enrolled. To estimate whether students interrupted their enrollment in 1995-96, an indicator of whether or not students were enrolled for eight or more months was used.26 The analysis was limited to students who worked while enrolled to pay education expenses; were enrolled in the fall of 1995; and had an associate's or bachelor's degree objective and did not attain the degree in 1995-"}, {"section_title": "96.", "text": "Given their educational objectives, these students would be expected to continue their enrollment for a full academic year.

As shown in figure 6, the results indicate that the likelihood of students attending for a full year was related to their employment intensity.28 This was true for both first-year and continuing students. About one in five (21 percent) first-year students working 35 or more hours per week did not attend for a full year, compared with about one in twenty (6 percent) who worked 1-15 hours. Among continuing students, 2 percent who worked 1-15 hours did not attend for a full year, compared with 11 percent of those working full time. For both first-year and continuing students, those working 1-15 hours per week were less likely to interrupt their enrollment than students working 16-34 hours per week. While it appears that the rates of enrollment interruption for those working 16-34 hours were lower than the rates for those working 35 or more hours (e.g., 13 percent versus 21 percent of first-year students), the group sizes were small and there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they were different. 26To capture the actual persistence rates for the year, one would have to know how many students did not return in the next year, and this information is not available in this survey.

For example, students who attend school exclusively part time are much less likely to persist to degree attainment.30 At the same time, part-time students are much more likely to work full time than those who attend school full time (see table 1). To take into account the interrelationship of work and other related variables, this analysis used a linear regression mode1.31 The dependent variable was a measure of enrollment interruption defined as attending school fewer than eight months, i.e., those students who did not attend for a full academic year. In addition to hours worked, the independent variables included attendance status (exclusively part-time enrollment versus others), gender, age, income quartiles, undergraduate level (first-year versus others), institution sector, race-ethnicity, job location, and financial aid receipt. The analysis was limited to students enrolled in the fall of 1995 who worked to pay expenses, had an associate's or bachelor's degree objective, and had not attained the degree (about one-third of the undergraduate population).

The third column displays the regression coefficients. Since the dependent variable is a measure of enrollment interruption, a positive coefficient indicates the variable contributes to enrollment interruption when compared to the reference group, while a negative coefficient indicates the opposite. For example, compared to working 1 to 15 hours per week, the regression coefficients for students working more hours are all positive. Furthermore, the percentages of students working either 16 to 20 hours or 35 or more hours are significantly greater than the percentage for students working 1 to 15 hours (12 and 13 percent versus 7 percent). In other words, students working 16 to 20 hours or 35 or more hours were significantly more likely to attend fewer than eight months in 1995-96 than students working 1 to 15 hours even after holding related variables constant.  Education Statistics, 1996). 31See appendix B for a description of the statistical methods.  This analysis determines the likelihood of students interrupting their enrollment only within one academic year. As such, it is an overestimate of actual one-year persistence because it does not take into account students who did not return to school the following school year. Nevertheless, even within this restricted time frame, the results confirm the adverse relationship of working full time to persistence, and they also suggest that, compared with working 1 to 15 hours per week, working more hours while enrolled is associated with higher rates of enrollment interruption. These results are consistent with a recent report that analyzed five-year persistence rates of 36 UNDERGRADUATES WHO WORK students who began postsecondary education in 1989-90.32 That study found that in addition to working full time, students who worked an average of 15 to 33 hours per week while enrolled were less likely to persist over a five-year period than were students working 1 to 14 hours. Another finding from the same longitudinal study showed that students who borrowed during their enrollment were more likely to persist over five years than students who did not borrow even after controlling for income, academic performance, institutional type, and other variables. In the current, study the unadjusted percentages are significantly different (5.1 percent of aided students who borrowed attended fewer than eight months versus 8.6 percent of aided students who did not borrow), but the adjusted percentages (6.4 percent and 8.5 percent) are not. However, those with no aid were more likely to attend less than a full year than were students with aid that did not include loans."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "The results concerning the location of a student's job were inconclusive. Before adjustment, among students who worked on campus, the percentage attending fewer than eight months was significantly less than the percentage for students working off campus (4 percent versus 11 percent). However, once the number of hours worked and other variables were controlled for, the percentages were virtually the same (10 percent). This may be because students who work on campus are much more likely to work 15 or fewer hours than students who work off campus, and once work intensity is held constant, the positive effect of working on campus disappears. It is also possible that the effect of working on campus may be more apparent when determining which students return to school the following year. If working on campus enhances student engagement with the institution, it is possible that students who work on campus are more likely to return to school the following year than those who do not. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the data, this phenomenon cannot be taken into account in the current analysis. However, in 1998, the first follow-up of the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal cohort of the 'NPSAS:96 survey will be available for analysis, at which time this relationship can be further investigated."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study focused on the extent to which undergraduates worked while they were enrolled in 1995-96.

Younger undergraduates were more likely to be enrolled in 4-year institutions than older students, who tended to be enrolled in 2-year institutions. For example, 56 percent of undergraduates aged 19-23 were enrolled in 4-year institutions, compared with 27 percent of students aged 40 or older; in contrast, 64 percent of students aged 40 or older were enrolled in 2-year institutions, compared with 36 percent of students aged 19-23 (table 2.1). Although similar proportions of male and female undergraduates attended 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions, men were more likely than women to attend 4-year institutions (47 percent versus 44 percent; table 2.1). Black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic undergraduates were less likely than their white, non-Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander counterparts to attend 4-year institutions. About 38 percent of black, non-Hispanic and 35 percent of Hispanic students attended 4-year institutions, compared with 47 percent of white, non-Hispanic and 53 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students. Conversely, black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend less-than-2-year institutions (8 percent) than white or Asian/Pacific Islander students (3 percent; table 2.1). In 1995-96, three-quarters of all undergraduates were enrolled in public institutions; 16 percent were enrolled in private, not-for-profit institutions; and 5 percent attended private, for-profit institutions. About 5 percent of undergraduates attended more than one institution (either simultaneously or consecutively; table 2.2). Racial-ethnic differences (also related to differences in income level as discussed on page 79) were found relative to institution control: black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic students attended private, for-profit institutions in higher proportions than white, non-Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander students (9 percent and 10 percent of black and Hispanic students versus 4 percent for either white or Asian students; table 2.2).
