There are more than 2 million confirmed cases and about 1,14, 000 deaths only in the USA. The other worst-affected countries like Brazil (8,28,810 cases with 41,828 deaths), Russia (5,28,964 cases with 6,948 deaths), UK (2,94,379 cases with 41,662 deaths), Spain (243,605 cases with 27,136 deaths), and Italy (2,36,651 cases with 34,301 deaths) have also reported high casualties (Our World in Data, 2020; Gayathri, 2020) . The very first case in India was reported on January 30, 2020 and the Indian government ordered national level lockdown on March 24, 2020 in order to maintain social and physical distancing and subsequently, extended the restrictions on industrial activities until May 31, 2020 due to growing number of infections in urban centers of several industrial and highly populated states. Along with the restricted industrial activities, the closure of shopping malls, hotels, gym, universities, schools and colleges have caused reduction in the activities of transportation. The total number of positive cases, however, has increased to 3,20,922 and the death toll to 9,195 on June 14, 2020 (Kachroo, 2020; Sinha, 2020) . The state of Maharashtra continues to remain the worst affected (1,04,568 cases) and it is followed by Tamil Nadu with the number of confirmed cases increased to 42,687. The states of Delhi (38, 958) , Gujarat (23, 038), Uttar Pradesh (13, 118) and Rajasthan (12, 401) are the other affected federal states.\nIn some of the recent research, the improvement in air quality during the lockdown period was related to the closure of industries and reduction in vehicle transit. For example, Mahato et al. (2020) used the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) data from 34 monitoring stations of Delhi (India), and observed 40-52% reduction in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , SO 2 , CO and NH 3 concentrations compared to a month before the lockdown. Nakada and Urban (2020) and Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) used the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f analyze air quality data in S\u00e3o Paulo state of Brazil and in Hubei province of China, respectively. They observed that the concentrations of air pollutants decreased by 50-60% in Brazil during April 2020 and 20-30% in China during February 2020. Tob\u00edas et al. (2020) analyzed air quality data from Barcelona in Spain and observed an average reduction of 51% in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and 31% in particulate matter (PM 10 ) compared to the same period over the last four years.\nThe Gujarat state of western India has several cities with poor air quality (e.g. Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat) due to the presence of power plants, street dust, transportation, outdoor waste incineration, construction and brick kilns. There are also several industrial zones of multinational groups on the city outskirts (Upadhyay, 2019). In terms of air pollution, Ahmedabad has been ranked as the fourth most contaminated in India (CPCB, 2019) . This research assessed the changes occurred in air qualities by comparing the concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 4 , CO, NO 2 and O 3 over the lockdown period with the prelockdown period from nine air quality monitoring stations within four different zones of Gujarat ( Fig. 1) . \nZone 2: Contents of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 4 , CO and NO 2 decreased by 38-82% (Table 1 and Fig   2b) . Compared to the pre-lockdown period, the mean concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 decreased by 34% and 47%, respectively. Declined PM 10 could be due to shutdown of pharmaceutical, petroleum and petrochemical, steel recycling, auto parts manufacturing, beverage manufacturing and textile industries that contributed to air pollution of Ahmedabad.\nSimilarly, the reduction in automobile transportation within Gandhinagar contributed to less air pollutants. Concentrations of other pollutants such as SO 2 (-58%), NO 2 (-82%) and CO (-38%) also reduced during the lockdown period. The reduction in CO (-38%) was much less compared to SO 2 and NO 2 and this is due to functioning of the power plants. The maximum daily average of O 3 increased by 38% (15 \u03bcg/m 3 ) during the lockdown. Reduction in transport and industrial activities along with more insolation and temperature of March-April might have contributed this increase.\nZone 3: Compared to the pre-lockdown, the mean PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels decreased by 78% and 80%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2c ). Both of them showed the highest rates of reduction compared to other zones. The rate of decrease for SO 2 (-58%) was also highest among all the zones. It must be due to restrictions imposed on navigation activities of large cargo ships, ferries and cruises. Other pollutants such as NO 2 (-50%) and CO (-49%) decreased compared to the pre-lockdown (Fig. 2c) . The total variation of +6 \u03bcg/m 3 in O 3 was negligible, but it showed an upward trend (increased by 48%). Table 1) .\nConcentrations of PM 2.5 decreased by 38%, PM 10 decreased by 32%, SO 2 reduced by 22%, NO 2 reduced by 84% and CO decreased by a negligible 3%. Similarly, the maximum daily average of O 3 (total variation of +2 \u03bcg/m 3 ) also showed minimal increase, but it had an upward trend with an increase of 34% (Fig. 2d) . Minimal changes in CO and O 3 reflected that lockdown had less effect on this zone with smaller number of industries as well as less population.\nWe compared the data of January-April, 2020 and January-April, 2019 to evaluate the effect of lockdown on the long-term changes in air quality (Table 1 ). The network of air quality monitoring stations maintained by CPCB provided PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations for the same interval for two years. Compared to the 2019 values, the average concentration of PM 2.5 decreased by 39% (92 \u03bcg/m 3 ) and the average content of PM 10 reduced by 44% (84 \u03bcg/m 3 ) in 2020. NO 2 also exhibited a decreasing trend in 2020 and its concentration was reduced by 59% (15 \u03bcg/m 3 ) (Fig. 4) . The concentrations of CO decreased by 25% (33 \u03bcg/m 3 ). Both NO 2 and CO are released through road traffic, especially from diesel combustion, and to a lesser extent from gasoline transport vehicles, manufacturing industry and power plants in the urban part of the study area. Closure of traffic flow during the lockdown period led to reduction in the concentrations of NO 2 and CO. Minimal shipping and fishing activity caused reduction in the emission of SO2 by 40% (22 \u03bcg/m 3 ). Finally, the O 3 levels increased by 58% (+30\u03bcg/m 3 ) as the lockdown led to reduction of NO emission and less consumption of O 3 during the titration (i.e., NO+O 3 =NO 2 +O 2 ). The higher insolation and warmer temperatures of March-April might have also helped to increase the levels of O 3 . Our results suggest that the lockdown led to an important improvement in long-term air quality and it should be considered as an alternative measure to reduce air pollution. The effect of lockdown, observed through the data of less than a month (i.e. March 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020) caused reduction in air pollutants by more than half for the four-month long study interval. Table 2 The six different categories of CPCB air quality indices using five pollutants (i.e. PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, NO 2 and SO 2 ) and their comparisons with USEPA.\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) is based on aggregation method of Ott (1978) and it was calculated using the five different pollutants (i.e. PM 10 and PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO 2 and CO) (CPCB, 2014 and USEPA, 2006) . The CPCB describes the AQI in six different categories, i.e. good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe (Table 2 ). Figure 5 depicts the AQI patterns during the pre-lockdown (January 1, 2020-March 23, 2020) and lockdown (March 24, 2020 -April 20, 2020 periods over the Gujarat state. The improvement in air quality of zone 1 is evident from AQI value showing a change of 32% (-32) compared to prelockdown period (Table 1 ). This zone comprises of industrial centers at Surat, Ankleshwar and Vadodara and the effect of lockdown should be considered by the state government to modify the industrial and transport policies for a better long-term air quality. AQI values changed by 60% and 75% in zones 2 and 3 showing net reductions in counting by -56 and -82, respectively (Table 1 and Tables   Table 1 Average concentrations of air pollutants during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods in 2020 in four different zones of the Gujarat state in western India.

We used contents of the particles with diameter <2.5\u03bcm (PM 2.5 ) and <10\u03bcm (PM 10 ), concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) ozone (O 3 ) and Air Quality Index (AOI). Daily Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f data (24 hours) between January 1, 2020-April, 20, 2020 were used for this evaluation and we separated the data in terms of pre-lockdown period (January 1, 2020 to March 23, 2020) and lockdown period (March 24, 2020 to April 20, 2020 . The average concentrations of air pollutants of the lockdown period were compared with pre-lockdown values in order to estimate the changes in %. We also compared the average data of January-April, 2020 with the same interval of the previous year. The tropospheric monitoring instrument of the precursor Copernicus Sentinel-5 (S5p/ TROPOMI) established by the European Space Agency (ESA) provided nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) data (\u03bcmol/m 2 ) for both the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods for the Gujarat state covering an area of ca.196,024 km\u00b2 (e.g. Tob\u00edas et al., 2020)."}, {"section_title": "Concentration of air pollutants", "text": "Zone 1: Concentrations of air pollutants reduced in this zone of dominant fabric and transportation sectors during the lockdown period (Table 1) .
