We show that these education decisions are socially inefficient. This result is driven by the fact that students do not consider an externality in the working environment of acquiring education for investment purposes. We show when and how it is possible to design tuition fees in such a way that students acquire the socially optimal level of education.\nJEL Numbers: D62; H21; I21."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the literature on the economics of education, the theory of human capital assumes that investments in education increase a worker's productivity (Becker, 1993) . The classic theory of human capital does not consider that consumption incentives may also influence educational choices. Various evidence suggests consumption incentives in educational choices are important.\nUniversity curricula vary widely in the job prospects after graduation. Students are often observed choosing majors and courses with weak job opportunities. This is not for lack of information. A student has a multitude of information about job opportunities in each field of study. For example, it is widely acknowledged that the job opportunities associated with pursuing an engineering degree are more favorable compared to those from an art degree. Interpreting education as a consumption good can help explain attendance at university courses that have weaker job prospects. A student may, for example, find taking an art course more enjoyable than an engineering course.\nThere is a relationship between income and the education acquired by an individual. This relationship refers both to the amount of education acquired and to the choice of curricula. In both cases, interpreting education as a consumption good may explain this relationship. First, educational attainment increases with income (Becker, 1967 , 1993 , McMahon, 1976 , and 1991 , Acemoglu and Pischke, 2001 , Blanden and Machin, 2004 , Vona, 2011 . The economic literature offers three explanations for this: financial constraints; pre-existing ability differences correlated with parental income (e.g., due to non-cognitive skills acquired from the environment in which a student is raised); and differences in risk aversion (Ellwood and Kane 2000 , Cameron and Heckman 2001 , Carneiro and Heckman 2002 . The empirical evidence is also consistent with the alternative interpretation that education may be considered as a normal consumption good rather than a pure investment good.\nSecond, there is a relationship between the choice of coursework and the student's household income. Parents with lower income levels are more likely to encourage their child to choose university courses that are associated with more promising job prospects, regardless of the child's preferences. Given this parental pressure, a poor student is more likely to choose coursework that can increase her opportunities in the job market. There is some evidence supporting this statement. Baird (1967) , in a study based on a comparative socioeconomic analysis of 18,378 prospective college students, found that students from higher income homes were relatively more concerned with developing their intellect, while students from less affluent households were more concerned with vocational and professional training. The Baird (1967) 's results are confirmed by Dealney (1998) , who provides evidence that lower income students are more concerned about how college will prepare them for a career. Trusty et al. (2000) , using the NELS:88 data set, examined choice of major field of study at postsecondary institution when students were 2 years beyond high school.\nThey found that, at the highest level of socio-economic status, increases in academic performance resulted in a decrease in the choice of enterprising-related majors. Leppel et al. (2001) examine the data from the 1990 survey of Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) that follows a group of students who began their postsecondary educational careers during the academic year 1989-90.\nThey show that an increase in socio-economic status of the families of college students would be good news for humanities and social science departments, but bad news for education, science and engineering departments.\n4 Leppel et al. (2005) exploit the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in order to examine processes by which students enter lucrative fields of study, selective colleges, and lucrative fields within selective colleges. They show that students from families with high socio-economic status have a much greater probability of selecting lower income fields.\nInterpreting education as a consumption good may explain this evidence: poor students are more likely to choose education with stronger investment characteristics than are rich students.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of educational choices having education explicitly modeled as a consumption or investment good. The analysis can provide input to help design an efficient educational policy. A question that may arise is why university courses that are associated with weaker job prospects should be subsidized. Similarly, should tuition fees be the same for university courses that differentially affect a student's future earnings? The aim of this paper is to address such questions.\nWe develop a model in which a student acquires education both with consumption and investment features. Educational investment increases a student's future earnings and has a positive effect on the general productivity of the working environment (Benabou, 1996) . Thus, investment in education is associated with a positive externality. Other educational expenditure has only a consumption value. When a student chooses its levels of consumption and investment education, the investment externality is not taken into account. As a consequence, in the private equilibrium, a student acquires too little educational investment, compared to the social optimum.\nThe paper considers next possible government interventions to engender the social optimum, specifically (i) regulated tuition fees or (ii) regulated levels of education. We show that with enough information it is possible to either manipulate tuition fees or set minimal levels of education to induce students to acquire the socially optimal levels of education. In the case with regulated 4 Both the NELS:88 and the BPS were conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Education.\ntuition fees, this result emerges if tuition fees for education consumption are kept at the marginal production cost of providing education, whereas the tuition fees for education investment are set below marginal production cost. Assuming student ability is private information, we show when these schemes are incentive compatible.\nThis paper can also provide a theoretical explanation for some findings in the empirical literature on heterogeneous human capital and heterogeneity in the returns of education. In this literature, Antonji et al. (2012) and Yamaguchi (2012) The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3\nshows the difference between the private equilibrium and the social optimum. Section 4 considers possible government interventions, in particular either (i) the design of optimal tuition fees or (ii) the introduction of minimum (optimal) levels of education investment. Section 5 concludes. Proofs are provided in the appendix. There are two periods. In period 0, students attend college. In period 1, they work and earn an income. When students attend college, they decide the amount and type of education they want to acquire. The unique feature of this model is that education can be acquired for two different reasons: (i) for investment reasons, i.e., education can be acquired to increase future income; and"}, {"section_title": "The model", "text": "(ii) for consumption reasons. Regarding the latter, an individual may be interested in a specific topic, may want to become more knowledgeable for social interactions in trendy topics, and/or may want to acquire social status given by obtaining a college degree though such coursework will not increase future income.\nIn college, different courses of study present different proportions of these two elements of education. This is due to different labor demands for alternative expertise (engineers may be more in demand than art experts), and to alternative interest from a social point of view toward topics (e.g., being conversant about arts, cinema, philosophy, and literature may be considered more interesting than being able to do advanced mathematics). The relative consumption vs. investment value of topics may change over time. In the future, people may find more socially intriguing a mathematician than an artist, and the labor market may need more philosophers than engineers.\nOur analysis does not refer to specific courses. Instead, we denote the amount of education acquired for consumption as 1 e , with per unit tuition fee 0 1 > t ; and the amount of education acquired for investment as 2 e , with per unit tuition fee 0 2 > t . We do not put constraints on the amount of education needed to acquire a degree. Even though a degree requires usually a specific amount of courses, a student may attend only one year, or keep studying at a master's program, or attend a short term course, or a summer school.\nProvision of higher education is perfectly competitive. Colleges set their tuition fees in such a way as to cover their marginal resource cost, (borrowing if negative) is determined in period 0, and r is the interest rate. E measures productivity of the workforce and is given by:\nThe specification follows Benabou (1996) . 7 Future earnings are Cobb-Douglas in own human capital ( 2 e \u03b8 ) and an index of all worker's human capital (E), with constant returns to scale. The index of all workers' human capital is increasing in any workers' human capital with a constant elasticity of substitution (\u03c3) between any two worker's human capital. In this specification, \u03c3 > 1 is needed for human capital to have a positive marginal product. Our central results do not require these functional forms, but the specification is appealing and easy to work with.\nIn equilibrium, students maximize their own utility by choosing their initial consumption, savings, educational consumption, and educational investment, subject to the budget constraint ( ) ( ) "}, {"section_title": "Private vs social optimum", "text": "In this section we develop the baseline results of the paper. We compare the private equilibrium with socially optimal allocations. For every student type ( ) Condition (6) equates the marginal consumption benefit of e 1 (LHS) to the marginal cost (RHS), the latter consisting of the tuition and time costs. Condition (7) equates the discounted marginal increase in future income from educational investment (LHS) to the marginal cost. 7 See equations (5) and (6) in Benabou (1996) . 8 Consistent with the atomism of individuals in the economy, an individual's own choice of e 2 will not affect his own earnings by affecting E.\nStraightforward manipulation of the first-order conditions to the individual's problem (see the appendix) shows that P 1 e is increasing in household income. This is, of course, because the utility specification implies that consumption goods are normal. Observe, however, that (7) implies educational investment is independent of income. Under our assumption of perfect capital markets (i.e., s is unconstrained), the educational investment decision reduces to maximization of the present value of lifetime income, the solution depending on ability but not endowed income. With perfect capital markets, the correlation between household income and educational expenditure is explained by educational consumption. Using \u2032\u2032 > 2 0 \u03c8 and \u03c3 > 1, one can confirm using (7) that P 2 e is increasing in own ability and the economy human capital index, these results reflecting complementarity in the workplace.\nWe turn now to the social problem and characterize first-best Pareto efficient allocations. \nthe corresponding total transfers.

The third constraint is the household balanced budget condition that individual \"choices\" must satisfy.\nThe last constraint is, again, the planner's balanced budget condition. We have written the problem having the planner pay for the cost of education. Since the planner can do lump-sum income transfers, the latter is with no loss of generality. Comparing (6) and (11), using that t 1 = c 1 in competitive equilibrium, one sees that the private and social optimum coincide if the level of first-period consumption is the same in each solution."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "No externality arises in private choice of educational consumption. In contrast, comparing the LHS of (12) to the LHS of (7) Underinvestment in education in the private equilibrium is due to the human capital externality in production. Individuals do not reap the full social benefit of their educational investment, while bearing the full cost. In the next section we examine intervention that would provide socially optimal incentives.\nFinally, notice that social-welfare weights on student types ( ) 0 ,Y \u03b8 \u03c9 do not play any role in determining the socially optimal levels of 2 e . Similarly to in the private solution, optimal levels of e 2 simply maximize lifetime income, but in the aggregate in the social solution."}, {"section_title": "Government intervention", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The design of optimal tuition fees", "text": "In this section, the planner sets and collects tuition fees, while paying for actual cost of education, and individuals make their privately optimal choices. The main result is: 11 Because the economy will be more productive in the social welfare solution and the planner may have preference for redistribution, we would not expect c 0 to be the same in the two solutions. However, given the desired transfers and socially efficient choices of e 2 , letting households choose e 1 would be efficient. This is shown below.\nFormal proof is in the appendix, but Proposition 4 is very intuitive. Tuition for educational investment is subsidized relative to marginal production cost by the amount of the marginal externality. The optimal tuition subsidy must vary by type, in particular by ability. This issue is further discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Regulated levels of education", "text": "In this section, we assume that the government imposes regulated levels of education, without altering tuition fees from the competitive ones. In particular, we consider the case in which the government sets a minimum level of education investment that students need to acquire. That is, the planner requires "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Several issues related to informational constraints warrant discussion. Our analysis has assumed educational investment is observed in the labor market. If students could complete coursework without effectively developing their skills, then our results are called into question. It is then important that education providers enforce standards. College exit exams, as are becoming increasingly popular, provide a means to support learning and teaching incentives. College reputation can also assist in this regard. In the discussion that follows, we continue to assume skills are observed or conveyed accurately when students enter the labor market.\nA key finding of our analysis is that efficient educational investment varies with student ability. Thus the interventions examined above require that ability can be observed or discerned.\nIf students know their ability but it is private information, they would not generally have an incentive to reveal truthfully their ability when confronted with the above interventions. In the case of tuition subsidies, they would want to maximize the subsidy. In the case of a minimum educational investment, they would want the minimum to correspond to their preferred investment.\nNeither intervention is consistent with truthful reporting. Suppose, though, that \"good\" tests exist that can be used to determine ability prior to pursuing higher education. If a student takes the test seriously, then their ability is well measured. More precisely, students can perform to the level of their ability if they try, cannot perform beyond their ability, but could underperform if they choose.\nThe issue is then whether the above interventions are consistent with students not underperforming on college entry exams. To consider this, we assume that any transfers are independent of student ability (i.e., social welfare weights in the social objective function do not depend on ability). Then we have:"}, {"section_title": "Proposition 6. If pre-college tests exist that allow students to perform only up to their ability (or to underperform), then the regulated tuition scheme induces accurate ability signaling while the minimum educational investment scheme does not.", "text": "The proof (see the appendix) follows this intuition. Confronted with an educational investment minimum that exceeds their preferred investment (Propositions 3 and 5) with truthful ability revelation, students prefer a lower minimum. Because the efficient minimum decreases with actual ability (see the Proof of Proposition 6), students prefer to underperform on an entry exam. In contrast, the efficient subsidy to educational investment increases with student ability (as shown in the Proof). Of course, students are better off the higher is the subsidy to educational investment, providing them with efficient incentive to perform on an entry."}, {"section_title": "It is notable that the incentive to perform as well as one can on an entry test under the tuition subsidy scheme applies as well if", "text": "students are unsure about their ability. That is, if the tuition subsidy scheme is based on measured ability with an accurate test (conditional on students doing their best), then the efficiency and incentive compatibility findings continue to apply if students do not know their own abilities. The results here obviously are supportive of using the tuition subsidy approach rather than investment minima.\nA separate issue regarding investment minima is whether graduation requirements provide a substitute. A simple total credit requirement is not a perfect substitute for the educational investment minimum approach for two reasons. First, educational consumption should not count toward the graduation requirement, though students should be able to take such courses as they please for private efficiency. Obviously, though, a graduation requirement could include completion of minimum coursework in investment areas and universities typically require completion of a subset of particular courses or a subset of courses from a restricted set. The second problem with common graduation requirements interpreted thought the lens of our model is that efficient investment varies with ability. Higher ability students should have to satisfy more stringent graduation standards. While issues related to different fields of study are not an element of our model, variable major requirements may be consistent with the notion of requiring more of higher ability students. The course requirements to major in engineering or mathematics are frequently relatively \"heavy\" and regarded as more difficult. Of course, elements our model cannot address are likely to explain the structure of major and graduation requirements. The requirement to take a set of math courses to major in engineering can be simply explained by the need to know the math to solve engineering problems. On the informational side, an interesting topic is whether graduation requirements and variation in them can be explained by second-best efficiency. For example, suppose that ability is private information and that institutional rules prevent varying tuition by type of study. Might minimal graduation requirements provide a second-best solution where the set of students that select into college are induced to increase educational investment toward efficient levels? Might variation in major requirements facilitate more refined selection and further enhance efficient investments? Future research might investigate these questions."}, {"section_title": "Summary and concluding remarks", "text": "In this paper we have analyzed a simple model in which students choose their university coursework with both investment and consumption incentives. The intent of the analysis is to clarify how these incentives determine choices and how private choices allocations. Assuming education is priced at marginal cost, students would underinvest in education due to a human capital externality in the workplace. Subsidizing tuition for educational investment could correct the externality as could minimum educational investment requirements. Since the efficient tuition subsidy or investment minimum varies with student ability, these interventions are not simple and require the policy maker to observe or infer student ability. Tuition subsidies correct incentives to underperform on exams used to measure ability, while this incentive compatibility would fail with the use of educational investment minima. It is of interest to investigate higher education policies like graduation requirements in light of imperfect information. Although the paper's aim to investigate consumption versus investment incentives is somewhat limited in scope, we hope the results provide useful input to the design of higher education policies."}, {"section_title": "Appendix", "text": "Proof of Proposition 1: To solve the problem stated in (5), substitute (2) into the objective function and write the Lagrangian function: \nNow differentiate the budget constraint (A.6), again using that e 2 is independent of Y 0 :\nSubstitute (A.9) into the latter: \nWe first find the first-order conditions with respect to the type-dependent variables and multipliers Proof of Proposition 4: We must show that the private solution with regulated tuitions as in (13) and appropriately adjusted lump-sum income transfers replicates any solution to the social problem. where, recall, the w-superscript indicates the optimal educational values in the social solution.
