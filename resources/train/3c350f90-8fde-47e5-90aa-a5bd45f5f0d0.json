For many years, flood management strategy has focused on reducing vulnerabilities by addressing impacted infrastructure while maintaining the status quo (i.e., elevating houses to prevent flood damage but still allowing people to live in the same places). However, the rising social and economic costs from increased flood frequency and the recognition that sea level rise will exacerbate these costs (Boon & Mitchell, 2015) have led to the understanding that the government needs to address regional resilience, rather than continue with the ad hoc patching of vulnerabilities.\nA key component of resiliency planning is the recognition that management strategies should address the nonlinear nature of changing systems as well as the inherent uncertainty in our understanding of it (Folke, 2006) . Effectively incorporating predictions of near-term and future flooding with mitigating strategies into resiliency planning requires a precise understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of current flooding, coastal dynamics, and precipitation patterns (Boon et al., 2018) . This level of detail allows for an inventory of infrastructure currently at risk, the development of flood early warning systems (reducing current vulnerabilities) and high-resolution hydrodynamic models (increasing our resilience to future storm surge and sea level rise), and improved predictions of future risk.\nCollaborative planning is critical in areas (such as Hampton Roads) where flood-prone regions cross jurisdictional boundaries. Locality-specific adoption of different strategies can lead to a coastline without cohesive protection measures and where the failure of protection measures in one community may impact the success of protection measures in an adjacent community. Collaborative planning efforts require cooperation on multiple levels, including the generation of seamless data sets. In Hampton Roads, the Intergovernmental Pilot Project (IPP; http://digitalcommons. odu.edu/odurc_pilot/) was established to coordinate a \"whole of government\" approach to regional resiliency planning (Toll, 2018) . Their three key recommendations were (1) to establish, maintain, and institutionalize relationships to support collaboration and information sharing; (2) to standardize methods for integrating and sharing data; and (3) to apply the \"Whole of Government and Community\" approach to the watershed level as opposed to jurisdictional boundaries (Steinhilber et al., 2016) .\nWithin the IPP, a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) comprising representatives from both private and public sector organizations engaged in a review of active scientific monitoring and observing within the Hampton Roads area. This committee is responsible for ensuring that member organizations work together to integrate a network of ocean, earth, and atmospheric data collection. This network includes private companies; academic institutions; and local, state, and federal government organizations. . Between these groups and the region, the key challenge in the collaboration, thus far, has been to ensure that data standards are consistent across organizations to allow for the integration of the data into multiple products with unique management focuses. In this paper, we document all the publicly available environmental observations in the region and the resulting models and portals for efforts to integrating the observations into formats useful for resiliency planning."}, {"section_title": "Observation Networks and Integration", "text": "Many different companies, academic institutions, federal, commonwealth, and city governments make environmental observations in the region. There is also much collaboration between these organizations to facilitate dissemination and archiving of the data. The main types of observations are water level, subsidence, topographic, wave/current measurements, and weather observations. All of these observations are critical for the modeling of past and future precipitationand wave-driven flood impacts that feed into resilience planning. Coverage of the different observation systems varies, creating unique challenges for the integration of the data into robust tools. The extent and format of each observing system are described in this section. In addition, nascent efforts to develop citizen science observations are ongoing, including a recent crowdsourcing effort using a mobile application developed in Norfolk called \"sea level rise\" to measure a king tide event in early November 2017. Sponsored by the nonprofit Wetlands Watch and promoted by the regional Virginian-Pilot newspaper, among other media partners, the \"Catch the King\" event portends increased awareness and potential scientific observations from March/April 2018 Volume 52 Number 2 the community that could prove valuable to mapping and model validation as well as public awareness (Loftis, 2017) .

Water level sensors directly report the water elevations using a standard vertical datum above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) or mean sea level (MSL). By default, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports these water levels relative to MSL with numerous other tidal and geodetic datum options, whereas the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) exclusively reports their levels relative to NAVD88, with both reporting water levels every 6 min. Water levels are presently publicly monitored in 57 locations throughout the region by NOAA, USGS, VIMS, WeatherFlow, and StormSense, each comprising 6, 19, 1, 3, and 28 sensors in their respective portfolios (Figure 1) . There also exist nonpublic sensor data collected by cities, which are somewhat limited for dissemination due to aging Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) architecture or limited communications functions. NOAA, the National Weather Service (NWS), and Tidewatch provide tide predictions at some of these gauges.\nThe National Ocean Service (NOS) of NOAA provides the most long-term and accurate water level observations. More recently, USGS and regional cities have installed more gauges. Most water level sensors in Hampton Roads are mounted to piers over open waterways or in sheltered marinas, as these sites accommodate a broad range of water level measurements from very low water events along with high water flood events. However, there are also inundation sensors in use, such as the temporary battery-powered rapid deployment gauges the USGS deploys in advance of substantial flood events over land or the new ultrasonic street inundation sensors the City of Norfolk installed as part of the StormSense Project in August 2017 (Loftis et al., 2017a) .\nWater level observations have been made in the region since the installation of the Sewells Point Gauge by NOAA in 1927 on Naval Station Norfolk. The long-term measurements, such as those at Sewells Point, are critical for determining the long-term relative sea level rise rates and potential changes in rates, that is, the acceleration of sea level rise seen in the region (Boon, 2012; Ezer & Corlett, 2012) . Since the initial installation, many more have been installed to improve flood forecasting, navigation, and delineation of the regional variability in sea level rise rates. As technology has advanced and associated hardware costs have become more affordable, a higher-density network of sensors is more tenable and affordable for the Hampton Roads community. The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and communications technologies has made these water level measuring technologies more affordable to local and regional entities in Hampton Roads. This development in sensor availability is critical, as the predictive capabilities of flood forecasting through hydrodynamic models (like those being developed at VIMS)"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1", "text": "Map of 56 publicly streaming water level monitoring stations throughout Hampton Roads, VA.

Ultimately, validations in more places throughout a city are needed to ensure a model's efficacy and aid improvement.\nIn 2008, NOAA published a gaps analysis in a technical memorandum reviewing relative coverage of regions with their sensors and originally identified few locations with need for data coverage in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries (Gill & Fisher, 2008) . No gaps were noted in Hampton Roads in Figure 11 of their report. However, NOAA's directive has a national viewpoint, and projected sea level rise trends and decreased costs for monitoring technology have enabled the region to respond more proactively to more frequent flooding. Due to the dendritic shape of the many estuaries of Hampton Roads, changes in prevailing wind directions combined with estuarine circulation contribute to flooding in ways that cannot be best understood by a single sensor at each major river mouth.\nIn a recent presentation to the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission's Regional Resilience Working Group, a more regionally resolute simulated gaps analysis review of 85 new suitable bridgemounted water level sensor locations throughout Hampton Roads was presented (Loftis et al., 2017b) . Suitability was determined by Lidar-detected deck heights for all bridges over open tidally connected waterways. The sites were identified by using hydrodynamic modeling simulations compared with the existing sparse network of sensor observations, and then a list was exported favoring sites that were <85% match in predictions, when compared with the next nearest suggested location during heavy wind conditions, and <95% match during regular tidal conditions. Of the 85 sites reviewed, 22 new suggested sensor sites were discovered as priority locations with bridges of sufficient elevation with consideration of projected sea level trends (Loftis et al., 2017b) . A map of those suggested sites are presented in Figure 2 , and a small number of these sites have since had sensors installed nearby by StormSense or the USGS.

The most comprehensive subsidence measurements for the area cover the time period from 1940 to 1971, depicting subsidence across the region that is relatively constant spatially at a level of approximately 2-3 mm/year. This subsidence is assumed to be due to the presence of large-scale subsidence signals associated with the glacial isostatic adjustment, groundwater withdrawal, and ongoing shifts associated with the Chesapeake Bay meteor impact crater. Until recently, this assumption was made, in part, because of the lack of higher-resolution information on vertical land motion for Hampton Roads. However, new methods employing a combination of the technologies in the ensuing subsections have enabled us to gain some slight insight into subsidence in Hampton Roads (Bekaert et al., 2017) .

They further advised that this could be accomplished through coordination between all levels of government and relevant private organizations for data collection and the delivery of data through integrated Web portals. These goals have been accomplished; however, there were a number of challenges that needed to be overcome. Both establishment of data standards and funding of network sensors have been major concerns. It should be noted that federal funding to NOAA, USGS, and NASA who maintain the land, ocean, and remote sensing instruments is crucial, yet it is expected that network funding may continue to be a concern."}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Establishing an Integrated Network of Measurement Assets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Communications Standards", "text": "Most of the cities in the region are installing their own water level gauges employing a broad range of sensor types ranging from (1) K a -band March/April 2018 Volume 52 Number 2 radar, as used by NOAA and USGS, to the cheaper (2) ultrasonic sonar, as remote sensing observation methods, to (3) in situ pressure transducers, which tend to biofoul in the fall tidal floods when harmful algal blooms are more frequent. With industrial IoT technologies, cost savings are realized in communities by eschewing the more costly Iridium Satellite uplink communication methods NOAA and USGS use in favor of 4G cellular broadband signals, 2G machineto-machine through Ingenu, and long range wireless area networks. These IoT communication methods, combined with cheaper ultrasonic sensors, result in a reasonably accurate (~10 cm) affordable water level monitoring alternative for modern smart cities at a cost of~10\u00d7 cheaper, per sensor (Loftis et al., 2017a) .\nThe reality is that, although cities may have ample Public Works and Data Scientists capable of installing and managing their own data, the data types, collection intervals, formats, and error metrics should be standardized. Thus, this approach is still likely to be out of the realm of affordability in rural localities for at least the next decade. It should also be noted that IoT approaches, though cheaper, are potentially more susceptible to interrupted communications during heavy flood events coincident with power outages. Although IoT water level sensors are powered by large solar panels and batteries, their communications are still subject to the same overburdened cellular Internet and data channels most denizens rely on when the power and Internet are offline."}, {"section_title": "Funding and Resource Sustainability", "text": "For the engaged cities installing sensors in Hampton Roads, most are either collaborating via cooperative agreement with the USGS Richmond Field Office or VIMS through the Smart Cities StormSense Project to locate suitable sites, procure and install the sensors, and make the data public.

To be sure of this, StormSense is funded through a Replicable Smart City Technologies Cooperative Agreement awarded to the City of Newport News and VIMS, who have been directly advised by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The data streams coming from the StormSense sensors emulate USGS' data standards by collecting data in 6-min time intervals and reporting their water levels relative to NAVD88 while broadcasting their data via public APIs in a variety of digestible data formats. By making all new water level sensors public in near-real time, the observations can be used for forecasting, emergency management, and research projects."}, {"section_title": "Creating Integrated Data Products", "text": "The frequency at which different types of data are upgraded can significantly impact the integration of multiple data into a single model or data product. For example, bathymetry is rarely updated, whereas the water level sensors are updated on 6-min time scales. This means that storm surge models are working with detailed changes in water level, but the water levels may be superimposed on inaccurate depths, hampering the improvement of the models.\nIn Hampton Roads, bathymetric surveys outside of the dredged primary shipping channels are relatively outdated and somewhat sparse in terms of point spacing. Given that shallower streams' hydrographic surveys are frequently integrated as the only digitized bathymetry source, shallow stream systems, such as the Lynnhaven, Nansemond, Back, and Lafayette Rivers do not have the best possible bathymetry data for adequate consideration of flood risk in Hampton Roads. Refined bathymetry would result in an immediate improvement of flood forecasting."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "In completing this inventory of observations and data formats, a number of key determinations can be formulated into recommendations for filling gaps, leveraging historical continuity of observations, and integrating systems for improving situational awareness in emergencies as well as broadbased information needs for resilience planning. An overall premise is that integration of diverse observing systems into a network is vital for resilience planning, which inherently crosses sectors and space-time scales. First, as each observing network arose out of a particular sector or scientific or geotechnical discipline, it is prudent to inventory and define data standards early when inputs are sought across networks. Interoperability issues comprise technical issues of communications and data formats, standards of unit measurements, and application requirements in temporal and spatial collection needs (extent, resolution, and temporal frequency). We find that shallow-water bathymetry continues to be a constraint on hydrodynamic modeling, and efforts to systematically map and update this parameter will result in better forecasting and planning process inputs. Likewise, topographic data, already greatly enhanced by Lidar DEMs, could be further improved with finer resolution, use of hydrocorrection in disjunct, low-lying areas, and leverage research on subsidence for developing future topographic representation (and inundation models) for relative sea level rise (combining eustatic rate scenarios and subsidence trends). In addition, the growing network of real-time water level sensors ought to be expanded to allow forecasting to better predict storm surge impacts as well as wind tides and nuisance flooding. Finally, overall integration of ocean, earth, and atmospheric observations should be sought to enhance situational awareness in emergency events as well as promote scientific analysis and prediction. With these recommendations in mind, these sensor data should be used to help the public, stakeholders, and policy makers in the near term by recognizing when their home or vehicle is in danger of flooding in near-real time and validate predictive model results for future improvement. Simultaneously, this integrated network of sensors will aid in resilience efforts through research into compounding effects of sea level rise and subsidence in Hampton Roads in the long term."}]
