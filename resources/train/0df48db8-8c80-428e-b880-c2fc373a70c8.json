The experimental estimates were built upon BEA's state personal income (SPI) ac counts and its GDP by industry accounts. 1 Since then, BEA has continued improving its GDP by state esti mates by incorporating additional source data, im proving the underlying estimation methodology, and more closely integrating the GDP by state estimates with the national estimates of the annual industry ac counts and the national input-output (I-O) accounts. Further, the release of prototype advance estimates in December 2004 significantly improved the timeliness of the GDP by state annual estimates. The annual GDP by state series consists of estimates for 1963-1997 for Standard Industrial Classification (SIC-based) industries and 1997-2015 for North American Industry Classification (NAICS-based) in dustries (as of June 2016). The GDP by state data are revised and updated quarterly, and annually, with 1.For a discussion of the methodology used to compute state personal income see \"State Personal Income: 2016 Methodology.\" Online methodol ogy publication (September 2016): www.bea.gov/regional/pdf/spi2015.pdf. benchmark revisions occurring approximately every five years, usually in conjunction with major revisions in BEA's estimates of GDP and GDP by Industry. The GDP by state estimates are the state counterpart of gross domestic product and as such, provide a com prehensive measure of a state's production. The follow ing table delineates the differences between GDP by state and SPI. The GDP by state estimates are used widely in both the public and private sectors. For example, the U. S. Department of the Treasury uses GDP by state in its calculation of a state's Total Taxable Resources and in formulas used to distribute federal grants among the states for Community Mental Health Services and Sub stance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grants. GDP by state estimates are also used by consulting firms and universities for use in econometric forecast ing models, by state revenue departments for budget planning, and by state and local economic develop ment offices for attracting new businesses to their states. The estimate of GDP by state for each state is de rived as the sum of the gross domestic product origi nating in all industries in the state. In concept, an 1.

S. indus tries or imported). The sum-of-states NAICS-based GDP by state differs from GDP for the nation for two reasons: \u2022 GDP by state excludes, and the annual industry accounts include, compensation of federal civilian and military personnel stationed abroad and gov ernment consumption of fixed capital for military structures located abroad and for military equip ment, except domestically located office equipment. \u2022 GDP by state, GDP, and the annual industry accounts have different revision schedules. 2 For an accounting of the differences between GDP by state for the nation and the annual industry ac counts for a representative year, see Appendix A. 3 GDP by state estimates are prepared for 81 NAICS industries (Appendix B). For each industry, GDP by state is presented in four components: \u2022 Compensation of employees (COMP), \u2022 Taxes on production and imports (TOPI), \u2022 Subsidies (SUB), and \u2022 Gross operating surplus (GOS). 4 The state estimates of GDP by state and its compo nents for all industries are consistent with national to tals of the annual industry accounts and its components for all industries. In general, there are two procedures for estimating GDP by state and its components, one uses state-level Census Bureau value-added data for the goods-pro ducing industries to estimate GDP by state for these industries, and the other utilizes Census Bureau re ceipts and payroll data, or company financial data to estimate GOS for the services-producing industries. For goods-producing industries, except farming, 2. For SIC-based GDP by state estimates, there is an additional difference between sum-of-states GDP by state and national GDP: SIC-based GDP by state is consistent with gross domestic income (GDI), which differs from GDP by the statistical discrepancy. See Appendix C for a list of industries published for SIC-based GDP by state estimates. 3.

Proprietors' income includes some portion of labor compensation that should be included in the employee compensation com ponent of GDP by state, but it is not possible to separate the labor share of proprietors' income from the capital share. GDP by state excluding R&D and EAO is computed as Census Bureau value added, adjusted to BEA's concept of value added. For farming, data on farm expendi tures and receipts from the Department of Agriculture are used to compute value added for the industry. The GOS income component for goods-producing indus tries is computed as a residual: For services-producing industries, Census Bureau receipts and payroll data or company financial data are used to estimate the GOS income component exclud ing R&D and EAO. GDP by state is the sum of the esti mated income components: The other income components for calculating GDP by state (compensation of employees, taxes on produc tion and imports, subsidies, and fixed investment) are estimated separately for each industry. The GDP by state estimates are prepared in current and chained (real) dollars. Real GDP by state is an in flation-adjusted measure that is based on national prices for the goods and services produced within each state. The purpose of this document is to provide readers with a more detailed description of the sources and methods used by BEA to prepare its estimates of GDP by state than is publicly available elsewhere. Sections II-V describe the data and methods used to estimate compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports, subsidies, and gross operating surplus. Sec tion VI shows the calculation of chained-dollar GDP by state. Section VII looks ahead to future improve ments planned for the GDP by state estimates.

This adjustment to put wage and salary disbursements onto an accrual basis is called the \"wage accruals less disbursements adjustment,\" or the WALD adjustment. The WALD adjustment is calculated for each industry and state on the basis of quarterly tabulations of wages and salaries covered by state unemployment insurance programs from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Accruals and disbursements differ because wage and salary disbursements include retroactive wage payments (bonus payments) recorded in the year they are paid, which may differ from the year in which they were earned.

GDP by State for Goods-Producing Industries", "text": "HE private goods-producing industries are agri-T culture, forestry, and fishing; mining; construc tion; and manufacturing. For these industries, BEA estimates total GDP by state, compensation of employ ees, proprietors' income with inventory valuation ad justment (IVA) and capital consumption allowance (CCA), subsidies, TOPI, and FI. 8,9 The corporate capi tal charge component of GOS is then computed as a residual. For farms, the GDP by state estimates for all years are based on the difference between farm receipts and farm expenses from the U.S. Department of Agricul ture (USDA). 10 For mining, construction, and manu facturing, the GDP by state estimates are based on value added from the quinquennial economic cen suses, although the census data must be adjusted to conform to BEA's definition of value added. Manufacturing, construction, and mining indus tries value-added data from the Census Bureau include the value of purchased services, which BEA treats as an intermediate cost of production and not as a part of value added. The Census Bureau data are adjusted to remove the cost of purchased services. 11 The national ratio of purchased services to value added by industry, derived from BEA's national annual input-output (I-O) tables, is used to estimate and remove the value of purchased services in the Census Bureau's state manufacturing valued added measure, to yield an esti mate of value added by state, industry, and year. After removing the cost of purchased services from the Census Bureau value-added data, an additional ad justment is made to account for differences in industry coverage and classification between the Census Bureau and BEA. The adjusted Census Bureau value-added 8. The forestry, fishing, and related activities industry, which is part of agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting, is estimated like a services-pro ducing industry described later in this document. 9. The inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) is an adjustment to put inventories on BEA's concept (replacement cost) from the way inventories are reported for income tax purposes (business cost). The capital consump tion allowance (CCA) consists of depreciation charges and accidental dam age to fixed capital. 10. Farm income is the sum of cash receipts, other farm income, and inventory change. Farm expenses include the purchase of the following goods and services: feed, livestock, seed, fertilizer and lime, petroleum products, veterinary services, pesticide, rental expense of non-operator landlords, equipment operation and repair, electricity, and miscellaneous expenses. 11. The major commodity groups included in purchased services are communications, finance, insurance, real estate, and services. Only that portion of wholesale trade attributable to sales branches and offices, i.e., non-margin output, is treated as purchased services. data are multiplied by the ratio of BEA wages and sala ries to Census Bureau payrolls by state and industry. This is done on the assumption that the ratio would be 1.0 if there were no differences in coverage and classifi cation of establishments between the two data series. For the construction industry, additional defini tional adjustments are made to the Census Bureau value-added data: 1. BEA removes rental payments for machinery and equipment, because these payments are treated as an intermediate expense by BEA. 2. After the previous adjustment, an adjustment is made to account for the value added generated by construction firms without payrolls, based upon the ratio of \"value of construction work for all firms\" divided by \"value of construction work for firms with payrolls\", as measured by the Census Bureau. 3. Finally, the adjusted value added is multiplied by the ratio of \"value of construction work by location\" to \"value of construction work by establishment\" to reassign the adjusted value added from the state where the construction establishment is located to the state where the construction is performed. After adjusting Census Bureau value-added data, the sum-of-state adjusted value added for the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries are recon ciled with the national industry accounts value added, excluding federal excise taxes (FETs) for the nation, yielding estimates of GDP by state, excluding FETs for the state. GDP by state is then computed by adding es timates of FETs by industry and state. Corporate capi tal charges (CC) by industry and state are then estimated by subtracting employee compensation, TOPI, and proprietors' income from GDP by state. The GDP by state estimates for goods-producing in dustries use different source data and estimation tech niques for years not covered by economic censuses. For the detailed manufacturing industries, value-added data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures are used to produce the GDP by state estimates using an estima tion methodology similar to that used in the bench mark years. For the detailed industries within the mining sector, value-of-production data for each min ing industry are used to extrapolate or interpolate GDP by state values. For construction, GDP by state earnings estimates are used as the industry extrapolation or in terpolation series for construction GDP by state."}, {"section_title": "IV.

For general sales and gross receipts taxes, informa tion is often available from state tax collection reports about the distribution of the taxes by industry and state. However, the industry detail reported by the states varies, so data from the state tax reports are ag gregated or disaggregated as required, on the basis of the industry distribution of employee compensation, to conform to the industries for which the GDP by state estimates are prepared. When the total sales and gross receipts taxes from individual state tax collection reports differ from the state totals reported to the Cen sus Bureau, the Census Bureau value is assumed to be the more reliable level and the industry estimates are made consistent with the published census values. The GDP measures of the remaining TOPI compo nents are distributed to the states using one of the fol lowing two methods depending on whether the tax is paid by just one or by several industries: \u2022 When the tax is paid by a single industry, the Census Bureau measure of the tax receipts by state, if avail able, is used as the indicator series to distribute the GDP by Industry tax measure to the states. If a Cen sus measure is not available, a related state indicator is used to allocate the annual industry accounts' tax measure to the states (Appendix D). \u2022 When the tax is paid by two or more industries, a dual allocation procedure is used. First, the industry distribution of BEA's compensation of employees, by state, is employed to distribute the Census Bureau's measure of the state's total collection of the tax to the industries in each state.

Real GDP by State", "text": "Chain-weighted quantity indexes EA prepares chain-type quantity indexes, by in-B dustry, for the nation, but state-level information on prices by industry is not available, so estimates of real GDP by state are derived by applying nationallevel industry implicit price deflators to the current dollar GDP by state estimates for the detailed indus tries. Real GDP by state for the aggregate industries (such as total services, manufacturing, and so on) is derived by using the same chain-type index formula that is used in the national accounts. To the extent that a state's output is produced and sold in national mar kets at relatively uniform prices (or sold locally at na tional prices), real GDP by state captures the relative differences in the mix of goods and services that states produce. However, real GDP by state does not capture state-to-state differences in the prices of goods and ser vices that are produced and sold locally. Unlike fixed-weighted measures, chain-weighted measures are not based on the price weights of a single base year, but on the prices and quantities of adjacent years. Fixed-weighted measures have a number of dis advantages, including the need for periodic rebasing, leading to significant revisions to the historical data, and the inability to capture substitution effects caused by changing relative prices of goods and services. Chain-weighted measures avoid these weaknesses. However, chain-weighted measures do have some disadvantages; they are not additive, because they are based upon geometric means, and they are more diffi cult to compute than fixed-weighted measures. The non-additivity of chain-weighted measures means that total real GDP by state cannot be obtained by sum ming the real GDP by state of each industry. As a re sult, the contribution of each industry to a change in real total GDP by state is not readily computable. The computation of contributions to growth is described later in this section. To calculate a chain-type quantity index for total GDP by state, or GDP by state of any aggregate indus try, a Fisher Ideal index is used. The Fisher Ideal index is the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche quantity indexes. The Paasche quantity index is de fined as: and the Laspeyres quantity index is defined as: The Fisher quantity index is the geometric mean of the Paasche and Laspeyres quantity indexes for adja cent years: However, in the above formula, the variables that represent the composites of prices in one year and quantities in an adjacent year (for example, p i,1 x q i,2 ) are not directly observable, so an algebraically-equiva lent formula is used to calculate the Fisher quantity in dex: The Fisher quantity index measures the percent change in real quantities between adjacent years. To obtain a time series, successive indexes are calculated and then chained together by arbitrarily setting the first year equal to 1.0 and iteratively multiplying the current year's index by the next year's index. To change the reference year (there is no \"base year,\" in the sense that there is in the case of fixed-weighted indexes) of the series, one must only divide each element of the se ries by the value of the index for the desired reference year. Real chained-dollar GDP by state estimates are calculated from the chained Fisher Ideal index series by multiplying the index for each year by the current-dol lar GDP by state value for the reference year. For dis play purposes, the indexes are commonly multiplied by 100, to set the reference year value to 100.0 rather than 1.0."}, {"section_title": "Contributions to real growth", "text": "Real chain-weighted GDP by state is not additive (ex cept for the trivial case of the reference year, when the real and nominal dollar values are the same), because the underlying quantity indexes are geometric means of indexes from adjacent years.

If the data being interpolated were, for example, payroll or value-added data by industry and state, then a related series to be used might be BEA wage and salary accruals by industry and state: The wage and salary data, W, are available for all years in the time series, so the interpolated values for X can be tied to the available values of W by interpolat ing the ratio between the two series. For the years for which values of X are available, compute the ratios be tween the values of X and the values of the related se ries W: The interpolated values of these ratios are then computed by applying the average annual growth rate between available ratio values, which are directly com putable just every five years in the current example: The value is the annual geometric factor (techni cally, it is 1.0 plus the average annual growth rate in the ratio) for computing interpolated values of the ratios between the related data series W and the missing val ues X: 0 , and so on until all the missing values of X have been computed. One limitation of the geometric interpolation method outlined here is that it is useless if the endpoint values being interpolated are of opposite sign. There is no constant annual growth rate, and therefore no value of \u0394 , that will carry one monotonically from a nega tive number to a positive one, or vice versa. (A negative value of \u0394 may be found to traverse the interpolation period and connect the available endpoints; however, it would do so by oscillating annually between negative and positive values-not generally a desirable result.) In these cases, a linear interpolation of the ratios be tween X and W may be the only solution, but one needs to carefully review the results of any such interpolation, inasmuch as the construction of the ratio-which value is the numerator and which is the denomina tor-will affect the shape of the resulting interpolated time series, sometimes in surprising fashion. A similar approach can be used to extrapolate values of X. In this case, one would need to decide what value to assign to \u0394. Assigning \u0394 a value of 1.0 keeps the ratio between X and W constant during the extrapola tion period (\u0394 is 1.0 plus the annual growth rate, so a value of 1.0 implies a zero growth rate for the ratio).

An indicator data series is a data set with a known distribution-usually a distribution across states. In the context of GDP by state estimation, it is assumed to be similar to the un known state distribution of the national total. For ex ample, in the absence of better information, it may be assumed that a tax for an industry is distributed across the states as employee compensation is distributed, so the state estimate for the tax would be derived by ap plying the industry's distribution of employee com pensation to the national total for the tax for the industry. It is often the case that the indicator series is itself a first estimate of the data being estimated, such as ad justed value-added data from the Census Bureau, which provide the first estimate of GDP by state for the manufacturing industries. In these cases the objec tive is to reconcile the first estimate with a predeter mined control total, usually a national total, to which the state-level estimates must sum. The procedure used to distribute a national total ac cording to an indicator series, or to reconcile a first es timate to a control total, is commonly referred to as allocation, because a control total is \"allocated\" or shared out to the states. This procedure can be ex pressed algebraically as: where: x i = the state i estimate for some component of GDP by state; X US = the predetermined national total being distrib uted to the states; and z i = the state i value of indicator series Z, being used to allocate the value of X US to the states (which may be the first estimate of the data being estimated). In practice, it is often advisable to perform data al locations using the absolute values of the indicator se ries, so the above formulation would become: Basing the allocation on absolute values has advan tages when either the indicator series or the national total being distributed may contain negative numbers, as commonly occurs when the data are net values, such as net interest. A refinement of this allocation procedure is some times used when additional information is available. For example, national property tax totals are available by industry, so the allocation procedure just described could be used to distribute those industry totals to the states, using compensation of employees or some other indicator series as the distributor. However, informa tion is also available on all-industry total property tax payments by state, so an additional constraint can be placed on the estimates of property tax payments by industry and state. This is accomplished using a dual allocation procedure. A dual allocation is an iterative application of the al location procedure described above, with the alloca tion first to one set of totals, and then to a second set; the procedure is repeated until the estimated values converge to a solution in which all constraints are sat isfied. Convergence to a solution requires the two sets of controls to be mutually consistent. Thus, using the property tax example again, the national property tax totals by industry can be summed across industries to yield a national all-industry total for property taxes, and the state-level all-industry property tax totals can be summed across states also to yield a national all-in dustry total for property taxes.

These all-industry totals by tax are distributed across industries and states according to the methods described below. \u2022 State and local general sales taxes are bottom-up estimates based upon reports collected from the individual states and upon Government Finance data from the Census Bureau. The data are aggre gated across states to yield national estimates by industry. The national estimates by industry for revised years are computed by applying the best change in the sum-of-state industry estimates to the previously published national industry values. The estimates by industry are then controlled to the national total for general sales taxes. \u2022 State and local property taxes by industry are esti mated using national industry property tax data and current-cost net stock of private fixed assets (\"capital stock\") data from BEA. The property tax estimates for farms are developed as part of BEA's GDP estimate. Property tax estimates for three industries: rail transportation, telephone and tele graph, and insurance carriers are based upon indus try data from DOT, FCC, and the American Council of Life Insurance, respectively. Property taxes for residential real estate are obtained from the NIPAs.

The national motor vehicle license tax total includes only business license taxes, which is what is needed in the computation of TOPI-personal motor vehicle li cense tax payments are not part of GDP by state. But the Census Bureaus' state and national values contain both business and personal license taxes, so the non business payments portion needs to be removed. To compute business motor vehicle license taxes by state, the ratio of BEA's national level of motor vehicle li cense taxes (which excludes personal motor vehicle li cense tax payments) to the Census Bureau's national measure of motor vehicle license taxes (which includes personal motor vehicle license tax payments) is com puted and applied to the Census state totals for motor vehicle license taxes, yielding business motor vehicle li cense taxes by state. The DOT supplies total motor vehicle registration fees and autos registration fees by state. These data are used to split the state business motor vehicle license taxes, computed above, into the amount for autos and for trucks. The autos share of total fees is applied to the state business motor vehicle license tax total yielding business taxes for autos by state. Trucks fees are com puted as a residual. Industry values for auto business taxes by state are computed by applying the national industry distribution of capital stock for autos to each state's auto license tax total. The same procedure is ap plied to trucks, using capital stock for trucks. The final national estimates for motor vehicle license taxes by in dustry are generated by summing the state/industry values for autos and trucks. \u2022 Taxes from motor fuel sales, tobacco sales, insur ance sales, hunting and fishing licenses, building permits, pari-mutuel sales, amusement sales, and amusement licenses each affect only one industry, so the national control total for each tax is assigned to the affected industry. \u2022 Alcohol license taxes are distributed to the indus tries by applying national industry shares of the tax (obtained from the GDP by Industry accounts) to the national total for alcohol license taxes. \u2022 Corporate franchise taxes are distributed to the industries by applying national industry shares of SOI capital stock to the national total for the tax, except for farms where the value is set to zero. \u2022 The TOPI category \"other taxes\" is estimated using data from NIPA tax receipts and the industry distri bution series of BLS wages and salaries.

The sum of these direct industry assign ments is then subtracted from total federal nontax pay ments yielding total miscellaneous receipts. A further industry assignment of miscellaneous re ceipts is done based on the title or description of coverage in Table A of the Treasury appendices.

Note 5: Adjustments to financial items of utilities companies BEA adjusts the profits and depreciation plus amortiza tion reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Com mission (FERC) by utilities companies to make them consistent with the conventions used in the NIPAs. The three steps below describe the adjustments to operating expense, operating income, and net interest: 1. The adjustment to operating expenses of each company consists of the net provision for de ferred income taxes divided by the corporate stat utory tax rate: where: \u0394 = the adjustment made to company operating expenses, P = provision for deferred income taxes, C = provision for deferred income taxes (credits), and r = statutory corporate income tax rate. The adjusted operating expenses value is com bined with reported depreciation expense plus amortization to yield the indicator series used to distribute to the states the national corporate CCA for utilities companies. 2. The same adjustment is made to reported net utility operating income. Then the following fi nancial items are added to the adjusted value of operating income: \u2022 Reported federal income taxes on operating and other income, \u2022 Reported net investment tax credit adjustments, \u2022 Reported total other income less other income deductions, and \u2022 Reported loss on disposition of property. This adjusted net utility operating income is then used to distribute to the states the national indus try total of corporate profits with IVA minus taxes other than income taxes (because those are ac counted for in TOPI) minus the sum of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction plus net interest charges. 3. The sum of net interest charges and allowance for borrowed funds used during construction is used as the indicator series to distribute to the states the national utilities industry net interest total.  employees..................................................

The impact of the natural disaster on personal income growth cannot be distinguished separately, however, because the source data record actual activity and do not attempt to separately identify the effects of the di saster. Nonetheless, in the short run, compensation in many industries is likely to decline in areas directly hit by the hurricane because of a decline in production, while in some industries involved in the cleanup and repair (construction and health care and social assis tance) compensation may increase. Similarly, compen sation could increase in areas that are the recipients of evacuees, both from the increased activity to support these evacuees (e.g. doctors moving into the area) and to the extent that the evacuees themselves might find employment. Estimates of property losses and of the associated insurance claims are incorporated as one-time effects: They increase both the consumption of fixed capital and business transfer payments. Damage to the prop erty of household enterprises affects proprietors' in come and rental income.

In the case of the New Orleans metropolitan area, as we now know, there was severe damage and flooding of residences and businesses in many parts of the area, and mandatory evacuation has been ordered for the entire city. Such a dramatic alteration of the structure of a local economy makes using multipliers from re gional input-output models like RIMS highly prob lematic.
