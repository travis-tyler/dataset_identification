[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Agriculture is one of the high risk enterprises where farmers are continuously faced with a lot of uncertainties. These uncertainties mostly come in the form of shocks and may generate high costs, most at times in amounts which are not readily available to the farmer. As to whether a farmer would be able to make the said repayment in the stipulated time depends on several factors which differ across farms, communities, regions as well as countries. Factors that affect timely loan repayment vary across sectors and geographical locations, though there sure would be similarities across board. This study basically seeks to find out the factors that influence farmer loan delinquencies and defaults, specifically factors that make farmers relent on paying their loans on time. The paper also uses a credit-risk model to describe the behavior of default farmers, and under what circumstances they may be highly probable to miss their loan repayment deadlines. The study estimates the probability of default using a credit risk model. Following Durguner's (2007) approach, this study also uses a farm-level data to measure creditworthiness instead of the conventional practice of using lender data. Other related farm-level data studies include Novak et al (1994) and Escalante et al (2004). In order to examine the credit riskiness of a borrowing farmer, the paper models the effect of financial ratios on farms' credit risk level, where credit risk level refers to repayment capacity. Higher repayment capacity implies a lower credit risk. Coverage ratio is used as a measure for repayment capacity. Farmers are considered to have low (high) credit risk if they have high (low) repayment capacity and a coverage ratio greater (less) than 1. The estimated model is as follows: The X i represents the financial ratios. They are the working capital to gross return, debt-to-asset ratio, return on assets, asset turnover ratio, and tenure ratio. These financial ratios are used as proxies for liquidity, solvency, profitability, and financial efficiency and tenure respectively. Dummy j represents the farm type dummy i.e. either grains, cotton, tobacco, poultry, cattle, dairy products, fruits or vegetables. All data are obtained from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) database (Phase III). A ten-year period (2003 -2012) survey data of the ARMS are amalgamated into a pool-cross sectional data. The rich farm-level information provided by the ARMS data provides a ground for detailed analyses and much more reliable results. The 10-year pooled-cross sectional ARMS data comprise of a total of 174,003 observations. Credit worthiness of different kind of farmers vary across space, are significantly affected by key financial ratios like liquidity, solvency, profitability, and financial efficiency. It is imperative for the lender to evaluate the group of farmer, his/ her area of operation and consequently the likelihood of repayment.
