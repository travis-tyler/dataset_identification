[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of severe cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia 1 Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named coronavirus disease . By Mar 16, 2020 Hypertension rates range from 13.4% in non-severe patients to 23.4% in severe patients, and the total incidence is as high as 15% 2 . Interestingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\nis involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and COVID-19 pneumonia. The above reasons prompted us to speculate that the organs attacked by SARS-COV-2 might not only be the lungs, but may also include other ACE2 expression organs, especially the cardiovascular system. In addition, patients with comorbid hypertension, especially those with long-term oral ACEI/ARB medication for hypertension, might have different susceptibility and severity levels of pneumonia upon infection with SARS-COV-2. Therefore, we investigated and compared the demographic characteristics, coexisting diseases, severity of pneumonia, and the effect of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI/ARB versus non-ACEI/ARB) in COVID-19 patients with coexisting hypertension. Our findings may hopefully reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with hypertension in patients with COVID-19.\n.

Patients who were < 18 years, whose entire stay in hospital lasted for < 48 hours were excluded from the analysis. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and the Ethics Commission of Hankou Hospital (hkyy2020-005). The Ethics Commission of Hankou Hospital waived the requirement for obtaining informed consent.\nWe obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcome data from patients' medical records using standardized data collection forms.\nClinical outcomes were followed up to March 8, 2020. To analyze the relationship between stage of hypertension and clinical outcome, a minimum follow-up time of 14 days was required, including follow-up of patients who were discharged before March 8, 2020. If data were missing from the records or clarification was needed, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. All data were checked by two physicians (TS and HH).

Compared to patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension were significantly older and more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. Patients with hypertension tended to have a longer time from onset to admission and have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Table 2 shows the results of the laboratory tests performed on admission according to hypertension status. Patients with hypertension had higher levels of serum creatinine (SCr) and lower levels of hemoglobin and D-dimer in whole blood than patients without hypertension. No differences in clinical outcomes were found between patients with hypertension and without hypertension ( Table 3) .\nWe then compared the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who had a history of hypertension and those who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs and those who had not. More cases of severe pneumonia were seen among patients who had taken ACEI/ARB drugs than the patients who had not, even though those who had taken ACEI/ARB drugs were younger than those who had not (Age, P = 0.055; Pneumonia severity status on admission, P = 0.064). No significant differences in other indexes were found between the two groups ( Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our observation shows that patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2.

ACE2 is the only known human homologue of the key regulator of blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).\nSince its discovery in 2000, ACE2 has been implicated to play an important role in the preservation of heart function, and the balance of blood pressure, with its effects being mediated, in part, through its ability to convert angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin-(1-7).\nUnexpectedly, ACE2 also serves as the cellular entry point for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the enzyme is therefore a prime target for pharmacological intervention on coronavirus-related diseases 9 . In 2003, ACE2 was identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which mediates the infection and transmission of SARS-CoV. This effect does not rely on the protease activity on ACE 10 . Structural analysis showed that the spinous protein of SARS-CoV was in contact with the head-end of the ACE2 catalytic domain subunit I, did not involve subunit II, and did not block the active region. Once SARS-CoV is connected to ACE2, the extracellular part of ACE2 will be lysed, and the transmembrane part will be transferred into the cell, which mediates further fusion of the virus particles and host cells 11 . Through next-generation sequencing technology, the entire genome sequence of COVID-19 has been successfully determined 12 . Compared with the genomic sequences of previous coronaviruses, it is found that SARS-COV-2 has 79% similarity with SARS-CoV 13 .\nIt is worth noting that ACEI/ARB drugs that are administered to hypertensive patients have resulted in an increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs. The role of ACE2 is opposite .

ACE2 can hydrolyze angiotensin I (Ang I) to produce angiotensin (1-7) peptides, thereby generating vasodilation and lowering blood pressure. ACEI/ARB drugs may increase the protein concentration of ACE2 in rat plasma, mRNA level of ACE2, and even the activity of ACE2 in cardiac tissue 14 . Thus, it is possible that those hypertensive patients who had been taking ACEI/ARB might have an increased level of mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 in the lungs, making them more vulnerable for SARS-COV-2 entry, as well as for development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings are worth investigating further.\nHowever, some scholars believe that the down-regulation of ACE2 expression after a neo coronavirus challenge aggravates lung injuries. This opinion mainly comes from animal model studies in multiple laboratories and a small sample clinical study. Studies have shown that ACE2 expression decreases after viral infection, causing acute lung injury; exogenous supplementation with ACE2 could alleviate acute lung injury 15 . Human recombinant ACE 2 (rhuACE2) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors protect mice from severe acute lung injuries induced by acid aspiration or sepsis 16 . It was found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were treated with rhuACE2 injections had rapidly decreasing levels of Ang II and increasing levels of Ang1-7 17 . The down-regulation of ACE2 caused the imbalance of ACE/Ang II and ACE2 and the activity of Ang II in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was enhanced because of the lack of antagonism 17 . Ang II mediates increased pulmonary vascular permeability by binding to receptor AT1, and might also cause pulmonary vascular contraction, resulting in hydrostatic pressure elevation and pulmonary edema 10, 17 . More clinical evidence is required to determine whether the expression of ACE2 is down-regulated in humans after a coronavirus (including .

Nevertheless, the results of our study suggest that in the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, the hypertensive population may need to quickly consider their choice of antihypertensive medications to reduce the possibility of developing severe pneumonia. Our investigation found that COVID-19 patients taking ACEI/ARB agents are younger than patients taking non-ACEI/ARB agents; this may be related to their doctor's prescribing habits.\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that COVID-19 patients taking ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs will have more severe pneumonia than those not taking ACEI/ARB drugs because many confounding factors such as coexisting diseases have not yet been excluded.\nOur survey shows that the population with hypertension does not seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 comparing with the non-hypertension population.

Second, our investigation included all clinically confirmed cases. Many patients were not tested because of the lack of nucleic acid test kits at the beginning of the outbreak. Further, there were some patients were suspected to have COVID-19 but were excluded from our study because they tested negative in the hospital; however, based on the exact epidemiological history, the patient's signs and symptoms, and chest CT examination results, we trust the reliability of the COVID-19 diagnosis in these patients. Third, due to the urgent data collection, we had a shorter follow-up time for some patients. The shortest hospital stay for patients is only > 14 days. This may interfere with the final prognosis and lead to the failure to analyze survival times. Fourth, we did not analyze the comorbidities such as shock and ARDS, because our focus is to analyze the risk associated with hypertension to provide evidence for the issue of COVID-19 prevention and treatment guidelines."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "COVID-19 patients with coexisting hypertension were significantly older and were more .
