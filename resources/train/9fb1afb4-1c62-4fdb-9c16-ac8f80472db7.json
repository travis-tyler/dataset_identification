Iterations were conducted in 1953 ( Josephson and McGuire 1958 ), 1978 (Birch et al. 1982 , 1993 (Birch 1996 ), and 2002 -2006 (Butler 2008 . The fifth iteration of the NWOS, documented here, was conducted from 2011 through 2013 by the Family Forest Research Center, a joint venture of the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nThis report documents the procedures used to design, implement, and generate estimates from the data collected by the U.S. Forest Service, National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS) during the 2011-2013 iteration of the survey. An analogous document published for the 2002-2006 NWOS (Butler et al. 2005) provides additional background on the NWOS. The organization of the current document follows the workflow of the NWOS as depicted in Figure 1 . First the background of the NWOS and the general planning process steps are described. Then the methods used to generate the sample of respondents asked to participate in the NWOS are defined including sampling design, sampling frame, sample size determination, and sample intensification. Next the basic survey instrument is detailed, and comparisons are made with the survey instrument used in the previous iteration of the NWOS. Methods used to implement the NWOS with mail, phone, and online approaches are outlined and data processing, quality assurance, data confidentiality, and database design are described. The next topic covered is procedures used to generate population-level estimates that incorporate the NWOS sampling design by using questionnaire responses. Finally, the NWOS products and general analytical approaches are briefly described. Key terms are defined in the glossary at the end of this report. "}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND AND PLANNING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Goals and Objectives", "text": "The legislative authority for conducting the NWOS as part of the Forest Inventory and Analysis program comes from the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 (RRA 1978) . This act instructs the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \"obtain, analyze, develop, demonstrate, and disseminate scientific information about protecting, managing, and utilizing forest and rangeland renewable resources in rural, suburban, and urban areas.\" As such, the U.S. Forest Service has established the NWOS as the social complement to the biophysical inventory conducted by the FIA program. While most of FIA is concerned with monitoring the number, species, health, and related attributes of the trees of the nation's forest and woodland resource (Bechtold and Patterson 2005) , the NWOS is concerned with understanding the social context within which the forests and woodlands exist, or more precisely the ownerships of these resources. The NWOS collects data on three groups of private forest and woodland ownerships: family, corporate, and other private. While family forest and woodland ownerships are the focus of many of the NWOS products and are the population of interest discussed here, identical methods were used to collect data for corporate and other private forest and woodland ownerships.\nThe objectives of the NWOS are to address questions related to:\n\u2022 Who owns America's forests and woodlands?\n\u2022 Why do they own these lands?\n\u2022 What have they done with these lands in the past?\n\u2022 What do they plan to do with these lands in the future?\n\u2022 How have characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors changed over time?\nThe goal is to obtain statistically reliable estimates of population parameters that answer these questions for the nation and all U.S. states, territories, and protectorates. Estimates for territories and protectorates have not yet been obtained, but it is hoped this shortcoming will be addressed in the next iteration of the NWOS.\nMonitoring trends in forest ownership characteristics is as equally important to the NWOS mission as is generating snapshot estimates of landowner statistics. Previous iterations of the NWOS were conducted in 1953 ( Josephson and McGuire 1958 ), 1978 (Birch et al. 1982 , 1993 (Birch 1996 ), and 2002 -2006 (Butler 2008 . Due to differences in data collected, data collection protocols, and estimation procedures, there are limitations when making comparisons between surveys, especially the earliest surveys. The 2002 The -2006 The and the current 2011 The -2013 iterations represent the first time that the same data collection protocols were used. Eighty-six percent of the 2011-2013 variables have analogous variables that were collected in the 2002-2006 NWOS, and a detailed discussion of comparability is provided. Because estimation procedures have been updated, the 2002-2006 data were reprocessed using the new procedures to avoid any differences due to data processing when comparing between the two iterations."}, {"section_title": "The Institutional Approval Process", "text": "As with all research that includes human subjects, approval of the methods used for the NWOS was required. Because the NWOS is implemented by the Family Forest Research Center (http://familyforestresearchcenter.org), a joint venture between the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, both federal-and university-level approvals were required. The process for federal approval is outlined in the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA 1995) and is administered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The university approval process is administered by the university's Internal Review Board (IRB; https://www.umass.edu/research/compliance/human-subjects-irb).\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act requires that all projects that collect information from 10 or more private citizens, businesses, or other nonfederal entities obtain approval from OMB prior to implementing the survey. As stated in the preamble of the bill, the overall intent of the Paperwork Reduction Act is \"to have Federal agencies become more responsible and publicly accountable for reducing the burden of Federal paperwork on the public\" (PRA 1995) . The submission package was assembled by the NWOS staff and involved reviews by outside experts and clearance officers within the Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service, posting on the federal registry, and a final review by OMB. The NWOS was approved under OMB Information Collection Number 0596-0078 for a 3-year period (September 1, 2010 to August 31, 2013 , the maximum allowed under the OMB guidelines.\nThe University of Massachusetts Internal Review Board process is administered in accordance with the Federal Policy on the Protection of Human Subjects (DHHS Policy 45 CFR 46, FDA policy 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56). The IRB, composed of university faculty with survey expertise, reviews all research involving human subjects. For the IRB process, the NWOS staff prepared the requisite forms, which were reviewed and approved by the IRB."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLING: DESIGN, FRAME, SIZE, AND INTENSIFICATION", "text": "To extrapolate the results of a survey of a subset of a population of interest to the whole population of interest, a probability-based sampling design is often employed. This means that all members of the population of interest have non-zero inclusion probabilities, i.e., all members of the population have some known, calculable probability of being included in the sample (Cochran 1977) . This section discusses all aspects of the sampling associated with the 2011-2013 NWOS, including: a description of the overall sampling design; details on the sampling frame, the list from which respondents are selected; the rationale for the target sample sizes; and why, where, and how the sample was intensified. More detailed discussions of the sampling strategy are provided in Dickinson and Butler (2013) and Dickinson et al. (2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Design", "text": "The NWOS is built upon the sampling framework used for the plot-based FIA forest resource monitoring (Bechtold and Patterson 2005) . The sampling procedure involves a hexagonal tessellation of the population from which a random sample point is selected within each hexagon (Fig. 2) . A grid of 5,937-acre hexagons was randomly placed over the United States, giving a spatial sampling intensity of roughly one sample point per 6,000 acres. The grid cell size was reduced in some small states, such as Rhode Island and Delaware, to obtain estimates with reliabilities more comparable to other, larger states. Rather than taking the hexagon centers as the primary sampling units as is done in a purely systematic design, sample points were randomly offset to \"satellite locations\" within each hexagon. The random offset was accomplished by randomly selecting azimuth and distance from the hexagon center. Sampling was systematic through time, with plots on a 5-to 7-year sampling rotation in the eastern United States and 10-year rotation in the western United States (Fig. 2) .\nThe FIA primary sampling units, which are zero-dimensional points (Bechtold and Patterson 2005) , were used to draw the NWOS sample. Analysis of the NWOS data differs from the FIA forest resource analyses because even though the sampling units for the NWOS are based on the FIA primary sampling units, ownerships are measured as opposed to the plots used for the forest resource analyses. Because multiple sample points can fall on the same ownership-especially for large and/or multiple-parcel ownerships-NWOS selection of ownerships is with-replacement ( Jessen 1978 , Lohr 1999 ). The hexagonal tessellation means an ownership can be selected as many times as the number of hexagons it occupies, but no more, because only one point is selected from each hexagon. As in any with-replacement design, attribute information from an ownership is used in estimation as many times as the ownership is selected.\nOwnerships are selected with probability proportional to size because points on the ground have equal probabilities of selection, and the greater the area of forest and woodland owned, the greater the probability of being included in the sample. Unequal probability sampling provides an advantage when there is wide variation among the units (Lohr 1999) , though sometimes it is just inherently part of the sampling process. (Bechtold and Patterson 2005) . Each hexagon contains one randomly selected sample point (\uf09f). The numbers represent a 5-year inventory cycle and indicate the year the hexagon will be sampled. For example, sample points in the hexagons labeled \"1\" would be sampled the first year, sample points in the \"2\" hexagons the second year, and so on, with sampling cycling back to the points in the \"1\" hexagons starting the sixth year. The critical terms to define in relationship to the NWOS sampling design are: population, stratum, and domain of interest. In this report, slightly different terminology from that used by Bechtold and Patterson (2005) in describing the FIA sampling design is used in order to be more consistent with the broader sampling literature (e.g., Lohr 1999 ). The population sampled by the NWOS is the same population sampled as part of the FIA forest resource inventory: all U.S. land. However, populations of interest are subsets of this full sampling frame. Furthermore, only ownerships associated with private forests are measured for NWOS attribute values. Family, corporate, and other private forest and woodland ownerships are the three populations of interest, and taken together, they represent all private forest and woodland ownerships. To simplify discussions in this report, population of interest refers to family forest and woodland ownerships unless noted otherwise. Identical procedures were used for the other populations of interest.\nThe NWOS was administered with varying sampling intensities by stratum. Strata were states for the 2011-2013 iteration of the NWOS in contrast to the 2002-2006 iteration when strata were substate estimation units (Butler et al. 2005) . Stratification by state is done for several reasons. First, expected cross-state differences in parameters should make stratification more efficient in terms of variance estimation. Second, states themselves are often domains of interest. Finally, a certain degree of precision is desired for each state, meaning disproportionate stratification is needed (Kish 1965 , Lohr 1999 , Som 1973 ).\nDomain of interest refers to a particular subset of a population of interest, either within or across strata. For example, a domain of interest could be family forest and woodland ownerships with a written forest management plan."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Frame", "text": "Remote sensing and ground-truthing determined land use at each sample point generated from the approach outlined in the Sampling Design section. Forest is defined by FIA as \"land at least 120 feet (37 meters) wide and at least 1 acre (0.4 hectare) in size with at least 10 percent cover (or equivalent stocking) by live trees including land that formerly had such tree cover and that will be naturally or artificially regenerated\" (Oswalt et al. 2014: 31) and as further defined in the FIA field manual (U.S. Forest Service 2010). Ownership for forested sample plots was determined from publicly available property tax records and was designated as 1 of 16 ownership categories (Table 1) . Private ownerships were then contacted and invited to participate in the NWOS.\nAn ownership is a legal entity that includes one or more owners, and so an individual owner can be part of more than one ownership. As stated in the questionnaire instructions, respondents were asked to respond for all of the forest and woodland they owned in a state. If an ownership had forest land in multiple states, they might be asked to complete separate surveys for each state within which they own forest and woodland. However, less than one percent of ownerships in the sample had sample points in more than one state. No ownership was contacted more than once per cycle for each state within which they owned forest and woodland. Because the unit of interest was an ownership, an individual could be asked to complete separate questionnaires if they were part of more than one ownership.\nAll qualified names and addresses were standardized (e.g., first name then last name) following the U.S. Postal Service addressing standards. This information was then entered into a master table, and a series of filters were applied to identify ownerships that were listed more than once. "}, {"section_title": "Sample Size", "text": "The target sample size per strata (i.e., state) was empirically determined by examining the coefficient of variation for estimates of the number of private ownerships for each state using the 2002-2006 data (Butler 2008) . The coefficient of variation is a means for looking at variation across estimates from populations of different sizes (Cochran 1977) Based on this analysis, an inflection point occured around a sample size of 250, and the coefficient of variation began to approach an asymptote of approximately 0.15 (Fig. 3) .\nA much smaller rate of decrease in the coefficient of variation after this point indicated a much lower marginal benefit. As a result, the goal of the 2011-2013 NWOS was to obtain a minimum of 250 responses per state with an associated coefficient of variation of no more than 0.15. In states where the target sample was not achieved through the base sample, efforts were made to increase the sampling intensity (see Sample Intensification section).\nThe number of forest and woodland ownerships responding to the NWOS in a state-the effective sample size-is a function of the sampling intensity, the percentage of forest and woodland that is privately owned, the number of sample points owned per respondent, and cooperation rates. Cooperation rates are calculated as:\nWhere Responses = number of completed and partially completed surveys returned, Sent = total number of surveys mailed, and Undeliverables = number of surveys returned as undeliverable.\nOften the term response rate is incorrectly used in the literature, when it is actually cooperation rate that is being reported. According to AAPOR (2015) , response rate should, at a minimum, include in the denominator those in the sample who were not contacted (e.g., those with bad addresses).\nFor the contiguous United States, the base sample is one sample point for every 6,000 acres collected over the course of the full measurement cycle that does not exceed 7 years in the East and 10 years in the West. The cooperation rate for the 2002-2006 NWOS was 51.3 percent (Butler 2008) . Based upon these considerations, budgetary and logistical constraints, and the fact that the 5-year cycle was compressed to 3 years, approximately 9,000 private forest and woodland ownerships per year were asked to participate in the NWOS from 2011 through 2013. The goal is to complete a full cycle of the NWOS once every 5 years with 20 percent of the potential respondents, equally distributed across the United States, contacted each year. This would better reflect how the sample is collected (i.e., as part of the base FIA program), allowing for finer temporal trends to be discerned and a better distribution of the workload. Due to various logistic constraints, the idealized timing has not yet been reached, but hopefully will be in the future."}, {"section_title": "Sample Intensification", "text": "In states where the base sample did not reach the minimum sample size, an intensified sample was collected if the requisite data were available (i.e., ownership information was available in a GIS format). This intensification was conducted in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Sampling procedures used for the base sample were replicated as closely as possible for the intensified sample, with a goal of eliciting a total of 250 respondents per state, including the base NWOS sample. In Connecticut and Maryland, external funding enabled even greater intensification, resulting in sample sizes larger than 250.\nUsing information from the base sample, including percentage of private forest and woodland ownership and cooperation rates, appropriately sized hexagons were created, and points were randomly generated for all hexagons where an NWOS sample point did not already exist. Newly generated points were intersected with a subset of federal and state land identified in the Protected Areas Database geospatial layer (PAD-US 1.1) (CBI 2010). For points determined not to be on federal or state ownerships, aerial photography was used to determine whether the points were forested or wooded. For the forested or wooded points, ownership information was collected from available geospatial data, and points determined to be private forest and woodland ownerships were added to the sample."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY INSTRUMENT", "text": "This section details the general approach taken for designing the survey instrument and discusses the specific data elements collected. Differences among the current and previous survey instruments are discussed in addition to minor differences in questionnaires across versions and states.\nBecause the only information available for all potential respondents was name and mailing address (see Sampling Frame section above), the primary survey instrument was a mail-based paper booklet (App. 1). This booklet contained a total of 37 questions, with many having one or more subparts. The survey instrument length was limited to minimize burden on respondents. Study objectives, including comparability with previous studies, and input from experts influenced the selection of questions that were included.\nA Web-based version of the survey instrument was created and coded by using hypertext markup language (HTML). This online survey instrument contained all of the same questions as the paper survey, and the wording and formatting mimicking that of the paper version as much as possible. To increase comparability with the paper version, no logic checks were built into the online version.\nTo test for nonresponse bias and provide additional data, a phone survey instrument containing a subset of the questions on the paper survey instrument was administered to a subset of the nonrespondents (App. 2). Only a subset of questions (22 percent) was used in order to minimize interview time, and only a subset of nonrespondents was contacted due to limited phone number availability and financial constraints.\nAs described above, states were the strata or estimation units, and the survey instrument was designed to reference all forest and woodland an ownership had in a given state. If an ownership had forest or woodland in more than one state, that ownership could receive a survey from each state, and a few owners did receive surveys for multiple states. The content of the state-specific survey instruments is documented in the Survey Instrument Versions section below."}, {"section_title": "Survey Pretesting", "text": "The wording, content, design, and layout of a survey instrument can significantly influence the response rate and the quality of the answers provided (Dillman et al. 2009 ). Pretesting via focus groups was used to develop questions that elicited accurate information. In writing the questions, the goal was to use language that someone with the equivalent of an eighthgrade education could easily understand. In addition, efforts were made to use words common to private forest owners rather than technical, forestry terms. For example, the term forest was not used in the survey instrument because it has a different connotation to owners and forestry professionals. Instead the phrase \"wooded land\" was used throughout the survey.\nPretesting of the survey instrument, in accordance with the OMB approval process, involved focus groups with private forest and woodland owners from across the United States. Focus groups were held in New Mexico, Maine, North Carolina, Missouri, and California in the fall of 2010 and in Hawaii in the fall of 2011. Recruiters were asked to invite owners who represented a range of sizes of forest and woodland holdings in order to negate any effects of size of forest holdings on the testing. In each state, two focus groups were conducted at one location (one midday and one evening session), with 6 to 12 landowners participating in each session. Landowners were asked some general questions about their land and then asked to complete sections of the survey instrument. After each section was completed, a group discussion was facilitated to highlight anything that might have been misunderstood, and participants were probed for deeper meanings on their responses. Questions were examined for readability, word choice, and efficacy in eliciting responses, and adjustments were made as deemed appropriate. An example of the focus group topic guide is included in App. 3."}, {"section_title": "Survey Questions", "text": "The formats of the questions in the NWOS survey instrument include closed-ended, partially closed-ended, and open-ended (Dillman et al. 2009 ). Closed-ended questions provide respondents with defined sets of options from which to select responses and included rating questions where respondents were asked to rate concepts using a 5-point Likert scale (Likert 1967 ). Partially closed-ended questions include a defined list followed by an \"other\" option that allows respondents to specify additional responses. Open-ended questions allow the respondent to fill in a blank response area using their own words.\nQuestions were grouped into sections that solicited similar information and were placed in sequences that were intended to be logical extensions of previous sections and questions.

The question began by ascertaining the total acres of land owned. This was done to help owners differentiate between all land and forest/woodland. In addition, this information can be used to calculate what percentage of an ownership's holdings is forested/ wooded versus other land uses. The next parts of the question asked how many acres of forest and woodland were owned within the state. A lay definition of forest and woodland was provided on the survey instrument. Information about the number of parcels or discrete, unconnected units of forest and woodland was collected to better understand forest and woodland parcellation and consolidation patterns."}, {"section_title": "Forest and woodland as part of a primary or secondary residence (Questions 4 and 5)-Absentee", "text": "forest and woodland ownership and an ever-increasing wildland-urban interface are important issues affecting forest and woodland resources. It is useful to know if a person lives on the forest and woodland or is an absentee owner because the two groups may behave differently. Questions 4 and 5 asked respondents if their primary or secondary (vacation home or cabin) residences, respectively, were associated (i.e., within one mile) with their forest/ woodland. As more people buy parcels of forest and woodland and move into the woods, the land base for more traditional uses, such as timber harvesting, often diminishes (e.g., Wear et al. 1999 ). This phenomenon is also related to parcellation."}, {"section_title": "Forest and woodland as part of a farm or ranch (Question 6)-", "text": "In many parts of the country, forest and woodland is commonly owned in conjunction with a farm or ranch.

Adopting the U.S. Census of Agriculture definition, a farm or ranch was defined in the survey instrument as a place where, in most years, $1,000 or more was earned from the sale of crops (other than forest products) or animals (NASS 2014).

In some states, management plans are a prerequisite for participation in certain preferential property tax programs. Having a management plan often is used as an indicator in sustainability assessments and is generally a requirement for getting forest land green certified.

Through other sources, information is available on how much wood is removed and processed annually (e.g., Oswalt et al. 2014) . To provide contemporaneous information about harvesting behaviors of private forest and woodland ownerships, this question used a matrix format to ask what types of products (firewood, logs, chips, or unwanted trees) were harvested and why (personal use, sale, or other). If the respondent indicated that trees were harvested or removed, subparts of the question asked if they used a professional forester or a certified logger for any of the harvests.\nHarvesting of nontimber forest products (Question 13)-Nontimber forest products are gaining increasing attention as a potentially important source of income for forest and woodland owners and as a resource for society. To ascertain how many forest and woodland owners were harvesting these products, this question used a matrix to ask respondents what types, if any, of nontimber forest products have been collected from their lands and why these products were collected (personal use or sale). Regionally relevant examples of the four types of nontimber forest products (edibles, medicinals, decorative, and landscaping) were included (Table 3 ; Fig. 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Past activities (Question 14)", "text": "-Things owners do with their forest and woodland are suggestive of the types of goods and services they intend to produce from that land.

First, a prenotice postcard (App. 4) was sent alerting the potential respondents that a survey instrument would be arriving soon. The prenotice postcard briefly described the survey, outlining why it was important, why their help was needed, and what they may gain from participating. Three to five business days later, the potential respondents received a survey instrument (App. 1), prepaid business reply return envelope, and a cover letter (App. 4) that described in detail the purpose and importance of the survey. Seven to ten business days after the survey instrument was sent, a reminder/thank you postcard (App. 4) was mailed to thank those who responded and to encourage nonrespondents to reply. Finally, 12-15 days after the reminder/thank you postcard was mailed, a second survey instrument and cover letter (App. 4) with a prepaid business reply envelope were sent to ownerships that had not responded. All mail was sent first-class via the U.S. Postal Service.\nResponses to the mailings were monitored as they were returned. Tracking numbers displayed on the back of the survey instruments were used to track who responded and help ensure they were not unnecessarily contacted again. Approximately 7 percent of mailings were returned by the Post Office and marked as undeliverable due to a bad address or because the person had moved or was deceased. Bad addresses were corrected where possible or new addresses were obtained and materials were mailed again. In the case of deceased owners, the new owner was contacted if mailing information was available. Otherwise the correspondence was recorded as undeliverable. If a respondent did not own forest or woodland, they were asked to indicate this on the survey instrument and return it so their record could be updated.\nThe mail survey instrument was designed using special software (TeleForm [Verity Inc. 2010] ) to allow electronic data capture in order to increase data quality and data entry efficiency. Returned paper survey instruments (most of the responses) were scanned, and the software used optical character recognition (OCR) and optical mark recognition (OMR) technology to capture the data.

A minimum of two mail survey instruments per state per year were randomly selected, and all entries in the physical survey instruments were compared to the corresponding field values in the electronic files. For every error that was found, a correction was made to the electronic recording of that survey. If error patterns were detected, this information was passed on to data entry personnel, and data were reprocessed as necessary.\nError rates ranged from 0.13 percent to 0.29 percent across the 3 years (Table 5 ). There were two basic types of errors-errors in text coding and those in numerical coding. In 2011, 21.4 percent of the errors were text-based while 78.6 percent of the errors were numerical (Table 6 ). The QA analysis of the 2012 surveys indicated that text-based errors appeared to be more than simple, random errors. Specifically, many of the text errors seemed to derive from fingers being on the wrong keys, as opposed to simple misspellings. These errors were recorded as text errors. In addition, in several instances errors were detected in multipart questions where the correct coding was present but was not coded under the correct field name. These errors were as if one of the fields of the multipart question was missing resulting in the remainder of the data being skewed. These errors were recorded as numerical coding errors. In 2012, 13.6 percent of the errors were text-based, and 86.4 percent of the errors were numerical (Table 6 ). The QA analysis of the 2013 surveys had simple text and numerical coding errors similar to that of 2011. It should be noted, however, that in a few isolated instances, many text errors were recorded for surveys from respondents who wrote a lot of text on their survey.

All manipulations were made on these working files (i.e., the original, raw files were never manipulated). Apart from the review of the text entries, all data processing was done using scripts implemented in the R computing environment (R Development Core Team 2012).

Owners who responded multiple times were identified via the response tracking system, and only the earliest response was used and the other record(s) was dropped. Because the eastern and western portions of Oklahoma and Texas were processed separately, it was necessary to identify where ownerships were located in these states.

The validity of the sample point counts was assessed by comparing the expected number of sample points to the observed number of sample points from the sampling frame. Expected point counts were calculated by taking the number of acres of forest and woodland owned and dividing it by the sampling intensity for the state. For example, if a family forest and woodland ownership reported owning 100 acres of forest and woodland and the sampling intensity was 1 sample point per 10,000 acres of family forest and woodland, the expected sample point count is 100/10,000 = 0.001 or rounding up, no more than 1.\nWhen large discrepancies were observed, the record was examined to see if any corrections needed to be made. Observed point counts substantially lower than expected point counts were typically associated with a subsidiary not responding for all of the land owned by a parent company, as they were asked to do. In these instances, the point count for a record was adjusted to what would be expected based on the acreage reported and the sampling intensity for that state. Observed point counts that were substantially higher than the expected point counts were typically caused by surveys being received by the wrong ownership (e.g., errors in mailing addresses or postal delivery). Where this was determined to be the case, the records were dropped.\nIn the FIA database (FIADB) private land ownerships are classified using the following owner class code (OWNCD) values (Woudenberg et al. 2010 However, this information is sometimes missing or incorrect. In the NWOS database, a new variable (OWNER_CLASS_ADJ) was created. When assigning this variable, information including the name associated with the ownership, how the respondent identified their form of ownership in the survey, and the original FIA OWNCD classification were taken into account. There were 1,116 instances (9.8 percent of records) where the FIA OWNCD did not agree with the survey response, and the OWNER_CLASS_ADJ values were coded to be consistent with the survey responses and ownership information.\nForest Industry code (FORINDCD), an FIA field variable (condition-level) indicating whether or not a respondent owns a primary processing mill (Woudenberg et al. 2010) , was also checked during this process. If a respondent reported owning less than 1,000 acres of forest and woodland and the variable indicated they owned a mill, the record was investigated and adjusted if needed. If FORINDCD was blank and the respondent reported owning less than 1,000 acres of forest and woodland, the variable was coded as no mill owned.

For instance, in part A of a multi-part question, a respondent may be instructed to complete parts B and C if they answered \"yes\" to part A.

Here the approach taken to generate population-level estimates in terms of ownerships and forest and woodland area is discussed. Other analyses may rely on different summary statistics, such as means, or use modeling approaches, such as logistic regression. Dickinson et al. (2016) discuss some additional approaches and provide the theoretical justification for the estimators. It is important that all analyses take into account the sampling design (as described above) in order to make valid inferences to the population of interest, e.g., family forest and woodland ownerships.\nDifferences exist in the estimation procedures used for the 2011-2013 NWOS (described here and in Dickinson et al. 2016 and Butler 2013) , those used for the 2002-2006 NWOS (described in Butler et al. 2005) , and earlier iterations of FIA ownership surveys. The \"dual-sampling\" paradigm implicit in the earlier iterations of the NWOS (Birch 1996 , Birch et al. 1982 , Kingsley and Finley 1975 ) assumes a whole acre of forest or woodland is sampled at each point and an ownership is sampled at each point. This is not theoretically correct as the primary sampling units are zero-dimensional points (Bechtold and Patterson 2005) . The only attributes recorded by FIA field crews that are used for the NWOS are the land use, ownership class, and for private forest and woodland points, name and address of the owner. With the exception of forest and woodland area estimates, all other attributes used in NWOS analyses are obtained from the survey, which applies not only to the forest and woodland where the point is, but to all forest and woodland in the state associated with the ownership. The dual-sampling paradigm, though theoretically inaccurate, does not lead to invalid point estimators because the probability proportional to size point estimators simplify to simple random sample estimators when per-acre estimates are calculated (Dickinson and Butler 2013) . The bigger problem lies in variance estimation. Issues with the previous NWOS estimators are discussed in more detail in Dickinson and Butler (2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Population Estimates", "text": "The unit of analysis for NWOS estimation depends on the needs of the data user. If the data user is more interested in land or trees than in ownerships, area-based summaries and analyses are likely more useful. Where the focus is on the people who own the trees, ownership-based summaries and analyses are likely more useful. And in many circumstances, both should be examined. Presented here are the ownership-and area-based total estimators and their associated variance estimators for categorical variables, the dominant NWOS variable type.\nProcedures for combining estimates across strata, as well as for estimating means, quantiles, and proportions for both categorical and continuous variables, are described in Dickinson et al.

This error is notoriously difficult to detect, and if found, it is difficult to rectify (Groves et al. 2002) . In addition to assessing nonresponse bias, efforts were made to maximize response rates by using the four contact method (see Data Collection section) advocated by Dillman et al. (2009) .\nUnit or survey nonresponse occurs when a person asked to respond to a survey does not respond. The degree to which this causes a bias in the results depends on whether the characteristics of the respondents are substantially different than those of the nonrespondents. The first approach for minimizing this error is to maximize cooperation rates. To minimize nondeliverable errors, names and addresses for the NWOS were standardized, and current mailing addresses were obtained using the U.S. Postal Service's Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) and FASTforward systems. Overall, the rate of undeliverable addresses was 8 percent.\nThe overall cooperation rate for the 2011-2013 NWOS was 52 percent. Note that cooperation rates differ from response rates in that undeliverables are negated from the denominator of the cooperation rate calculation (AAPOR 2015) , and many studies use the term \"response rate\" when they really mean cooperation rate. Across the states included in the estimation, the cooperation rates for family forest and woodland ownerships ranged from a low of 37 percent in Hawaii to a high of 64 percent in Michigan (Fig. 7) . Some regional differences occurred, with response rates generally higher in the North and lower in the South. Service, National Woodland Owner Survey, by state . The cooperation rate for Hawaii was 37 percent. In Alaska there were fewer than 10 respondents with forest or woodland. *Estimates were not calculated for states with fewer than 10 respondents. +60% 50\u221259% 40\u221249% <40% Fewer than 10 respondents* Nonresponse bias assessment and mitigation is notoriously difficult and fraught with problems as all methods of mitigation rely upon untestable assumptions (Sarndal et al. 1992) . Methods for mitigating unit nonresponse usually consist of weighting the respondents' values in some way, but choosing the weights can be very difficult (Groves et al. 2002 , Lohr 1999 , Sarndal et al. 1992 .\nIdeally, a model of unit nonresponse could be developed and used to compensate for any detectable nonresponse bias using ancillary data or the results from the NWOS telephone survey data. Unfortunately, resources were not available to conduct a thorough investigation of nonresponse bias and viable methods for dealing with it. Therefore, the estimators presented assume no nonresponse bias.\nWhile a strict nonresponse bias assessment was not possible, a qualitative assessment could be conducted. A strict assessment would evaluate how the nonresponse influenced estimates of key population parameters. Instead, comparisons were made between mail and phone respondents. The variables examined were area of forest and woodland owned in a state (AC_WOOD), land tenure (TENURE = QUEST_YEAR -ACQ_YEAR), having commercially harvested trees in the previous 5 years (ACT_CUT_SALE), having a written forest management plan, (MAN_PLAN), having received forest management advice in the previous 5 years (ADVICE), and having received cost-share assistance (COST). Demographic variables, such as age, could not be tested as they were not asked on the phone version of the survey. Family forest and woodland ownerships with 10+ acres are a primary focus of many NWOS analyses and reports (e.g., , so the nonresponse bias assessment focused on this population and domain of interest. For continuous variables, graphical comparisons were made using box plots, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (Conover 1971) and Wilcoxon rank sum (Hollander and Wolfe 1973) tests were used to test for statistically significant differences. For categorical variables, graphical comparisons were made using bar plots, and X 2 tests (Agresti 2007) were used to test for statistically significant differences. All analyses were conducted in the R computing environment (R Development Core Team 2012).\nFour of the six variables tested, AC_WOOD (Fig. 8) , TENURE (Fig. 9) , ACT_CUT_SALE ( Fig. 10) , and COST (Fig. 11) , showed no statistically significant differences (p \u2265 0.05) between (Fig. 12) and ADVICE ( Fig. 13) , did show significant differences (p < 0.05). In both cases, the percentages were higher for the mail respondents. There appears to be a higher propensity for those who have a written management plan or have received forest management advice to complete an NWOS survey. This is logical (i.e., they are more attuned to the forestry community) and suggests there may be an upward bias in the estimates of these variables. With no means for fully testing nonresponse bias, mixed results (mostly supporting no bias) from the qualitative analysis, and no means for correcting bias, no corrections were made to the data, but these findings should be considered when interpreting the results.\nThe second type of nonresponse manifests in surveys that are returned but contain missing values for one or more questions. This is called item nonresponse. Item nonresponse rates for the 2011-2013 NWOS family forest and woodland ownerships with 10+ acres varied from 0 to 60 percent with a median rate of 5 percent (Table 10 ). The \"other\" options were excluded from this analysis because most respondents viewed those as optional if the question did not apply to them.\nQuestions that asked about why a respondent did or did not do something and questions that had complex formats (e.g., multiple skips or a matrix format) tended to have the greatest item nonresponse rates. Questions with high item nonresponse rates, such as demographics for the second owner, the number of children or other family members who are likely to receive the land, reasons for not having a management plan, and having ever cut or removed trees for personal use, should be interpreted with caution. The content and formatting of these questions with high item nonresponse rates will be reconsidered for future iterations of the NWOS.\nMethods for mitigating item nonresponse usually involve imputation techniques (Groves et al. 2002) , but many studies take a na\u00efve approach and assume that those who responded are representative of those who did not respond. Currently, the na\u00efve approach to item nonresponse is the only feasible option for the NWOS. This approach potentially biases the NWOS estimates, but to what degree is unknown, as testing for item nonresponse bias is beyond the resources of NWOS at this time.

"}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS AND PRODUCTS", "text": "Although states are the basic strata, it is possible to make estimates for other geographies. Scaling-up to multi-state regions is simply a matter of summarizing the statistics over the broader areas. For geographic areas that do not conform to state boundaries, estimates are possible, but there are important caveats. For example, if substate level estimates are desired, the location of the sample points can be used to identify respondents in the geographic area.\nAlthough it is known a respondent has acreage in the area of interest, it is not possible to determine if the respondent only owns forest and woodland in the specified area of interest. The area-based estimates will not be biased, but estimates of number of ownerships could be biased. A sufficient sample size is required in any substate geographic area to ensure confidentiality of the respondent and that the statistics are reliable. Ideally, each geography of interest would have at least 100 respondents.\nIn analyzing NWOS data, the difference between all forest and woodland holdings in a state and specific forested/woodland parcels may be important to some analyses. If the ownership has only one parcel, then this point is moot. Keeping with the precedent set by previous iterations, the 2011-2013 NWOS asked respondents to respond for all forest and woodland holdings in a state that are part of their ownership, not a specific parcel. While it is possible to ask them to respond to a specific parcel (e.g., their largest or newest parcel), it is not logistically possible to convey to them exactly where the point(s) lie. Asking them to respond only to a specific parcel that is not associated with the sample point would create a sampling bias. The problem with not associating the responses with a specific parcel is that it is uncertain if the behaviors and characteristics (e.g., written management plan and timber harvesting) overlap. Interpretation of results must therefore account for this difference, or analyses can be limited to ownerships with single parcels. This latter approach assumes that all behaviors and characteristics are consistent across a parcel, an equally uncertain assumption. Analyses (e.g., Kilgore et al. 2015) have shown no significant differences between ownerships with single versus multiple parcels, but this should nonetheless be considered by those using the NWOS data for modeling purposes.\nA standard approach should be taken when conducting special analyses using the NWOS data. This begins with univariate analyses then progresses to bivariate analyses, and finally, if appropriate, multivariate analyses. The univariate analyses look at each variable independently and are useful for examining the basic distributions and determining if transformations or recoding are necessary. The bivariate analyses look at relationships between key pairs of variables and are useful for building and interpreting multivariate analyses. The multivariate analyses allow for examination of higher-level relationships, but building these models is more complicated and interpretation of the results is more complex. In each step, it is imperative to recognize the data types (e.g., categorical or continuous) and use approaches that are appropriate for each type (e.g., X 2 analyses for comparisons between pairs of categorical variables). Other important issues to consider are:\n\u2022 What is the domain of interest?\n\u2022 How should the data be weighted to incorporate the sampling design?\n\u2022 How should missing data (e.g., -3, -2, and -1 values) be handled?\n\u2022 In calculating percentages, how should item nonresponse be handled?\n\u2022 How should skip patterns be handled?\n\u2022 How do potential sources of error (e.g., nonresponse) influence interpretation of results?\n\u2022 What are the proper statistical models given the questions of interest and the underlying data?\nThe results from the NWOS will be shared through multiple outlets. This report documents the methods used to design, implement, and generate estimates from the 2011-2013 NWOS. Tables and two-page summaries of the results will be available through subsequent publications, which can be accessed at the NWOS website (www.fia.fs.fed.us/nwos). The tables will summarize each of the questions asked on the survey and will provide populationlevel estimates of ownerships and area by state, region, and for the nation. The initial tables will focus on family forest and woodland ownerships with 10+ acres of forest and woodland holdings. Subsequent summaries will examine other ownership types and ownerships with forest and woodland holdings of less than 10 acres. Customization of the domains of interest and cross-tabulations will be available via the NWOS Online Table Maker program (http:// apps.fs.fed.us/fia/nwos/tablemaker.jsp). General and scientific reports will be published using the latest NWOS results, and the first publication will document the general findings. Subsequent publications will focus on specific topics. Publications will be made available through a variety of outlets ranging from peer-reviewed journals aimed at scientific audiences to brochures aimed at more general audiences. In addition, presentations will be made at scientific and other meetings to further share the results. On a limited and highly controlled basis, the raw survey results (with no personally identifiable information appended) can be made available to researchers. Individuals interested in this access should contact the lead author of this report or another member of the NWOS staff.\nIt is the intent of FIA to implement the NWOS on a continual basis, and planning for the next iteration of the NWOS has begun. Monitoring trends in the attitudes and behaviors of America's private forest and woodland ownerships will continue, with hopes of increasing sample sizes in those states where the targets were not met, including U.S. territories and protectorates. NWOS will work with interested parties to further increase the sampling intensities in selected areas and address state-specific issues."}, {"section_title": "GLOSSARY", "text": "area-based-analyses where the units of analysis are area of forest and woodland, reported in terms of acres.
