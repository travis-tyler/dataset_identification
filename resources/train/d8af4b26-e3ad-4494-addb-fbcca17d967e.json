[4] [5] [6] [7] Nevertheless, the findings reported so far are not consistent, and some studies have failed to demonstrate these relationships.\nMany studies have dealt with the association between BPH and metabolic syndrome (MetS). This connection may result from the fact that changes in hormone levels and metabolic disorders predispose to BPH. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] At the same time, there are a few publications that have compared sex hormone levels in serum and prostate tissue between men with BPH and those without it 16, 17 and there have been no studies comparing sex hormone levels in serum and prostate tissue homogenate in BPH patients in regard to concomitant MetS. Comparative studies of sex hormone levels in serum and prostate tissue have provided divergent results. 17, 18 In analyzing the potential contributors to BPH, it seems important to take into account the connection between the levels of selected sex hormones (determined in both serum and prostate tissue) and MetS. The lack of systematized knowledge of these issues can lead to a false assessment of the patient's clinical status. These discrepancies in the data most probably arise from different methods of sampling and analysis. 17, 18 It is thus reasonable to determine the levels of hormones involved in the etiopathology of BPH in serum and prostate tissue.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between changes in the levels of selected hormones in serum and prostate tissue homogenate in regard to metabolic disorders in patients with diagnosed, surgically treated BPH."}, {"section_title": "Patients and methods Patients", "text": "The study involved a group of 154 men with a diagnosis of BPH, aged 52-75 years (average: 66.96), who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate.

The data suggest significant differences in all tested parameters between serum and prostate tissue homogenates. Table 2 shows the results of a comparison between selected hormone levels in serum and prostate tissue in patients with and without MetS. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum SHBG levels ( p = 0.015), but not in the prostate tissue SHBG levels ( p = 0.106). A similar relationship was observed in regard to IGF-1, the serum levels of which were significantly higher in patients with MetS ( p = 0.017). Table 3 shows the results for the ratio of selected hormone levels in serum and prostate tissue of BPH patients with and without MetS.

What has been observed during the process of men's aging is a physiological decline in the level of testosterone, resulting from the decreased synthesis of androgen hormones. 5, 21 This can lead to many clinical symptoms, such as a loss of libido, reduced muscle strength and muscle mass, decreased bone mineralization, and decreased testicular volume. 21 Nonetheless, the role of the decline in testosterone levels, which is found in BPH alongside metabolic disorders, is open to debate. Testosterone and the product of its enzymatic conversion -dihydrotestosterone (DHT) -are known to take part in the growth and proliferation of prostate cells. 22, 23 In our study, the levels of all the parameters in BPH patients differed significantly between the prostate tissue and serum. The literature lacks accurate data on testosterone and DHT levels in prostate tissue homogenates, in part due to differing methods of collecting material for chemical analysis. At present, DHT levels in prostate tissue are believed to be independent of BPH. At the same time, there are no adequate data on testosterone levels in prostate tissue. 18, 24, 25 Results regarding particular hormone levels can slightly differ depending on the prostate tissue sampling method.\nTissues obtained via transurethral resection of the prostate may undergo electrothermal damage. Tissues obtained by biopsy can only be preserved for a short time. This method, however, enables accurate collection of the material from particular areas of the prostate. Tissues taken during open surgery or autopsy are dehydrated and degenerated. 18 Pej\u010di\u0107 et al 17 reported median TT and DHT levels that were akin to those in our analysis and the literature data. However, these results cannot be objectively compared owing to the differing ways of collecting research material The researchers demonstrated that both TT and DHT accumulated in hyperplastic prostate tissue, but that DHT levels were visibly higher. One additionally analyzed parameter in that study was prostate volume. The authors noted that the mean DHT-to-TT ratio in larger prostates was considerably higher than in smaller ones.\nIn our study, TT and DHEAS levels in prostate tissue homogenates were analyzed in patients both with and without MetS, but no statistically significant differences were revealed.\nA similar investigation was conducted by Parsons 26 as a part of a large cohort study, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Parsons et al developed a model on the basis of which they found that a 1 kg/m 2 increase in BMI was accompanied by an increase in prostate volume of 0.41 mL. They also observed that patients with BMI $35 kg/m 2 , who 27 performed a meta-analysis of 5,403 patients with prostatic hyperplasia from different countries. The subjects were again divided into a group with and a group without MetS, and the men with MetS proved to have notably greater prostate volumes. Of the parameters diagnosed in the etiology of MetS, only waist size and HDL levels were significantly predictive of BPH risk.\nIn our study, FPG levels correlated with the levels of LH and TT. This relationship was, however, only observed in serum. Furthermore, only serum insulin levels correlated positively with age, BMI, waist size, and FPG levels. Serum LH levels correlated with patients' age and FPG. Statistically significant differences were also noted in serum SHBG levels, depending on the presence of MetS. This association was not observed in the levels of this parameter in the prostate tissue homogenate.\nComparison of the ratios of the hormones and protein levels in serum to their levels in the prostate tissue between patients with and without MetS revealed that men with MetS had statistically significant lower SHBG ratios. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that serum SHBG levels weakly correlated with waist size and TG levels. There was no such relationship for prostate tissue. Correlations between the level of TT and the levels of SHBG and FT were observed in prostate tissue.\nLee et al 28 suggested that the level of testosterone may be loosely related not only to enlargement of the prostate, but also to the occurrence of LUTS and erectile dysfunction. In a study 8 of over 2,000 men aged 40-59 years, BPH symptoms did not correlate with serum TT levels. A similar observation was made by Yassin et al, 29 who found that men with MetS often had lower TT levels, which did not directly contribute to LUTS. These authors also claimed that hyperreactivity of the autonomic nervous system played an important part in the pathogenesis of LUTS, which may have been caused by disturbed TT levels. Kim et al also examined the correlations between the levels of testosterone, insulin, glucose, weight, and prostate volume in BPH patients subjected to transurethral resection of the prostate. 30 They informed that only the TT and insulin levels exerted no significant effects on prostate volume. A new look at these issues was provided by a study on the impact of testosterone supplementation on BPH treatment. 31, 32 Antunes et al 33 carried out comparative research of the relationships between weight and TT levels in patients with LUTS. They asserted that, in a group of 725 obese men (mean age 65 years, BMI $25 kg/m 2 ), age and TT levels were LUTS-related factors. Nevertheless, these authors did not find any associations between the parameters they tested and the levels of FT and SHBG. A similar analysis was performed by Kaplan et al, 23 who noted a connection between obesity and low testosterone levels in men with BPH.\nThe role of estrogens in the regulation of the male reproductive system is quite well understood. 34, 35 In men, estrogens mainly arise through the process of peripheral aromatization of testosterone. 34 With age, serum E2 levels either remain the same or rise, thus leading to an increase in the E2-to-TT ratio. 35 In our study, patients with MetS had significantly lower ratios of serum to tissue E2 levels ( p = 0.069). In the analysis of B\u00e9langer et al, 35 E2 levels correlated with age in BPH patients with MetS, but not in those without it. Research on an animal model 36 confirmed that changes in the E2-to-TT ratio contribute to gradual prostatic enlargement and urination disorders in rats. This study, however, did not support the hypothesis that changes in the ratio of these hormone levels were associated with LUTS and urinary obstruction. Sex hormone levels in a large group of aging men with a diagnosis of BPH were investigated by Tan et al, 37 who reported that patients with prostatic hyperplasia had higher E2 levels than their counterparts without this condition.\nIGF-1 is a mitogenic hormone synthesized mostly in the liver and locally in various types of tissues. There is a hypothesis that IGF-1, which is similar to insulin in structure, can bind to the same receptors and activate pathways involved in the growth and proliferation of prostate cells. Disturbed regulation of this factor and its overexpression may be a part of the etiology of both benign and malignant tissue hyperplasia. 38 Ryl et al 39 demonstrated that the level of IGF-1 in BPH patients without MetS correlated with the parameters of a lipid profile. They also found that the coexistence of MetS and BPH disturbed this correlation. The in vitro analysis of Siejka et al 40 revealed that pharmacological inhibition of growth factor production can suppress proliferation of human BPH cells. Hyperinsulinemia stimulates the liver to produce increased amounts of IGF-1, which binds to insulin receptors, thus causing prostatic hyperplasia. 41 What is more, it was demonstrated that stress-activated kinases in prostate stromal fibroblasts induce IGF-1 secretion, which stimulates prostate epithelial cell division through the activation of particular target genes. 42 In our study, patients with MetS had significantly higher serum IGF-1 levels. The same relationship was not confirmed in their prostate tissue. However, what should be emphasized in the pathomechanism of BPH is its multifactor etiology, and especially complex hormonal regulation. The study that deserves particular attention is that 43, 44 who found that prostatic tissue is not directly affected by serum hormone levels, but instead gets a much higher level of testosterone straight from the testes before it is diluted by the overall circulation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our study focused on the levels of certain hormones in serum and prostate tissue in BPH patients additionally diagnosed with MetS. The occurrence of MetS in BPH patients was associated with changes in the levels of hormones and proteins (IGF-1 and SHBG). These changes, however, were not always equivalent to changes in the levels of these parameters in prostate tissue. It should also be mentioned that MetS in BPH patients had an influence on a quantitative balance between the levels of SHBG in serum and prostate tissue. Our results indicate the necessity for further research on the contribution of MetS to the development and clinical picture of BPH."}]
