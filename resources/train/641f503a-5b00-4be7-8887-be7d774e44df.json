Various initiatives are underway to exploit land-based GPS PW measurements to improve weather forecasting [Wolfe and Gutman, 2000;Ware et al., 2000] and to study climate [Foster et al., 2000]. In addition, land-based GPS estimates of zenith wet path delay can calibrate space-based microwave radiometers by extrapolating the land-values 30-Estimating GPS-derived PW from floating platforms is complicated by the dynamics induced by wave and tidal action. GPS positioning of floating platforms has been used to measure wave and tidal variation with centimeter-level resolution to calibrate satellite altimeters [Born et al., 1994] and to locate a surface hydrophone that acoustically ranges to seafloor geodetic markers to measure seafloor crustal motion [Spiess et al., 1998]. Buoys used for altimeter calibration are usually within 20 km of a fixed reference site and no differential tropospheric is estimated. Buoys/ships supporting seafloor geodesy are typically from 150 to 500 km from shore and require the estimation of an independent tropospheric path delay at the buoy. Spiess et al. [1998] demonstrated centimeter-level positioning of a surface platform 150 km from shore which suggested that PW could be recovered from floating platforms  "}, {"section_title": "Cardellach et al.

At each station the antenna phase centers were modeled using IGS values, data below 15 degree elevation angle were not included [Fang et al., 1998] and ocean loading effects were modeled [Dach and Dietrich, 2000]. The GPS data were processed in a network mode with clock and phase biases estimated as white noise parameters, i.e., the equivalent of double-differenced phase processing. Ambiguity fixing was implemented with nearly 100% success over the short 8-km baseline between shore and the buoy [Blewitt, 1989]. Estimated values of zenith wet path delay were added back to the constant hydrostatic path delay to form the total zenith path delay. The recorded values of surface pressure and temperature were used to recalculate the hydrostatic path delay and wet path delay which was converted to an absolute estimate of PW [Bevis et al., 1994;Duan et al., 1996]."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The quality of the GPS data and the validity of the processing approach were examined by estimating GPS-PW at shore station SVER and comparing the estimates to radiosonde-derived values (Figure 2A). The GPS-PW and 22 radiosonde-derived values have an rms agreement of +1.2 mm and a bias of -0.03 mm ( Figure 3A, Table 2). The rms agreement is representative of what is routinely achieved using land-based static GPS stations and validates the approach used. Typically, GPS slightly underestimates the PW compared to radiosondes [Duan et al., 1996]. The lack of any significant bias term may reflect the small statistical sample, the fact that the air is relatively low in PW [Ohtani, 2000] or that we use stations more than 2000 km distant to decorrelate the PW estimate [Tregoning et al., 1998]. To examine the quality of GPS-PW estimates recovered at the buoy, its derived estimates are also compared to the radiosonde values ( Figure 2B,3B). Due to occasional telemetry problems there are some gaps in the time series of the GPS-PW buoy estimates. The comparison ( Figure 3B) between 20 radiosondes and buoy estimates show an overall agreement of 4-1.5 mm with a bias of-0.29 mm (Table 2). The buoy GPS-PW estimates have larger variability than GPS-PW at SVER due primarily to the less-well determined kinematic position as reflected in the wet delay estimate formal error which is about 15-20% greater than for shore sta-tion SVER. Also, the radiosondes are launched within a few hundred meters of SVER while the buoy is 8 km away across the land/water interface. Nevertheless, GPS-PW estimation from a buoy is demonstrated with a resolution comparable to that of static, land-based GPS values. To access temporal resolution, 30-minute-averages of buoy GPS-PW were compared to 30-minute-averages of SVER GPS-PW ( Figure 3C). With 384 comparisons, the overall agreement is 4-1.9 mm with a bias of-0.27 (Table 2). Though the bias term is similar to that derived from the radiosonde comparison, the rms difference is larger which may reflect the use of a larger population size for the comparison. Clearly, a temporal resolution of 30 minutes is demonstrated for GPS-PW from a floating platform, though with higher uncertainty than with a land-GPS receiver. As another indicator of the overall capability of the approach, we compare 157 hourly NOAA tide gauge values with hourly-averages of the GPS-estimated vertical position of the buoy showing an rms agreement of 4-24 mm (Figure 4), which is equivalent to about 4 mm of PW. This resolution over 11 days is comparable to that achieved by   previous investigators over time spans of a few hours [Born et al., 1994]. Some of the discrepancy may arise because the vertical offset from the buoy antenna to the sea-surface was assumed constant, though the buoy likely lists as it rotates in response to changes in wind direction. However, as was known prior to the experiment, this does not effect the comparison of buoy GPS-PW to radiosonde values."}, {"section_title": "[ \u00df GPS-MEASURED TIDE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We demonstrate that PW can be estimated directly using GPS tracking of an ocean surface platform 8 km from shore with 1-2 mm accuracy every 30 minutes.
