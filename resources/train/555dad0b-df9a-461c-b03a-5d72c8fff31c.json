Emergency medical service (EMS) response time, defined as time elapsed between EMS notification and arrival on scene, is a system-level factor with potential to influence survival. Emergency medical services provide the critical link between injury and definitive care. 6 Early arrival of EMS at the crash scene allows for stabilization of occupants with lifethreatening injuries, timely triage, and transport to hospital. 6, 7 Conversely, delays could lead to a greater risk of death. We postulated that a relationship exists between regional EMS response capabilities and crash mortality and that reducing the time to first medical contact in the field might decrease deaths due to road traffic injuries at the system level. Therefore, we measured the association between EMS response times and MVC mortality at the population level across US counties and estimated the number of fatalities that might be prevented if response times were shortened."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "This study was a population-based analysis of MVC-related deaths within US counties from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015.

Univariable analyses compared county characteristics across quartiles of county response time. The Wilcoxon rank sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in analysis of continuous variables, and frequencies were compared using the \u03c7 2 test.\nA hierarchical negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the risk-adjusted association between county response time and MVC mortality. This model was a generalized linear mixed model with random effects to account for clustering of counties within states.\nTo estimate the proportion of MVC-related deaths associated with prolonged EMS response times, we used the population attributable fraction. [35] [36] [37] The population attributable fraction is defined as the fraction of all cases (in this case, MVC fatalities) in a population that is attributable to a specific exposure (in this case, prolonged response times), assuming a causal relationship. This was estimated using adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) from the hierarchical model using the formula described by Rockhill et al 37 and\nMiettinen 38 : population attributable fraction = P c ( 1\u22121 / MRR) \u00d7 100%, where P c is the proportion of MVC fatalities that occurred in counties with prolonged response times (prevalence of the exposure among cases). In this study, the population attributable fraction can be interpreted as the estimated fraction of all MVC fatalities that might have been prevented if all counties achieved response times below the defined threshold.\nOwing to geographic and resource constraints, it is unlikely that rural counties would be able to achieve EMS response times comparable to those of urban counties. Therefore, we performed a stratified analysis grouping counties into rural/wilderness and urban/suburban counties using ruralurban continuum codes. The median county response time was calculated separately for rural/wilderness and urban/ suburban counties to define the prolonged response time threshold appropriate to each context. The population attrib-utable fraction was then estimated for rural/wilderness and urban/suburban counties using these benchmarks.\nGeospatial analyses deriving variables for proximity of trauma centers and helicopter EMS to county populations were performed using Esri ArcMap GIS software, version 10.5 (Esri). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Counties included were from 49 US states (including the District of Columbia) and accounted for an estimated 239 464 121 persons (75% of the total US population). Densely populated urban areas with greater access to trauma center care were overrepresented among the counties analyzed (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Table 1 compares the characteristics of counties across quartiles of county response time. The median county response time was 9 minutes (IQR, 7-11 minutes). Counties with longer response times were more often rural, had longer on-scene and transport times, had less access to level I or II trauma centers, and had lower helicopter EMS availability. Conversely, counties with shorter response times were associated with greater presence of protective state traffic safety laws.\nThe MVC mortality rate was significantly higher in counties with longer response times. In counties with response times of 12 minutes or greater, the mortality rate was 11.9 per 100 000 person-years; counties with response times of less than 7 minutes had a mortality rate of 4.9 per 100 000 person-years (unadjusted MRR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.72-2.22). A near-linear association was observed between county response time and MVC mortality rate (Figure 2 ). Table 2 shows the results of our hierarchical negative binomial model for county MVC mortality. After adjusting for potential confounders, longer county response times were associated with higher rates of MVC-related death (county response time, \u226512 vs <7 minutes; MRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.32-1.61). Crash mortality was highest among males aged 15 to 34 years and in rural counties with low population density. The presence of a level I or II trauma center within a county was associated with lower mortality (MRR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59-0.72), whereas higher maximum speed limits on rural highways and interstates were associated with greater mortality.

This finding was consistent in both rural/wilderness and urban/suburban settings, where a significant proportion of crash fatalities (9.9% and 14.1%, respectively) were associated with prolonged county response times. These data have important implications for trauma system design and health policy because they suggest that efforts to address regional disparities in MVC mortality should evaluate EMS response times as a potential contributor. That ensuring short EMS response times could save lives seems intuitive. Severe trauma is a time-dependent condition. Prompt arrival of first responders at the scene of a crash provides the greatest opportunity for early stabilization of occupants with life-threatening injuries, timely triage, and mobilization of the broader trauma system to achieve disposition to definitive trauma care. 7 Conversely, delays may confer a greater risk of death among those in need of urgent medical attention. Thus, regional systems in which delays are more common would exhibit higher rates of crash mortality after accounting for other regional differences.\nIt is important to place the results of this study in context with the current debate surrounding use of response time as an EMS performance measure. To date, there has been scarce evidence that response times influence trauma-related mortality. 39 Studies that previously examined response time intervals were hindered by a lack of risk adjustment 40,41 or were not designed to make system-level recommendations. 42 Furthermore, a greater emphasis on speed has the potential to put the safety of first responders at risk. 7 For these reasons, opinion has moved away from the use of response time standards as performance indicators. The present study adds to this discussion by showing, for the first time to our knowledge, that EMS response times may be associated with outcomes at the regional traumasystem level. These findings do not necessarily imply that EMS should simply drive faster, but rather that trauma systems should be organized to achieve a quick response to MVCs. Approaches to shortening response time intervals include ensuring adequate numbers 43 and optimizing the distribution of first-responding units in a dynamic and predictive fashion. 44 In regions where geographic and resource constraints are especially limiting, improvements to on-board telematics systems that predict the risk of severe injury may serve to better triage deployment. 45 Although these approaches can be costly, our results suggest that such strategies may yield a public health benefit, particularly where delays in EMS response are common. Studies of cost-effectiveness are required in this area. On-scene and transport times were not significantly associated with crash mortality. This observation is notable because counties with longer EMS response times also had longer on-scene and transport times, reflecting differences in crash characteristics, EMS practices, and greater travel distances in rural areas. The finding that only EMS response times were significantly associated with mortality after accounting for other regional differences suggests that early medical contact with prehospital personnel is uniquely important to MVC occupant survival at the trauma-system level. Further research is needed to clarify what additional EMS structures and processes of care, such as the level of first-responding unit, provider training, or prehospital interventions, might contribute to the observed mortality benefit of early EMS arrival.\nGreater access to trauma center care was associated with lower MVC mortality. Counties with level I or II trauma centers had crash mortality rates 35% lower than those with no nearby trauma center, providing further evidence that trauma centers are associated with reduced risk of injury-related death.\n17,46 Conversely, state laws allowing higher speed limits were associated with greater mortality, reaffirming the dominant role of speed in the epidemiology of fatal road traffic crashes."}, {"section_title": "26,27", "text": "Contrary to previous reports, 4,28-31 primary enforcement of seat belt and administrative license revocation laws were not significantly associated with MVC mortality. These findings likely reflect the updated era in which the data were derived. During 2013 through 2015, seat belt use in the United States surpassed 86% 47 and all states had enforced the blood alcohol content limit of 0.08%. 33 Therefore, although seat belt and alcohol-impaired driving laws prevent traffic deaths, the measurable effect is likely diminished compared with previous periods."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study has several important limitations. First, there is potential for residual confounding due to regional differences in road traffic crash characteristics. Crash characteristics might confound the relationship between EMS response time and mortality if vehicle occupants in counties with longer response times are more likely to experience forces leading to greater injury severity. As a consequence, a greater proportion of on-scene deaths (including those not modifiable by post-crash interventions) would be observed in regions with longer response times. However, we accounted for several variables that are correlated with crash characteristics, including measures of rurality, 48 on-scene time (prolonged with extrication), 49 and traffic safety laws (particularly those related to speed). Confounding attributable to other processes of care, such as EMS notification, the quality of medical care delivered, and patterns of interfacility transfer, was also mitigated through adjustment for rurality and regional differences in access to trauma resources (trauma centers and helicopter EMS). Second, the 2268 of 3144 US counties included in our analyses were overrepresentative of densely populated urban areas with greater access to trauma center care. However, that a substantial majority of US counties (and population) were included, representing the full spectrum of rurality and resources, is a compensating strength of the study. Third, it is difficult to confirm the completeness of the EMS activations collected by NEMSIS. However, NEMSIS captured an average of 26 million EMS activations annually during the study period (74% of an estimated 35 million nationally 50 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the data from which our exposure variable was derived were comprehensive for the 72% of US counties included. Finally, the exposure variable itself (median EMS response time) was an ecologic measure of regional EMS response capabilities. Therefore, caution should be taken in making inferences at the individual level from our results (ecologic fallacy). 51 However, individual-level effects were not a concern within the stated objectives of the study, which were to ascertain county-level effects relevant to trauma system design and broader health policy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Among 2268 US counties, longer EMS response times were associated with higher rates of MVC mortality.
