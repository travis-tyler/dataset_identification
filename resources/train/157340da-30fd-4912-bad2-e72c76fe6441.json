Totally 31.2 % TCs have underwent at least one RI processes (RI TCs) and 341 made landfalls after RI from 946 historical TCs, using the definition of 95 th percentile from the accumulative probability distribution of over-water 24-h TC intensity change. The frequent-occurrence region of RI is found in sea areas to the east of Philippines, and the mean genesis and on-set locations of landfalling TCs underwent RI had westward components compared with the ones did not made landfalls. The Philippine coast, the southern Chinese coast and the coast along the southern Japan are the three main 15 regions affected by the landfalling RI TCs. The coasts in the latter two regions have increased trend of cyclone energy since 1986, which possibly correlates with the poleward migration of the mean latitude where TCs reach their lifetime maximum intensities (LMI). The frequency of the landfalling RI TCs have a significant upward trend with insignificant increase in their LMI, while both the LMI and landfalling cyclone energy by TCs that didn't undergo RI in the western North Pacific show downward trends in the period during 1986-2017. The changes of the LMI distribution in the western North Pacific are 20 related tightly with these two types of TCs with different intensification rates: strong TCs are found become stronger mainly due to more active RI processes, while weak TCs have weakened in majority of moderate intensity TCs, which didn't experience RI processes."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Tropical cyclones are one of the most devastating natural hazards, their activity of landfalls and associated landfalling 25 intensities (or energy) are highly related to coastal damages and have profound social and economic impacts around the world.

Due to the fact of the observed sea level rise and land subsidence, as well as the booming population and economy in coastal regions, the TCs approaching shore and making landfalls tend to pose more threat to coasts with increasing exposure. Although several studies proved that social factors (e.g., increase in population and wealth) has played a major role in coastal damages prone to landfalling TCs (Klotzbach et al., 2018; Weinkle et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2009) , the changes in storminess (i.e., the 35 frequency and intensity) from historical records and the trend detection and attribution of TC activities under future climate change, are of great concern by previous research (Elsner et al., 2008; Emanuel, 2005; Knutson et al., 2010; Mei and Xie, 2016; Webster et al., 2005) and are still crucial for further vulnerability assessment, preparation and mitigation of coastal regions. However, for the western North Pacific basin, where on average more than one-third of global TCs were generated and has extensive TC activities (Mei et al., 2015) , the trend of TC landfalls and the cyclone energy accumulated by TCs with 40 different intensification rates are not fully examined.\nThe locations where TCs make landfalls are largely dependent on their tracks (Zhou et al., 2018) , which can be classified into three prevailing directions over the western North Pacific: westward-moving, recurving-land, and recurving-ocean (Colbert et al., 2015; Elsner and Liu, 2003; Wu and Wang, 2004) . The meteorological factors controlling or contributing to TC tracks, e.g., the large scale steering flow (Zhou et al., 2018) , affect the resultant TC landfall locations. Decay in wind 45 speed due to land-sea interaction and asymmetric structure are ones of mostly focused topics associated with TC landfalls (Chan et al., 2004; Chan and Liang, 2003; Chen and Yau, 2003) . Meanwhile, the studies with emphasis on track density variability (Mei et al., 2015) , TC recurvature (Zhang et al., 2013b) , TC-land interaction during landfalling processes (Zhang et al., 2013a) have gained knowledge about TC tracks and landfall related mechanisms. Mei and Xie (2016) suggested the landfalling typhoons in the northwest Pacific have significantly intensified since the late 1970s owing to strengthened 50 intensification rates, by investigating four clusters of typhoons with different track characteristics. Note that the TC intensity prior to landfall is not necessarily correlated to the TC peak intensity, extra metric is necessary to better describe the landfalling cyclone energy. Although debates still exists that if TC frequency has an upward trend or not, researchers have gained agreement to some extent that the numbers of high intensity TCs indicate increased trend in the past decades (Song et al., 2018; Webster et al., 2005) . Lee et al. (2016) has demonstrated that the TCs underwent RI and the TCs didn't undergo RI 55 (non-RI TCs) are main storm types contributing to major storms and minor storms, respectively. Thus, their separate variation of frequency and intensity, the associated influence on the TC activities, as well as the spatial distribution of the landfalling TCs along regional coasts are the main concern in the present study.\nIn this paper, we examine landfalls in the western North Pacific by TCs with different intensification rates, namely RI TCs and non-RI TCs, using the IBTrACS data set (Knapp et al., 2010) ; one straightforward metric was proposed to assess the 60 storm power of the landfalling TCs. The rest of the manuscript is arranged in the following sequence: Section 2 explains the utilized data sets, definition and methodology applied in the subsequent sections. In section 3, the LMI distribution of the TCs is explored and we detect all the landfalls during the period 1986-2017 and examine their destructive power with a https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2019-279 Preprint.

Focusing on the decadal and seasonal variability of TCs, several characteristics, e.g., LMI, accumulated landfalling cyclone energy, TC genesis and RI 65 on-set locations, etc., were investigated in section 4 and section 5. Finally, a concluding summary is provided in section 6."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "The latest released version v04r00 of IBTrACS best track data (Knapp et al., 2010; https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/) developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center was used in the present study. The best track data includes geography location, maximum sustained winds (MSW) and minimum atmospheric pressure, as well as extra information, e.g., the 70 radius of maximum wind (RMW), while available from the agencies as provided. The locations are provided with the spatial resolution of 0.1\u00ba\u00d70.1\u00ba, the magnitudes of 1-min MSW are rounded to nearest 5 kt. Compared with previous versions, the track data of version v04r00 is available in every 3 h, when the locations and the surface wind speed are interpolated from the data provided by agencies using the B-spline and the linear interpolation, respectively. For simplicity and to avoid the possible uncertainty introduced by interpolation, here we use the 6-h track data by excluding the interpolated track locations. 75\nThe data provided by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) was utilized from the data set (IBTrACS-JTWC herein for short) for analysis in the present work. Dvorak's satellite-image-based technique (Dvorak, 1984) was used after 1985 by almost all the agencies around the world to estimate cyclone intensity and has enhanced the quality of observations among basins [Knaff et al., 2010] . We utilized the data during the period from 1986 to 2017 in the present study for a better consistency of data quality. The TCs with keyword 'TRACK_TYPE' as 'main' (of which the data has been re-analyzed and 80 has higher quality) and with track data available were counted into track samples for analysis. By further excluding the ones with lifetime less than 24 hours, the total number of TC track samples, being involved in the present study, counts 946 for the western North Pacific during 1986-2017.\nThe rate of intensity change in 24 h, notated as \u2206 , was calculated using the wind speed change for each of the track segments within temporal span of 24 h. The track segments of TCs over land and extratropical were excluded for \u2206 85 calculation. The rapid intensification of TCs adopts a certain criterion of \u2206 , a fixed magnitude of \u2206 and a fixed level in the percentile of \u2206 cumulative distribution are the most accepted ones (Kaplan and DeMaria, 2003; Wang and Zhou, 2008) . Nevertheless, among different basins, the criterions of RI magnitude associated with the same percentile have discrepancy (Sampson et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2017) , resulting in inconsistency of statistic characteristics from the RI probabilities in different basins. Kaplan and DeMaria (2003) found that TCs with RI larger than 30 kt in the Atlantic basin is 90 approximately equivalent to the 95 th percentile of \u2206 cumulative distribution from 1989 to 2000. Using the IBTrACS-JTWC track data during period 1986-2017, the accumulative distribution of over-water \u2206 in the western North Pacific is shown in Fig. 1 . The result indicates that \u2206 larger than 30 kt is only equivalent to 92 th percentile in the western North Pacific. Lee et al. (2016) also reported that 35 kt is better to distinguish the TCs with RI and TCs without RI in most of the basins. To that end, the RI of TCs in our study is defined with over-water \u2206 larger than 35 kt of 1-min MSW, which is equivalent to 95 th percentile of cumulative distribution (the corresponding RI definitions for CMA/JMA best track data could also be found in Appendix A). Similar as the classification of intensity change groups by Fischer et al. (2018) , we develop three groups to further distinguish TCs with different maximum intensification rates during their strengthening processes in lifetime ( Table 1 ). The additive of slow-intensified (SI) TCs and neutral (N) TCs constitutes the non-RI TCs.\nTo quantify the power of the landfalling TCs and to obtain associated spatial distribution along the coast, control lines 100 (CTRLINE hereafter; see Fig. 2a ) in this region were created and split into totally 106 segments with separate length coverage of ~200 km. The landfalls were detected firstly by automatically judging from the keyword 'DIST2LAND' in the IBTrACS-JTWC data, then were final-confirmed via separately visual check. According to the detected landfalls during 1986-2017 in the western North Pacific shown in Fig. 2b , the most affected regions are the Philippine coast and the Vietnam & the southern Chinese coast by mainly the westward TCs, as well as the region in relative higher latitude (> 30\u02da N; 105 including the coast along the northern China, Korean Peninsula and Japan) by mainly northeastward recurving TCs. Inspired by the accumulated cyclone energy proposed by Knapp et al. (2013) , which described the total energy carried during a TC's life span, we develop the metric , multidecadal accumulated cyclone energy, to investigate the intensity changes in landfalling activities. For a specific period, the value of was calculated for each segment on CTRLINE as the sum of the square of the maximum sustained wind prior to landfall, and was normalized in the form: 110\nwhere is the number of TCs that made landfalls at one CTRLINE segment for the specific period, is the maximum sustained wind just before TC's landfall (at 6-h resolution), is the number of years for calculation.\nTherefore, is an annual averaged metric. Figure 3a represents the locations of totally 953 RI processes in the western North Pacific, 50 kt and 70 kt of 1-min MSW were used to further distinguish grades of RI. The majority of RI ranges 35-50 kt, only 23.2% and 5.9% of them could reach up to 50 kt and 70 kt, respectively. At the same time, the proportion of RI duration within 24-48 h was up to 65.9%, while a percentage of 27.1% had longer RI processes for 42-72 h, and only 7.0% lasted more than 72 h without exceeding 102 h. 120"}, {"section_title": "LMI Distributions of RI and Non-RI TCs and Their Landfalls 115", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RI in the western North Pacific", "text": "The results indicate 295 TCs (31.2 %) had underwent at least one RI during their lifetime, namely 9 TCs per year on average.

The distribution of RI occurrence density by 1\u02da\u00d71\u02da grid (Fig. 3b ) illustrates that the main region undergoing the most frequent RI was the sea areas east of the Philippine Islands, namely the region 10\u02da N-20\u02da N, 124\u02da E-137\u02da E.

As TC landfall intensity is largely affected by its life cycle and LMI, the LMI distribution of TCs is investigated before looking into the intensity prior to their landfalls. The LMI distribution for all TCs in the western North Pacific in Fig. 4a shows bimodal pattern with 1 st and 2 nd peaks at about 30 kt and 140 kt, which are highly contributed by non-RI TCs (Fig. 4c-d ) and RI TCs (Fig. 4b ),\nrespectively. The LMI distribution of non-RI TCs is mainly depend on 'SI' group of TCs, only 71 TCs are observed in the 130 'N' group and are mainly comprised with tropical depressions. These characteristics are consistent with Lee et al. (2016) 's conclusion that the bimodal pattern of LIM distribution are satisfied in all basins, and the non-RI TCs and RI TCs contribute mainly to the low and the high intensity TCs, respectively. Note that of all the major storms (Category 3-Category 5), the TCs underwent RI take the percentage of 87.4%, and reach up to 91.9% of high intensity storms (Category 4-Category 5).\nThe ratio is even hundred percent for the Category 4 and Category 5 storms in the Atlantic basin that experienced RI (Wang 135 and Zhou, 2008) . Above statistics indicate that the majority of major storms underwent at least one RI process, and remind us the significance of RI, being one of the essential characteristics for the high intensity TCs. Among the major storms, the ones approached the coast undergoing RI processes and finally made landfalls pose a great threat to coastal communities, especially which lack evacuation preparation."}, {"section_title": "Annual Averaged Landfalling Intensity of TCs 140", "text": "From all detected landfalling TCs, 341 landfalls from 192 RI TCs and 587 landfalls from 357 non-RI TCs were counted during the period 1986-2017 ( Fig. 5a-b ). Even that the number of non-RI TC landfall occurrence far overrode that of RI TCs, namely nearly 2 times, we observe their landfalling intensities being mostly weaker than Category 1, except a few TCs that made landfalls along the coast of Zhejiang Province and Taiwan, and of southern Japan, with intensity above Category 3. On the opposite side, RI TCs had affected the coast along both Philippines and southern China with landfalling TCs 145 reached Category 4, or even Category 5. Utilizing the concept MA , we estimate annual average values of landfalling energy along the coast in the western North Pacific from both types of TCs. This energy was further transformed to counts in four intensity grades as in Table 3 . The criteria of grade II-IV are decided using the lower criteria of tropical storms, Category 1 storms and Category 4 storms in sequence on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, representing energy level associated with tropical storms, moderate and high intensity storms, respectively. The accumulated energy is classified into 150 1-n counts of criteria units, before it could be categorized into next higher level of grade. To have an example for illustration, 2 at a specific segment of coastline demonstrates that the energy reaches at least double of and is less than trible of , and so on for counts in other grades. Using this quantitative method, the annual averaged statistics of cyclone energy in Fig. 5c shows: the Philippine islands and Taiwan island were the most affected regions by landfalling TCs, at least one storm equivalent to Category 1 and above hit these regions each year; the southern Japanese coast, the southern 155 brought by RI TCs was more compact and denser on the Philippine coast (Fig. 5d ), while the non-RI TCs tend to have more evenly-distributed energy, affecting both the Philippine coast and the southern Chinese coast (Fig. 5e ).

September is the most active month throughout the year, with maximum numbers of both total TCs and the landfalling RI TCs. Taking May, June and December into 165 consideration as well, the monthly averaged geography locations of RI TC genesis and on-set were calculated using TC samples during 1986-2017 ( Fig. 7) ; among them, the corresponding representative locations associated with the landfalling RI TCs were presented in blue markers. The RI processes tend to occur to the northwest of their genesis, they shifted farther to the westward direction in May, November and December. Large scale environmental flow (e.g., vertical shear) and sea surface temperature were believed to be possible inherent mechanisms (Holliday and Thompson, 1979; Kaplan and 170 DeMaria, 2003; Wang and Zhou, 2008) , which have significant impacts on the development of a TC and modulate its intensity since its genesis. Moreover, the occurrence latitude is another important climatological characteristic showing the seasonal variability of TCs. Kossin et al. (2016) investigated the TC activity using the metric, f (the mean latitude where TCs reach their LMI), and reported a fairly uniform poleward migration of f in the western North Pacific in past decades since 1980. The seasonal discrepancy in latitude directly leads to differences in affected coasts each season. The universally 175 observed westward locations (both TC genesis and RI on-set locations) of the landfalling RI TCs indicate that the RI TCs generated to the west of mean locations have higher probability to make landfalls afterwards and should be paid more attention."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Variability of Landfalling along the Coast", "text": "The TC numbers and associated each month are plotted for the most hit coasts in the western North Pacific (Fig. 8) as 180 in three representative regions (see definition in Fig. 2b) .

We further explore the RI TCs by three groups with different \u2206V in Fig.   11d -f. A higher intensification rate is generally related to higher LMI, but meanwhile the LMI is also influenced by other 205 factors, for instance, the intensification duration, the intensity when rapid intensification trigged, etc. Even that no significant trends are observed for RI TCs with different intensification rates, we notice increased occurrence of \u2206V \u2265 70 in recent ten years, which indicates potential occurrence of high intensity TCs owing to high intensification rate in the near future.\nNote that it is not the only case in the western North Pacific that stronger TCs have strengthened and vice versa, previous studies also yield similar trends in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere (Song et al., 2018) ."}, {"section_title": "LMI variation of RI 210", "text": "TCs and non-RI TCs hence definitely would vary the LMI distribution of TCs, which is shown in Fig. 12a .

The changes in LMI distribution of RI TCs and non-RI TCs (Fig. 12b-c) well explained the intensity shift in LMI distribution: a positive intensity change of RI TCs around 125 kt is mainly responsible for the strengthened strong TCs in the past decades; larger negative changes at 45 kt, 75 kt and 215"}, {"section_title": "Variation in Cyclone Energy of Landfalling TCs", "text": "Apart from the LMI which describes the maximum intensity during a TC's lifespan, the metric quantifying the local influence on coast has been utilized to obtain its annual mean value (period 1986-2017) of landfalling TCs in Section 3.3, here we further calculate the anomalies by comparing the average cyclone energy during period 1986-2001 and period 220 2002-2017 with it (Fig.12) .

Compared with the declined trend of annual TCs numbers, the absolute number and the ratio of RI TCs that made landfalls have a significant upward trend during this period, with insignificant variation in the LMI. The 260 spatial distribution of cyclone energy anomalies illustrate that the power from the landfalling RI TCs increased especially along the coast along the southern China and the Korean Peninsula. We attribute this regional variation to the poleward migration of f in the western North Pacific, which also influenced the distribution of landfalling intensity.
