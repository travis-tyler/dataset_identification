[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper presents a bibliography of 263 references related to human problem solving, arranged by subject matter. The references were taken from PsycInfo and Academic Premier database. Journal papers, book chapters, and dissertations are included. The topics include human development, education, neuroscience, and research in applied settings. It is argued that researchers are more and more engaged with problem solving research because of its centrality in human actions and because society needs advice from science in understanding and solving complex problems."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Thinking and problem solving has been an issue in basic psychological research since its beginnings in the 19th century. The first ideas came from Oswald K\u00fclpe who-in the late 1890s-invented in his W\u00fcrzburg lab the method of \"systematic experimental introspection, \" a technique that required extensive retrospective reports from trained subjects about their perceived internal processes during their problem solving activities while working on complex intellectual tasks. This method provoked Wilhelm Wundt, the experimentalist, who rejected introspection for methodological reasons. The early Gestaltists (Karl Duncker, Max Wertheimer) followed a systems approach to thinking that was based on perceptual processes of restructuring. Their problems relied on visualization and processes near to perception, forming a Gestalt solution out of the problem particles.\nWith the advent of behaviorism and with the reign of terror during World War II, that analysis of higher cognitive processes has gone lost. The recovered interest in problem solving in the times of the Cognitive Revolution around the mid 1950s led to an increasing interest in internal processes and the search for a General Problem Solver. But, as Stellan Ohlsson (2012) wrote in this journal, \"Newell and Simon's search for general problem solving strategies failed. Paradoxically, the theoretical vision that led them to search elsewhere for general principles led researchers away from studies of complex problem solving. \" So, what is the stand of problem solving research in the 21 st century in terms of published articles?\nFor the years 2006, 2008, and 2010 , comprehensive bibliographies of problem solving research were collected and commentated by Zygmunt Pizlo (see Pizlo, 2007 Pizlo, , 2009 Pizlo, , 2010 . In his last review, he was a bit pessimistic: \"There is no indication that volume of research on human problem solving is increasing. The number of published reports is substantially smaller than in other areas of cognition, such as perception or learning and memory. It seems that the lack of reliable experimental methodology, as well as the absence of theoretical foundations are responsible for this state of affairs\" (Pizlo, 2010, p. 52) . With this bibliography from 2012, I want to bring a bit more optimism back to the reader: from my point of view, problem solving as a concept and as a research issue is gaining more interest than before.\nBased on activities in 2011 and 2012, there is an emerging bulk of research on what is called \"complex problem solving\" in the tradition of Sternberg and Frensch (1991), Frensch and Funke (1995) , as well as D\u00f6rner (1997), using microworlds and computer-simulated scenarios as tools for the assessment of problem solving (see Brehmer & D\u00f6rner, 1993; Gray, 2002) . The growing interest has to do with several developments, one of them being a recent shift in the understanding of problem solving by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris) that runs the international largescale assessment enterprise called PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). PISA is intended to compare and improve the quality of national education systems because the next generation's workforce needs better education than ever. On their webpage (http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/), the OECD describes PISA as follows: \"Since the year 2000, every three years, a randomly selected group of fifteenyear-olds take tests in the key subjects: reading, mathematics and science, with focus given to one subject in each year of assessment. The students and their school principals also fill in background questionnaires to provide information on the students' family background and the way their schools are run. Some countries and economies also choose to have parents fill in a questionnaire. In 2000 the focus of the assessment was reading, in 2003 mathematics and problem solving, in 2006 science and in 2009 reading again. \" In 2012, about 500,000 pupils from more than 60 countries have been assessed and the focus domain in that wave has been problem solving! As I said before: there was a major shift in the conceptualization of problem solving competencies: whereas in PISA 2003 (when problem solving was first in the focus) analytical, static problem solving was assessed by means of paper-pencil-tasks, in PISA 2012 (when problem solving was again in the focus) dynamic, interactive problem solving was assessed for the first time in PISA by means of computer-based testing (see Greiff et al., 2013) .\nTherefore, I see a growing interest in problem solving as an issue in itself. All world-wide or at least nation-wide operating large-scale assessments that are currently on the run besides PISA (e.g., ATC21, Assessment and Teaching of 21 st Century Skills, http://atc21s.org/; P21, Partnership for 21 st Century Skills, http://www.p21.org/; PIAAC, Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, http:// nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/) do include measures for problem solving. Problem solving is seen as a key competency in a world full of uncertainty (Osman, 2010) and full of potential obstacles on our way to societal goal states of peace, food, and justice. Isn't that a success story? Accordingly, the absolute number of publications with the keyword \"problem solving\" (in all fields) per year that can be found in the Psy-cInfo database shows a steady increase (see Figure 1 ).\nIn the period between 2005 and 2010 especially, one can see a marked increase that supports my assumption of a growing interest in our issues, the increase in the total documents being steeper than in the peer-reviewed ones-once again a potential indicator for public interest that is responsible for the higher number of non-peer-reviewed papers.\nThe diversity of outlet journals has also increased: whereas in 2010, only 56 different journals were mentioned, in 2012 it is the amazing number of 171 journal titles from all fields of psychology and above. Concerning different sections in the following bibliography, in most areas slight to moderate increases can be documented, with education having a "}, {"section_title": "J. Funke", "text": "Human Problem Solving in 2012 4 strong growth from 15 to 39 publications. Reasons for that have been mentioned before. Also, the new clinical category (with n=34 starting on a high level) shows the high application interest in our topic. Against expectations, the \"Neuroscience\" category has only a small increase (from 5 to 9); maybe problem solving (as a coordinated action of higher order processes) is not easily analyzed by means of functional imaging techniques.\nThree \"Maybes\" as recoMMendaTions for fuTure bibliographies 1. Maybe the restriction to one year of publication activity is a time window too small for the identification of trends. To iterate the bibliography not every year but every two years seems reasonable-but to have a time window of one year might be a bit short. Recommendation 1: Why not choose a time window of two years that is reported every two years? 2. Maybe \"problem solving\" should not be the only keyword to search for. Research on complex problem solving, for example, comes under different labels like \"dynamic decision making\" (Coty Gonzalez, e.g., Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011), \"complex dynamic control\" (Magda Osman, e.g., 2010), or \"naturalistic decision making\" (Gary Klein, e.g., 2008). Search in databases is restricted to certain keywords that sometimes do not reflect the broader context and the similarities in content despite of different labels. "}]
