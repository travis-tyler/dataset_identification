Cognitive impairment is associated with poor antidepressant response in depressed older adults. 3 In most but not all studies, depression in individuals with CI consistently increases the risk of transition to a diagnosis of dementia. 4, 5 Depression and CI patients convert to dementia at a greater rate than elderly nondepressed patients with MCI, 6 lending support to the idea that late-life depression may be a risk factor for later dementia or represent a prodromal condition in many patients with dementia because depressive symptoms often accompany rather than precede cognitive decline. 7 Within MCI, amnestic (aMCI) and nonamnestic (naMCI) subtypes have been delineated with the distinction based on poor performance relative to standardized norms on either memory tests (aMCI) or nonmemory tests (naMCI). 8, 9 Patients with aMCI are thought to be more likely to transition to a clinical diagnosis of AD, whereas patients with naMCI are considered to be more likely to transition to non-AD dementia, such as vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies. 10 Because of growing interest in early intervention and prediction, aMCI has been further subtyped into early aMCI (EMCI) and late aMCI (LMCI). While distinctions between aMCI and naMCI have been extensively studied, 11 little information is available on the distinction between EMCI and LMCI, and, in particular, a lack of information on differences in the presence of comorbid depression.\nEarly aMCI and LMCI subtypes are distinguished by the severity of amnestic impairment with LMCI requiring memory test performance greater than 1.5 SD below standardized norms on memory tests and EMCI requiring memory test performance between 1.0 and 1.5 SD below standardized norms. This classification has been used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, and is related to the distinction between aMCI and naMCI that is the predominant subtyping classification in the literature on MCI. 12 While LMCI is essentially synonymous with the longstanding definition of aMCI, EMCI does not necessarily equate with naMCI in which deficits in nonmemory cognitive domains need to reach the 1.5 SD threshold. 13 Early aMCI patients have milder verbal memory impairment than LMCI and are thought to represent a very early stage of disease that may be optimal for disease modification treatments. These subtype differences may have implications for differences in biomarker abnormalities, likely clinical course, and treatment response in patients with comorbid depression and cognitive impairment.\nCardiovascular disease, which is a risk factor for both late-life depression and dementia, may contribute to the development of both conditions by disrupting prefrontal systems governing executive functions and mood regulation. One subtype coined as \"vascular depression\" is characterized by deficits in executive functioning, presence of white matter hyperintensities, and poor antidepressant treatment response. 14 The vascular depression subtype, however, has been explored primarily in the context of nonamnestic MCI, and amnestic MCI has typically been excluded in most studies of vascular depression. Therefore, patients in these studies may not represent the full range of patients with DEP-CI. [15] [16] [17] There is also an established asso- 20 Further, those with DEP-CI who transition to a clinical diagnosis of AD do so at a younger age and with greater hippocampal volume loss than patients with MCI alone. 6 Taken together, these reports suggest that volumetric atrophy in the medial temporal lobe increases the risk of transition to AD, and depressive symptoms may exacerbate this tendency.\nTo clarify the clinical and radiological correlates of patients with DEP-CI, we examined differences between EMCI and LMCI in a sample of patients with depression and cognitive impairment participating in a clinical trial. At baseline, we hypothesized that there will be worse global cognitive functioning (ADAS-Cog, MMSE) in LMCI than EMCI.\nWe also expected smaller medial temporal lobe volume in LMCI than EMCI. Finally, we evaluated whether cerebrovascular pathology differs between EMCI compared to LMCI by examining white matter hyperintensities in the 2 groups."}, {"section_title": "| MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Inclusion criteria", "text": "The full DOTCODE study procedures have been described elsewhere. 21 The study was approved by the New York State Psychiatric\nInstitute/Columbia University Institutional Review Board and the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.

Both subtypes were comparable in demographic features including age, sex, education, race, marital status, and employment status ( Table 1) . No differences between the subtypes were found for family histories of depression or dementia, prevalence of vascular problems, baseline depression severity, or ApoE genotype (Table 1 ).\nThere were also no differences between the groups on self-reported or informant-reported instrumental activities of daily living. In cognitive functioning, there was a statistically significant difference between groups on ADAS-Cog (Figure 1) , MMSE, Block Design, Digit Symbol, Animal Fluency, Visual Reproduction II, and UPSIT performance. No differences between the groups were found for Digit Symbol, Letter Fluency, Visual Reproduction I, measures of executive functioning (Trails or Stroop), or Boston Naming Test (Table 2 ).\nThe LMCI group had statistically significantly less volume in the right hippocampus (Table 3 ). All other regions had comparable volumes in EMCI and LMCI, including the bilateral entorhinal cortex, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, left hippocampus, and total hippocampus ( Figure 2 ). For white matter hyperintensities, there were no statistically significant group differences in lesion severity for DWM, PVH, or SCG using the Fazekas-modified Coffey Rating Scale. In lesion volume, there were also no statistically significant differences between the LMCI and EMCI groups. notion that decline in verbal memory ability is associated with decline in other cognitive domains in most patients. 28 At the domain level, those with LMCI had reduced visuospatial ability, semantic fluency, and delayed nonverbal memory. There was also worse olfactory identification performance in the LMCI group compared to the EMCI group. This is in line with reports from other studies which find that olfactory impairment is linked with both incident LMCI and progression from LMCI to dementia, but not with incident naMCI. 29 Despite these broad differences in cognitive abilities, the 2 groups did not differ with respect to instrumental activities of daily living.\nSmaller medial temporal lobe volume was predicted for patients with LMCI. Indeed, smaller right hippocampus volume was observed in the LMCI group, which has been reported by other groups."}, {"section_title": "30,31", "text": "The right hippocampus is involved in spatial memory whereas the left hippocampus plays a greater role in verbal memory, 32 making it somewhat surprising that no difference was found for the left hippocampus, seeing as our groups were formed on the basis of verbal memory functioning. Visual Reproduction II, a measure of spatial memory, did differ across groups. Consideration should be given to the possibility that early volume loss in the right hippocampus and dysfunction in visual memory ability are unique characteristics of DEP-CI. Follow-up studies may need to consider classifying amnestic patients based on any memory modality as EMCI or LMCI, instead of verbal memory impairment alone. There was no group difference for volume in the entorhinal cortex, which is a region located within the parahippocampal gyrus. Given the susceptibility of the entorhinal cortex to decay earlier and at a faster rate than the hippocampus in patients with LMCI, 33 and the role of the entorhinal cortex in delayed recall, it is unexpected to find no difference between our LMCI group and EMCI group. The entorhinal cortex is a small structure, and small degrees of atrophy at the MCI stage can sometimes be difficult to measure accurately. 34 We hypothesized greater white matter hyperintensity volume among patients with LMCI, yet found no differences between the groups in WMH volume or Fazekas ratings. There were also no group differences in reported vascular problems. Nonamnestic MCI is generally thought to largely comprise vascular cognitive impairment that is often a prodrome to vascular dementia, whereas aMCI is thought to be more likely to indicate future transition to AD. As such, naMCI is This study involved a sample of older adults with cooccurring depression and cognitive impairment. However, in the literature, these 2 disorders are typically kept separate. Research focused on MCI tends to exclude depression by excluding affective disorders, [35] [36] [37] and research on late-life depression tends to exclude memory disorders and cognitive impairment 38 by using a cutoff score for the Mini-Mental State Examination. 27, [39] [40] [41] [42] This creates a bias against the study of comorbid depression and cognitive impairment in older adults. Because there is a clear, commonly occurring, association between depression and MCI, [43] [44] [45] it is important to learn more about the characteristics of patients presenting with both conditions.\nPreviously, the ADNI enrolled subjects with LMCI and EMCI who did not meet criteria for a depressive disorder. 12 In the ADNI dataset, the LMCI group has significantly worse ADAS-Cog performance and smaller total hippocampal volume than the EMCI group. 46 The discrepant total hippocampal volume findings between our study and ADNI may be because of the unique presentation of DEP-CI, comparably lower statistical power, or differing approaches for obtaining hippocampal volume. Our study used a manual segmentation approach, whereas Beckett et al used a fully automated approach, which tends to estimate greater overall hippocampal volumes than manual methods by expanding the hippocampal ROI to the adjacent white matter."}, {"section_title": "47", "text": "The DEP-CI subjects presented in this report were enrolled in a "}]
