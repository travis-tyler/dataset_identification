Using propensity score methodological approaches (Rosenbaum, 2002) and informed by developmental systems theory (Ford & Lerner, 1992), this study estimates the effect of early (first and second) grade retention on academic achievement and psychosocial outcomes in eighth grade: six or seven years later. The goal is to determine whether retention is an effective intervention for students struggling to meet academic standards early in their elementary schooling, and to inform the education policy and practice debate regarding the costs and benefits associated with grade retention."}, {"section_title": "Setting:", "text": "Data for this study are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class 1998-1999U.S. Department of Education, 2009), a nationally representative sample following a longitudinal cohort of 21,260 kindergarteners until the eighth grade. Data were collected at seven waves: fall and spring of kindergarten (1998-99), fall and spring of first grade (1999)(2000), spring of third grade (2002), spring of fifth grade 2004, and spring of eighth grade (2007). During the fall of first grade, data were only collected from a subsample of participants and this wave will not be included in this analysis. The dataset includes multiple sources of data including administrator surveys, teacher assessments, direct child assessments, child questionnaires, and parent surveys."}, {"section_title": "Population / Participants / Subjects:", "text": "The sample is comprised of 5,586 students who (1) participated in the six data collection waves of interest; (2) attended public school through all data collection waves; (3) were first time kindergarteners at the study's start; (4) were enrolled in first grade in spring 2000; and (5) have valid grade level data in the spring of 2002 (i.e., students who were in ungraded classrooms, promoted ahead of time, retained in kindergarten in spring 1999, or whose grade level data were missing or not ascertained were excluded.) Within this sample, 295 students who were retained once in either the first or second grade compose the treatment group. These students were identified through teacher report because they were in the second grade in spring 2002, when the majority of students in the sample are in the third grade. All remaining students in the sample who were reported as being in the third grade in spring of 2002 create the comparison group (n = 5,291). Table 1 presents the pre-treatment demographic characteristics for retained and promoted students. In summary, the retained group consists of a higher proportion of males (58% versus 48%) and lower proportion of white students (38% versus 61%) as compared to the promoted group. Additionally, 22% of retained students were classified as having a disability (a proxy for special education), while 13% of promoted students had this status."}, {"section_title": "Intervention / Program / Practice:", "text": "Grade retention supporters claim it is an effective remedial intervention that provides students \"the gift of time\" (Smith & Shepard, 1988;Tomchin & Impara, 1992), and some studies demonstrate student improvement in reading and math test scores (Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005) and social-emotional outcomes (Hong & Yu, 2008) after retention. Yet, scholars who oppose retention and advocate for social promotion (i.e., moving students to the next grade even if current performance standards are not met), argue that students would fare better academically if they were not retained (Allen et al., 2009;Reschly & Christenson, 2013). Detrimental academic consequences (Jimerson & Ferguson, 2007;Jimerson, et al., 2002) and behavioral health outcomes provide empirical support for the negative effects of grade retention."}, {"section_title": "Research Design:", "text": "The ECLS-K followed a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners from the 1998-1999 school year through the 2006-2007 school year. The current study utilizes a quasiexperimental, longitudinal approach and propensity score methodology to estimate the effect of early grade retention on academic and psychosocial outcomes in the middle grades."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Analysis:", "text": "The ECLS-K collected data from multiple reporters to assess a range of child outcomes. Data utilized in the analysis are derived from the fall and spring of kindergarten (wave 1 and 2), spring of 1 st grade (wave 4), and spring of 8 th grade (wave 7). For students who were not retained (i.e. engaged in continuous progression) this translates to a data collection timeline occurring in kindergarten, first, third, and eighth grade; for retained students, they would be at a lower grade level. Covariates are drawn from data collected during or before spring 2000 (i.e., before retention occurs), and outcomes are measured in spring 2007. We use data from spring 2002 to identify treated versus comparison group students. Academic outcomes. Math and reading achievement are measured by the direct assessment of students' math and reading skills on a 50 to 70 item reading test that measures latent ability in the subject. This study uses the IRT-derived theta scores, which are comparable across different time points and thus allow for the examination of growth over time (Najarian, Polllack, & Sorongon, 2009). Theta reliability estimates for reading IRT score is .87, and .92 for math in spring 2007 (Najarian et al., 2009). Student self-reported reading competence and math competence from the Self-Description Questionnaire (alpha = .76 and .89 respectively; Najarian et al., 2009), the indirect measure of teacher-report of reading competence from the Academic Rating Scale, and teacher rated oral and written skills are examined. Psychosocial outcomes. Social self-concept is a continuous composite measure comprised of five items related to peer acceptance and rated on a five-point scale (alpha = .89). In spring 2007, students rated eight items along a four-point scale about feeling lonely, frustrated, and worrying about school, which comprises the measure of internalizing problem behaviors (alpha = .75). Self-esteem (alpha = .79) is comprised of seven items derived from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE, Rosenberg 1965), and locus of control (alpha = .68) is comprised of six items. For both self-esteem and locus of control, items were rated on a fourpoint scale (i.e., strongly agree to strongly disagree) and analyses utilized the scale score, which is the average of the standardized items with mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Covariates. The selection of covariates is informed by previous empirical work to understand connections to both the likelihood of being retained, as well as outcomes postretention. All covariates are from fall 1998, spring 1999, or spring 2000, ensuring collection prior to the treatment of grade retention. Selected covariates (Table 2) are organized by priority for achieving balance in the propensity score model, due to the strength of theorized connection to the treatment and/or outcome variables. The covariates include administrative (child and school level), demographic, teacher-report, and parent-report variables, in addition to child assessments. Pre-treatment indicators of dependent variables collected in fall 1998, spring 1999, and/or spring 2000 are also included as covariates. Informed by prior studies, 43 confounding covariates are included in the propensity score model to address the ignorability assumption; of these, higher priority covariates with less than ideal balance will be included in the analytic model. Data analysis. Prior to running analyses, we will conduct a single imputation using chained equation to address the issue of missing data. Then we use propensity score matching to construct a logical counterfactual group, and compare retained students to other students who would have been retained, based on similar observed characteristics, but were promoted. The utilization of propensity scores ensures that students who have been retained are only compared to similar individuals who have been promoted as measured by \"causally related covariates\" (Hill & Reiter, 2006), rather than all students who have been promoted. This allows us to estimate the effect of grade retention and disentangle it from other confounds because the only meaningful observed difference between the two groups is the treatment. By accounting for characteristics measured before retention that may act as potential confounds, the propensity score method adjusts for potential bias associated with the likelihood of a student experiencing grade retention versus being promoted on time. Consistent with prior literature (e.g., Hong & Raudenbush 2005Hong & Yu 2007, each student in the analytic sample will receive a propensity score fit using a logistic regression, which summarizes the likelihood of being retained based on all of the pre-retention covariates (Rosenbaum, 2002;Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983). We use two different propensity score methodological approaches to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated: (1) nearest neighbor (one to one) matching without replacement and (2) caliper matching with replacement. The goal is to select the ideal control participants that serve as the best comparison for the students who have been retained. Retained students not in the area of common support are excluded, as they do not have comparable counterfactuals. We will employ two different matching approaches to address the issue of bias and determine if our findings are consistent and robust. Various propensity score models will be fit for each method to obtain balance between the retained sample and the comparison group of promoted students on as many covariates as possibility, but prioritizing the covariates on the left side of Table 2. To determine the treatment effect for each method and outcome, we will run a regression-adjusted matched estimate using probability weights and covariate adjustment (i.e., inclusion of the priority covariates related to the likelihood of being retained and/or outcomes post-retention, and variables that do not demonstrate sound balance)."}, {"section_title": "Findings / Results:", "text": "Analyses are presently being conducted and formal results are forthcoming. As a preliminary step, descriptive results summarizing the outcomes of interest for the treatment group of students who have been retained are presented in Table 3."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions:", "text": "Conclusions and recommendations will be developed after the results and findings have been finalized. However, if there is an absence of compelling evidence to support the extremely costly and time intensive intervention of grade retention (Allen et al., 2009), there is an opportunity for this research to contribute policy-relevant knowledge. Going beyond academic outcomes, this study aims to highlight the long-term, cumulative impacts of early elementary grade retention and the relationship between academic and psychosocial outcomes during this developmentally sensitive outcome period.
