Prior DTI studies reported decreased structural integrity of the superficial white matter (SWM) in the brain diseases. Objective: This study aimed to determine the diffusion characteristics of SWM in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using tractography and region of interest (ROI) approaches. Methods: The diffusion MRI data were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database on 24 patients with AD, 24 with MCI, and 24 normal control (NC) subjects. DTI processing was performed using DSI Studio software. First, for ROI-based analysis, The superficial white matter was divided into right and left frontal, parietal, temporal, insula, limbic and occipital regions by the Talairach Atlas, Then, for tractography-based analysis, the tractography of each of these regions was performed with 100000 seeds. Finally, the average diffusion values were extracted from voxels within the ROIs and tracts. Results: Both tractography and ROI analyses showed a significant difference in radial, axial and mean diffusivity values between the three groups (p < 0.05) across most of the SWM. Furthermore, The Mini-Mental State Examination was significantly correlated with radial, axial, and mean diffusivity values in parietal and temporal lobes SWM in the AD group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: DTI provided information indicating microstructural changes in the SWM of patients with AD and MCI. Therefore, assessment of the SWM using DTI may be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of patients with AD and MCI."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used in recent years as a strong and non-invasive neuroimaging technique, which can provide useful information for detecting damage to white matter in neurodegenerative diseases by measuring the diffusion properties of water molecules [1, 2] . Four important quantitative measures of DTI are axial diffusivity (AxD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA). FA describes the degree of anisotropy of water diffusion. MD is the average rate of diffusion along all directions and is typically increased with damage to myelin sheaths. AD is diffusion parallel to axons, while radial diffusivity (RD) reflects the two vectors of diffusion perpendicular to the axon [3] .\nDTI tractography is a potential 3D tool for detecting white matter pathology and evaluating the microstructural integrity of white matter fiber bundles using information collected by DTI [4] that was developed by Mori et al. [5] . DTI and fiber tractography may be used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nAD is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly population that caused by the presence of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and finally cause neuronal death and damage to the brain tissue [6] .\nMCI is a type of cognitive decline characterized by significant memory loss without functional impairments. Individuals with MCI do not fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia but they have a high risk for progression to dementia. This fact shows that the detection of MCI is important [7, 8] . It is believed that differential diagnosis of between normal subject and MCI and between MCI and AD are difficult and very important, and clinical neuroimaging techniques can be used to make these distinctions [9] .\nAD and MCI affect certain regions of the brain. Therefore, the atlas-based method for the study of white matter integrity invariant regions of interest (ROI) has been widely used [10] . Superficial white matter (SWM) is one of the regions that may play an important role in the diagnosis of AD [11, 12] and MCI.\nSWM is located between gray matter and deep white matter and mainly consists of short-range association fibers (such as U-shaped fibers which connect neighboring gyri). The cellular and structural arrangement of the SWM differs from the deep white matter. For example, according to the retrogenesis model, fibers that myelinate later in development are the first to be affected by damage [13, 14] . The SWM, unlike the deep white matter, is comprised of latemyelinating fibers. Therefore, they are vulnerable to neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, oligodendrocytes that produce the myelin sheath insulating neuronal axons tend to myelinate with fewer wraps in the SWM than the deep white matter. Accordingly, SWM axons are more sensitive to impairments [11] .\nRecent studies showed decreased structural integrity and high sensitivity of SWM in multiple sclerosis [15] , autism [16] , schizophrenia [17, 18] , Huntington's disease [19] , AD [11, 12] , and cognitive decline in aging [20, 21] . According to our knowledge, no studies have assessed DTI values in this region in MCI.\nThere are many different methods for analyzing DTI data with their own advantages and restrictions. As different information and results are provided by different methods, performing more than one type of analysis is often valuable to earn insight into the results of each method [22] . Methods used in recent studies include Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics (TBSS) [23] , connectivity analysis [24] [25] [26] [27] , voxelbased and ROI analyses [28] , tractography analysis [18, 21] , and other methods. In the present study, we performed ROI and tractography approaches of the SWM region.\nThe purpose of the present study was the detection of SWM microstructural changes in AD and MCI using DTI through the region of interest and tractography techniques."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical data and demographics", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

Therefore, we evaluated the SWM in MCI and AD groups in this study.\nOur findings showed that AxD, MD, and RD values were higher in patients with AD in comparison with control subjects and these values were much more different than in FA. The results are consistent with two previous studies [11, 12] . They believed that increased axial diffusivity is associated with axonal damage and Wallerian degeneration in patients and increased RD is related to myelin sheath disruption and increased MD reflects the brain tissue atrophy. Accordingly, our findings also demonstrate brain tissue atrophy, Wallerian degeneration, and myelin sheath disruption in SWM in AD. The highest increase in MD values was seen in the left temporal and limbic regions (both increased by 32%), and in the left limbic region for AxD and RD values (28% and 44%, respectively) between ADr and control groups average an ROI approach.\nOn the other hand, SWM fiber tractography results also showed that the highest increase in AxD and RD values was in the left temporal (by 17%) and MD value increased in the left limbic (15%) in patients compared to the healthy controls. FA value was reduced in patients with AD in comparison with healthy controls and MCI subjects, but it was not statistically significant.\nTractography is a powerful tool for studying white matter pathways can be used for SWM fibers. These fibers often included short association U-fibers and intraregional fibers. In some studies [33, 34] , short association fiber pathways (U-fibers) identified separately, but we evaluated all the fibers of SWM in any region in the present study.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the SWM changes in MCI using DTI. AxD, MD, and RD values were higher in MCI in comparison with control subjects. Nevertheless, we found a significant difference in MD value only in the right parietal SWM tracts.\nThese results are in agreement with a perfusion study that showed significant regional hypoperfusion in patients suffering from MCI compared to the CN group in the parietal lobe [35] . Also in another study, the scores on the working memory domain correlated inversely with the parietal lobe atrophy score in MCI patients [36] , which confirms the damage to the parietal lobe in MCI patients, similar to our results.\nMost studies reported DTI values changes in AD and MCI groups compared to the healthy controls and emphasized the earliest pathological changes in specific regions notably temporal lobe [37, 38] . Following these studies, we evaluated the SWM as a specific region that can help in the diagnosis of AD. Finally, compared to MCI, patients with AD had the highest increase in diffusivity values in the bilateral temporal lobe. In other words, the SWM of the temporal lobe in AD subjects can be a valuable biomarker for the detection of AD and MCI.\nPrevious studies have suggested the MMSE score as a useful tool for the identification of cognitive impairment in individuals with memory or other cognitive impairment [10] . However, according to the results of the study by Phillips et al., the SWM microstructure may be vulnerable to age-related processes of demyelination [20] . So, we detected associations between anatomic regions of SWM and MMSE score and we showed a significant association between changes in the axial, radial, and mean diffusivity of parietal and temporal SWM and the MMSE score in AD subjects. That is, in AD subjects, a decrease of the MMSE score was negatively associated with increased RD, MD, and AxD in temporal and parietal SWM (negative correlation). Phillips et al. believed that the correlation between SWM and MMSE suggested that the microstructural abnormalities could be seen as a manifestation of the disease evolution [11] . Our findings showed a negative correlation between MMSE and diffusivity, which supports this conclusion.\nCaution is needed when interpreting the results, since fiber architecture of superficial white matter containing multiple fiber populations (termed \"crossing fibers\"), reveals the more complex arrangement than in the deep white matter. The complex fiber arrangement can affect the estimation of the diffusion properties [19] . For example, the FA value is strongly affected and is lower in such areas [39] and similar results were reported by Wheeler-Kingshott et al. that demonstrated the challenges of interpreting changes in axial and radial diffusivity in crossing fiber regions [40] . These created effects depend on the microstructure features of white matter pathways such as the degree of orientational coherence of fibers and pose severe challenges for tractography [41] . Thus the interpretation of the diffusion data is complex and requires a prior knowledge about the architecture of the white matter pathways. Further research oriented on the anatomical specificity of superficial white matter architecture will help to complement DTI findings."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "DTI offers a wide set of biomarkers for identifying and monitoring of the disease. Given that the DTI values changes in some regions of SWM, it can play an important role in the diagnosis of AD and MCI. To support this conclusion, we showed that there is major abnormality across the brain in patients and it is associated with MMSE score in AD subjects. So, the SWM microstructural changes are related to the clinical symptoms in AD."}, {"section_title": "Limitation", "text": "In the present study, DTI images were reconstructed with DTI as a model-based method.
