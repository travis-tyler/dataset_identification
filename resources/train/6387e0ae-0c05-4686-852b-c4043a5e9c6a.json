Secondary analysis using cross-sectional data of 714 healthy normal and overweight Caucasian subjects (age 18-83 years) with comprehensive information on FFM, organ and tissue masses (as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), body density (as assessed by Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP)) and hydration (as assessed by deuterium dilution (D 2 O)) and REE (as assessed by indirect calorimetry). High metabolic rate organs (HMR) summarized brain, heart, liver and kidney masses. Ratios of HMR organs and muscle mass (MM) in relation to FFM were considered. REE was calculated (REEc) using organ and tissue masses times their specific metabolic rates. REE, FFM, specific metabolic rates, the REE-FFM relationship, HOMA, CRP, and thyroid hormone levels change with age. The age-related decrease in FFM explained 59.7% of decreases in REE. Mean residuals of the REE-FFM association were positive in young adults but became negative in older subjects. When compared to young adults, proportions of MM to FFM decreased with age, whereas contributions of liver and heart did not differ between age groups. HOMA, TSH and inflammation (plasma CRP-levels) explained 4.2%, 2.0% and 1.4% of the variance in the REE-FFM residuals, but age and plasma T3-levels had no effects. HMR to FFM and MM to FFM ratios together added 11.8% on to the variance of REE-FFM residuals. Differences between REE and REEc increased with age, suggesting age-related changes in specific metabolic rates of organs and tissues. This bias was partly explained by plasmaT3-levels. Age-related changes in REE are explained by (i) decreases in fat free mass; (ii) a decrease in the contributions of organ and muscle masses to FFM; and (iii) decreases in specific organ and tissue metabolic rates. Age-dependent changes in the REE-FFMassociation are explained by composition of FFM, inflammation and thyroid hormones."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Resting energy expenditure (REE) decreases from young to old age by 1% to 2% per decade [1] .

The decrease in REE is explained by a reduction in FFM as well as by changes in the composition of FFM in normal and overweight subjects (Table 1, Figure 3) . With increasing FFM, the proportion of HMR to FFM remained relatively constant, whereas the MM to FFM ratio decreased with age. Considering individual organ and tissue masses, heart mass and spleen masses per FFM increased with age ( Figure 3) . In a previous study of our group, Bosy-Westphal et al. [3] had already described that heart mass explained 58% of the variance in the difference between REE and REEc in elderly subjects. A higher heart mass with age was seen as a compensatory effect on chronic hypertensive load or hypertrophy of cardiocytes.\nIn addition to the age-related (i) decreases in FFM and (ii) changes in the proportion of organ/tissues mass to FFM, alterations of specific metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues add to age-related changes in REE. To address this issue, REE was calculated (REEc) based on organ and tissue masses times specific tissue metabolic rates. Elia [27] was first to publish metabolic rates of individual organs and tissues assuming constant values across lifespan. By contrast, Gallagher et al. [4] showed that specific metabolic rates based on data of younger subjects do not resemble the respective metabolic rates in elderly subjects. In a previous work, Wang et al. [13] calculated that specific metabolic rates of organs and tissues changed with age resulting in corrections of Elias constants. Anyhow, the present data revealed that the differences between REE and REEc increased with age. This was obvious for both the Elia and Wang predictions (Figure 4) . The bias between REE and REEc could not be explained by the age-related changes in whole body density or FFM hydration. In our opinion, this supports the idea that the physical property of organ and tissue masses are not related to age-related changes in REE.\nIn the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Ruggiero et al. [14] and Fabbri et al. [16] have already shown that higher resting metabolic rates in age were associated with multi-morbidity and mortality. We now add the finding that age-related changes in the REE-FFM-association (i.e., the REE-FFMresiduals) were related to inflammation. Thus, the variance in the FFM to REE relationship could reflect health status.\nA limitation of this study was the assumption of age-independent constant organ and tissue densities that affects the estimate of organ and tissue masses from their volumes. In addition, we have used cross-sectional data only; thus, our data cannot give a future prospect on individual aging. The fact that data analysis included normal and overweight subjects (BMI < 30 kg/m 2 ) only could be seen as critical, but this cut off was chosen to cover current normal BMI ranges for all young as well as older adults."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, age-related changes of REE relate to decreases in FFM as well as alterations in the REE-FFM relationship. In addition, proportional changes in FFM composition (i.e., the organ and tissue mass ratios to FFM) plus decreases in specific metabolic rates of organs and tissues add to the decrease in REE with age. The variance in the REE-FFM association is related to inflammation."}]
