[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In December 2019, China reported a sudden outbreak of pneumonia due to an unknown source in Hubei province, Wuhan city [1] which later got attributed to a virus named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae which also houses SARS-CoV-1 [2], [3] and MERS-CoV [4] virus. Genomic sequence analysis of the newly reported virus was found to be highly similar to that of SARS-CoV (95%\u2013100%), thus showing the evolutionary similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [5]. By October 2020, India has registered over 7.65 million cases [6], making it one of the most affected countries in the world. Symptoms of the COVID-19 vary from fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnoea and diarrhoea to severe respiratory distress which may require life support systems. In severe cases, it may even lead to death [7]. Considering these consequences, World Health Organisation (WHO) suggested to interrupt human\u2013human contact in the form of total lock downs along with precautionary measures such as face masks and hand sanitizers to control the spread of COVID-19. Hence, it is the need of the hour to find a cure for COVID-19 in the form of vaccine.\nClassical methods of vaccine design like attenuation of the virus through external sources such as micro-organisms to mitigate its harm or virulence usually depends on the response of the virus itself. Sometimes mutations in the virus genome can result in autoimmune response eventually making the virus even more virulent. Hence, such classic vaccine design approaches are time consuming, expensive and may not provide an effective response. With the evolution in bioinformatics and genome analysis, it is now possible to study the DNA, RNA and molecular evolution of a virus which can aid in development of vaccine through approaches such as reverse vaccinology. Reverse vaccinology involves pinpointing the protein sites that results into synthetic peptide based vaccines [8], [9]. The preparation of epitope based vaccine is carried out in sequential form, starting from scanning the genome of the pathogen to locating the surface proteins, followed by extracting the best epitopes situated on the surface and also testing these synthetic designs against any autoimmune response [9]. The antigens provided by the epitopes are the sites to which antibodies bind, hence selection of the best epitopes is one of the crucial and foremost steps in vaccine design. In regard to this, Skwarczynski et al. [8] have suggested several factors which influence the selection of epitopes, such as immune response to the pathogen, hypersensitivity responses and coverage of different peptide against different pathogen subtypes. Further, these epitopes can be classified into two classes i.e. MHC-I, MHC-II associated T-cell epitopes [10] and B-cell epitopes [11] based on their responses against recognized foreign pathogens. The antigens provided by MHC-I interact directly with the CD8 cells evoking the cellular response [8]. MHC-II antigens bind to the surface of the pathogens to initiate the T-helper cells (CD4) which are responsible for activating the Th1 and Th2 type helper cells in the form of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) and humoral response through antigens loaded in MHC-I and B-cell epitopes. Hence, the selection of T-cell and B-cell epitopes is a crucial process in order to provide a reliable vaccine.\nBy considering the several advantages presented in form of peptide-based vaccine, many studies have been carried out to design a vaccine in order to provide a stable solution against the threat as presented by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Earlier, it was found that spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 can act as an intermediary to bind to the host cells with a very strong affinity, thus eventually attracting various experiments towards targeting this protein site as the potential target for vaccine design and diagnostics [12]. Following this, many types of vaccine designs have been proposed based on RNA, vectored, recombinant protein sequence and cell-cultures while focusing on the spike protein or whole virion [13]. Additionally, in Lin et al. [14] heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) in the spike protein have been predicted followed by the peptides with the help of molecular dynamics simulation between the fusion of the viral membrane and the host cell membrane, eventually limiting the spread of the virus within the host cells. Another study carried out by Vashi et al. [15] predicted 24 potential epitope fragments of which 20 were on the surface of spike protein. This information can be helpful for designing potential immunogenic peptide-based vaccines. Similar study has been conducted by Rakib et al. [16] in which spike protein region has been analysed through multiple sequence analysis in different SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict the most immunogenic peptide fragments. In this study, a multi-epitope based vaccine has been proposed through analysing the S1 and S2 domains of spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in order to provide the best epitopes [17] for designing a vaccine. However, it is important to note that other protein sites can also be targeted for vaccine design as well [18]. This depends on how the T-cell interacts inside the different protein region of SARS-CoV-2. Grifoni et al. [18] have identified that 70\u2013100% of epitope pools detect CD8 and CD4 T-cells for SARS-CoV-2. CD4+ cells interact with the other proteins like membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and ORF1ab proteins like NSP3, NSP4 and NSP12, but the dominance of CD4+ cells is very high within the spike region. On the other hand, no such dominant reactivity was identified in case of CD8+ cells in spike protein region. Hence, MHC-I restricted epitopes derived from M, NSP6, ORF3a or N proteins can also be considered for vaccine design. Noorimotlagh et al. [19] have conducted a review on several papers and have inferred a set of T-cell and B-cell epitopes from the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins with high antigenicity. Genomic analysis conducted by Yadav et al. [20] on the first two cases reported in India resulted in the introduction of two non-identical strains of SARS-CoV-2. With time, more mutation points have been discovered [21] as well. This alteration in the protein region of the genome can lead to vaccine failures as was noticed in the case of Influenza virus in 2013\u201314 [22]. Hence, stable vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, for such RNA viruses which undergo rapid mutations, Nandy et al. [9] have suggested the extraction of genomic regions which are either not influenced or very less influenced by the process of mutation. This can be carried out by analysing large set of virus genomes with the help of sequence alignment techniques. Such similar regions inside different viral genomes can be then considered for synthetic peptide vaccine designs. In [23], Gupta et al. have developed a web resource \u201cCoronaVR\u201d and have identified a set of T-cell and B-cell epitopes that can be incorporated in vaccine design. On the other hand, Crooke et al. [24] have used available algorithms and webtools to identify 41 T-cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B-cell epitopes as probable targets for epitope-based vaccine design. Ong et al. [25] have used Vaxign and the recently developed Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict potential vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Apart from Spike, they have identified epitopes derived from NSP3, 3CL-pro, NSP8, NSP9 and NSP10 proteins to be highly likely candidates for vaccine design. There are other works like [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] as well pertaining to epitope identification in SARS-CoV-2 for vaccine design.\nIn the above discussed literature, prediction of epitopes has been performed by analysing the virus proteins whereas genetical mutations are the primary reason for change in structure of the virus proteins. This fact motivated us to analyse the 566 available Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the conserved regions to predict the immunogenic and antigenic epitopes. For this purpose, we have used four different multiple sequence alignment techniques viz. ClustalW [34], MUSCLE [35], ClustalO [36], [37] and MAFFT [38] to align the sequences. Consensus conserved regions (CCnR) are then identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned results of the alignment techniques. Further, these conserved regions are filtered on the basis of (a) length should be greater than or equal to 60nt and (b) corresponding protein sequence should not have any stop codons. This is followed by the validation of specificity of the conserved regions as query coverage with the help of Nucleotide BLAST [39]. These filtered conserved regions are then used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores. Thereafter, these scores are used to rank the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 23 conserved regions encompassing NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, 3CL-Proteinase, NSP10, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Helicase, Spike glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Subsequently, the consensus conserved region in NSP3 gene has been found to be highly immunogenic and antigenic. It provides MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes, FLKKDAPYI, ITFLKKDAPYIVGDV, TLVSDIDITFLKKDAP as immunogenic and TAVVIPTKK, IDITFLKKDAPYIVG, LHPDSATLVSDIDITF as antigenic respectively. Also, different immunogenic and antigenic epitopes associated to other conserved regions are provided as well. Finally, to validate the identified epitopes, the conformational 2D non-covalent structure of the chosen epitopes is studied. Moreover, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes along with Ramachandran plot and Z-scores are also reported in the paper."}, {"section_title": "Data preparation ::: Materials and methods", "text": "In order to map the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we have used the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2)2\nand 44583 available protein sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI). To generate the protein sequence, we have taken the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 genome and considered the reading frame concepts. A reading frame divides the sequence of nucleotides of the reference sequence into a set of successive, non-overlapping triplets. There are three possible reading frames: Frame 1 which starts from the first nucleotide of a reference sequence and creates the triplets, Frame 2 which starts from the second nucleotide and creates the triplets and Frame 3 which starts from the third nucleotide and creates the triplets. For each frame, these triplets are then translated into the corresponding proteins based on the codon table3\n. Finally, we have obtained 25 such unique proteins which were best matched to Frame 2. Also, the recent genomic sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 virus have been collected from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)4\nin fasta format. It contains 566 complete and near complete genomes with sequence ID. The average length of the 566 genomes is 29,831 bp. These 566 SARS-CoV-2 sequences are aligned using multiple sequencing alignment (MSA) techniques to extract the conserved regions. Also, the coded protein associated to each conserved region are extracted. For the alignment of sequences, High Performance Computing (HPC) facility of NITTTR, Kolkata is used. The HPC cluster has a master node with dual Intel Xeon Gold 6130 Processor having 32 Cores, 2.10 GHz, 22 MB L3 Cache and 128 GB DDR4 RAM and 2 GPU and 4 CPU computing nodes with dual Intel Xeon Gold 6152 Processor having 44 Cores, 2.1 GHz, 30 MB L3 Cache and 192 GB DDR4 RAM each, while GPU nodes have NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GB memory each. MSA was performed using the 2 GPU and 4 CPU computing nodes."}, {"section_title": "Pipeline of the workflow ::: Materials and methods", "text": "The pipeline of the workflow is shown in Fig. 1\n. To start with, we have focused on finding the conserved regions in the 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence which are not affected by genetic mutations. For the same, initially we have constructed a Consensus Multiple Sequence Alignment (CMSA) approach in which we have used four different alignment techniques: ClustalW, MUSCLE, ClustalO and MAFFT in order to align the 566 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Subsequently, consensus conserved regions (CCnR) are identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned result of alignment techniques. ClustalW initially performs pairwise alignment of all sequences by using the k-tuple method. Thereafter, MSA is created by progressively aligning the most closely related sequences based on Neighbor-Joining guide tree method. In MUSCLE technique, two distance measures are used: k-mer for unaligned pairs and Kimura method for aligned pairs of sequences. Initially, a draft MSA is produced in MUSCLE using the k-mer method. Then, a progressive alignment is constructed based on the guide tree as produced by the UPGMA method. This initial tree is then re-estimated using the Kimura distance method after which UPGMA method is once again used to produce a new guide tree, thereby creating a second MSA. New MSAs are finally created by realigning the two sequences created previously. ClustalO uses the k-tuple method to produce pairwise alignment. Then mBed is used to cluster the sequences followed by k-means clustering algorithm. Next, the guide tree is built using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) method. Finally, MSA is constructed using the HHalign package. MAFFT uses two different heuristic methods, progressive (FFT-NS-2) and iterative refinement (FFT-NS-i). The main aim of MAFFT is to merge local and global algorithms for MSA. Initially, FFT-NS-2 is used to calculate all-pairwise distances to create a provisional MSA from which refined distances are calculated. Then, FFT-NS-i is performed to get the final MSA. Thereafter, to identify the conserved regions, these aligned sequences are used to compute the entropy(E).(1)E=ln5+\u2211Sxyln[Sxy]where Sx\ny indicates the frequency of each residue x occurring at position y and 5 represents the four possible residues as nucleotide plus gap. To identify the conserved regions (CnRs) for each alignment technique, a minimum segment length of 15 is considered with maximum average entropy as 0.2. Further, maximum entropy per position is taken as 0.2 with no gaps after finding the consensus sequence for the 566 genomic sequences. All these values are taken after following the literature. Thereafter, the CCnRs are identified considering the CnRs of all the alignment techniques. Next, a refinement process is carried out for the CCnRs based on the criteria that their length is greater then or equal to 60nt and no stop codon is present in the associated protein sequence. Moreover, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the CCnRs as query coverage as well. Subsequently, T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified from these CCnRs. To predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes and to find their corresponding immunogenic scores, each CCnR is subjected to IEDB5\nand ABCPred6\nrespectively. As recommended by IEDB, for the prediction of MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, NetMHCpan7\nand Consensus Approach8\n[40] are selected respectively whereas for B-cell epitopes, prediction is carried out by ABCPred which uses Recurrent Neural Network. Then, by using the predicted epitopes, antigenic scores are calculated with the help of VaxiJen2.09\n. For each CCnR, multiple T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified along with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Subsequently, for each CCnR the highest immunogenic and antigenic scores are considered to select the corresponding epitopes. Furthermore, these scores are used to rank the CCnRs based on geometric mean as given in Eq. (2). The use of geometric mean is to avoid the skewness of immunogenic and antigenic scores obtained for T-cell and B-cell epitopes so that proper ranking of the consensus conserved regions can be performed. Moreover, to validate the identified epitopes, the conformational 2D non-covalent structures of the identified epitopes are studied using LigPlot+ [41]. Furthermore, BepiPred2.0 server10\n[42] is used for the verification of the predicted B-cell epitopes.Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes along with Ramachandran plot are reported through PyMOL [43] and its extensive libraries Autodock Vina (for docking) [44] and PyMOD 3 [45] while for the Z-score calculation ProSA11\n[46] online server is used.(2)RCCnR=Rank([ISMHC-I\u00d7ISMHC-II\u00d7ISB-cell]\u00d7[ASMHC-I\u00d7ASMHC-II\u00d7ASB-cell])16)where, RCCnR represents rank of consensus conserved region (CCnR) based on geometric mean of immunogenic and antigenic scores of T-cell and B-cell epitopes, ISi and ASi are the scaled immunogenic and antigenic scores for MHC-I, MHC-II and B-cell epitopes respectively."}, {"section_title": "Ranking of the CCnRs ::: Results and discussions", "text": "Experiments in this study are carried out according to the flowchart as mentioned in Fig. 1. Initially, 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes are aligned by using Consensus Multiple Sequence Alignment (CMSA) techniques, ClustalW, MUSCLE, ClustalO and MAFFT. Subsequently, we have obtained 125 CCnRs by considering all the alignment techniques. This is shown in Fig. 2\nwhere 438, 439, 438 and 438 conserved regions (CnRs) from ClustalW, MUSCLE, ClustalO and MAFFT respectively are provided resulting in 125 CCnRs. This is followed by mapping of the CCnRs to 11 coding regions i.e. ORF1ab, Spike, ORF3a, Envelope, Membrane, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid and ORF10. The corresponding protein sequence for each CCnR has been taken from Frame 2. Now, the 125 CCnRs are filtered based on the criteria that (a) their length should be greater than or equal to 60nt and (b) no stop codons should be present in the corresponding proteins. A BLAST specificity score as query coverage equal to 100% is also considered during the filtering process. As a result, 23 CCnRs have been identified. Subsequently, these CCnRs are ranked on the basis of geometric mean of highly immunogenic and antigenic scores of the corresponding MHC-I, MHC-II T-cell and B-cell epitopes. It is worth mentioning that the immunogenic and antigenic scores are scaled within the range of 0\u20131 to bring the scores of all the epitopes for different CCnRs to a uniform scale and mentioned throughout the paper while the actual scores are given as Supplementary in excel file. After ranking, top 5 CCnRs along with their corresponding protein sequences, lengths, blast specificity scores, percentage of BLAST specificity scores as query coverage, coding regions with their starting and ending coordinates, lengths and coded proteins are also mentioned in Table 1\n. Moreover, the ranking with the scores of these top 5 CCnRs is reported in Table 2\n. It is found from Table 1, that the top 5 CCnRs belong to the coding region which codes NSP3, 3CL-Proteinase, NSP10 and NSP4 proteins respectively. Please note that all the 23 CCnRs are reported in Supplementary Table S3 while their ranking details are given in Supplementary Table S4.\nIt is important to note that although structural proteins are the popular candidates for vaccine, vaccine protection can be correlated to non-structural proteins. In this regard, [47] showed that NS1 which is a non-structural protein can bring about protective immunity against flaviviruses. Though, no neutralizing effect was shown by antibodies against NS1, some exuded complement-fixing activity and even passive transfer of anti-NS1 antibody or immunization with NS1 can lead to protection against viruses [48]. Furthermore, anti-NS1 antibody could be responsible to block NS1-induced pathogenic effects, reduce viral replication by complement-dependent cytotoxicity of infected cells and even attenuate NS1-induced disease development. This has led to NS1 being a prospective vaccine candidate against Dengue virus [49], [50]. Another core advantage of NS1 is that being a non-structural protein, the anti-NS1 antibody will not instigate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is a virulence factor causing serious repercussions. Additionally, non-structural virus proteins can generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes which are important to control infection. In [51], the authors have shown that the non-structural proteins of the hepatitis-C virus could generate HCV-specific broad-spectrum T-cell responses. Non-structural proteins have been used by [52] for vaccine design against Usutu Virus. Also, as targets for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines, the non-structural proteins of HIV-1 were shown to be quite important [53]. Moreover, Ong et al. [25] have predicted NSP3 in SARS-CoV-2 to produce high protective antigenicity. Thus, we can hypothesize that apart from structural proteins non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be possible targets as well for vaccine design which may induce cell-mediated or humoral immunity that is necessary to prevent viral invasion and/or replication."}, {"section_title": "Identification of MHC-I restricted T-cell epitopes ::: Results and discussions", "text": "For epitope prediction from the 23 CCnRs, the associated protein sequences are used as inputs to the prediction tools.

Such filtering resulted in 23 CCnRs covering NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, 3CL-Proteinase, NSP10, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, Helicase, Spike glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. This ranking also resulted in 34 MHC-I and 37 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 16 and 19 unique HLA alleles and 29 B-cell epitopes for the 23 CCnRs. These CCnRs are then ranked based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores to identify the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell and B-cell epitopes. This ranking identified CCnR from NSP3 coded protein to be highly immunogenic and antigenic, providing MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell and B-cell epitopes, FLKKDAPYI, ITFLKKDAPYIVGDV, TLVSDIDITFLKKDAP as most immunogenic and TAVVIPTKK, IDITFLKKDAPYIVG, LHPDSATLVSDIDITF as most antigenic respectively. These epitopes can be considered for designing of synthetic vaccines. Furthermore, to validate the relevance of these epitopes, their binding confirmation and physico-chemical properties are also shown with respect to HLA alleles. This study thus provides the potential MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell and B-cell epitopes to design epitope-based synthetic vaccines."}, {"section_title": "Ethics approval and consent to participate", "text": "The ethical approval or individual consent was not applicable."}, {"section_title": "Availability of data and materials", "text": "The aligned 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes with reference as well as consensus sequences and the final results of this work are available at \u201chttp://www.nitttrkol.ac.in/indrajit/projects/COVID-EpitopeVaccine-India/\u201d.
