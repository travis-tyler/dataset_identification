Some stakeholders have suggested that collecting information on graduates' employment outcomes-whether they are employed in their field of study, for example-will provide better information to help assess the impact of a postsecondary education. The Higher Education Opportunity Act directed GAO to study the information that states have on the employment outcomes of postsecondary graduates. This report describes (1) the extent and purposes for which states collect employment-related information and the challenges they faced in doing so, (2) potential approaches to expanding states' collection efforts across states and nationwide, and (3) how selected states and schools collaborate with employers to align education and workforce needs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant research and interviewed officials from the U.S. Departments of Education (Education) and Labor, as well as postsecondary institutions, state agencies, and employers in seven states and two countries selected based on their data collection capabilities."}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "text": "GAO recommends that Education clarify means by which states can collect and share graduates' employment information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and establish a time frame for doing so. Education agreed with the recommendation."}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "text": "Twenty-six states collect some employment-related data, such as data on salary and industry, on individual postsecondary graduates by linking student databases with states' labor data, according to a national 2010 study of state education databases. Officials in seven states GAO contacted reported using graduates' employment data for a variety of purposes, including economic development and institutional feedback. For example, one state reported using the data to compile information on the educational level of the local workforce to accommodate an out-of-state employer interested in opening offices in that area. However, some stakeholders cautioned against potentially inappropriate uses of the data, such as holding institutions accountable for the employment outcomes of graduates, noting that such outcomes are often beyond schools' control. Additionally, some state officials said that they faced challenges in their data collection efforts, including the means by which they can appropriately link student and employment data and comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits disclosing a student's education records without written consent. Education officials acknowledged that confusion exists among some states and said they are planning to provide further guidance through various means, but as of September 2010, these plans had not been implemented. A review of relevant literature and interviews with state officials and experts helped identify three potential approaches for expanding the collection of graduates' employment data, but many stakeholders emphasized the need to decide upon the specific purposes of the system prior to creating it. Possible approaches include expanding direct state-to-state data sharing, using a third party to expand interstate data sharing, and expanding existing national education-related surveys. An advantage of state-to-state data sharing is to follow individual students who go to school in one state and get a job in another. However, many stakeholders noted that sharing student data across states raises privacy concerns under FERPA, much like sharing data across different agencies within the state. In Australia and the United Kingdom, postsecondary institutions conduct national surveys of all recent graduates to obtain employment and other outcome information. States and schools that GAO contacted collaborate with employers to align education and workforce needs in several ways, including through workforce investment boards, advisory committees, and employer surveys. The extent of school efforts to partner with employers varied depending on the mission and goals of the institution, with community colleges and vocational schoolswith their emphasis on career and technical training-making greater use than 4-year schools of advisory committees. For example, a private, nonprofit technical school in one state has an advisory committee for each program that drives the curriculum for that program. On the basis of employer input, the school discontinued its auto body program because of a lack of opportunities and began networking with employers to identify programs in new areas.

This report addresses the following questions: 1 To determine the extent to which states collect employment information on postsecondary graduates and the methods used to collect such information, we reviewed relevant research and studies, and consulted with subject matter experts. We reviewed information from a 2007 report by the Lumina Foundation 3 and a 2010 report by the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO), 4 to obtain information on the extent to which states are collecting employment-related and other outcome information on postsecondary education graduates, and how states obtain such information. In addition, to further understand how states collect, use, and display graduates' employment-related information, we selected seven states-Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, North Dakota, and Washington-for a combination of site visits and telephone interviews. These states were selected to reflect a geographically diverse set of states with a range of abilities to collect student and employment information. Within each selected state, we interviewed officials from the departments of higher education and labor; representatives from selected public, private, and for-profit postsecondary institutions, such as 2-year and 4-year colleges; and one or more employers. Our findings from these states are for illustrative purposes only and are not generalizable nationally. Additionally, while we asked states about what they did to validate the data they collect on students, we did not use data collected by states to substantiate any of our findings. To identify the potential approaches and challenges for expanding efforts to collect graduates' employment information, we focused on the states' efforts to share data both internally and with other states. 5 We also interviewed officials from federal and state education and labor departments, experts in the areas of state student data systems and postsecondary education, as well as representatives from postsecondary education organizations and institutions. We also examined postsecondary data collection systems of two selected countries-Australia and the United Kingdom-to obtain an international perspective (see app. IV). We selected these countries primarily on the basis of expert recommendations about countries known to be active in collecting outcome data on postsecondary graduates and preparing graduates for the workforce. In addition, we reviewed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which includes requirements related to the use and disclosure of data on individual students. 6 To determine how selected states, schools, and employers identify and address workforce needs, we interviewed subject matter experts and officials in our seven selected states, including members of local workforce organizations and employers, and reviewed relevant provisions of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. 7 We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions 5 We focused on state rather than federal efforts because the HEOA provided generally that nothing in the Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes the U.S. Department of Education to create a federal unit record system to track individual college students. Sec. 113, \u00a7 134, 122 Stat. 3110-11 (codified at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1015c based on our audit objectives. Appendix I discusses our scope and methodology in further detail. A growing number of states are recognizing the potential of collecting data at the state level to inform changes in policy and practice that can lead to improved educational outcomes for students. State-level student unit record (SUR) data systems are one example of how individual students can be tracked over time-often called longitudinal data systems-as they move through the education system. In each state, a number of separate SUR data systems containing individually identified student data may exist at all levels of the education system. For example, a state may have multiple SUR systems that capture information on each student's educational data from kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12), with each school or school district maintaining its own SUR database, and other SUR systems that capture information on students at postsecondary institutions. Other state data systems capture information on people employed in the state. However, these systems historically have not been integrated with each other and therefore have not allowed for the tracking of students as they progress from one education level to the next and finally into the workforce. Furthermore, there is considerable variation across data systems with respect to the data elements collected. The focus of this report is on state-level SUR data systems containing postsecondary data that other research has found are generally maintained by the state's department of higher education or a similar agency that coordinates postsecondary education efforts."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The types of student data maintained in postsecondary SUR data systems include the following: \u2022 basic demographic and enrollment data such as name, gender, ethnicity, major, degree granted, and academic history and \u2022 financial aid information such as family income, expected family contribution, and financial assistance from state, federal, and other sources. At the time of our review, several federal initiatives were under way that promoted the linkage of education to employment databases. One such initiative is Education's Grant Program for Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS), authorized by the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002, 9 through which Education awards competitive grants to states for the development of longitudinal data systems based on individual student records. While the grants initially focused on integrating the various K-12 systems maintained by schools and school districts, the focus has recently shifted to following students from prekindergarten through postsecondary education and into the workforce. In fiscal year 2010, Education awarded $250 million in SLDS grants to 20 states. Another initiative is the Department of Labor's (Labor) Workforce Data Quality Initiative, which supports the development of longitudinal data systems that integrate education and workforce data using funds provided under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. 10 Labor announced the availability of approximately $12.2 million to fund these competitive grants, for which applications were due by August 2010. In establishing data linkages among agencies and sharing data from a student's education records, entities must be aware of and comply with FERPA, which generally affords parents and eligible students access to student education records while limiting the disclosure of those records to 8 In prior reports, we found that there is a 6-to 9-month lag between the time employers report UI data and states update their UI wage records. See GAO-04-657, Workforce  L. No. 107-279, \u00a7 208, 116 Stat. 1940, 1981 third parties. 11 Specifically, FERPA requires educational agencies and institutions that receive Education funds-such as schools, school districts, colleges, and universities-to provide parents and eligible students with access to education records and generally prohibits the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records without the prior written consent of the parent or eligible student, unless an exception to the FERPA general consent requirement applies. One exception to the general consent requirement in FERPA permits educational agencies and institutions to disclose, without consent, personally identifiable information from students' education records to state and local educational authorities for the purpose of an audit or evaluation of federal-or state-supported education programs, or for the enforcement of or compliance with federal legal requirements that relate to those programs. 12 Representatives of state and local educational authorities-such as a state educational agency-may nonconsensually redisclose personally identifiable information from students' education records on behalf of the educational agency or institution in accordance with the redisclosure requirements of FERPA. 13 That is, the redisclosure must meet the statutory and regulatory exceptions to consent in FERPA. Accordingly, Education has interpreted FERPA to permit an educational authority to redisclose personally identifiable information from education records to another educational authority if the latter entity has the legal authority to audit or evaluate the federal-or state-supported education program of the educational agency or institution that disclosed the education records in the first place. 14 11 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g. In addition, the rights under FERPA, including the right to access student education records, transfer from the parent to the student when the student becomes an eligible student. An eligible student is a student who has turned 18 years old or attends a postsecondary institution at any age. 12 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(3 According to SHEEO, 5 states do not have a SUR database: Delaware, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, and New Hampshire, and 1 state (Iowa) had limitations to its data system and enrollment numbers that precluded it from being included in the SHEEO report. Further, some states have multiple SUR databases, but for purposes of this report, we use states rather than individual data systems as the unit of analysis.   Note: According to SHEEO, Iowa had limitations to its data system and enrollment numbers that precluded it from being included in the report. Further, according to the SHEEO report, most of the state postsecondary data systems include information on public institutions within the state. 16 Of the 26 states with postsecondary data systems that linked to employment data, 24 collect data from both public 2-and 4-year institutions and the other 2 states collect data only from public 4-year institutions. Furthermore, 8 of the 26 states collect data from independent, nonprofit institutions, and 5 collect data from for-profit institutions. The types of employment-related data collected by the 26 states that link student data with labor data include the following: \u2022 whether graduates were employed in-state, \u2022 wages earned, \u2022 employer name, and \u2022 industry of employment. Of the 7 states we selected for review, 6 have one or more SUR data systems containing postsecondary data, and 4 states linked those data systems to labor data to capture employment information on graduates. Florida state education officials reported that they also link their postsecondary data system to federal databases such as those maintained by the U.S. Postal Service, Office of Personnel Management, and Department of Defense to obtain employment data on federal employees. Since UI wage records do not capture information for federal employees, this capability allows Florida officials to obtain employment information on postsecondary graduates who are employed by the federal government. Some of the specific education and employment data elements collected on postsecondary graduates by the selected states include individual students' courses of study during college, job obtained within a particular industry, their salary once they were employed, and the type of financial assistance they received while in college (see table 1). 16 State profiles from the SHEEO report indicated that of the 45 states with postsecondary SUR databases, 42 collect data from both public 2-and 4-year institutions and the other 3 states collect data only from public 4-year institutions. Furthermore, 19 states collect data from independent, nonprofit institutions, and 7 collect data from for-profit institutions.  Source: GAO analysis of data capabilities of selected states and the following data elements specified in HEOA mandate: type of job obtained, whether job was related to course of study, starting salary, student's satisfaction with his or her preparation for job, guidance provided with respect to securing job, and type of assistance received for recipients of federal student aid. a While Connecticut does not link its postsecondary SUR data system to UI wage records, a state labor official said that the state has linked postsecondary data provided directly from public postsecondary institutions to UI wage data to capture certain labor elements required for annual reporting requirements. In contrast, we found that occupational information was generally not available in states' labor systems, in part because their UI wage records often do not capture this information. Such information can indicate whether an individual got a job in a field related to his or her course of study during school. The UI wage records maintained by states commonly contain data that identify the industry-such as health care or retail-that employed individuals, but according to Labor, state labor agencies generally do not require employers to identify occupations in a way that would reflect the type of job-such as nurse or cashier. An industry code would indicate, for example, that a graduate with a nursing degree or certificate is employed in the health care industry but not whether the graduate is employed as a nurse or an administrative assistant. Several state officials and experts we spoke with believed that collecting the occupation code from employers would be valuable. However, some also acknowledged that this would require burdensome and costly system changes for both states and employers. One official in Connecticut estimated that it would initially cost the state approximately $800,000 to add occupation codes to its unemployment insurance data system, and about $400,000 each year thereafter. Our selected states also reported that they were not able to use their data systems to gauge students' satisfaction with the preparation they received for the job obtained. Instead, student satisfaction information was usually collected through surveys administered by postsecondary institutions. For example, state officials and representatives at some institutions we interviewed said that student satisfaction surveys were typically conducted by for-profit institutions and certain professional programs at 4year universities in the state because these schools were required to collect outcome information, such as placement rates, in order to satisfy national accreditation requirements. Federal grant funds could result in further changes to states' systems for capturing employment information on graduates. All 7 states we contacted had received federal SLDS grants from Education, and some have used or planned to use these grants in part to develop student data systems, or expand their efforts to capture employment data using existing SUR data systems, according to state officials. For example, Colorado, which had a SUR data system containing postsecondary data but was not capturing any employment data from its UI wage record system, had established in 2009 a Government Data Advisory Board to oversee, among other things, the development of a comprehensive data system that would allow data to be collected on students from prekindergarten through their entry into the workforce. According to officials in Michigan, which had no postsecondary SUR database in place, the state planned to use the grant to develop a data system that linked K-12, postsecondary, and workforce data."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education", "text": "Selected states reported using graduates' employment-related data for a variety of purposes: \u2022 Promote economic development. One official in Florida mentioned that the state workforce agency used the data to compile information on the educational level of the local workforce population at the request of an out-of-state employer that was interested in opening offices in that area. State workforce officials in Indiana also said that they use the student unit record database to inform prospective employers about the educational attainment of local postsecondary graduates, their geographic location within the state, and whether these graduates are still seeking employment. Officials in North Dakota's Department of Commerce said that they combine graduates' employment information with labor market information to determine the extent to which graduates are prepared for employment in high-growth industries. \u2022 Provide institutional feedback. North Dakota used the database to provide feedback to institutions. Using the data, the state compiled reports on the total number of degrees awarded, by institution, and whether graduates who earned those degrees were employed in-state. Indiana used its database to approve a master of liberal arts program at a particular campus. To do so, the state analyzed employment outcomes of graduates of a similar liberal arts program at other campuses and determined that these individuals were more likely to be employed in-state and have higher earnings after completing their degree."}, {"section_title": "How Australia and the United Kingdom Use and Display Graduates' Employment Information", "text": "Government officials we spoke with in Australia reported using education and employment information-collected through their Australian Graduate Survey-in a variety of ways. One way is to use the information as an accountability tool for overseeing universities that receive monetary incentives through a performance fund that is partly based on survey results. Australia also collects employment-related information on vocational education graduates and uses data collected at the time of enrollment and completion to determine how many students are trained in specific occupations, evaluate performance of training providers, and allocate funding, among other purposes. In the United Kingdom, employment information is also obtained through surveys of university and college graduates, which are used to help rank these institutions. Both countries make survey results publicly available through the Web sites of agencies that administer the surveys. For example, Australia publishes five annual reports based on information collected through the graduate surveys and made available online through the agency's Web site. These reports provide information on graduates such as earnings and course experiences. Prospective students can also use an online tool to view employment information on vocational schools, and can query the data through this tool to customize the data to their needs. \u2022 Raise consumer awareness. To better inform prospective students, some states that collect employment information reported that they make aggregate data and annual reports on graduates' employment publicly available, generally through their state Web site. For example, according to a state education official in Florida, the state higher education agency publishes an annual outcomes report that provides information on numbers of graduates, average salary, and whether they are working in-state. This report provides aggregate employment information on graduates and is publicly available on the state's Web site. Furthermore, some institutions we contacted, including for-profit and 4-year schools, also reported providing outcome information on the school's or state's Web site such as placement rates and average salary. However, some stakeholders cautioned against what they considered to be potentially inappropriate uses of the data. Stakeholders raised concerns that employment outcomes that are beyond a school's control should not be used as a basis for assessing the quality of the education provided by the school or adequacy of preparing students for employment. For example, several postsecondary institution representatives in Michigan mentioned that many external factors such as the local economy are not captured by data systems even though they might influence whether graduates can successfully obtain employment. In addition, stakeholders were also concerned that employment outcome data may not be comparable from one institution to another, depending on how specific data elements are defined, such as job placement rate. Finally, representatives from several 4-year institutions and higher education associations noted that there are other reasons students choose to go to college besides employment, including enhancing skills and engaging in lifelong learning. Some state officials and other stakeholders we interviewed said that states' varying interpretations of FERPA have caused confusion, with one national stakeholder adding that the stakeholder has called upon Education to clarify FERPA so that states understand how they can link education and employment data. Education officials acknowledged that despite the agency's issuance of FERPA regulations in December 9, 2008, confusion remains among states in how to interpret FERPA's redisclosure provisions for sharing education data with noneducation entities. 20 Education officials said that they were taking steps to clarify how states can develop and use data in statewide longitudinal data systems consistent with FERPA. As previously discussed, many states are developing or enhancing statewide systems under Education's Grant Program for Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, which supports data integration including education and workforce information. Education officials specifically said they were planning to improve the guidance and technical assistance available to education data stakeholders through activities that include issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; creating a Chief Privacy Officer position within Education; releasing technical briefs related to data security, confidentiality, and privacy; and launching a Privacy Technical Assistance Center. As of September 2010, Education said it was engaged in implementing these actions, with a timeline for completion expected to occur during fall 2010 and early winter 2011. At the time of this report, Education had not provided information on whether its guidance would specifically address linking education and employment data. In addition, several state officials we spoke with were also challenged by trying to collect information on graduates who obtain employment outside of their state. Specifically, some state officials reported that existing postsecondary data systems are able to track students within the boundaries of a given state, but they have been rarely used to track students across state lines, in part based on the lack of common data elements, standardized definitions, and interoperable data systems. On the basis of our review of relevant literature and interviews with numerous state officials and subject matter experts, we identified several potential approaches for expanding the collection of postsecondary graduates' employment information on a broad level, such as across states or nationwide. These include direct state-to-state or regional data-sharing arrangements, using third parties to assist state efforts in a variety of ways, and expanded national surveys that collect employment-related data. 21 Each approach presents challenges. Regardless of how collection efforts might expand, many state officials and other stakeholders we spoke to emphasized the importance of having a clear understanding of the specific policy questions that the data system should address prior to creating it. For example, state officials in Colorado noted that when the policy questions are known, it makes determining the required data elements needed to answer those questions easier and can decrease unnecessary data collection and costs."}, {"section_title": "Several Potential Approaches Exist for Expanding the Collection of Graduates' Employment Data", "text": "Expanding Direct State-to-State Data Sharing One approach to expanding collection efforts is for states to directly share postsecondary graduates' employment data with each other, which can be done through data-sharing agreements. This approach allows states to expand their data on graduates' subsequent employment and allows analysis at the individual student or postsecondary institution level. 22 One example of the use of this approach is the data-sharing agreement between the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges and Oregon's labor agency to provide UI wage data from the latter state. Board officials said this agreement allows the board to follow the employment progress of students who graduate from community and technical colleges in Washington and find a job in Oregon. This additional employment information has enabled Washington to better evaluate the education students received, since it has more data to determine whether Washington community college graduates are working in the field in which they were trained. The SHEEO report noted that only three statewide postsecondary data systems shared data with other states. Several key challenges that affect interstate data-sharing agreements are similar to those associated with sharing data across agencies in the same state, including privacy concerns under FERPA, the lack of standardization of certain data elements, and coordinating ownership and allowable uses of the data, as well as other matters, sometimes referred to generally as governance issues. However, these challenges can be more complex when they arise across different states rather than within the same state. Education's current FERPA regulations do not explicitly address linking data between agencies of different states, so state officials told us they lack sufficient guidance on how data can be shared between states in a way that is consistent with the requirements of FERPA. Further, according to one stakeholder, many states have their own privacy laws in addition to FERPA, and this can create additional challenges for sharing data across states. Nonetheless, several national postsecondary education organizations have indicated that interstate data exchanges could be handled consistent with the requirements of FERPA if certain guidelines are followed, such as having state legislatures specifically authorize state agencies to create the exchanges. A second challenge is the lack of standard data elements among states that may use a different coding system: Even when a state's own agencies have agreed on what data to share with each other and how to standardize the coding, those same kinds of issues must be resolved again by agencies sharing data across states. Another challenge to sharing data across states involves governance issues such as who owns the data, who has the right to use them, and how data quality is managed and assured. Washington's approach to complying with FERPA--in seeking information on the employment of college graduates that had moved to a neighboring state, Oregon--entailed close supervision of the data and data-linking process. To maintain complete control over the student records and matching process, a staff member from one of the educational authorities in Washington will drive to the Oregon Employment Security Department and personally oversee the match and deliver the data back to the Washington board, according to a Washington state board official. The official said that the current agreement would comply with FERPA requirements. The official also noted that Washington will no longer obtain data from Idaho and Montana, as it had through separate agreements in the past, because it would take too much time to drive to those locations to conduct the match and the current procedure requires personal oversight of the matching process."}, {"section_title": "Using a Third Party to Help Expand Interstate Data Sharing", "text": "A second potential approach for expanding data collection may be to have third parties help, by coordinating interstate data sharing, or by warehousing the relevant data from institutions or states. This involves having states select one or more unrelated entities to serve various functions such as facilitating data-sharing agreements and analyzing or warehousing data. Similar to the first approach, this approach allows states to follow students across state lines and analyze outcomes at student and institution levels; however, it also presents FERPA and other challenges. 23 In 2007, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia used the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, a private nonprofit organization, to facilitate a data exchange designed to help the states examine postsecondary student mobility across their borders. 24 Serving as a third party \"broker,\" the center created exchange agreements with each state individually to resolve governance issues such as how the data would be shared and used. The states also used an independent \"administrator\" that received data from each state, matched data across states, and constructed database tables based on the designated data elements. A third party, according to officials from the center, can also develop standard datasharing methodology that can be applied to multiple states. Another example of using a third party approach for sharing data is Labor's Wage Record Interchange System (WRIS). The WRIS facilitates the exchange of wage data among participating states for the purpose of assessing and reporting on employment and training under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, among other purposes. States voluntarily participate in the WRIS, which acts like a third party by using the WRIS Clearinghouse to exchange wage data. According to Labor officials, the WRIS permits state workforce agencies to obtain wage data of individuals 23 Using a third party administrator can also help states avoid giving one state access to other states' records. Accessing another state's records can raise FERPA issues, according to documentation from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems. However, a third party that has education records, such as a contractor, must comply with FERPA with regard to any nonconsensual redisclosures of that information. Education had not issued any guidance on whether third parties may be utilized to facilitate the exchange of education records and employment records at the time of this review. who have participated in workforce investment programs in one state, then subsequently taken a job in another. By participating in the WRIS, states can have a more robust picture of the effectiveness of their workforce investment programs, and are able to report more comprehensive outcomes against their performance measures, according to Labor documentation. 25 In addition to performing these coordination and administrative functions, a third party could serve as a warehouse, maintaining all or some of the data content submitted by other databases, such as those maintained by state agencies' SUR databases or postsecondary institutions. Stakeholders suggested, for example, that the National Student Clearinghouse, a nonprofit institution that verifies student enrollment and other records on behalf of postsecondary institutions, could serve as a third party warehouse of a system that would expand current collection efforts. 26 The Clearinghouse maintains enrollment data on over 92 percent of all postsecondary students, obtained directly from institutions, including public, private, and proprietary institutions, according to Clearinghouse officials. However, these data would still need to be linked to state department of labor wage records in order to furnish employment information on graduates. Clearinghouse representatives responded to this idea by emphasizing that all the parties, including the postsecondary institutions themselves, would have to agree to the arrangement, since local postsecondary institutions own any data that would be provided to the Clearinghouse. One challenge associated with the third party approach that some officials raised is how to pay for the third party, in addition to some of the same challenges with the state-to-state approach, including FERPA compliance and governance challenges, like data ownership. Recent data-sharing discussions among Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington highlight 25 The WRIS does not allow for the sharing of aggregate wage record results obtained through WRIS to third party entities, such as state education agencies. However, a proposal before the WRIS Advisory Group would allow states to participate in a process to share aggregate wage record results with education agencies to obtain information on behalf of workforce and economic development partner public agencies. Labor officials emphasized that participation by any state in such a process would be on an entirely voluntary basis. governance issues in the third party context. Those states have initiated an effort to develop a \"prototype\" multistate data exchange to follow students from K-12 through employment, according to an official from the third party coordinating the effort, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. 27 In addition to data ownership, use, and quality, those states have discussed other governance challenges: \u2022 How would the data system be organized (e.g., would the data reside with a third party)? \u2022 How can the states establish a governance board in a cost-effective way, who should sit that board, what kind of authority for that board is needed (such as individual state legislation), and what kind of agreements are needed? \u2022 How can the parties be motivated to continue working together, particularly in the event the shared data make some states appear better than others? Likewise, states would have to resolve how to analyze results once the data system is in place. The commission's report on this data exchange effort highlighted the magnitude of governance challenges, noting that the time and effort needed to establish governance rules for data exchange systems generally will likely be significantly greater than the time and effort needed to actually match the data from one state's database to another. A third potential approach for collecting more employment-related data on a larger number of postsecondary graduates is to expand existing national surveys. 28  In Australia, the primary mechanism to obtain employment outcome information on recent graduates of the country's 4-year universities and vocational education sector is a survey of all such graduates, according to Australian officials. Universities administer the survey 4 months after graduation, and information collected includes \u2022 education (e.g., institution attended, degree earned, and major field of study), \u2022 satisfaction with the quality of graduates' educational experience, and \u2022 employment (e.g., employment status, job type, relation to course of study, and annual salary). Similarly, the United Kingdom obtains outcome information from graduates of universities on whether they are employed, are taking part in further study, or are not available for employment; the type of industry they are working in; and their salary. See appendix IV for details of the information collected in these two countries. \u2022 Ten years after college, what percentage of graduates work full-time at one job? \u2022 What percentage of recent graduates view their job as the start of a career? \u2022 What is the unemployment rate among college graduates 1 year after graduation? Additionally, officials we interviewed at one university mentioned that one private survey, conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, already provides information on average salaries of recent 28 We also spoke with a few employers and national associations representing employers or for-profit institutions about surveying employers online to obtain information on employer satisfaction with graduates they hire. They said that they would be willing to complete this type of survey if it would provide them with benefits such as access to aggregated information about graduates' institutions of postsecondary education attended, degrees, or starting pay. However, one association official stated that access to this information might not be enough of an incentive to compel employers to complete the online survey. graduates and has information categorized by major and institution. 29 One major advantage of surveys is that because students themselves provide the information, FERPA compliance is not an issue. However, existing surveys have limitations. For example, surveys that are able to bridge postsecondary education and employment, like the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, are compiled infrequently: That study has followed groups of students who graduated in 1993 and 2000, and data collection is under way for a third group of 2008 graduates. Further, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study is representative for graduating seniors nationally and across all majors, but is not representative of any given state or institution, precluding analyses at those levels. 30 A few stakeholders also said that because surveys rely on self-reported information, they might be less reliable than other data sources. Other stakeholders noted that surveys sometimes have low response rates, and results might have significant lag time between data collection and data publication, and incur costs each time a survey is administered. (See table 2 for a summary of the various approaches.) 29 The National Association of Colleges and Employers Salary Survey compiles data from career planning and placement offices of colleges and universities across the United States. The reports consist of starting salary offers made to new graduates by employing organizations in business, industry, and government, and by nonprofit and educational institutions. The figures reported are for base salaries only and do not include bonuses, fringe benefits, or overtime rates. The Salary Survey reports offers, not acceptances. It does not distinguish between single and multiple offers to individual students and, consequently, offers reported by the study cannot be equated with actual hires. 30 Additionally, the survey may not be representative of all majors in follow-up surveys. \u2022 Could provide more information than could be obtained using only the UI wage records linked to SUR data, because UI wage records generally contain only whether a person is employed, the salary, employer name, and industry of employment \u2022 Low response rate and time delay between conducting survey and survey results can affect ability to capture current trends of overall population or generalize findings to all postsecondary graduates \u2022 Self-reported data may be less reliable than linked SUR and UI information \u2022 Paying for the survey, which incurs costs every time it is administered State and local workforce officials and postsecondary school representatives we interviewed said they collaborate with employers in various ways to keep abreast of workforce needs. At the state and local levels, these partnerships were generally facilitated through workforce investment boards established under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, 31 or in some cases by the state's department of labor, though other means were also used to cultivate ties with employers. Workforce officials in some states said that local workforce investment boards use the state workforce agency's labor market analysis to project high-growth occupations by industry in order to align education and training programs with employers' anticipated needs. To promote partnerships with industry, Florida set up steering committees guided by local chamber of commerce and business leaders and embedded 13 centers-known as Banner Centers-at selected postsecondary institutions to promote coordination among local economic developers, employers, and schools. In Washington, the state workforce investment board, in conjunction with the state board representing public and private postsecondary schools, conducts an assessment every 2 years of the education and training credentials required to meet employer demand. The 2009 assessment showed that the largest gaps between supply and demand were in engineering, computer science, and the medical professions. It noted that the education system will need to expand in these fields to meet employer demand as would the number of students who are interested in and prepared for pursuing careers in these fields. Washington plans to survey employers as part of all subsequent assessments. In North Dakota, the oil and gas industry collaborated with the state workforce development office to assess the industry's workforce needs in light of a projected shortage of qualified workers in the state's labor pool. The industry's trade association partnered with the state to help identify skills needed-such as well drilling-and the state college designed a program around those skills. Another state college created a power plant technology program in response to industry demand for qualified power plant operators and hired one of the employer's retirees to head up the program, given his substantial experience in the industry. In turn, the industry contributed funding and equipment, such as simulators, for the classroom. North Dakota plans to conduct similar assessments for other industries, such as information technology and manufacturing, to help ensure that employers have access to a skilled labor pool. At the school level, the vast majority of the postsecondary schools we contacted relied on program advisory committees or informal discussions to obtain employer input in designing or updating academic programs. 32 For more information on how community colleges collaborate with the workforce investment system to develop career and technical training programs that meet industry needs, see GAO, Workforce Development: Community Colleges and One-Stop Centers Collaborate to Meet 21st Century Workforce Needs, GAO-08-547 (Washington, D.C.: May 15, 2008). Fourteen of the 25 schools also surveyed employers in part to determine skills sought and satisfaction with recently hired graduates. Such collaboration often occurred at community colleges and for-profit vocational schools, given their focus on career and technical training, compared with 4-year schools whose stated mission is to provide a broad, comprehensive education. Nevertheless, officials from one 4-year university in Colorado said that certain programs, such as engineering, used advisory boards to inform program design, while at another university, in Washington, all of its degree programs had advisory boards to ensure classes were relevant to employer needs. \u2022 Advisory committees. Twenty-one of 25 postsecondary schools we contacted reported using advisory committees, which include business and industry leaders, to plan and develop their programs and curricula. 33 A 4-year public school in Michigan has an employer advisory board consisting of 15 major corporations that advise the entire school and not just individual academic departments. At a private, nonprofit technical school in Washington, there is an advisory committee for each program that drives the curriculum for that program. On the basis of employer input, for example, the school discontinued its auto body program because of a lack of sufficient job opportunities and began networking with potential new employers. A for-profit school in Michigan meets with its advisory committees each year, in part to ensure that technology being used in the classroom is up to date. \u2022 Informal communication. Twelve of the 25 schools we contacted said they cultivated ties with employers through informal communication. Schools maintained open lines of communication, for example, through luncheons with local business leaders to solicit feedback on the school and its graduates. The faculty of one community college in Indiana has built individual relationships with local businesses and meets directly with them. Fostering close relationships with employers enabled the faculty to incorporate employer needs into the classroom while helping students understand how classroom learning can be applied to the work world. In addition, several employers we spoke with said they had a good working relationship with schools, enabling them to provide school administrators with informal feedback on the quality of graduates they hired and whether the curriculum needed to be adjusted to meet employer needs."}, {"section_title": "School and Employer Partnerships in Australia and the United Kingdom", "text": "One university in Australia that offers vocational education categorizes its courses according to the specific industry. It then seeks input from industry representatives to inform the programs and to keep apprised of emerging skill needs. Another university obtains employer feedback on the curriculum and faculty of its biomedical and science programs, and also surveys employers on the quality of university graduates hired. An administrator at a university in the United Kingdom told us that 6-8 employers serve as members of the school's governing committee, and as many as 120 employers participate in an employer group that advises the school's career services office. The university also surveys employers and uses other means to gauge their satisfaction with graduates hired. \u2022 Employer and graduate surveys. Surveying employers was a commonly used method among schools to determine what skills employers sought and employers' perception of how adequately recently hired graduates were prepared. In Indiana, a for-profit school surveyed its graduates to gauge how satisfied they were with the guidance they had received in preparing for and obtaining employment, while a community college surveyed graduates on how beneficial their coursework had been in helping them prepare to enter the job market. A community college in Indiana developed a workplace readiness certificate after survey results showed that employers' biggest demand was that graduates possess soft skills-the nontechnical skills and traits needed to function in a job, such as punctuality, teamwork, and work ethic. A for-profit school also in Indiana said it offers remedial training for graduates if employers are dissatisfied with their skills. Some community college officials said that once employer input is obtained, the colleges can adjust their curricula and add new training or degree programs very quickly (e.g., anywhere from under 2 months to 1 year) to respond to employer needs. For example, officials at a community college in Indiana said they developed a new industrial technology program that met employers' needs for courses in advanced manufacturing. In contrast, officials at a 4-year school said that faculty, particularly if they are tenured, can be resistant to changing their program because their focus is on teaching rather than on the quality of jobs their graduates obtain. In an era of increasing focus on educational accountability and on U.S. competitiveness in a global economy, there are many merits to collecting employment data on postsecondary graduates and expanding on existing state data collection efforts. For example, collecting employment information on students that moved out of state could help close a knowledge gap when they obtain employment in another state. Some state officials and subject matter experts agree that such enhanced information could provide a more comprehensive picture, across states, of what happens to graduates when they enter the workforce, shedding light on the outcomes of education programs. A system that provides detailed Conclusions information on the percentage of a school's graduates that land jobs, average starting salary, and whether they are employed in another state could also raise consumer awareness about education and employment outcomes, as long as this information is made public, for example, by posting the information on the state's or school's Web site. Just over half of the states collect employment information on their postsecondary graduates, and while there could be significant advantages in expanding current data collection efforts, there are also several inherent challenges in doing so. In particular, many states are unsure about how to collect and share the information while still protecting student privacy under FERPA. Education is planning to take several steps to clarify FERPA guidance and provide technical assistance. These are positive steps toward improving guidance, but it is not clear when the guidance will be available and whether it will specifically address states' concerns regarding how to develop or broaden their existing data collection systems in accordance with FERPA. Developing such guidance is important to addressing ongoing confusion and is particularly needed in view of federal grants that require states to specify how they will link their education and employment systems. Until such guidance is in place, the full potential of collecting longitudinal data within and across multiple states, while still ensuring necessary privacy protections, cannot be realized. To help address states' information needs, we recommend that the Secretary of Education develop and disseminate guidance that clarifies the means by which state education agencies can share student records to facilitate obtaining graduates' employment information while ensuring appropriate privacy protection under FERPA. In addition to establishing a time frame for implementation, this guidance should include how student records could be shared with state labor agencies, and how states can share data with one another. We provided a draft of this report to officials at the Departments of Labor and Education for their review and comment. Labor had no comments. Education provided a response, which is included as appendix V of this report, and technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. In its comments, Education agreed with our recommendation and noted that it has started several initiatives that are in various stages of action. Specifically, Education intends to propose amendments to FERPA regulations to clarify what is permissible under FERPA. According to Education, these amendments, if adopted, would clarify how states can effectively develop and use data in statewide longitudinal data systems"}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "text": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation while ensuring protection of individual privacy under FERPA. Education also stated it was creating a Chief Privacy Officer position and establishing a Privacy Technical Assistance Center to serve as a one-stop shop for state educational agencies and others for questions related to protecting privacy, confidentiality, and data security. In addition, Education is planning to release a new series of technical briefs on various issues related to the protection of personally identifiable information in student education records. To address the objectives of this study, we used a variety of methods. Our overall approach included a review of relevant federal laws, literature, studies, and reports, as well as interviews with state education and workforce agency officials, representatives at all types of postsecondary education institutions (i.e., vocational, 2-year, and 4-year schools that were either public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit), employers, and database and postsecondary education experts. To provide an international context for our work, we reviewed relevant reports and studies and obtained recommendations from postsecondary education experts to identify countries that collect significant information on postsecondary students and that may have strong workforce development programs in place. We judgmentally selected seven states and two countries-Australia and the United Kingdom-where we spoke with officials from relevant education and workforce agencies, as well as postsecondary institutions, to help us understand their methods of data collection and workforce development planning. In conducting our review of states and other countries, we did not conduct independent reviews of their laws, but rather relied on statements attributable to government officials from those states and countries and reliable secondary sources, such as selected researchers, subject matter experts, and employers. We also contacted two accrediting bodies for their perspectives on our work. To identify the extent to which and for what purposes states collect employment-related information on postsecondary graduates, we identified a sample of seven states for site visits and telephone interviews and, within these states, interviewed state education and labor officials to determine what information is available on the employment outcomes of college graduates and how states are capturing this information. We also met with selected postsecondary education institutions to discuss the types of outcome data they report to the state, any additional outcome information they collect for internal purposes, and the methods used to collect such information. Additionally, we asked state officials, postsecondary institution representatives, and other subject matter experts about how states and institutions collect graduates' employment outcome information, any barriers or challenges they face in doing so, how this information is displayed, and for what purposes the information is used. To select our sample of states for review, we primarily relied on recommendations from postsecondary education experts and information from an external report published in 2007 by the Lumina Foundation entitled Critical Connections: Linking States' Unit Record Systems to Track Student Progress. 1 This report is based on the results of a 50-state survey completed in 2006 by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems that identifies the states that have postsecondary student unit record databases, the ability of these databases to link to employment-related data systems such as states' unemployment insurance wage records, and other data sources such as military records, federal employment data, and department of social services data, that provide employment outcome information. On the basis of a review of the Lumina Foundation report's state survey results, we grouped the states into the following four categories according to their data system capabilities: (1) Advanced data capabilities. States in this category had an operational student unit record data system for postsecondary students, experience linking student data to unemployment insurance wage records, and experience linking student data to additional sources that provide employment outcome information. (2) Emerging data capabilities. States in this category had an operational student unit record data system for postsecondary students and experience linking student data to unemployment insurance wage records, but did not have experience linking student data to other additional sources that provide employment outcome information. (3) Minimal capability. States in this category had an operational student unit record data system for postsecondary students, but did not have experience linking to unemployment insurance wage records or other sources that provide employment outcome information. (4) No capabilities. States in this category did not have an operational student unit record data system. In selecting our sample of states, we also considered additional database functionality (such as including data from private and proprietary institutions), state participation in a regional data sharing agreement, and geographic and demographic diversity (e.g., rural, urban, and makeup of student population). On the basis of these considerations, we judgmentally"}]
