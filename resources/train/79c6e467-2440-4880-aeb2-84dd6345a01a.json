[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Understanding how midlife risk factors influence age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide clues to delay disease expression. Although midlife adiposity predicts increased incidence of AD, it is unclear whether it affects AAO and severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology. Using a prospective population-based cohort, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), this study aims to examine the relationships between midlife body mass index (BMI) and (1) AAO of AD (2) severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology and (3) fibrillar brain amyloid deposition during aging. We analyzed data on 1394 cognitively normal individuals at baseline (8643 visits; average follow-up interval 13.9 years), among whom 142 participants developed incident AD. In two subsamples of BLSA, 191 participants underwent autopsy and neuropathological assessment, and 75 non-demented individuals underwent brain amyloid imaging. Midlife adiposity was derived from BMI data at 50 years of age. We find that each unit increase in midlife BMI predicts earlier onset of AD by 6.7 months (P = 0.013). Higher midlife BMI was associated with greater Braak neurofibrillary but not CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) neuritic plaque scores at autopsy overall. Associations between midlife BMI and brain amyloid burden approached statistical significance. Thus, higher midlife BMI was also associated with greater fibrillar amyloid measured by global mean cortical distribution volume ratio (P = 0.075) and within the precuneus (left, P = 0.061; right, P = 0.079). In conclusion, midlife overweight predicts earlier onset of AD and greater burden of Alzheimer's neuropathology. A healthy BMI at midlife may delay the onset of AD.\nMolecular Psychiatry (2016) 21, 910-915;"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Reducing the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global public health imperative 1 and the impact of an intervention that delays the onset of AD even modestly will be enormous. For example, an intervention that delayed onset of AD by just 2 years would decrease the worldwide prevalence of the disease by an estimated 22.8 million cases in 2050. 2 In the United States alone, an intervention that offered only a 1-year delay in AD onset would result in annual savings of US$10 billion in each of the following 10 years. 3 This degree of delay in AD onset may be achieved by changes in societal behaviors such as dietary or exercise habits known to modify AD risk. 4, 5 Moreover, to achieve maximum effect, such changes should logically be instituted in midlife or earlier. However, despite the promise of altering the trajectory of AD by modifying midlife risk factors, the effect of such risk factors on the age at onset (AAO) of AD has received little attention to date.\nMidlife obesity is a risk factor for AD, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and the World Health Organization estimates that the worldwide prevalence of overweight people today is already 1.4 billion. 13 If present trends continue, this figure will increase substantially. 14 The problem is especially acute in the United States where almost 90% of American adults will be overweight by 2030. 15 Although previous studies have established that midlife obesity is associated with increased risk and age-specific incidence of AD, 7, 8, 10, 12 it is unclear how obesity and overweight at midlife may influence the AAO of AD. Equally importantly, it is not known whether midlife body mass index (BMI) affects the extent of AD neuropathology.\nWe therefore used longitudinal assessment data of older individuals (N = 1394; mean follow-up interval 13.9 years but ranging to 35.2 years) within the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) 16 to ask whether midlife adiposity was related to the AAO of incident AD. Using the neuropathological data from the autopsy cohort of the BLSA, we also examined the relationship of midlife adiposity with measures of both neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Finally, we used in vivo brain amyloid imaging with 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) to ask whether midlife adiposity was related to the magnitude of fibrillar brain amyloid burden, even in non-demented older individuals."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants", "text": "The BLSA is a prospective, ongoing cohort study of community-dwelling volunteer participants in Baltimore begun in 1958. As such, it is among the largest and longest-running longitudinal studies of aging in the United States. 16, 17 Its community-dwelling unpaid volunteer participants are predominantly White, of upper-middle socioeconomic status and with an above-average educational level. Initially limited to men, enrollment of women started in 1978. In general, at the time of entry into the study, participants had no physical or cognitive impairment. Detailed examinations, including neuropsychological assessments and neurological, laboratory and radiological evaluations, were conducted every 2 years. Since 2003, participants older than 80 years have received yearly assessments. Written informed consent was obtained at each visit, and the study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and the National Institute on Aging.\nMidlife BMI BMI at 50 years of age was used to define 'midlife BMI'. At each visit, height and weight were measured using calibrated scales by trained technicians and BMI at age 50 years was estimated for participants in the study sample using linear mixed-effects model (details described below). To avoid confounding with behavioral abnormalities associated with cognitive impairment, BMI was considered only if measured at visits before onset of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)."}, {"section_title": "AAO of AD", "text": "After each visit, cognitive status was considered at consensus diagnosis conferences using established procedures described previously, 18 relying on information from neuropsychological tests, as well as on the clinical data. Diagnoses of dementia and AD were based on DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition) 19 and the NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria, 20 respectively. Our sample included all participants who entered the BLSA from 1978 onwards when recruitment of females into the study began. We excluded participants whose last visit was before age 50 years (N = 377). We also excluded individuals with diagnoses of MCI 21 or non-AD dementia (N = 134). A total of 142 individuals received a clinical diagnosis of incident AD among the sample of 1394 participants who were followed over a mean interval of 13.9 years (sample 1 in Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Neuropathological studies", "text": "The autopsy program of the BLSA was initiated in 1986. We have previously described details of this sample. 22 Briefly, the mean age at death in the autopsy sample is 88.3 \u00b1 7.3 years (range 69.3-103.2 years), and the mean interval between last evaluation and death is 8.7 \u00b1 6.7 months. 22 As reported previously, the autopsy subsample is not significantly different from the BLSA cohort as a whole in terms of the rates of dementia and clinical stroke. 23 As of September 2009, 197 BLSA participants had undergone autopsy and neuropathological assessment following death. We excluded four African Americans and two subjects who did not have BMI measurements while they were cognitively normal. The final sample included 191 participants (sample 2 in Figure 1 ). Post-mortem brain examinations were performed by an experienced neuropathologist (JCT). Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were assessed as described previously. 24 AD pathology was assessed on silver-stained material and graded according to the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) 25 and Braak criteria. The BLSA neuroimaging study began in 1994. 27 BLSA participants were initially prioritized for admission to the neuroimaging study based on health considerations and the amount of previous cognitive data available for each individual. At enrollment, participants were free of self-reported central nervous system disease (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, bipolar illness and dementia), severe cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease requiring angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery), pulmonary disease or metastatic cancer. In vivo amyloid imaging by [ 11 C] PiB PET study was initiated in 2005 in a subset of BLSA neuroimaging substudy participants who agreed to annual neuroimaging assessments and were representative of the entire BLSA neuroimaging study with respect to baseline age, sex, race and education. 28 As of 2014, 80 participants had undergone at least one PiB PET imaging. Five participants who developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia were excluded from the current analysis, yielding 75 participants who remained cognitively normal through follow-up (sample 3 in Figure 1 ).

MPRAGE (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo) scans were conducted on a 3T Philips scanner (Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) using the following parameters: TR = 6.8 ms, TE = 3.2 ms, \u03b1 = 8\u00b0, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, 170 slices, pixel size = 1 \u00d7 1 mm 2 and slice thickness = 1.2 mm."}, {"section_title": "Image processing", "text": "Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of the MPRAGE images for regional definitions were performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (version 5.1; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), with manual editing to fix the cortical surfaces. The details have been described previously. 29 Remaining image analysis steps were carried out using an automated inhouse pipeline developed using Medical Image Processing, Analysis and Visualization software (Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) 30 and the Java Image Science Toolkit (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA). 31 The frames of the dynamic PiB PET image were aligned using rigid registration with a leastsquares cost function onto the 2-min mean of the PiB PET image. 32 For each subject, the inhomogeneity-corrected MPRAGE was rigidly registered onto the 20-min mean of the PiB PET image using normalized mutual information as cost function. 33 FreeSurfer labels were mapped onto the PiB PET space using the resulting transformation for the MPRAGE.\nParametric images of regional \u03b2-amyloid load (as given by the distribution volume ratio, or DVR) were generated using a twocompartment simplified reference tissue model. 34 The subject-specific cerebellar gray matter segmentation from FreeSurfer was used as the reference region for nonspecific radiotracer binding. 35 Mean cortical DVR and regional DVRs of the precuneus (left and right) were the principal metrics for these analyses. Mean cortical DVR is the weighted average of values for the superior, middle and inferior frontal and orbitofrontal, superior parietal, supramarginal and angular gyrus, precuneus, superior, middle and inferior occipital, superior, middle and inferior temporal, anterior, middle and posterior cingulate regions, which provides a global index of cortical fibrillar amyloid burden. Precuneus DVR was examined because this region has been reported to show the earliest accumulation of fibrillar amyloid in the preclinical stages of AD. 36 Other covariates Both sex and race were dummy coded in the analyses (male coded as 1; female coded as 0; White coded as 1; African American coded as 0). Education was coded as the 'number of years'. Cardiovascular comorbidities were computed by counting the total number of the following selfreported medical conditions: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, history of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke and transient ischemic attack. In addition, hypertension was also defined as recorded systolic blood pressure \u2a7e 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \u2a7e 90 mm Hg, diabetes as recorded fasting blood glucose \u2a7e 126 -mg dl \u2212 1 and hypercholesterolemia as recorded cholesterol \u2a7e 200 mg dl \u2212 1 . Smoking status was defined as 'non-' or 'ever' smoker. APOE genotype data was available in a subset of participants (N = 1022) and included in secondary analyses where we tested the APOE \u00d7 midlife BMI interaction and APOE main effect on the AAO of AD."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "We applied a linear mixed-effects model to the entire BLSA longitudinal sample using BMI as the dependent variable to derive BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimates) 37 of midlife BMI. Fixed effects of the model included intercept, age, age-squared and their interactions with sex and race. Random effects included intercept, age and age-squared. This model is flexible and powerful in that it allows nonlinear BMI trajectories both at the individual and population levels. Furthermore, the model uses all available BMI data, including longitudinal assessments, to derive estimates of an individual's BMI at age 50 years with the corresponding standard errors. To account for the precision of predicted midlife BMI values, we derived weights for these estimates as the inverse of square of standard errors (i.e., for ith subject the estimated weight was w i = 1/\u03c3 i 2 ) in all subsequent regression analyses. Estimated midlife BMI values with higher precision were thus given greater weights in the regression analyses. The weights depended on several factors including the number and frequency of repeat measurements, proximity of the actual measurement to age 50 years and within-individual variability relative to between-individual variability. Supplementary Figure S1 uses two BLSA participants to illustrate the relationship between number of repeated BMI measurements, proximity of the actual measurement relative to age 50 years and the estimated midlife BMI with corresponding standard errors. As our main aim was to examine the precise relationship between midlife BMI and AAO of AD, we used accelerated failure time (AFT) models from survival analyses, which allowed us to express the effects of covariates on the time to event (incident AD) in terms of an acceleration/decceleration factor. On the other hand, the most commonly used Cox proportional hazard model expresses the effects of covariates in terms of relative risk of AD. The AFT model is formulated as log T i = X i \u03b2+\u03c3\u03b5 i , where outcome T i is the time to event for ith subject, defined here as the AAO of AD ('event age') for participants with AD and age at most recent visit as 'censored age' for a normal participant. \u03c3 is a scale parameter and \u03b5 i is the random disturbance term following a certain distribution. The predictors (X i ) included midlife BMI, sex, race, year of birth, number of years of education and cardiovascular comorbidities. We fitted a series of AFT models assuming different distributions for T i that included: exponential, log normal, log logistic, Weibull and generalized gamma. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for each model, and Akaike information criterion/Bayesian information criteria were used to select the model that best fit the data. The precision of midlife BMI estimates was taken into account in the model by weighting the loglikelihood function for each subject. In separate analyses, we also estimated the effect of midlife BMI on the risk of AD using Cox proportional hazard model (Supplementary Table S1 ).\nSeparate weighted least-square regression was used with pathology scores (CERAD and Braak) and DVRs (PET-PiB amyloid burden) as dependent variables and midlife BMI as the main predictor. Other covariates included sex, race, years of education and cardiovascular comorbidities. For pathology outcomes, age at death was also included as a covariate.\nIn all the regression analyses, linearity and additivity of the effect of midlife BMI on the AAO, extent of AD pathology and DVRs were tested by including the natural spline of BMI and interaction between BMI and sex term separately in the models. As they were not significant, they were dropped from the final model. Thus, all 3 models meet the assumptions of linearity and additivity."}, {"section_title": "Additional analyses", "text": "As APOE genotype is the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD, we also tested the effect of midlife BMI on AAO of AD after adjusting for APOE \u03b54 carrier status. In additional analyses, we also tested the effect of BMI by APOE interaction on AAO, by including APOE \u03b54 status \u00d7 BMI interaction term as an additional covariate. This analysis was run on 1022 individuals who had APOE genotype data available (109 of whom developed incident AD).\nWe also examined whether rates of change in BMI predict AAO of AD. We first used linear mixed models to estimate the rates of BMI change before AD onset from all the longitudinal BMI data measured after age 40 years up to AD onset or last visit. We then included the rates of BMI change as the main predictor in the AFT model using the same covariates as in the primary analyses. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study samples from the BLSA cohort. In the sample for the accelerated failure time analysis, among 1394 participants, 142 (10.2%) developed incident AD with an average AAO of 83.3 years. In the autopsy sample, clinical diagnoses before autopsy included AD (71), mild cognitive impairment (26) , non-AD dementia (24), cognitive impairment-not mild cognitive impairment (2) and cognitively normal (68).\nAfter adding APOE \u03b54 status as an additional covariate, the effect of midlife BMI on AAO of AD remained statistically significant (P = 0.0011). Although the effect of APOE \u03b54 status on AAO of AD was not statistically significant, we found that on average APOE \u03b54+ individuals have an earlier onset of AD by about 3.4 years compared with APOE \u03b54 \u2212 participants (acceleration factor = \u2212 0.041, s.e. = 0.025, P-value = 0.11).

After adjustment for sex, race, years of education, birth year and cardiovascular comorbidities, midlife BMI had a significant effect on the AAO of AD with an acceleration factor of \u2212 0.0067 (P = 0.013), indicating that each unit increase in midlife BMI was associated with about 0.67% acceleration or about a 6.7 months decrease in AAO of AD (Table 2 ). Figure 2 shows the relationship between midlife BMI and 10th percentile time to event of AD (i.e. the age when 10% of the sample would have developed AD) from the final AFT model. In the figure, each unit increase in midlife BMI is associated with an earlier AAO of AD by an average of 6.7 months. When we examined the effect of BMI on risk of AD using a Cox proportional hazards model, we found that higher mid-life BMI was associated with an increased risk of AD (hazard ratio = 1.07, P = 0.024) (Supplementary Table S1 ).\nMidlife BMI and severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology In a model adjusted for sex, age at death, number of years of education and cardiovascular comorbidities, midlife BMI was significantly associated with Braak score (P = 0.0087) with higher midlife BMI predicting greater neurofibrillary tangle burden. However, we did not find significant associations between midlife BMI and neuritic plaque burden as measured by the CERAD score (P = 0.27) ( Table 3) .\nMidlife BMI and in vivo fibrillar brain amyloid burden Higher BMI at age 50 years was marginally associated (i.e. approaching significance) with an increase in mean cortical DVR (P = 0.075). Similarly, higher BMI at age 50 years was also marginally associated (i.e. approaching significance) with increased fibrillar amyloid deposition in the left and right precuneus (P = 0.061, 0.079, respectively) (Supplementary Table S2 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our results show a robust association between higher BMI at age 50 years and earlier onset of AD, greater severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology at autopsy and a trend towards higher fibrillar amyloid deposition in non-demented elderly. Our findings clearly indicate that higher adiposity at midlife is associated with a longlasting effect on accelerating the clinical course of AD. We found a strong association between higher midlife BMI and greater severity of neurofibrillary pathology. Finally, we extended our study to ask if midlife BMI was related to measures of fibrillar amyloid deposition during life. We found that higher midlife BMI was associated a trend towards both greater global fibrillar amyloid burden and increased deposition within the precuneus, a brain region especially vulnerable to early accumulation of amyloid even in non-demented older individuals. 36 Our study has several strengths. First, the BLSA is among few longitudinal studies with serial cognitive assessments of initially healthy individuals and prospective consensus diagnoses of incident dementia that enable accurate estimates of AAO of AD. The frequency of serial assessments (every 2 years on average) and long follow-up duration are particular strengths of our study. The paucity of studies that have explicitly tested the association between midlife adiposity and AAO of AD may be due, in part, to the lack of accurate midlife BMI or AAO data in these studies. Furthermore, our use of an accelerated failure time model allowed us to examine directly the relationship between midlife BMI and AAO of AD. This method provides an intuitive and easy to interpret summary statistic in terms of an acceleration/deceleration factor from survival curves, which is especially useful in aging research. 38 In contrast, the traditional Cox proportional hazards model estimates the hazard function and summarizes the effects of midlife BMI in terms of the ratio of age-specific incidence (i.e., the hazard ratio). Finally, the availability of an autopsy sample with detailed assessment of neuropathology as well as a neuroimaging substudy with in vivo estimates of amyloid deposition make our analyses, especially unique in suggesting possible biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between midlife adiposity and the AAO of AD. A potential limitation of our study is that the BLSA is a predominantly Caucasian sample of highly educated and healthy individuals. It would be important, therefore to test whether our findings are also valid in larger, more diverse samples. We also believe that a much larger sample representing a wider range of midlife BMI values would be required to ascertain whether a precise threshold effect of midlife BMI on AAO of AD exists or whether nonlinear relationships between AD risk and midlife BMI are important, and to determine the effects of longitudinal changes in BMI on AAO of AD. Similarly, studies examining the effect of BMI on AAO of AD over a wider age range, including childhood and young adulthood, would be important in identifying the most opportune window for lifestyle interventions targeting obesity to reduce risk of AD. An additional limitation of our study is our inability to explicitly test the interaction between BMI and dietary patterns on the AAO of AD. Accumulating evidence suggests that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may protect against AD. 39 Although historical dietary data on macronutrient intake was available in our sample, systematic categorization of foods consumed into 'beneficial' (e.g. vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereal, fish) and 'detrimental' (e.g. meat and dairy products) to estimate a Mediterranean diet score has not been carried out in a majority of participants. In future studies, it is important to incorporate the effects of dietary patterns as potential modifiers of BMI-associated AD risk.\nWe focused our analyses on midlife BMI in relation to AAO of AD for several reasons. First, identification of an environmental risk factor in midlife may allow for early lifestyle interventions exerting long-lasting effects to delay the onset of AD. [40] [41] [42] Second, a growing body of evidence links healthy behaviors during midlife with various metrics of healthy aging. 43 Last, measures of BMI in late life are more likely to be confounded by comorbid medical conditions as well as by perturbations in feeding behavior in the early stages of AD, 44, 45 whereas midlife BMI may be less prone to such confounding variables.\nAlthough we did not directly assess the mechanisms underlying the association between midlife BMI and onset of AD, this relationship could be mediated in part by an increase in both neurofibrillary tangle pathology and greater accumulation of fibrillar amyloid in vulnerable brain regions such as the precuneus. Interestingly, we have reported previously that midlife obesity is also associated with greater rates of regional brain atrophy in individuals progressing to cognitive impairment. 46 Taken together with our current results, these findings suggest that increasing amyloid accumulation, accelerated brain atrophy and neurodegeneration may be pathological events underlying the association between midlife BMI and earlier AAO of AD. It may be important to also consider the role of chronic inflammation associated with obesity as a trigger for the initiation or worsening of AD neuropathology. 47, 48 In summary, we found that greater midlife adiposity was associated with earlier AAO of AD and greater severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology. Our findings suggest that maintaining a healthy body mass index at midlife could have a long-lasting impact in delaying the onset of AD. Equally importantly, they relate the AAO of AD to a modifiable risk factor that can be easily measured at a single time point at home, and reveal a long interval of opportunity during which lifestyle changes might delay the onset of AD. Our findings raise the possibility that inexpensive, noninvasive interventions targeting midlife obesity and overweight could substantially alter the trajectory of AD, reducing its global public health and economic impact."}]
