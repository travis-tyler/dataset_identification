[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "By mid-2020, Latin America became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 1.1M reported cases and 50,000 deaths. In this context, Uruguay stands out as an outlier surpassing the situation with remarkable success. Uruguay is a 3.5million-people country located in the Atlantic coast of South America. Two rivers (R\u00edo de La Plata and Rio Uruguay) establish its border with Argentina to the west, and a long, dry border of almost 1000 km conforms its northeastern limit with Brazil, currently the second country with the highest prevalence of COVID-19 in the world (Worldometers.info/coronavirus). More than 50% of the population lives in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital city, and its metropolitan area. The other half of the population is distributed among several cities, generally not exceeding 100,000 inhabitants, and the countryside. Additional unique factors compared to other countries, in particular with Argentina and Brazil, are, for example, that there is only one major international airport, located at the periphery of Montevideo, and one major international harbor also located within the capital.\nTo understand the management of COVID-19 in Uruguay it is important to highlight aspects of its health system. Uruguay has developed a universal access health integrated system with public and private medical centers offering widespread access to all the medical services and procedures, including intensive care. Before SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Uruguay (March 13th 2020), the health system had 19 intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants. This figure positioned the country in between countries with the highest number of ICU beds (approximately 30 beds per 100,000 like Germany and Austria), and countries such as France, Spain or Italy with 11, 10, and 9 beds per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Of note, Uruguay was able to increase this number significantly reaching 24 intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants just two months after the first COVID-19 cases were detected.\nAt the time of COVID-19 emergence on March 13th, Uruguay decided to base its strategy on two main lines of action that we understand underlie the so far successful management of the epidemic. As opposed to other countries, Uruguay had a rapid, seemingly exaggerated, response declaring a health state of emergency upon detection of the first cases. This included closing borders, shutting down schools and any activity that may lead to agglomeration (pubs, commercial centers, churches, entertainment .

The government also exhorted personal responsibility for controlling the virus through voluntary/self-confinement with no mandatory lockdown (a summary of key factors is shown in Fig. 1 ). In parallel the government sought for advice, support and help from the local scientific system. By early March 2020, Uruguay had access to only 200 PCR-based diagnostic assays, a worrisome factor in the face of the incoming pandemic, especially in an international context of imminent shortage of commercial diagnostic kits and reagents as stressed by the World Health Organization (WHO). As a result of a first pivotal meeting and in synergy with the Ministry of Public Health, the Uruguayan scientific and medical ecosystem decided to develop a national response based on four key aspects: i) to locally develop diagnostic resources, ii) to expand the diagnostic capacity by creating a national network of COVID-19 diagnostic labs, iii) to deploy epidemiological approaches and real-time genomic surveillance to track the transmission of the virus and to help contain potential outbreaks. Moreover, a month later an ad honorem Scientific Advisory Group (GACH) was created to advice and report directly to the government (see Fig. 1 ).\nAlmost three months after the first cases, a period of time in which most countries enter the exponential phase, Uruguay has never entered into such complex phase. In this work, we aim to describe and discuss the key scientific approaches and tools that have been important milestones in the management of the COVID-19 crisis in Uruguay.\n.

Second, and aiming to follow the WHO TETRIS guides, the scientific and medical community played an active role in finding national solutions in, at least, three main areas: i) the development of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests, ii) increasing the nation-wide testing capacity and, iii) performing an epidemiological surveillance to track and isolate positive cases while monitoring the circulation of the virus by sequencing technologies.\nThe spread of the virus worldwide has changed dramatically in the last few months. A frightening fact, for example, is that while it took almost three months to reach the first 500,000 positive cases, 500,000 new cases are now reported in a matter of weeks or even days (Worldometers.info/coronavirus). Thus, controlling the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been an enormous challenge. In this context, the fact that Uruguay was able to avoid entering an exponential phase of disease contagion in the first three months despite having a number of outbreaks, is a remarkable point. Our analysis shows that one key aspect was the reduction in the effective reproduction number (Re) which is reflected in that most local transmission chains have been controlled at the second generation of contacts. This was due to a massive testing strategy, allowing the rapid detection of COVID-19 cases, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, based on the national development of a RT-qPCR kit and an extensive network of diagnostic laboratories created by the scientific system and supported and encouraged by the national health authorities. In fact, Uruguay was able to reach a number of PCR-based tests per day that compares and sometimes even surpasses topranking economies (300 tests per million people per day). Another key factor was the effectiveness of the epidemiological control teams of the Ministry of Public Health who reconstructed the epidemiological changes and followed up most cases on a one to one basis. This in turn allowed to track and quarantine all the people that contacted confirmed positive cases thus limiting the spread of the virus. Importantly, as of to date, we have not reached saturation in our testing and epidemiological surveillance capacity.\nIn addition, the dynamics of the virus transmission was monitored in a real-time fashion through genomic sequencing. These data were also instrumental to understand the different entry events and outbreaks.\n.

In Uruguay, the first level of medical attention is supported by family physicians that typically assist patients at their home (a strategy that is being strengthened due to the COVID-19 epidemic) therefore reducing the number of potentially infected individuals entering hospitals and clinics. A direct consequence of all these measures has been the fact that we have not saturated neither the epidemiological surveillance system nor the health system, and particularly the ICUs that were specially prepared to deal with the epidemic, even significantly increasing the number of beds available in the system. Importantly, Uruguay needs to keep all the measures and continue exploring innovative strategies to improve the TETRIS. This is especially relevant since mathematical modeling indicates that containment measures can become saturated, giving rise to an epidemic threshold. After that point, the disease begins to grow rapidly in an exponential phase and the previously effective measures become ineffective17.\nIn summary, we firmly believe that the management of the health crisis has been supported by a hitherto unseen interaction between the national health authorities and the scientific academy. This relationship has been instrumental to capitalize on having scientists with different expertise and covering different areas such as virology, epidemiology and molecular biology, many of whom collaborated ad honorem to allow the different scientific developments described here. Notably, this interaction has contributed to make decisions based on solid scientific evidence, a paradigm shift that is proving successful so far.\n.

Altogether, 87% of all cases were outpatients, 4% were assisted in intensive care units (ICUs), and the remaining 9% (n = 74) required standard hospitalization. Comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, kidney diseases, among others) were overrepresented in patients that were admitted to hospitals (71%) compared to ambulatory patients (27%) ( Table 1 and 2). Of note, and consistently with observations made worldwide12, men appeared to be more affected than women with 5.9% of men requiring critical care assistance vs. 1.7% of women (Table 1 ).\nThe accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in Uruguay never reached an exponential phase. Case number peaks correspond to four isolated outbreaks with less than 40 cases per day each (Fig. 2 ). The first outbreak occurred at the same time as the first reported cases and was associated with a social event (SE). A second outbreak happened in a mental health care hospital (MH), and a few weeks later a third outbreak occurred in a Residential Care for the Elderly (RCFE) facility. Finally, an outbreak occurred at a city of Rivera (RA), located at the dry border with Brazil, the number two country with the highest number of cases worldwide. Uruguay rapidly contained these outbreaks. Several factors might explain their successful management, and the course of the epidemic in the country, including the rapid tracking and isolation of people that had contacts with confirmed cases. Importantly, that effort was based on the ability of the National Direction of Epidemiology to rapidly confirm positive cases in the first place, thus following the WHO's recommendation to \"test, trace and isolate\" (TETRIS). This end could have been, however, complicated by the country's limited testing capacity at the start of the epidemic coupled with the international shortage of supplies."}, {"section_title": "Development of a national molecular diagnostic test", "text": "For the successful implementation of the TETRIS strategy, performing as many molecular tests as possible is a key factor.

Importantly, and in line with this effort, the national health authorities enabled research institutions to perform clinical diagnosis for COVID-19, following international standards. As a result, Uruguay was able to dramatically increase its diagnostic capacity from 205 molecular tests per day in March to more than 800 by the end of May ( Fig. 2; red line) .

This was the product of implementing a real-time genomic surveillance approach to characterize genetic variants that arrived in the country and subsequently caused major outbreaks.\nOur analysis revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Uruguay and that 4 out of the 5 major SARS-CoV-2 lineages identified worldwide have circulated in the country (Fig. 5B and 5C) . Importantly, the application of this genomic epidemiology analysis evidenced that the RCFE outbreak was originated from genetic variants that had already caused the MH outbreak, suggesting a previously unseen epidemiological link between these outbreaks. Remarkably, the genetic variants causing the MH, RCFE and RA represent the recent introduction and local expansion of lineages 20A and 20B (>50% of sequenced cases), which harbor the D614G mutation in the spike protein coding gene. This mutation has been recently proposed to increase viral transmission14; hence it would potentially represent an important genetic marker to guide improved disease control strategies.\n.

Samples are pooled by row and by column and these pools of 10 are tested in the first stage of the algorithm. Individual testing needs to be performed at the sample in the intersection of positive rows and columns. The \"Matrix pooling 10x10\" strategy allows to analyze 1,000 samples performing only 200 molecular tests. Therefore, this configuration reduces the required number of tests by 80% when compared to individual testing, further increasing our national testing capacity."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included a wide range of strategies, some even questioning the general guidelines suggested by the WHO.
