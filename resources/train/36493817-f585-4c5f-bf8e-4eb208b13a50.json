Including Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Measures in the NSCG, SDR, and SED Would Enhance the Quality and Utility of the Information Being Collected", "text": "As in previous versions of the survey, the proposed 2019 NSCG would collect some types of personal information from respondents, including race, ethnicity, sex, age, income, and disability status, 3 which we support. However, while the proposed NSCG would collect a variety of personal demographic information from respondents, it would not collect data on respondents' sexual orientation or gender identity. Including measures of sexual orientation and gender identity in the NSCG (as well as the SDR and SED) would enhance the quality and utility of the information being collected. There has been a growing recognition of the need to measure sexual orientation and gender identity in the STEM workforce. 4 As summarized last month in the scientific journal Nature, recent studies show that LGBT people are experiencing disadvantages and disparities in STEM fields similar to other under-represented groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities and women. 5 Estimates suggest that LGBT people are approximately 20% less represented in STEM fields than expected based on their prevalence in the U.S. population. 6 A 2018 study found that sexual-minority undergraduates were 8% more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to drop out of STEM majors, even though they were more likely to pursue relevant research experiencea pattern commonly associated with difficulties in retaining women and racial and ethnic minorities in STEM fields due to a non-supportive STEM culture. 7 Indeed, several studies have shown that LGBT people encounter non-supportive environments in STEM fields. LGBT people report more negative workplace experiences in STEM fields than do non-LGBT people in those same fields, or than do LGBT people in non-STEM industries. 6 Among sexual-minority STEM faculty members who are 'out' about their sexual orientation, 69% report feeling uncomfortable in their academic department, which is related to exclusion and harassment they report. 8 Some STEM fields, such as chemistry, have conducted surveys on the professional environment that included questions of sexual orientation and gender identity. In a 2016 survey in chemistry, 44% of LGBT people reported that they were harassed, intimidated, or excluded at work. 9 As noted by the 2018 National Academies' Measuring the 21st Century Science and Engineering Workforce Population: Evolving Needs report, the science and engineering workforce \"is becoming increasingly diverse\u2026in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, and other characteristics\". 10 In this respect, the report highlights an evolving need: Future recruitment, growth, and development of the nation's scientists and engineers will depend on greater understanding not only of the diverse composition of the science and engineering workforce but also of the factors that facilitate or impede the entry, retention, and advancement of underrepresented groups in the workforce. 10 Inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity measures on the NSCG, SDR, and SED would directly address such evolving needs identified by the National Academies. Doing so would provide important data regarding how LGBT people navigate the STEM environmentfrom their undergraduate and graduate education through to the workforceand where they may experience barriers to entering or remaining in STEM fields. Such data would also provide information about the experiences of LGBT people in STEM more generally, including, for example, whether they are satisfied with their jobs, receiving sufficient professional support, or experiencing pay inequality. There are many potential uses of sexual orientation and gender identity data in STEM workforce surveys. For example, such data would inform institutions, agencies, and researchers developing strategies to address under-representation or career or educational barriers experienced by LGBT people. Reports based on NSCG, SDR, and SED data, including the Science & Engineering Indicators and Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering reports, are routinely used by policymakers overseeing diversity initiatives at educational and research institutions across the nation and at funding agencies, including the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. Data on LGBT representation could therefore similarly inform such diversity programs, as these programs may be interested to address under-representation of LGBT people in specific STEM fields and career stages, if and where it exists. As with other under-represented groups, such diversity initiatives could include fellowships for doctoral students, scholarships for undergraduate students, or recruitment strategies for faculty, graduate students, and/or postdoctoral researchers. More generally, the data would also inform research aimed at developing interventions or paradigms to reduce disadvantages experienced by LGBT scientists and engineers. In short, including sexual orientation and gender identity measures in the NSCG, SDR, and SED would increase the quality and utility of the information collected, because such data would enhance the understanding of diverse and under-represented groups' participation in STEM education and their representation in the STEM workforce."}, {"section_title": "II. Importance of Governmental Data Collection on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SO/GI); SO/GI Data Collection is Becoming Increasingly Common", "text": "Adding sexual orientation and gender identity measures to the NSCG, SDR, and SED would reflect a growing trend among federal, state, and other data collections that include demographic measures. This trend is responsive to a need succinctly described by the Federal Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys: At a time when sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations are becoming more visible in social and political life, there remains a lack of data on the characteristics and well-being of these groups. In order to understand the diverse needs of SGM populations, more representative and better quality data need to be collected. 11 A growing number of federal government surveys allow people to voluntarily disclose their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Examples of federal government surveys that collect these data include the National Health Interview Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, National Survey for Family Growth, and National Crime Victimization Survey, among others. 11 Further, several state and local government surveys also collect data on sexual orientation and gender identity, such as the California Health Interview Survey, 12 as do several large surveys administered by private entities, most notably Gallup through its Daily Tracking Survey. 13 While more and better data are needed, governmental and other data collections that include measures of sexual orientation and gender identity have allowed researchers to begin to describe the size of the LGBT population and LGBT people's demographics; employment, housing, and family circumstances; health and well-being; and the discrimination and disparities they face. These data are vital to policymaking in order to ensure that stereotypes and myths are not driving policies that impact LGBT people, and so that programs and services are appropriately targeted at vulnerable LGBT populations. For example, we now know that there are an estimated 11 million LGBT individuals living in the U.S. 13 We also know from the data that the LGBT population is remarkably diverse and that the experiences of LGBT people are not uniform but, rather, are shaped by factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical location, primary language, education, disability, religion, family composition, and age. 14 We have also learned that LGBT people are more likely to be in poverty than non-LGBT people, 15 contrary to the popular stereotype of LGBT affluence, and that LGBT people face persistent and pervasive discrimination in employment, housing, educational, and other important settings. 16 Noting the disadvantages LGBT people are facing in STEM fields (see Section I), the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity measures in STEM workforce surveys (NSCG, SDR, and SED) would provide similarly vital information about the experiences, career trajectory, and representation of LGBT people in STEM fields."}, {"section_title": "III. Experience Indicates NSCG, SDR, and SED Respondents Would Willingly and Accurately Disclose Their Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity", "text": "Federal and other population-based surveys that collect sexual orientation and gender identity data indicate NSCG, SDR, and SED respondents would be willing and are able to answer questions about their sexual orientation and gender identity, and doing so would not raise privacy or other concerns. As an initial matter, we note that the National Science Foundation' addition to other measures, to protect respondents' confidentiality. And federal law protects the confidentiality of individually identifiable information collected by these agencies. 17 Experience shows that respondents are willing to answer questions about their LGBT status. Indeed, the Federal Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys has explained that \"[m]ost surveys incorporating [sexual orientation and gender identity] items have not found higher nonresponse rates than other 'sensitive' questions, such as personal or household income.\" 18 Likewise, federal surveys incorporating these measures and other research demonstrate that including sexual orientation and gender identity questions does not cause survey breakoff. 19 Although nearly all college graduates and doctoral degree holders taking the NSCG, SDR, and SED are adults, the sample includes those who would be considered young adults. Experiences with other federal government and population-based surveys show that youth and young adults are capable and willing to answer questions about sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, as the Sexual Minority Assessment Research Team report explained, \"[s]exual orientation questions have been asked on large-scale school-based surveys of adolescents around the world since the mid-1980's.\" 1 For instance, the National Survey of Youth in Custody includes a measure of sexual orientation, 20 and the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey successfully includes respondents as young as 13 and has included sexual orientation measures since 2015. The National Survey of Family Growth, which includes respondents as young as 15, has included a sexual orientation behavior measure for many years. 21 While sexual orientation and gender identity data should be treated with the same concern for confidentiality of respondents as any other demographic category, there is no rational basis to single out the questions on sexual orientation and gender identity as warranting special concern about the sensitivity of this type of information. As noted above, sexual orientation and gender identity measures do not have materially higher non-response rates than other potentially sensitive personal questions. Moreover, according to the Federal Interagency Working Group, \"[the] perceived sensitivity of questions can affect the willingness of survey practitioners to include [sexual orientation and gender identity] questions even when inclusion of these measures would support agency mission and data needs.\" 22 In this case, the inclusion of these measures strongly supports the mission of the National Science Foundation and furthers the goals of several federal agencies, as described in Section I. We recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity questions could be sensitive for certain respondents, although there is no reason to believe they would be more sensitive than other questions, such as income or disability status. And even if the sexual orientation and gender identity questions would be sensitive for some respondents, the questions would be voluntary, as is the case in other federal government surveys and recommended by the Federal Interagency Working Group. Thus, no respondent would be forced to answer these questions. In other federal government surveys, these questions frequently have \"don't know\" and \"something else\" or \"none of these\" response options, giving respondents options for responding to these questions if they are uncomfortable disclosing or unsure about their sexual orientation or gender identity. 1 In addition, as described earlier, responses are highly confidential and are strongly protected under federal law. In short, previous experiences in governmental and other data collection suggest that NSCG, SDR, and SED respondents will not encounter any issues in willingly and accurately disclosing information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Nor will such disclosures introduce issues of confidentiality or privacy, a high non-response rate, or survey breakoff."}, {"section_title": "IV. The NSCG, SDR, and SED Have Sufficiently Large Samples to Produce Reliable Estimates Related to Sexual Orientation And Gender Identity", "text": "The Federal Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys cautions that small samples may lead to significant errors in estimation and description and/or an inability to produce reliable estimates related to sexual orientation and gender identity. 22 However, the current sample sizes of the NSCG, SDR, and SED are all sufficiently large, and thus there is no rational basis for concerns related to small sample sizes in the context of these STEM workforce surveys. For instance, recent versions of other federal government surveys, such as the National Health Interview Survey and National Survey of Family Growth, entailed sample sizes of approximately 87,500 23 and 10,000, 24 respectively, and both surveys currently collect information about sexual orientation. Sample sizes of the NSCG are far larger: the NSCG has a sample of approximately 135,000, the SDR approximately 120,000, and the SED approximately 55,000. 10 Thus, concerns of small sample size are unwarranted. The NSCG, SDR, and SED routinely ask about race and ethnicity information, and many of the race and ethnicity classifications have a prevalence in the U.S. population that is smaller than that of LGBT people. For instance, the 2017 Women, Minorities, and People with Disabilities in Science and Engineering report provides recent estimates of each race and ethnicity classification's prevalence in the U.S. population, so as to permit comparison with corresponding percentages in science and engineering fields. For the following four race and ethnicity classifications included in the 2017 report (and collected in the NSCG, SDR, and SED), their prevalence estimate in the U.S. population is: \u2022 Asian: 5.3% \u2022 American Indian or Alaska Native: 0.7% \u2022 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander: 0.2% \u2022 Two or more races (not Hispanic): 2.0% 25 Despite being quite small, STEM workforce surveys currently provide full data on each of these race and ethnicity classifications. Most recent estimates of the prevalence of LGBT people in the U.S. adult population, according to the Gallup's 2017 Daily Tracking Survey (n=340,604), is 4.5%. 13 This prevalence is roughly on par or only slightly smaller than that of the U.S. Asian population, and is considerably higher than those of the other three race and ethnicity classifications. Thus, the NSCG, SDR, and SED currently collect information on race and ethnicity classifications that have expected samples smaller than those of LGBT people. Finally, reports of NSCG, SDR, and SED data, such as the Women, Minorities, and People with Disabilities in Science and Engineering report, typically suppress a cell of data only if the sample constituting that data cell is less than 0.1% (due to concerns of an unreliable estimate or that so few respondents raises concerns of identifiability), and this is far lower than 4.5%. Dividing into specific subgroups and intersections with other demographic information in theory could lead to subgroup samples constituting less than 0.1% or where concerns of unreliability of identifiability are relevant. However, as with the race and ethnicity classifications currently collected with even smaller samples, such specific LGBT subgroup data could be suppressed wherever necessary. That certain subgroups or intersections may have overly small sample sizes does not warrant the wholesale exclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity information more generally. Given that federal surveys with smaller sample sizes than the NSCG, SDR, and SED already currently collect sexual orientation and gender identity information, and that these STEM workforce surveys routinely collect information related to race and ethnicity classifications that have smaller prevalence in the U.S. population than LGBT people, concerns of unreliable or invalid estimates of LGBT people in STEM workforce surveys have no substantive support."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "The National Science Foundation is committed to promoting diversity in STEM fields and providing resources to ensure that science and engineering are inclusive to all. 26 Collecting sexual orientation and gender identity data on the NSCG, SDR, and SED would provide vital information about LGBT participation in the STEM pipelinefrom undergraduate and graduate education through to the workforceand LGBT representation among our nation's scientists and engineers. This information would enhance the ability of the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies to provide critical data and support to the scientific community and to advance the future of the U.S. STEM workforce.
