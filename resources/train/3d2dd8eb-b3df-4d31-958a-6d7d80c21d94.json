[{"section_title": "SECTION I. GENERAL NOTES", "text": "The data described in this report were collected in the 21st annual National Science Foundation/National Institutes of Health (NSF/NIH) Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, covering fall 1992. This publication describes the survey and characteristics of the database. The survey universe is composed of all U.S. institutions with departments or programs offering courses of study at the postbaccalaureate level in any science and engineering (S&E) field. Medical schools and other specialized institutions in health-related fields with postdoctoral programs or S&E master's or doctoral programs are also included. The 1992 survey universe included 333 doctorategranting institutions and 275 master's-granting institutions. Section II presents a description of the survey methodology and response analysis. Section III lists the institutions surveyed, by degree level, along with their identifying Federal Interagency Committee on Education (FICE) codes. Section IV displays copies of the survey instruments, along with summary questionnaire facsimiles containing data for all departments or for selected groups of departments. The facsimiles present data for all institutions, by broad science and engineering field, and summary statistics for doctorate-granting institutions, master's-granting institutions, and other selected groups of institutions. Detailed data are available in several publications. Selected Data on Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (NSF 94-301) includes tables summarizing results on all topics covered by the questionnaire. Because of the large number of tables (more than 650 in 1992) generated on the basis of graduate S&E enrollment data, it is not feasible to include the full set of tables in a general-audience publication. To meet the needs of those interested in more detailed data of a specific type, NSF has developed a series of \"Supplementary Data Releases\" focusing on specific data topics. The 18 pamphlets available are listed on the order blank provided at the back of this book. Tables in these publications showing data for doctorate-granting institutions include all institutions with any school (medical school, dental school, etc.) or branch campus that granted S&E doctorates for all years in which such degrees were offered. This definition differs from that used by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which considers only those institutions that granted \"significant numbers\" of doctoral degrees to be doctorate-granting institutions."}, {"section_title": "DATA LIMITATIONS", "text": "In any analysis of the data in these publications, the following definitions and limitations should be kept in mind. In fall 1992 the definitions of foreign students and U,S. citizens were modified to match those used by the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Institute of International Education. In previous years permanent residents were counted with foreign students, but in fall 1992 permanent residents were included with U.S. citizens. In tables showing full-time graduate enrollment by source of support, \"institutional support\" includes those students receiving their primary support from State and local government sources as well as from their institutions. \"Other U.S. sources\" includes students supported by industrial firms, nonprofit institutions (independent research institutes, professional societies, philanthropic foundations, etc.), and all other sources of support originating within the United States. However, \"Other U.S. sources\" does not include loans, family money, or personal savings used by students supporting themselves. Students supported primarily by foreign industrial firms, as well as by foreign governments, are reported under \"foreign sources.\" \"Imputation,\" as defined by NSF, denotes a computerized process that estimates data for totally or partially nonrespondent institutions based on their own data from earlier years, if available, or data from peer institutions. Data can be imputed for an entire institution, a department, or individual cells for which the institution or department was unable to provide actual data. The imputation procedures are described in detail in section II, \"Technical Notes.\" Respondent institutions can revise prior-year data as well as current data during the editing process. Consequently, only the trend data from the current report should be used in historical analyses."}, {"section_title": "DATA SUMMARY", "text": "In fall 1992 495,397 graduate students were enrolled in master's and doctoral programs in the science, engineering, and health fields. This total represents a 4-percent increase from the fall 1991 figure. The increase was 3 percent in the engineering fields and 4 percent in the science fields. Of all science fields social science students and Earth, atmospheric, and ocean science students increased the most rapidly (almost 6 percent each). Growth was slowest in the agricultural sciences, with an increase of slightly more than 1 percent. The social sciences continued to be the most popular field in the sciences, with 85,824 graduate students or more than one-fourth of the total. Nearly one-third of the engineering graduate students, 36,272, were enrolled in electrical engineering. Graduate students enrolled full-time numbered 323,399 and accounted for 65 percent of the total. The number of graduate students enrolled fulltime increased at a faster rate from 1991 to 1992 than did those enrolled part-time (almost 5 percent compared with 3 percent). The number of women enrolled in graduate S&E programs continued to rise more rapidly than the number of men, reaching 40 percent of the total. Women increased by 6 percent, whereas men increased by a little less than 3 percent. Women continued to make up the majority of those enrolled in psychology and the health fields but accounted for only 14.5 percent of engineering graduate students. Foreign students, at almost 23 percent of the total, increased by less than 1 percent, probably due to a change in the definition of foreign students. In previous years permanent residents were counted with foreign students, but beginning in fall 1992 permanent residents were included with U.S. citizens to conform to data collected by other sources. This definitional shift may explain why students with U.S. citizenship increased by more than 5 percent in 1992 but increased by only 3 percent in 1991. Foreign students were most heavily concentrated in the physical sciences and in engineering, making up almost 36 percent and 35 percent of the total, respectively. Foreign students also made up about one-third of all graduate students in the mathematical sciences and computer sciences. At almost 40 percent of the full-time total, academic institutions remained the major source of support for full-time graduate students. Selfsupported students (including those supported by loans, family money, or personal savings) made up a little more than 31 percent of the full-time total. The Federal Government supported slightly more than 20 percent. Enrollment in doctorate-granting irstitutions, at 427,792, represented 86 percent of all graduate students. This percentage has varied only slightly since 1975. Nevertheless, master's-granting institutions accounted for more than one-eighth of all graduate students reported and grew by 5 percent from fall 1991 to fall 1992, compared with a 4-percent growth in enrollment at doctorate-granting institutions.

TECHNICAL NOTES THE SURVEY UNIVERSE", "text": "The data collected in the fall 1992 Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctoratei. :n Science and Engineering (GSPSE) represent national estimates of graduate enrollment and postdoctoral employment at the beginning of academic year 1992-93 in all academic institutions in the United States that granted doctorate or master's degrees in any science or engineering field. Included are data for all branch campuses, affiliated research centers, and separately organized components such as medical or dental schools, schools of nursing, public health, etc. The survey universe consisted of 727 reporting units at 608 graduate institutions. Included were 275 master's-granting institutions and 452 reporting units associated with 333 doctorate-granting institutions. The National Science Foundation has collected data on graduate science and engineering (S&E) enrollment and postdoctoral appointees since 1966. From fall 1966 through fall 1971, data from a limited number of doctorate-granting institutions were collected through the NSF Graduate Traineeship Program, which requested data only on those S&E fields supported by NSF. Beginning with the fall 1972 survey, this data collection effort was assigned to the Universities and Nonprofit Institutions Studies Group and was gradually expanded during the period 1972-75 to include additional S&E fields as well as all institutions known to have programs leading to the master's or doctorate degree. Because of this expansion, data for 1974 and earlier years arc not strictly comparable with 1975 and later data. Table  II-1 shows the number of institutions, reporting units, and departments at each level included in the data, as well as the total enrollment reported for each year between 1966 and 1992. No attempt has been made to inflate the data for 1966-74 to reflect universe totals. Beginning with the 1984-85 academic year, master's-granting institutions were surveyed on a sample basis. The fall 1988 survey included the entire survey population for the first time since 1983-84. For each year since 1988, any institutions that begin S&E master's or doctoral programs are added to the survey universe and any that close all their S&E graduate programs arc deleted. (Sec \"Survey Methodology,\" below.) Tables 11-2 and 11-3 present data on departmental coverage by S&E field for doctorate-granting and master's-granting institutions for each year in the survey."}, {"section_title": "THE SURVEY INSTRUMENTS", "text": "The Departmental or Program Data Sheet (NSF Form 812) on which data were reported in fall 1992 was identical to the fall 1991 version, except for changes in the instructions to clarify some data items, most notably the definitions of postdoctoral appointees; first-year, full-time graduate students; and sources of support for full-time students. Furthermore, in fall 1992 the definitions of foreign students and U.S. citizens were modified to match those used by the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Institute of International Education. In previous years permanent residents were counted with foreign students, but in fall 1992 permanent residents were included with U.S. citizens. Each survey package also included (I) a flier explaining NSF's academic S&E surveys; (2) a computer-generated List of Departments or Programs (NSF Form 811) specific to each institution surveyed and based on the departments known to exist in the previous survey cycle; (3) a \"crosswalk\" showing NCES instructional program codes corresponding to each S&E field as defined by NSF; (4) a \"How To Avoid Common Survey Errors\" sheet with guidelines for avoiding the most common mistakes made in the Graduate Student Survey; and (5) a postcard acknowledging receipt of the survey and requesting the respondent to indicate changes in coordinator name, address, or telephone number."}, {"section_title": "SURVEY METHODOLOGY", "text": "The survey packages were mailed out by Nov. 12, 1992. The final survey universe consisted of 727 responding units at 608 institutions. The acknowledgment postcard requested that institutional coordinators indicate how the data were collected, whether the data were maintained centrally or collected from individual departments, and whether they were derived from a computerized database or were hand tabulated. Of the 727 responding schools surveyed, coordinators at 697 units, or 96 percent, have provided this information over the past 6 years. The responding coordinators indicated the following distribution of data sources: This pattern is similar to that for 1991. This year the number of schools using computerized systems to assemble the requested data increased as did those using automated systems with departmental input and those hand tabulating data at the department level. The number of schools hand tabulating data at the institution level remained relatively the same as last year, whereas those using a combination of data sources decreased. Institutional coordinators were asked to review the departmental listing provided on the Form 811, to indicate any changes in their departmental structure such as departments newly formed, phased out, split, or merged, and to check off any departments that had neither graduate students nor postdoctorates and for which Form 812s would therefore not be submitted. The revised Form 811s were returned to the data processing contractor for use as a checklist in tracking departmental responses. A Form 812 was completed for each department either centrally or at the departmental level and was returned to the data processing contractor for data entry, editing, and tabulation. Arithmetic errors, inconsistencies between items, and sharp year-to-year fluctuations were referred to the institutional coordinators for correction or clarification."}, {"section_title": "THE RESPONSE RATE", "text": "Of the 727 responding units included in the fall 1992 survey, 726, or 99.9 percent, were able to provide at least partial data, distributed as follows: At the departmental level 10,604 departments responded, or 97.0 percent of the 10,936 departments surveyed. This includes 9,066 departments providing complete responses, or 82.9 percent of the total. A total of 332 departments, or 3.0 percent of the departmental total, required complete imputation, and 1,538, or 14.1 percent, had one or more data cells imputed. Table 11-4 presents the response rates for earlier years for comparison. Missing data for partially nonrespondent departments were imputed using the departments' previous year's data, where available, or data from peer institutions in cases where data had not been reported the previous year. Data for nonrespondent departments (departments that did not provide any data) were imputed using data from the previous year, where available. For the two nonrespondent departments that were new to the survey, data could not be imputed. The number of departments in doctorate-granting and master's-granting institutions that required total or partial imputation and the numbers and proportions of full-time and part-time graduate students and postdoctorates imputed are shown in tables 11-5 through 11-8. In 1992 imputation rates for graduate students in master's-granting institutions were slightly higher than for those in doctorate-granting institutions."}, {"section_title": "CHANGES IN DATA ITEMS", "text": "Although NSF has attempted to maintain consistent trend data, some modifications in the survey questionnaire have been made to respond to changing issues over the past 15 years. As a result some data items are not available for all institutions in all years. Whenever a new item has been added to the questionnaire, it has been NSF's standard policy to allow the respondents I year's leadtime to convert their data collection systems before incorporating the new data into the survey: the question is labeled \"optional\" in the first year. Thus, whereas information on racial/ethnic background was first added to the survey form in 1979, publishable data were first obtained in 1980. Major changes in the data collected are as follows: From 1975 through 1977, data for master'sgranting institutions were collected on a short form (i.e., an abbreviated form of the survey) that did not collect data on sex or citizenship of graduate students, nor any data on postdoctoral appointees. In 1978 a similar questionnaire was sent to doctorate-granting institutions, but master's-granting institutions were not surveyed. The 1978 figures shown in the tables for master's-granting institutions represent estimates based on 1977 and 1979 data. Beginning in 1979 the long form (i.e., the full-scale survey form) was sent to both doctorate-granting and master's-granting institutions. Distribution by sex was originally requested only for full-time graduate students at doctorate-granting institutions. Beginning in 1976 master's-granting institutions were requested to provide data on all graduate students by sex, and in 1977 similar data were requested for all graduate students in all institutions. The short form used in the 1978 survey did not request any information on sex; figures in the tables represent estimates based on 1977 and 1979 data. Citizenship data were collected only for graduate students enrolled full-time in doctorate-granting institutions through 1977. No citizenship data were requested on the short form used for master's-granting institutions in 1975 through 1977 and for doctorate-granting institutions in 1978. Data on citizenship of all full-time graduate students are available beginning in 1979 and on those enrolled part-time since 1983. As noted above, racial/ethnic data were first requested in 1979 and became a standard item on the questionnaire in 1980. However, imputation rates for this item are still higher than for other data on the questionnaire, as shown in tables 11-6 and 11-8. \"Fellowships and traineeships\" were combined on one line until 1979, when separate data on the two mechanisms were first collected. \"Other nonfaculty research staff with doctorates\" were combined with postdoctoral appointees until 1979. Separate data on students receiving their primary support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture were first requested in 1985."}, {"section_title": "DATA REVISIONS", "text": "During the fall 1988 survey cycle, the criteria for including departments in the survey universe were tightened, and all departments surveyed were reviewed. Those departments not primarily oriented toward granting research degrees were no longer considered to meet the definition of science and engineering. As a result of this review, it was determined that a number of departments, primarily in the field of \"Social sciences, n.e.c.\" (not elsewhere classified), were engaged in training primarily teachers, practitioners, administrators, or managers rather than researchers; these departments were deleted frcan the database. This process was continued during the fall 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992 survey cycles and expanded to ensure trend consistency for the entire 1975-92 period. As a result, total enrollments and social science enrollments for all years were reduced. The net effect of adjustments over the years is shown in table 11-9. The definition of \"medical schools\" was revised during the fall 1992 survey cycle to include only those institutional components that are members of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Tables generated after the fall 1992 survey differ from their counterparts in earlier years in that they exclude schools of nursing, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and other health-related disciplines, and should not be compared with tables from earlier years.                0( the students on line (6), column (K), how many are FIRST.Y EAR students?

To avoid common mistakes found on the survey forms, please follow these guidelines: (1) Use only whole numbers, not decimals or fractions. When reporting graduate students in Items 5, 6, and 7, and postdoctoral appointees in Item 8, use headcounts rather than full-time-equivalents (FTEs). 2Count only full-time, degree-seeking graduate students in Item 5, and count each only once, by the largest source of support, so that all columns and rows sum to the full-time total in line 6(K). (3) Don't forget full-time, self-supported students, who should be reported in Item 5, column (J). Selfsupported students are supported primarily through loans, personal savings, and/or family contributions. For the purposes of this survey, fellowships are competitive awards which require no work from the recipient. Do not report students in the fellowship row of Item 5 if their largest source of support does not fit this definition. Report only full-time, first-year students in Item 5, lines 8 and 9. The total number of full-time, firstyear students reported in Item 5, line 8 should not be greater than the full-time total reported in Item 5, line 6(K). Likewise, the total number of first-year full-time women reported in Item 5, line 9 should not be greater than the full-time women total reported in Item 5, line 7(K). Count only U.S. citizens and permanent residents in Item 7, columns A-F. Count all foreign students on temporary visas in column (G) only, regardless of race/ethnicity. (10) For the purposes of this survey, departments or programs that do not offer graduate degrees (Ph.D. or master's) are considered as \"no-degree\" programs, even if they grant a first professional doctorate. Such \"no-degree\" programs should not report students, postdoctoral appointees, or anyone else in Items 5, 6, and 7. Count individuals in a \"no-degree\" program only in Item 8, and only if they qualify as postdoctoral appointees or other non-faculty research staff by this survey's definitions.
