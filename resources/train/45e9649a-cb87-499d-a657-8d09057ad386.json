This research field has addressed two main statistical questions: atlas construction for cross-sectional shape datasets, and shape regression for shape time series. The former is the classical extension of a mean-variance analy-sis, which aims to estimate a mean shape and a covariance structure from observations of several individual instances of the same object or organ. The latter extends the concept of regression by estimating a spatiotemporal trajectory of shape changes from a series of observations of the same individual object at different time-points. The emergence of longitudinal shape datasets, which consist in the collection of individual objects repeatedly observed at multiple timepoints, has raised the need for a combined approach. One needs statistical methods to estimate normative spatiotemporal models from series of individual observations which differ in shape and dynamics of shape changes across individuals. Such model should capture and disentangle the inter-subject variability in shape at each time-point and the temporal variability due to shifts in time or scalings in pace of shape changes. Considering individual series as samples along a trajectory of shape changes, this approach amounts to estimate a spatiotemporal distribution of trajectories, and has potential applications in various fields including silhouette tracking in videos, analysis of growth patterns in biology or modelling disease progression in medicine."}, {"section_title": "Related work", "text": "The central difficulty in shape analysis is that shape spaces are either defined by invariance properties [21, 40, 41] or by the conservation of topological properties [5, 8, 13, 20, 34] , and therefore have intrinsically a structure of infinite dimensional Riemannian manifolds or Lie groups. Statistical Shape Models [9] are linear but require consistent points labelling across observations and have no topology preservation guarantees. A now usual approach is to use the action of a group of diffeomorphisms to define a metric on a shape space [29, 43] . This approach has been used to compute a \"Fr\u00e9chet mean\" together with a covariance matrix in the tangent-space of the mean [1, 16, 17, 33, 44] from a cross-sectional dataset, and regression from time series of shape data [4, 15, 16, 18, 26, 32] . In [12, 14, 31] , these tools have been used to estimate an average trajectory of shape changes from a longitudinal dataset using the convenient assumption that the parameters encoding inter-individual variability are independent of time. The work in [27] introduced the idea to use the parallel transport to translate the spatiotemporal patterns seen in one individual into the geometry of another one. The co-adjoint transport is used in [38] for the same purpose. Both estimate a group average trajectory from individual trajectories. The proposed models do not account for inter-individual variability in the time dynamics, which is of key importance in the absence of temporal markers of the progression to align the sequences. The same remarks can be applied to [6] , which introduces a nice theoretical setting for spaces of trajectories, in the case of a fixed number of temporal observations across subjects. The need for temporal alignment in longitudinal data analysis is highlighted for instance in [13] with a diffeomorphismbased morphometry approach, or in [40, 41] with quotient shape spaces. In [24, 37] , a generative mixed-effects model for the statistical analysis of manifold-valued longitudinal data is introduced for the analysis of feature vectors. This model describes both the variability in the direction of the individual trajectories by introducing the concept of \"expparallelization\" which relies on parallel transport, and the pace at which those trajectories are followed using \"timewarp\" functions. Similar time-warps are used by the authors of [23] to refine their linear modeling approach [22] ."}, {"section_title": "Contributions", "text": "In this paper, we propose to extend the approach of [37] from low-dimensional feature vectors to shape data. Using an approach designed for manifold-valued data for shape spaces defined by the action of a group of diffeomorphisms raises several theoretical and computational difficulties.

To this end, we propose here:\n\u2022 to formulate a generative non-linear mixed-effects model for a finite-dimensional set of diffeomorphisms defined by control points, to show that this set is stable under exp-parallelization, and to use an efficient numerical scheme for parallel transport; \u2022 to introduce an adapted MCMC-SAEM algorithm with an adaptive block sampling of the latent variables, a specific sampling strategy for shape parameters based on random local displacements of the shape contours, and a vanishing tempering of the target log-likelihood; \u2022 to validate our method on 2D simulated data and a large dataset of 3D brain structures in the context of Alzheimer's disease progression, and to illustrate the potential of our method for classifying spatiotemporal patterns, e.g. to discriminate pathological versus normal trajectories of ageing.
