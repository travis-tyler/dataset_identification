[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge compares the performance of algorithms at predicting future evolution of individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease. TADPOLE Challenge participants train their models and algorithms on historical data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study or any other datasets to which they have access. Participants are then required to make monthly forecasts over a period of 5 years from January 2018, of three key outcomes for ADNI-3 rollover participants: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog13), and total volume of the ventricles. These individual forecasts are later compared with the corresponding future measurements in ADNI-3 (obtained after the TADPOLE submission deadline). The first submission phase of TADPOLE was open for prize-eligible submissions between 15 June and 15 November 2017.

This paper describes the design of the TADPOLE Challenge."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), and dementia in general, is a key challenge for 21st-century healthcare. The statistics are sobering (Winblad et al., 2016) : in 2015, 47 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, of which AD is the most common cause; dementia costs $818 billion worldwide, which is more than 1% of the aggregaste global gross domestic product (GDP); AD might contribute to as many deaths as does heart disease or cancer. There are no available treatments that can cure or even slow the progression of AD -all clinical trials into putative treatments have failed to prove a disease-modifying effect. One key reason for these failures is the difficulty in identifying a group of patients at early stages of the disease, where treatments are most likely to be effective.\nWhile early and accurate diagnosis of dementia can be challenging, this can be aided by quantitative biomarker measurements taken from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) samples extracted from lumbar puncture. It has been hypothesized for AD Aisen et al., 2010; Frisoni et al., 2010 ) that all these biomarkers become abnormal at different intervals before symptom onset, suggesting that Email address: tadpole@cs.ucl.ac.uk URL: http://tadpole.grand-challenge.org together they can be used for accurate prediction of onset and overall disease progression in individuals. In particular, some of the early biomarkers become abnormal decades before symptom onset, and can thus facilitate early diagnosis.\nSeveral approaches for predicting AD-related target variables (e.g. clinical diagnosis, cognitive/imaging biomarkers) have been proposed which leverage multimodal biomarker data available in AD. Traditional longitudinal approaches based on statistical regression model the relationship of the target variables with other known variables. Examples include regression of the target variables against clinical diagnosis (Scahill et al., 2002) , cognitive test scores (Yang et al., 2011; Sabuncu et al., 2011) , rate of cognitive decline (Doody et al., 2010) , and retrospectively staging subjects by time to conversion between diagnoses (Guerrero et al., 2016) . Another approach involves supervised machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, which use pattern recognition to learn the relationship between the values of a set of predictors (biomarkers) and their labels (diagnoses). These approaches have been used to discriminate AD patients from cognitively normal individuals (Kl\u00f6ppel et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) , and for discriminating at-risk individuals who convert to AD in a certain time frame from those who do not (Young et al., 2013; Mattila et al., 2011) . The emerging approach of disease progression modelling aims to reconstruct biomarker trajectories or other disease signatures across the disease progression timeline, without relying on clinical diagnoses or estimates of time to symptom onset. Examples include models built on a set of scalar biomarkers to produce discrete (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014) or continuous (Jedynak et al., 2012; Donohue et al., 2014; Villemagne et al., 2013) biomarker trajectories; richer but less comprehensive models that leverage structure in data such as MR images (Durrleman et al., 2013; Lorenzi et al., 2015; Bilgel et al., 2016) ; and models of disease mechanisms (Seeley et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012; Raj et al., 2012; Iturria-Medina et al., 2016) .\nThese models have shown promise for predicting AD biomarker progression when using existing test data, but few have been tested on truly unseen future data. Moreover, different investigators test these models on different datasets (including subsets of a single dataset) and use different processing pipelines. Community challenges have proved effective, in the medical image analysis field and beyond, for providing unbiased comparative evaluations of algorithms and tools designed for a particular task. Previous challenges that focussed on prediction of AD progression include the CADDementia challenge (Bron et al., 2015) , which aimed to predict clinical diagnosis from MRI scans. A similar challenge, the \"International challenge for automated prediction of MCI from MRI data\" (Sarica et al., 2018) asked participants to predict diagnosis and conversion status from extracted MRI features of subjects from the ADNI study (Weiner et al., 2017 ). Yet another challenge, The Alzheimer's Disease Big Data DREAM Challenge (Allen et al., 2016) , asked participants to predict cognitive decline from genetic and MRI data.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge aims to identify the data, features and approaches that are the most predictive of AD progression. In contrast to previous challenges, our motivation is to improve future clinical trials through identification of patients most likely to benefit from an effective treatment, i.e., those at early stages of disease who are likely to progress over the short-to-medium term (1-5 years). Identifying such subjects reliably helps cohort selection by focussing on groups that highlight positive treatment effects. The challenge thus focuses on forecasting three key features: clinical status, cognitive decline, and neurodegeneration (brain atrophy), over a five-year timescale. It uses rollover subjects from the ADNI study for whom a history of measurements is available, and who are expected to continue in the study, providing future measurements for testing. Since the test data does not exist at the time of forecast submissions, the challenge provides a completely unbiased basis for performance comparison. TADPOLE goes beyond previous challenges by drawing on a vast set of multimodal measurements from ADNI which support prediction of AD progression."}, {"section_title": "Competition Design", "text": "The aim of TADPOLE is to predict future outcome measurements of subjects at-risk of AD, enrolled in the ADNI study. A history of informative measurements from ADNI (imaging, psychology, demographics, genetics, etc.) from each individual is available to inform forecasts. TADPOLE participants are required to predict future measurements from these individuals and submit their predictions before a given submission deadline. Evaluation of these forecasts occurs post-deadline, after the measurements have been acquired. A diagram of the TAD-POLE flow is shown in Fig 1. "}, {"section_title": "Forecasts", "text": "Since we do not know the exact time of future data acquisitions for any given individual, TADPOLE challenge participants are required to make, for every individual, month-bymonth forecasts of three key biomarkers: (1) clinical diagnosis which can be either cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or probable Alzheimer's disease (AD); (2) ADAS-Cog13 (ADAS13) score; and (3) ventricle volume (divided by intra-cranial volume). Evaluation is performed using forecasts at the months that correspond to data acquisition. TADPOLE forecasts are required to be probabilistic and some evaluation metrics will account for forecast probabilities provided by participants. Methods or algorithms that do not produce probabilistic estimates can still be used, by setting binary probabilities (zero or one) and default confidence intervals.\nParticipants are required to submit forecasts in a standardised format (see Table 1 ). For clinical status, relative likelihoods of each option (CN, MCI, and AD) for each individual should be provided. These are normalised at evaluation time; negative likelihoods are set to zero. For ADAS13 and ventricle volume, participants need to provide a best-guess value as well as a 50% confidence interval for each individual. This 50% confidence interval (as opposed to the more standard 95%) was chosen to provide a more symmetric and less noisy evaluation of overand under-estimation of the confidence interval, because similar sample sizes of data fall inside and outside the interval."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We provide participants with a standard ADNI-derived dataset (available via the Laboratory Of NeuroImaging: LONI) which they can use to train their algorithms, removing the need to pre-process the ADNI data themselves or merge different spreadsheets. However, participants are allowed to use a custom training set, by adding any other ADNI data or data from other studies. The software code used to generate the standard dataset is openly available in a Github repository 1 and on the ADNI website, packaged with the standard dataset in the LONI ADNI database."}, {"section_title": "ADNI data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The general ADNI inclusion criteria has been described in Petersen et al. (2010) . The data we used from ADNI consists of: (1) CSF markers of amyloid-beta and tau deposition; (2) various imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) using several tracers: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG, hypometabolism), AV45 (amyloid), AV1451 (tau) as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); (3) cognitive assessments acquired in the presence of a clinical expert; (4) genetic information such as alipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status extracted from DNA samples; and (5) general demographic information.

For MRI scans, this included correction for gradient non-linearity, B1 non-uniformity correction and peak sharpening 2 . Meaningful regional features such as volume and cortical thickness were extracted using the Freesurfer crosssectional and longitudinal pipelines (Reuter et al., 2012) . Each PET image (FDG, AV45, AV1451), which consists of a series of dynamic frames, had its frames co-registered, averaged across the dynamic range, standardised with respect to the orientation and voxel size, and smoothed to produce a uniform resolution of 8mm full-width/half-max (FWHM) 3 . Standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) measures for relevant regions-ofinterest were extracted (see Jagust et al. (2010) ) after registering the PET images to corresponding MR images using the SPM5 software (Ashburner, 2009) . DTI scans were corrected for head motion and eddy-current distortion, skull-stripped, EPIcorrected, and finally aligned to the T1 scans using the pipeline from Nir et al. (2013) .

The data set contains a set of measurements for every individual that has provided data to ADNI in at least two separate visits (different dates) across three phases of the study: ADNI1, ADNI GO, and ADNI2.\n\u2022 D2: The TADPOLE longitudinal prediction set contains as much available data as we could gather from the ADNI rollover individuals for whom challenge participants are asked to provide forecasts. D2 includes all available timepoints for these individuals.\n\u2022 D3: The TADPOLE cross-sectional prediction set contains a single (most recent) time point and a limited set of variables from each rollover individual in D2. Although we expect worse forecasts from this data set than D2, D3 represents the information typically available when selecting a cohort for a clinical trial.\nThe forecasts will be evaluated on future data (D4 -test set) from ADNI3 rollovers, acquired after the challenge submission deadline. In addition to the three standard datasets (D1, D2 and D3), challenge participants are allowed to use any other data sets that might serve as useful additional training data. Fig. 2 shows a diagram highlighting the nested structure of datasets D1-D3. Table 2 shows the proportion of biomarker data available in each dataset. There are a considerable number of entries with missing data, especially for some biomarkers such as tau imaging (AV1451). We also estimated the expected number of subjects and available data for D4, using information from the ADNI3 procedures and using rollovers from previous ADNI studies (Table 2 , right-most column) -See Appendix A for more information on D4 estimates. Based on our estimates, we believe the size of D4 (around 330 subjects, 1 visit/subject) should be enough for a reliable evaluation of TADPOLE submissions."}, {"section_title": "Submissions", "text": "There are two kinds of submissions that challenge participants can make. A simple entry requires a minimal forecast and a description of methods; it makes participants eligible for the prizes but not co-authorship on the scientific paper documenting the results. A simple entry can use any training data or prediction sets and forecast at least one of the target outcome variables (clinical status, ADAS13 score, or ventricle volume). A full entry entitles participants for consideration as a co-author on the publication documenting the results. Such a full entry requires a complete forecast for all three outcome variables on all subjects from the D2 prediction set, along with a description of the methods. Each individual participant is limited to a maximum of three submissions. This restriction has been introduced to avoid the risk of participants tuning their method on the test set by submitting multiple predictions for a range of algorithm settings. Although not required for a full entry, participants are strongly encouraged to submit predictions also for D3. Prizes are awarded to the best entries regardless of the choice of training sets (D1/custom) and prediction sets (D2/D3). However, the additional submissions support the key scientific aims of the challenge by allowing us to separate the influence of the choice of training data, post-processing pipelines, and modelling techniques or prediction algorithms. The target variables used for evaluation, in particular ventricle volume, will use the same post-processing pipeline as the standard data sets D1-D3.\nBeyond the standard training dataset (D1), participants can include additional forecasts from \"custom\" (i.e. constructed by the participant) training data or custom post-processing of the raw data from subjects in the standard training set. The same applies to the prediction sets D2 and D3, which can be customised by the participants if desired, e.g. a prediction set with different features from the same individuals as in D2 and D3. Table 3 shows the twelve possible combinations of subject sets, processing and prediction sets, from which a full-entry submission must contain at least one of the first four (ID 1-4)."}, {"section_title": "Forecast Evaluation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical Status Prediction", "text": "For evaluation of clinical status predictions, we will use similar metrics to those that proved effective in the CADDementia Figure 2 : Venn diagram of the ADNI datasets for training (D1), longitudinal prediction (D2), cross-sectional prediction (D3) and the test set (D4).

The balanced accuracy for class i is then:\nwhere TP, FP, TN, FN represent the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives for classification as class i. In this case, true positives are data points with true label i and correctly classified as such, while the false negatives are the data points with true label i and incorrectly classified to a different class j i.

Finally, in order to enable participants to share algorithm performance results throughout the competition, we created a leaderboard system 6 that evaluates submissions on an existing test dataset and publishes the results live on our website.\nGoing forward, we hope that by November 2018 sufficient data will be available from ADNI3 rollovers for a first meaningful evaluation of the forecasts. We plan to publish the results on the website in January 2019, and then submit a publication of the results soon after. However, we reserve the right to delay evaluation until sufficient data is available.

Expected number of subjects and available data for D4\nWe estimated the number of subjects and available data in D4 (Table 2 , last column) using information from the ADNI procedures manual and previous ADNI rollovers. For estimating the total number of subjects (first row) expected in D4, we computed the dropout rate (0.36) based on ADNI1 rollovers to ADNI2, then multiplied it by the total number of subjects in D2 (896). For estimating the proportions of each diagnostic category (third row), we used the proportion of diagnostic rates in D2 and multiplied them with conversion rates within 1 year from ADNI1/GO/2 (see website FAQ). For estimating the average number of visits per subject (mean \u00b1 std.) in D4 (second row), we used the proportions for each diagnostic group and considered one visit per subject (ADNI procedures). We set the standard deviation to be zero, although in practice this won't be the case.\nFor estimating the available biomarker data (lower half of table), we used a 1-year time-frame from start of ADNI2 (July 2012 -July 2013 and computed the proportion of available data in that time frame. For AV1451, we used the same estimate as for AV45, due to the fact that the scan was introduced later on in ADNI2, and we expect more subjects to undergo AV1451 scans in ADNI3.
