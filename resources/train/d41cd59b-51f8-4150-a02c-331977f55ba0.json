To evaluate the magnitude of these contributions, emission avoidance contributions for field and farmstead windbreak designs in regions across the United States were estimated, along with greenhouse gas (GHG) emission budgets for corn, soybean, winter wheat, and potato operations. We looked at farming scenarios with large (600 ha), mid (300 ha), and small-size (60 ha) farms containing farmsteads built before and after 2000, and growing different cropping systems. Windbreak scenarios were assumed to be up to 5% of the crop area for field windbreaks, while emission avoidance for farmstead windbreaks were assumed to provide a 10% and 25% reduction in energy usage for space conditioning and heating, respectively. Total reduction of C equivalent (CE) emissions by windbreaks on farm systems ranged from a low of 0.9 Mg CE year \u22121 for a 60-ha farm with a home built before 2000 to 39.1 Mg CE year \u22121 for a 600-ha farm with a home built after 2000. By reducing fossil fuel usage from farm operations, windbreaks provide a promising strategy for reducing GHG emissions from agriculture in the USA."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Carbon (C) storage and emission reduction approaches are being examined as greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies [1] . One such approach is a change in consumptive behavior resulting in reduction in fossil fuel usage, also referred to as avoided GHG emissions. In the agricultural sector, forestry and agroforestry are recognized as a suite of management practices that, besides providing several climate change adaptation services, can also provide both C sequestration and avoided GHG emission opportunities [2] . Within the suite of practices, incorporating field and farmstead windbreak practices into farm management plans seems to be a particularly promising option for storing carbon and for reducing emissions from farm operations [3] .\nPlanting field windbreaks on agricultural lands reduces the cropping area, but generally more than compensates for this loss by increasing crop yields [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . This reduction in land being farmed leads to a reduction in fuel use and other inputs (avoided emissions) as well as to other indirect benefits [3] . Avoided emissions via windbreaks on farms can also be achieved through the use of living snow fences, which reduces the need to clear snow from roads following snow events, which reduces fuel usage [12, 13] , and through the use of farmstead windbreaks, which reduces energy needs for home heating and cooling [14] [15] [16] [17] . Readers are referred to [18] for more information on windbreaks and these services. Information on the indirect impacts of agroforestry practices on the C budget of a farm is limited compared to C sequestration in the woody biomass of windbreak trees [19] . Rudimentary calculations by [3] suggest that the contribution of avoided emissions to the C budget may be even greater than sequestration contributions. Many believe trees belong only to forests; however, trees on farms such as in windbreaks, riparian zones, and orchards or woodlots make significant contributions to the C budget by storing C and avoiding fossil fuels emissions from farms operations. Here we consider the potential value of these agricultural 'trees outside of forests', specifically trees in windbreaks within farm operations, as a GHG mitigation strategy. The main objective of this study was to assess the indirect C effects of field and farmstead windbreaks and the magnitude of these values within a farm's C budget."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "The basic input needs of a typical farm operation were developed based on published crop budgets for corn, soybean, potato, and winter wheat operations in Nebraska, Tennessee, Ohio, Montana, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Idaho, Colorado, and Kansas as representative states of the nine regions we defined ( Figure 1 ). Data from these locations and cropping systems were used to estimate C equivalent (CE) emissions for the various farm operations. Because energy use for irrigation was considerable, crops were grouped as either irrigated or as non-irrigated cropping operations. It was assumed that 5 percent of the crop area was removed from production and occupied by field windbreaks. Five percent was selected as it is the threshold for the economic advantage of field windbreaks. If more than 5% of the land is planted to windbreaks it is very difficult to justify field windbreaks from a purely economic position. In other words, giving up 5% or less of the land to windbreaks pays; whereas above 5% we start losing profit from grain production [20] . From these areas, the reduction of fuel, fertilizer, and pesticide use was calculated. Data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) of the U.S. Energy Information Administration [21] were used to estimate farmstead size and use of electricity, natural gas, propane, and other fuels in different climatic zones (Figure 1 ). The available data in the crop budgets for energy use are reported in different units, such as volume (mL, gal, L), weight (oz., kg, Mg, cwt), units of energy (BTU), and electricity (kWh). To standardize these units, the carbon equivalent (CE) approach [23] and the Farm Energy Analysis Tool (FEAT) [24] were used. The reductions in emissions resulting from the adoption of field and farmstead windbreaks on small (60 ha), medium (300 ha), and large (600 ha) farms were calculated using these values.

Data from five different climatic zones (Zone 1 through Zone 5, Figure 1) were acquired from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA) [21] .\nBecause new homes consumed 21% less energy for space heating on average than older homes [21] , rural homes over a range of ages (built before and after 2000) were subsampled from the general data. Those years was chosen because the analysis from the EIA's most recent Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) shows that U.S. homes built in 2000 and later consume more energy on average than homes built prior to 2000. From this new database, fifteen variables were analyzed to define the energy used in each climate zone per home type (Table A2 ).\nThe energy units of these variables were converted from BTU to kWh \u22121 and to Mg CE using values listed above in Table 1 . The conversion from energy sources to CE was based on [35] ; protocols for estimating kg CE are described in Table A3 .\nThe total CE emissions were calculated for rural homes for all energy sources.

Potato systems showed the highest emissions per hectare (1.01 to 1.51 Mg CE ha \u22121 ) (Table A4); followed by corn (0.25 to 0.81 Mg CE ha \u22121 ); winter wheat (0.16 to 0.53 Mg CE ha \u22121 ); and soybean (0.16 to 0.33 Mg CE ha \u22121 ). The amount of CEs emitted depends on the farmers' decisions and environmental conditions (Table A1 through Table A7 (e.g., Table A5 Id #20 and #21)). Mean CE estimates of the irrigated and non-irrigated crop systems In these values, the main difference in the energy use comes from diesel fuel and fertilizers in all irrigated crops, especially in potato and corn systems. It follows then that a reduction in the number of hectares farmed significantly reduces the CE emissions from those hectares.\nNo significant differences in CE emissions were found between houses built before and after 2000. The total CE emissions ranged from 4.5 to 8.1 and 4.1 to 7.4 Mg CE year \u22121 per house built before and after 2000, respectively.

As expected, the better the insulation, the lower the CE emitted. Data also indicated northern region homes tended to emit more CE per home than those located in more southern regions. This is most likely due to typical central air conditioners in the south being about four times more energy efficient than a typical furnace or boiler in the north [41] . "}, {"section_title": "Reduction of Emissions by Windbreaks on Agricultural Lands", "text": "Overall, we estimated that the use of field and farmstead windbreaks can reduce emissions from farming operations from a low of 0.01 Mg CE ha \u22121 year \u22121 for some windbreak scenarios (e.g., soybean on small Arkansas farms) to a high of 0.7 Mg CE ha \u22121 year \u22121 (e.g., large farm scenarios with potato in Massachusetts). Overall, for all farm scenarios considered, the mean reduction in emissions attributable to windbreaks ranged from 0.8 to 39.1 Mg CE for small (60 ha) and large farm (600 ha), respectively (Table A8 ). The lowest reduced emissions occurred in scenarios containing soybean and winter wheat systems, with the highest in potato systems. The mean reduced emissions, for small and large farms, were equivalent to 0.02 to 0.05 Mg CE ha \u22121 year \u22121 , respectively.\nPotato farming scenarios with windbreaks for all regions analyzed had the greatest reduction in emissions. Potato crops are highly intensive in the use of fuel and chemicals, especially nitrogen (Figure 2 ). These potential reductions for potato systems were estimated to be between 3.3 and 39.1 Mg CE for small and large farms containing a farmstead. On a per hectare basis, potential reductions in emissions for all farming scenarios with potato and windbreaks were 0.06 and 0.07 Mg CE ha \u22121 , for small and large potato farms, respectively.\nReduced emissions for corn farming scenarios with windbreaks ranged from 1.2 to 24.7 Mg CE for small and large farms, respectively. When furrow irrigated, corn on large farms displayed the highest avoided emissions (24.7 Mg CE) (Table A8 ). This irrigation system includes lower pumping costs per acre-inch of water pumped despite its greater labor costs and lower application efficiency compared to sprinkler and subsurface drip irrigation [42, 43] . On a per hectare basis, emissions ranged from 0.02 to 0.04 Mg CE ha \u22121 for small and large farms.\nAvoided emissions for soybean farming scenarios with windbreaks were 0.8 and 9.6 Mg CE for small and large farms, respectively. The highest emission reduction values occurred in the Corn Belt region (Iowa) for herbicide-tolerant soybean. The lowest reduction of emissions by windbreaks corresponded to non-irrigated soybean in the Corn Belt (Ohio) ( Table A8 ). These reduced CE emission scenarios were equivalent to 0.01 and 0.02 Mg CE ha \u22121 for small and large farms, respectively.\nReduction of carbon emissions of windbreaks on winter wheat farming scenarios ranged from 0.9 to 15.6 Mg CE for small and large farms, respectively. The highest reduction was found in non-irrigated winter wheat under conventional tillage and fallow rotations, while the lowest reduction was found for sprinkler-irrigated continuous wheat in the southern Rocky Mountains region (Colorado). Overall, reduced emissions on these farms were equivalent to 0.02 and 0.03 Mg CE ha \u22121 .\nThe CE equivalent emissions for farming scenarios with irrigated and non-irrigated crop systems on small and large farms built after 2000 are summarized in Table 4a . The avoided C emissions after planting windbreaks on 5% of area of the irrigated and non-irrigated farming scenarios are presented in Table 4b . Our calculations indicate that windbreaks may have the potential to provide the largest reduction in C equivalent emissions in irrigated potato systems, while their contributions in the rainfed winter wheat systems were the least. This was most likely due to the large amounts of fertilizer and fuel used in potato systems that were then partially reduced by use of field windbreaks.\nFrom these results, we calculated the potential reduction in C emissions for a national windbreak program encompassing 1 million ha (2.47 million acres) of agricultural lands. A program designed to establish windbreaks on 17,000 small; 3300 medium; or 1700 large farms would plant approximately 0.05 million ha (0.12 million acres) of windbreaks, thereby removing that area from production. Over a year's cropping cycle, emissions ranging from 9660 (non-irrigated soybean system) to 65,363 Mg CE year \u22121 (irrigated potato system) could potentially be avoided on 0.05 million ha (Table 4c ). The reductions were equivalent to 0.193 for non-irrigated soybean systems to 1.3 Mg CE year \u22121 for irrigated potato systems. During the 50-year lifespan of the windbreaks, we could expect a reduction in emissions on the order of 0.5 and 3.3 Tg CE. Values based on the number of farms for each size that can be placed within a million ha: 17,000 ha (small), 3300 ha (medium), and 7700 ha (large); 2 To derive the amount of CE per ha, the total amount of CE is divided by the number of ha of small, median, or large farms."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Agriculture has been identified as one of the anthropogenic activities that produce substantial amounts of GHGs [44] . At the global, regional, and local scale, agriculture is considered the largest source of anthropogenic N 2 O and CH 4 [45] , contributing 52% of global methane and 84% of global nitrous oxide emissions [46] . Around the world, agricultural systems continue to add C to the atmosphere by using fossil fuels in machinery, using chemicals and other inputs, and cultivating soil, which results in a dynamic release of C [47] . A global analysis of soil C loss following cultivation of forests or grasslands shows a 20% reduction of the initial soil organic carbon (SOC), or approximately 1500 g m \u22122 in the top 0.3 m of the soil [48] and 30% SOC loss within 20 years following cultivation, with the greatest loss in the first five years [49] .\nConversely, agriculture is also an accumulator of C, offsetting losses when the organic matter (OM) accumulates in the soil [49] or when aboveground woody biomass acts either as a semi-permanent sink or is used as an energy source [23, 48] . Many studies have estimated that farms are responsible for about 13% of total global emissions, making it the world's second-largest C source, after energy production [23] . After 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) many countries have committed to trying to hold global warming to no more than 2 \u2022 C above preindustrial levels [50] .\nMost agro-ecosystems have the potential to store C. Pastures, agroforestry, and forest ecosystems tend to lead in soil C storage. In some regions, large agricultural areas represent a considerable potential for enhancing the rate of C sequestration through management activities that reverse the effects of cultivation on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools [51] . In these cases, refilling depleted soil C pools via woody biomass production may result in much higher rates of SOC storage than the accumulation of passive soil C [52] .\nWindbreaks, used in support of agriculture production, not only contribute to GHG mitigation through C storage in woody biomass and soils [53] , but also provide additional indirect benefits by: (1) reducing the farm's use of fossil fuels, (2) reducing the energy used for heating and cooling homes and other buildings, (3) reducing the inputs applied to crops and livestock, (4) providing more diversity for wildlife habitat [54] , and reducing irrigation needs, which has an significant impact on fresh water use for agriculture [55] . Along with these GHG mitigation services, agroforestry practices also provide numerous adaptive services, including diversifying crop production systems to buffer the income risks associated with climatic variability [56] . Much research remains before reliable information and models can be developed to guide the use and management of these spatially and temporally complex systems that can themselves be impacted by shifting conditions [57, 58] .\nThis study provides information specific to just the indirect benefits of windbreaks from avoided C emissions resulting from the reduced use of fossil fuels and other energy-intensive inputs in these different farming scenarios. By providing protection to different crop systems and farmsteads, windbreaks could cut the use of fuel and agricultural inputs by almost 5% and reduce the use of energy for heating and cooling farmsteads by 10% to 25% [3, 16, 59] .\nThe potential C emission reduction value for farms with farmstead windbreaks was greatest in those areas with cold winter winds. However, farmsteads in all regions could potentially derive some level of benefits from properly designed windbreaks. The greatest economic benefit was derived from the energy savings from the reduction in air infiltration rates [3] . These results are corroborated in this study when our savings varied with climate conditions (locations) and the type of insulation.\nOn small farms the largest proportion of emission avoidance is a result of the farmstead windbreak and the largest proportion of the C stored is in the farmstead windbreak. Small farm scenarios are therefore more likely to approach C neutrality, potentially storing and/or avoiding more than they emit, through use of windbreaks.\nFurther reduction of emissions in such farming operations can be accomplished through inclusion of other activities, such as soil conservation practices [60, 61] ; optimizing fertilizer use [62] [63] [64] ; improving irrigation systems [65] ; and reducing the energy use in farmsteads [66] . In reality, for a farm operation to approach a net zero emission status, the strategic use of several of these activities will be required, with windbreaks being just one.\nThe contribution of tress in windbreak arrangements on agricultural lands can indirectly reduce input use through the increase of crop productivity. The literature suggests that windbreaks can increase crop yields levels [67] above what would be necessary to compensate for the area withdrawn from crop production [3] . These authors indicated that this additional production will reduce the rate at which additional crop area will need to be added in the future to meet growing food needs. This could potentially lead to a further reduction in the use of fuel and fertilizer and reductions to atmospheric GHG levels. Adding all these reductions and the potential of windbreak trees to directly store C from the atmosphere [20] through their woody structures, windbreaks seem to be a promising strategy to help mitigate the impact of agriculture on global GHG.\nAnother aspect is that the greatest effects of trees in windbreaks result in years when the extremes of cold, dry, windy conditions, and/or hot, dry, windy conditions are most prevalent [49] . Moreover, these agroforestry practices are also recognized for reducing soil erosion and increasing crop yields in the case of small grains [68] [69] [70] ; however, other research indicates no consistent trends in benefits to small grains [71, 72] . These results indicate that the effects of windbreaks on crop yields have no conclusive results; for this reason, more research is needed [73, 74] . Despite these appealing results, some uncertainties remain, such as the difference between actual and modeled energy consumption from USDA survey [21] , the permanent change from home heating and cooling appliances and energy sources, and the uncertainties of future warming [62] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The avoided CE emissions from fewer acres farmed and less energy used for heating and cooling the farmstead make windbreaks a promising strategy for reducing the impact of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions.
