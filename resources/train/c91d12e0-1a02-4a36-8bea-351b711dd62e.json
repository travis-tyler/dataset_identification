[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A recent class of factor demand models is discussed and used to analyze U.S. state-level production data. The approach accommodates output risk, heterogeneous technologies, technological change, endogenous variables, aggregation across agents, and more general flexible functional forms than previous models. We find the approach to flexibility found in the consumer literature empirically useful in the analysis of producer behavior as our results suggest that standard flexible models that have been ubiquitous in agricultural and industrial research are strongly rejected here in favor of a more general and flexible specification. Further, there is substantial heterogeneity of conditional own-price elasticities across states."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Cost Model", "text": "The approach taken here stems from the conceptual model of LaFrance and Pope (2010) . It is briefly reviewed focusing on issues of empirical implementation. Two common issues in economic models of production are: (1) most agricultural data has been aggregated across production units -across fields on a farm, farms in a county, state, country, or region; and (2) in agricultural production, most inputs are committed to production before outputs are realized, leading to latent variables in input demand equations.\nJoint production in agriculture often is expressed as a function of planned, or expected, outputs. When this is true, the model of LaFrance and Pope (2010) identifies the necessary and sufficient condition for variable input demands to be functions of input prices, quasi-fixed inputs, and total variable cost. The essential features of this model are the following. Let \nT is a standard joint production possibilities set. Suppose that C can be expressed as ( , , ) ( , , ( , )). \nThe cost function is increasing in outputs, implying that C \uf025 is monotonic in .\n\uf071 \uf025 Solving (1) for ( , , ) , C"}, {"section_title": "\uf071 \uf047 \uf03d W Z \uf025", "text": "where \uf047 is the inverse of C \uf025 with respect to , \uf071 \uf025 and substituting this into the right-hand side of (2), gives ( , , ( , , ) ) ( , , ) .\nThus, input demands are functions of input prices, quasi-fixed inputs, and cost.\nOne motivation for this specification is the choice functions in (3) are based entirely on observable measures. Production risk is one reason this is a reasonable approach to modeling ex ante cost functions -output levels that are planned or expected at planting time are unknown and unobservable (Pope and Chavas, 1994; Just, 1996, 1998; Moschini, 2001) . It has been argued that expected/planned output alone does not adequately characterize cost minimizing behavior under risk aversion (e.g. Pope and Chavas, 1994) , in which case the state-contingent approach of Chambers and Quiggin (1998, 2000) is likely more appropriate. Re-defining Y as a vector of state-contingent outputs in equation (1) accommodates this alternative. Thus, while our approach is largely motivated from an ex ante cost function perspective, it is sufficiently general to accommodate the state-contingent effort-cost function of Chambers and Quiggin (2000) .\nFurthermore, one can also apply conventional errors-in-variables language, where Y is the true measure of outputs and Y is outputs measured with error.\nIf joint production also is subject to constant returns to scale -a well-accepted stylized fact in agriculture -then the variable cost function is homogeneous of degree one in ( , ) .\nY Z 3 Dividing through by the last element of the quasi-fixed input vector -acres of farmland in the application below -gives the variable cost function in the normalized form ( , , ( , ) The cost function also is homogeneous of degree one in variable input prices. Dividing through by the th N price -the farm wage rate in the empirical application -gives the cost function in real terms as ( , , ( , ) The empirical specification for variable costs follows Ball et al. (2010) , which is essentially the same as the example in LaFrance and Pope (2010) with some minor notational differences. Let capital, k, be a quasi-fixed input, let t reflect exogenous technical change, set 1, n N \uf03d \uf02d and define the functions, \nApplying Hotelling's/Shephard's lemma to (5) and rearranging terms gives the j th input demand in real expenditure per acre for state i in year t as dependent variables as,\nwhere ijt ijt ijt e w x \uf03d is real expenditure per acre and ijt u is a random error term. See section A2 in the supplementary material for the derivation of (6) ------------4 As such, the separability assumption represents a potential limitation in our approach, and we are unable to directly test the relevance of this assumption in the empirical application. Such tests are difficult in practice (see Moschini, Moro, and Green, 1994 and references therein) and, in the current context, would need to directly address the bias induced by the inclusion of outputs, which are measured with error. One might consider using an errors-in-variables approach to overcome this bias, however these estimators are often difficult to implement in practice and further complicated by the inherently nonlinear cost function (Moschini, 2001; Amemiya, 1985) .\n5 One could write the input demand system in terms of quantities or cost shares. This changes the exponents on cost and input prices in the leading terms on the right-hand side of (6) as well as the properties of the error terms, . We introduce cross-sectional heterogeneity through the state-specific 0i \uf061 parameters, which is similar in spirit to commonly used linear unobserved effects panel data models (Wooldridge, 2010, chapter 10) . Given the nonlinearity of the model, these parameters permit heterogeneous levels, slopes, and curvatures of the input demands with respect to prices, cost, quasi-fixed inputs, technical change, and structural breaks. In addition, this parameterization permits heterogeneous expansion paths, as well as heterogeneous elasticities of substitution between factors and factor demand price elasticities.\n7 Thus, this framework provides a rich environment for incorporating production heterogeneity within a panel data setting."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "This model is nonlinear in variable cost, creating aggregation properties similar to those in the theory of consumer choice (see LaFrance, 2008; Lafrance et al., 2006; and references therein) . In the present case, after some algebra, three functions of cost appear on the right-hand side of (6) Thus, the number and functional form of the terms involving real input prices and variable costs are both nested in this specification. Section A3 of the supplementary material demonstrates how more simplified versions of this model are nested within (6). Since the non-linearity and large number of parameters in the general model are potentially difficult to work with in practice, these more simplified alternatives might prove attractive in other settings and can be easily tested for given the nested structure."}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "The estimation method is a parametric form of GMM. As noted in the introduction, due to the appearance of the nonlinear fixed effects parameters, equation (6) cannot identify state-specific random effects. It remains possible that the ijt u are serially correlated over time, have state-level ------------ 6 We account for technical change using a linear time trend in the specification for the \u03b1 parameters. Given that these parameters enter the model nonlinearly, this in turn implies that we are allowing for a nonlinear effect of technology on both variable costs in equation (5) and input demands in equation (6). If one were interested in evaluating stochastic efficiency, as distinguished from technological change, they might consider a stochastic frontier demand model as in Schmidt and Lovell (1979) . Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) provide a fairly recent survey of this literature. 7 As discussed in the Economic Regularity and Elasticity Estimates subsection below, the inclusion of the \u03b1 0i parameters permit heterogeneity in the cost function and factor demand equations, which in turn permit heterogeneity of the Hessian matrix. As can be shown from (5) this in turn induces heterogeneity for many elasticities that are used to summarize production technology, such as factor price demand elasticities as well as Allen-Uzawa and Morishima factor substitution elasticities. 8 Although not considered here, additional flexibility could be incorporated by allowing the parameters associated with higher order price effects ( , and, B \uf067\uf02c \uf064 ) to vary cross-sectionally given parameter identification. \nis finite, symmetric, positive definite, and has ones on the main diagonal, , .\nrecovers the iid random variables.

Steps (1) and (5) are the first and last stage of the typical NL3SLS estimator. Conditional on the instrument set, this procedure produces consistent, asymptotically normal parameter estimates (Rothenberg and Leenders, 1964) . One can check for additional heteroskedasticity of an unknown form with robust standard errors (White, 1980; MacKinnon and White, 1985) . Results of doing so for this data set are reported in the empirical section."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The main data set analyzed in the empirical application is a state-level annual time series panel on U.S. agricultural production. This data set is compiled and maintained by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is described in detail in Ball et al. (2004) , and is commonly known as the Ball data. This data contains measures of variable input quantities, prices, and expenditures, farm capital, land in farms, and variables relating to realized (ex post) farm production and revenues. For this particular application we require data on variable input prices and expenditures, farm capital, and land in farms. The additional explanatory variable in equation (6) is variable cost, which essentially replaces farm outputs in the demand equations and is constructed as the sum of input expenditures.\nTo match the data used in the empirical application as closely as possible to the above theory, we modify the Ball data in three important ways. The measure of own labor cost in the Ball data is calculated from off-farm employment surveys and nonfarm wage rates. We use the farm wage for own labor cost so that management skill is assigned to the owner/operator's net return to farming. A recent ERS survey found that 98 percent of U.S. farms are family farms (Hoppe and Banker, 2006) . El-Osta (2011) and references therein provide an excellent overview of the difficulties associated with the valuation of human capital in a family farm setting. In general, one can either incorporate a \"management\" premium for the owner into the farm labor wage, or value the owner's wage using the hired-labor wage rate and allow the premium to be reflected in the returns-to-operation. The former likely introduces significant measurement error into the wage variable as correctly measuring this premium is difficult in practice. This error would be especially problematic for our empirical application as we use wage as the num\u00e9raire to normalize input prices (Pope, LaFrance, and Just, 2007) . Thus, we follow the latter approach.\nThe Ball data also contains an imputed value of capital that relies on a host of assumptions and secondary estimates. We use direct estimates of the value of farm capital from annual surveys reported by the ERS. The accounting of on-farm capital stocks and flows has received much attention in the literature. An excellent overview is provided in Andersen, Alston, and Pardey (2011) . The most widely used measures are those of the Ball and InSTePP series. 10 The primary difference between the Ball and InSTePP series is that the former uses the perpetual inventory method while the later uses a physical inventory method . In addition, estimates also differ in their treatment of depreciation and the retirement of capital assets, as well as the sources and categories of data used . Thus, the selection of an appropriate capital series is not straightforward due to the different inventory methodologies and the various underlying assumptions required in using them. We focus here instead on direct estimates of capital stock from ERS balance sheet data. The slope estimate from a regression of our capital series on the Ball series is 0.77 with an r-squared of 0.89; thus, our measure is closely aligned to the Ball series.\nFinally, we relate farmland to the Census of Agriculture, published in 1954 Agriculture, published in , 1959 Agriculture, published in , 1964 Agriculture, published in , 1969 Agriculture, published in , 1974 Agriculture, published in , 1978 Agriculture, published in , 1982 Agriculture, published in , 1987 Agriculture, published in , 1992 Agriculture, published in , 1997 Agriculture, published in , 2002 Agriculture, published in , and 2007 . In each year in our sample that coincides with a Census year, we use the Census data for land in farms. In other years, we use ERS estimates of the acres harvested of major crops in each state to adjust the Ball data. The difference in each state between farmland in the Ball data and the ERS measure of harvested acres is calculated for years that did not have a Census report. For each three-to four-year period between adjacent Census years, the average of this difference is added to harvested acres to connect annual changes in farmland to annual changes in crop acres.\nOur proposed estimation method relies on instrumental variables methods, so identification requires that the instruments are correlated with the endogenous regressors and uncorrelated with the error terms. The first group of instrumental variables include national averages of the real input prices, variable cost per acre, and the real value of capital per acre, all lagged two periods to ensure they are predetermined and thus uncorrelated with the error terms. These instruments are potentially weak given the two-period lag construction. To address this concern, our second group of instrumental variables includes contemporaneous variables for the general U.S. economy: per capita disposable income, unemployment, the rate of return on AAA corporate 30-year bonds, the manufacturing wage, the producer's price index (PPI) for materials and components, and the PPI for fuels, energy and power."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Although contemporaneous, the variables in the second group are unlikely to be correlated with the error term as U.S. agriculture is a small sector of the U.S. economy with approximately 2% of employment and less than 1\u00bd% of GDP. California is the largest farm economy, accounting for less than \u00bc% of U.S. GDP. As a result, the effects of changes in any state's farm prices, production costs, or value of capital will be far smaller on the general economy than the impact of changes in the general economy on that state's farm economy.\n------------10 Data and documentation for the InSTePP data can be found at www.instepp.umn.edu, and Pardey et al. (2011) provides additional details for the capital series. 11 Per capita income is deflated by the consumer price index (CPI) for all items, the manufacturing wage and wholesale price indices are deflated by the implicit price deflator (IPD) for gross domestic product (GDP), and the real rate of return on corporate bonds is the nominal rate minus the percentage annual change in the CPI.\nEach general economy variable is considered a valid instrument for a specific explanatory variable. The manufacturing wage is a measure of the opportunity cost of farm work and serves as an instrument for the farm wage. Income affects the demand for agricultural products and serves as an instrument for the cost of production. The rate of return on corporate bonds is a measure of the opportunity cost of investing in agriculture. The PPI for fuels, energy and power is an instrument for the farm costs of fuels, energy, and agricultural chemicals, which are largely hydrocarbon based. The PPI for materials and components is an instrument for the farm cost of materials. Our final set of instruments includes both groups mentioned above as well as a time trend.\nThe adding up condition requires that one input demand equation must be omitted from the estimated model. Farm labor is excluded from the estimated equations in this study. Input prices and variable cost are deflated by the farm wage to satisfy homogeneity. Input demands estimated are energy, agricultural chemicals, and materials. Lagging the aggregate farm-level instruments shortens the sample period two years. Thus, 1,824 observations on 3 variable inputs, 48 states, and 38 years are used to estimate the input demand model. The final (normalized) input expenditure, variable cost, capital, and input price series were tested for unit roots using the Im, Pesaran and Shin (2003) procedure for heterogeneous panels. We reject the null hypothesis that all panels have unit roots at standard significance levels for each of the series (all p-values are less than 0.01).\nThere are 144 input demand equations and 12 instruments, thus generating 1,728 moments for estimation. There are 599 model parameters, so the model is significantly over-identified and testing the model was important. We test this using the omnibus test, Hansen's (1982) J-statistic, and fail to reject the null hypothesis (that the orthogonal conditions hold) at the one percent significance level. This implies that the demand model is reasonably specified."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "This section reports our empirical findings as they relate to structural breaks, the stochastic process for the error terms, and the functional form of the input demand equations. The final subsection analyzes the economic regularity of the estimated cost model and reports own-price elasticity estimates for the factor demands. Gutierrez et al. (2007) investigates the role that structural breaks play in the agricultural economy with respect to finding a stable relationship between farmland prices and land rents. They use a panel data set of 31 U.S. states over the time period 1960-2000. They find that all states have at some point been subject to structural breaks."}, {"section_title": "Structural Breaks", "text": "The results of Gutierrez et al. (2007) show considerable evidence of structural breaks in 1973 and 1986. The former is the beginning of the period of rapid commodity price inflation that followed the OPEC oil embargo. The latter is the start of major reforms in agricultural policy during the Reagan administration, including a movement to decouple farm subsidy payments from agricultural production, and lower price and income support levels overall. During the mid to late 1970s, U.S. agriculture experienced oil price shocks, a high rate of growth in farm income, growth in net agricultural exports with a falling exchange rate, and poor weather conditions in competing production regions. On the other hand, increased uncertainty in the expected returns to agricultural investment, high real interest rates, and lower commodity prices and support levels have characterized the farm economy since the second half of the 1980s.\nTests for structural breaks also are conducted in this paper. There are many diagnostic procedures for testing the adequacy of a model's specification and parameter stability (Brown et al., 1975; Ploberger and Kr\u00e4mer, 1992) . The methods in LaFrance (2008) \nwhere the s \uf074 are parameters to be estimated and the dummy variables \nThe s \uf074 are unrestricted across states and inputs, but enter the model as structural parameters to accommodate economic theory both before and after the structural breaks.\nThe top panel of Figure 1 reports box plots of the test statistics for each input in each state, and for the system overall, in the absence of structural breaks.

We calculate \uf0b5 33 H at each state-year observation and find that 96% of the associated eigenvalues are negative.\nFinally, we evaluate the model's ability to capture heterogeneous technology across states. Because the demand equations are quadratic forms in the s, \uf061 the state-specific fixed effects in the model influence the levels, slopes, and curvatures of the input demand equations with respect to all explanatory variables. To illustrate these effects, we calculate demand elasticities using 1 ( ) ( ),\nwhere i w and i q are nominal input prices and input quantities, and ( ) i x \uf044 is an N\u00d7N diagonal matrix with i x as the i th main diagonal element. We have included a subscript i for the Hessian matrix to emphasize that it varies across states. 14 These elasticities are calculated for each stateyear pair in the data. Figure 5 reports histograms and kernel density estimates of time-averaged state-level own-price elasticities. This figure clearly demonstrates the model's ability to capture a wide range of price response, which would not be apparent from aggregate U.S. data. 15 The estimated density functions show that own-price elasticities are all negative and vary ------------ 14 Even if one were to hold input prices, capital, and cost constant across states, the Hessian would still vary across states due to the state-specific parameters \u03b1 0i in both the cost function and factor demand equations. 15 The time-averaged state-level elasticities are calculated as follows. First, we calculate a full set of in-sample elasticities for every state-year pair. Next, for each state we average the elasticities across time, which results in 48 cross-sectional observations for each elasticity E jj' . substantially across states. Two inputs that are often of policy interest are energy and agricultural chemicals, which tend to have the most elastic input demand functions. Table 3 reports summary statistics for the state-level own-price elasticities for labor, energy, and chemicals by NASS production region. Several interesting patterns emerge. First, input use is price inelastic in all regions, except chemicals in New Mexico (-1.22 ) and Arizona (-1.02), and labor in Arizona (-1.71). Second, chemicals is the most price elastic input across all regions. Farm expenditures on chemicals is a large portion of total production expenses relative to labor and energy (USDA, 2012) . From a policy perspective it is interesting that this also is the most price sensitive variable input. The highest own-price elasticities for agricultural chemicals occur in the West, and the lowest occur in the South. For individual states, New Mexico (-1.22) is the most price sensitive while Florida is the least (-0.57), which is not surprising given the adverse (favorable) production climate in New Mexico (Florida). Finally, labor has the lowest own-price response in all regions except the West, where some of the largest absolute own-price elasticities are observed (Arizona at -1.71, New Mexico at -0.97, and Colorado at -0.92). Interestingly, labor accounts for roughly twenty percent of total production expenses in the West (USDA, 2012) . This implies that wage volatility can lead to considerable volatility in agricultural production costs in this region."}, {"section_title": "Further Robustness of Model Estimates", "text": "This section evaluates the robustness of the empirical model in two additional dimensions.
