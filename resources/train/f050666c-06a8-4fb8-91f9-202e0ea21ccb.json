[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is a consequence of heterogeneous and complex interactions of age-related neurodegeneration and vascular-associated pathologies. Evidence has accumulated that there is increased atherosclerosis/arteriosclerosis of the intracranial arteries in AD and that this may be additive or synergistic with respect to the generation of hypoxia/ischemia and cognitive dysfunction. The effectiveness of pharmacologic therapies and lifestyle modification in reducing cardiovascular disease has prompted a reconsideration of the roles that cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular function play in the pathogenesis of dementia. Methods: Using two-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, we quantified cerebral blood flow within the internal carotid, basilar, and middle cerebral arteries in a group of individuals with mild to moderate AD (n = 8) and compared the results with those from a group of age-matched nondemented control (NDC) subjects (n = 9). Clinical and psychometric testing was performed on all individuals, as well as obtaining their magnetic resonance imagingbased hippocampal volumes. Results: Our experiments reveal that total cerebral blood flow was 20% lower in the AD group than in the NDC group, and that these values were directly correlated with pulse pressure and cognitive measures. The AD group had a significantly lower pulse pressure (mean AD 48, mean NDC 71; P = 0.0004). A significant group difference was also observed in their hippocampal volumes. Composite z-scores for clinical, psychometric, hippocampal volume, and hemodynamic data differed between the AD and NDC subjects, with values in the former being significantly lower (t = 12.00, df = 1, P = 0.001) than in the latter. Conclusion: These results indicate an association between brain hypoperfusion and the dementia of AD. Cardiovascular disease combined with brain hypoperfusion may participate in the pathogenesis/pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

AD is definitively diagnosed based on quantitative neuropathologic criteria reflecting the profuse deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The prominence of these lesions has made them obvious therapeutic targets, but successful interventions to prevent or remove amyloid plaques have not had the anticipated commensurate impacts on dementia. 2, 3 It has been suggested that chronic brain hypoperfusion and consequent hypoxia/ischemia play a direct role in the pathogenesis of AD or promote the development of this dementia. 4, 5 A consensus is emerging that AD is a heterogeneous amalgam of multiple age-related neurodegenerative factors and vascularassociated pathologies.\nIt is irrefutable that a healthy cardiovascular system is indispensible for brain development, function, and survival. To meet metabolic demands efficiently, the blood flow to the brain needs to be approximately 750 mL per minute or about 50 mL/100 mL of brain tissue per minute. 6, 7 Cerebral perfusion pressure is primarily generated by an efficient cardiac output, patent elastic arterial walls modulated by the microvascular resistance of the brain, and adequate venous drainage. In addition, a series of hemorheologic events and conditions needs to be extant, such as adequate blood pressure, blood viscosity, blood flow velocity, and appropriate vascular resistance of the brain vasculature. In a recent report, Nation et al observed that elevated pulse pressure was correlated with the severity of cerebrovascular disease found post mortem. 8 In a large brain perfusion study carried out by the Rotterdam Study group, it was found that individuals with low total brain perfusion showed significantly larger white matter lesion volumes relative to those with high total brain perfusion. 9 Other epidemiologic studies have also found an association between decreased pulse pressure and the risk of AD. 10 Single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging perfusion studies, adjusted for related gray matter atrophy, have shown dysfunctional cerebral blood flow in individuals with AD. [11] [12] [13] The value of arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging, a promising technique for the quantification of cerebral blood flow, has been recently reviewed by Alsop et al. 14 The consensus indicates that the parietal and frontal cortices, the precuneus, and the posterior cingulate are the predominant areas with altered cerebral blood flow in AD. The latter two brain regions reflect the global perfusion state of watershed areas because they are irrigated by terminal branches of the pericallosal artery, a branch from the anterior cerebral artery, and/or the posterior cerebral arteries. 15 In general, a large body of data from in vivo functional imaging studies suggests that profound alterations in cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization, and oxidative metabolism are observable in the early stages of AD. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities, as well as diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral blood flow estimated by arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging and/or two-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (2D-PC MRI) are promising tools for the preclinical assessment and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and AD, and for longitudinal evaluation of therapeutic interventions deployed against dementia progression.\nThe cardiovascular contributions to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia have been recently reviewed by an authoritative study group representing the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology and the Alzheimer's Association. 5 The group emphasized the need for transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional studies to understand better the complicated interactions that exist between vascular and AD pathologies.\nIn this preliminary study, we measured cerebral blood flow in the internal carotid, basilar, and middle cerebral arteries in a group of individuals with mild to moderate AD and compared the results with those from a group of age-matched nondemented control (NDC) subjects using 2D-PC MRI. We sought any potential correlation between cerebral blood flow volumes, pulse pressure, and cognitive measurements.

Subjects provided their informed consent prior to scanning as per the approved study institutional review board. After patient landmarks were obtained, a three-plane localizer scan was performed, followed by a low-resolution two-dimensional dataset acquired for ASSET (array spatial and sensitivity encoding technique) calibration (parallel imaging). A magnitude-only three-dimensional time of flight (TOF) magnetic resonance imaging was performed axially, using ASSET to accelerate the scan. This provided a detailed view of the patient vasculature in order to prescribe the subsequent two-dimensional phase contrast flow scans.

The two-dimensional slice was oriented orthogonal to each vessel location as identified in the previous three-dimensional TOF magnetic resonance imaging scan. A total of five vessel measurements (separate scans) were made using this sequence: basilar artery, right and left internal carotid arteries, and right and left middle cerebral arteries. The 2D-PC MRI flow data collected were processed using the ReportCard TM analysis software provided by the scanner vendor (General Electric Healthcare). Phase contrast results from the 2D-PC MRI datasets were loaded into the software, which automatically plots the velocities of each of 16 cardiac phases (time points over the heartbeat). This plot of the velocities over the cardiac cycle was then analyzed by integrating the area of the velocity curve over the vessel area, which determines flow and is in a superior and outward direction for the arteries of interest in the brain.

The raw scores for each parameter were converted into z-scores, and an average of all the z-scores was calculated for each individual. This average is referred to as the composite z-score. Z-scores for each parameter were calculated by subtracting the NDC group mean from the raw score and dividing by the standard deviation of the NDC group. The directionality of each variable was considered so that the z-score reflected whether an increase or decrease in the variable would be indicative of AD. Given that the sample size for each clinical group was relatively small, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for group comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to discern group differences in composite z-score between the AD and NDC groups, with statistical significance determined by P values of # 0.05. Similar analyses were also conducted to determine if the composite z-score differed significantly by gender and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 carrier status.

The AD and NDC groups did not differ significantly with respect to age (KruskalWallis = 0.002, P = 0.96). There were no significant differences in gender frequency (\u03c7 2 = 2.49, df = 1, P = 0.11); however, the proportion of apolipoprotein E \u03b54 carriers in the AD group was significantly greater than in the NDC group (\u03c7 2 = 4.90, df = 1, P = 0.03). The mean body mass index in the AD and NDC populations was almost identical (Table 1) . Group comparisons of MMSE, FAST, and Clock Draw demonstrated significant statistical differences in the expected directions (Table 1 ) between the two study groups.\nCardiovascular disease was the most prevalent pathology among the study participants, with only one individual in each group (AD patient 7 and NDC patient 16) free of cardiovascular-related ailments ( Table 1) . Twelve of the 17 individuals in the study suffered from hypertension (Table 1) . We observed a significant difference in mean systolic blood pressure between the AD and NDC subjects (P = 0.05), resulting in a lower pulse pressure in the AD group (mean AD 48 versus mean NDC 71; P = 0.0004, Table 2 ). Interestingly, there were no statistically significant differences in pulse rate or diastolic blood pressure between the two groups (P = 0.15 and P = 0.35, respectively). All subjects with hypertension were receiving antihypertensive therapy, ie, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (Table 3) .\nIn order to assess cerebral blood flow in our AD and NDC subjects, 2D-PC MRI measurements (mL per minute) were taken from the basilar, right and left internal carotid, and right and left middle cerebral arteries (Table 2 ). Mean cerebral blood flow values for each of the arteries studied were lower in the AD group than in the NDC group ( Table 2) . The left internal carotid, and right and left middle cerebral arteries, as well as total cerebral blood flow, represented by addition of the basilar artery and left and right internal carotid artery, showed statistically significant group differences (Table 2) . Mean total cerebral blood flow in the NDC population was 743 mL per minute, which is within the expected range for normal blood flow. In contrast, the AD group had a mean value of 610 mL per minute, representing about 20% less than the mean NDC value, suggesting reduced brain perfusion in the AD group. Because our sample numbers were small, we carried out further statistical analyses of the individual arteries and found the following: left internal carotid artery \nCorrelations of pulse pressure with body mass index and cerebral blood flow variables are shown in Table 4 . Pulse pressure was moderately correlated with all cerebral blood flow measures, with the exception of the basilar artery, which showed a weak correlation. Body mass index did not correlate with pulse pressure (Table 4) . Statistical correlations between pulse pressure, MMSE, and Clock Draw, as well as correlations between arterial blood flow, MMSE, and Clock Draw are shown in Table 5 , and with the exception of the basilar and right middle cerebral artery, all values are moderately correlated.\nTo determine if apolipoprotein E \u03b54 carrier status has any effect on pulse pressure and total brain blood flow, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for both comparisons, revealing no significant difference in total brain blood flow [Kruskal-Wallis = 1.46 (df = 1), P = 0.23]. However, pulse pressure was significantly different between apolipoprotein E \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers [Kruskal-Wallis = 8.03 (df = 1), P = 0.005], with apolipoprotein E \u03b54 noncarriers having higher pulse pressure.\nVoxel-based morphometry found that AD subjects had significantly less volume than NDC subjects in the left parahippocampal region (uncorrected P , 0.001 and corrected P = 0.021). FreeSurfer volumetric analyses were also carried out, and it was found that AD subjects had significantly less volume in both the right and left hippocampal regions (Table 6 ). Intracranial volume was not significantly different between the AD and NDC groups (P = 0.23)\nThe blood flow data of the individual arteries were combined with other measures in order to characterize more accurately the contribution of other cardiovascular variables to our overall hypothesis. For a final statistical analysis of clinical, psychometric, morphometric, and hemodynamic data, a composite z-score including several parameters (total cerebral blood flow, pulse pressure, hippocampal volume, body mass index, Clock Draw, and MMSE) was calculated. Composite z-scores in between-group analyses yielded a statistically significant difference between the AD and NDC groups, with the AD group being significantly lower [Kruskal-Wallis = 12.00, df = 1, P = 0.001]. The magnitude of the difference between the AD and the NDC groups on the composite z-score was large (Cohen's d = 3.59). A plot of the individual composite z-score is displayed in Figure 1 . No significant difference on composite z-score was found for gender [Kruskal-Wallis = 2.14, df = 1, P = 0.14].

Cerebral blood flow was reduced in AD when compared with NDC individuals, and decreased total cerebral blood flow correlated with cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the AD cohort had lower hippocampal volumes than NDC cases, and the NDC group had higher composite z-scores than the AD subjects. Within the limitations of this study, we discovered some important trends that need to be investigated, in conjunction with other cardiovascular and neurologic risk factors, in a properly powered longitudinal study to establish a brain/cardiovascular fitness index that may aid in the diagnosis of AD.\nHigher systolic and pulse pressures have been associated with better cognitive performance in patients with 47 Subclinical dysfunctional heart disease may result in decreased cardiac output that may lead to lower pulse pressure in AD patients. Impaired left ventricular diastolic filling efficiency, as assessed by vortex formation time and detected by echocardiography, was significantly decreased in AD patients compared with NDC subjects. 48 These findings suggest that intraventricular blood conveyance is suboptimal in AD and that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is related to cognitive deficits. 48 Decreased pulse pressure could be part of the pathogenesis of AD and/or synergistically contribute to the development of this neurodegeneration, given that oligemic and hypoxic changes in the AD brain may also result from destruction of the vasoactive brain centers that regulate cerebral perfusion. 49 In the elderly, low pulse pressure may also be the consequence of antihypertensive overmedication that results in iatrogenic brain hypoperfusion.\nA pathologic complication of hypertension is the development of diffuse microvascular disease. [50] [51] [52] Investigation of the functional conditions of the brain circulation in AD patients by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of cerebral arteries demonstrated an increased pulsatility index, symptomatic of diffuse microvascular disease, and lower mean flow velocities than subjects with NDC or mild cognitive impairment. 53, 54 In addition, Doppler ultrasound studies have demonstrated a considerable decrease in diastolic velocity along the common and internal carotid arteries in individuals with AD compared with NDC, 53 suggesting reduced compliance in the elasticity of these arteries.\nBrain hypoperfusion can be triggered or complicated by cardiovascular-related diseases, including stroke, cerebral infarction, hypertension, hypotension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valvulopathy, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. 4, 5, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] The presence of lacunar infarcts and strokes may prompt the onset of dementia or worsen the clinical course of AD, [61] [62] [63] [64] clearly demonstrating that deficiencies in cerebral blood flow are involved in the global pathogenesis of cognitive decline. Arterial stenosis and loss of elastic compliance of the carotid/vertebral vessels, circle of Willis, and major brain arteries, as well as arteriolar and capillary loss are major factors contributing to sustained brain hypoperfusion. 56, 65 Recent pathologic observations by our group and others have suggested that atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis is significantly more extensive in AD when compared with an NDC population. [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and calcification of arterial walls have been related to cerebral infarcts and increased white matter lesions. 72 In addition, atherosclerotic calcification measured by computed tomography was found to be associated with impaired cognitive function and decreased brain volume. 73 Atherosclerosis also creates increased peripheral resistance and consequent age-related elevations in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, leading to brain hypoperfusion and dementia. 10, 74, 75 Low systolic and diastolic pressures have also been associated with dementia.

These harmful pathophysiologic hemodynamic changes are compounded by architectural lesions in the brain microvasculature of AD subjects, as recently demonstrated by our laboratory. 81 We recognize that atherosclerosis causes increased peripheral resistance and hence an increase in pulse pressure. Many AD patients, but not all when considered individually, have increased peripheral resistance as reflected by an increased pulsatility index on transcranial Doppler ultrasound resulting from diffuse small vessel disease. 53 On average, patients with AD have more extensive atherosclerosis, but a considerable number of cases have a minimal amount. 71 On the other hand, aging in apparently healthy patients causes an elevation in pulse pressure resulting from increased peripheral resistance due to microvascular lesions and loss of compliance. However, The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging has shown that a number of apparently healthy people 80 years and older have pulse pressures of 40 mmHg or even lower. 82 In summary, AD and other dementia syndromes are multifaceted and very heterogeneous maladies associated with general physical decay.\nThe fact that systolic and pulse pressure are diminished in the AD group may give the impression of better cardiovascular system conditions. However, the population we examined was an elderly one (mean age 81 years). As a result of atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, which are universal in this age group, blood flow to the brain decreases with age and needs to be compensated by an increase in cardiac output which elevates systolic pressure to maintain adequate brain perfusion. Therefore, low pressures do not always represent a healthier status and may result in chronic cerebral metabolic failure, while a slightly compensatory increase in systolic pressure may lead physiologically to better brain and organ perfusion. We recognize the difficult question as to whether deficient cerebral blood flow is a primary cause or consequence of AD. This issue has enormous significance in the context of understanding the pathophysiology AD and in the development of therapeutic interventions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The significance of cardiovascular disease and brain hypoperfusion, and their potential impact on disabling neurodegenerative disease, is of paramount epidemiologic importance due to an anticipated explosive increase in the number of individuals over 65 years of age, that will dramatically grow from about 40 million at present to 88.5 million by the year 2050. 83 The increasing degenerative processes and inability to repair the cardiovascular system observed in the aging population can result in atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction, with damage to the blood-brain barrier and brain function. In addition, altered systolic and diastolic pressures and damaged myocardial and valvular performance may impinge on cardiac output. These factors inevitably have a deleterious effect on brain perfusion, resulting in harmful ischemia/hypoxia and neuronal and glial injury.
