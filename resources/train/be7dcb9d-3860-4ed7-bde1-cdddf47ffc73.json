[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The growth in occupations for high-skill workers in information technology (IT) has been dramatic over the past two decades-beginning in the mid-1990s with the start of the Internet boom and continuing with rapid expansions in information technology (IT) innovation. Broadly encompassing programmers, computer scientists, and electrical engineers, the IT workforce increased by more than 1.2 million workers, or by 112%, between 1993 and 2010 (table 1). 1 Sectors served by these workers have responded to dramatic increases in Internet commerce, giving rise to technology firms like Google, Yahoo, and Amazon, as well as maintaining the prosperity of firms like Microsoft and IBM. One of the distinguishing features of the Internet boom in the United States has been the extent to which foreign-born workers have been part of the supply response. Among IT workers with at least a bachelor's degree, foreign-born workers have grown from about 16% of the IT workforce in 1993 to nearly 32% in 2010 (table 1). This kind of labor market response to demand shocks would not have occurred in the 1970s or in an environment with more restrictive immigration policies (Bound et al. 2013;Bound et al., forthcoming). 2 This analysis focuses on understanding the role that US higher education and immigration policy plays in the flow of foreign-born IT workers. To the extent that the US labor market provides a substantial wage premium relative to countries like China and India (Clemens, Montenegro, and Pritchett 2008;Pari 2009;Clemens 2013), high-skill workers have a strong incentive to immigrate. Yet, limits in the availability of temporary (H-1B) visas, which require employer sponsorship, may limit direct flows from foreign countries to the US labor market. Since the number of foreign students who can enroll in US higher education is not limited by visa policy (but rather by conditions in the higher education market) foreign students have incentives to pursue degrees in the United States, both to acquire skills and to improve the potential likelihood of finding a job in the US labor market (Rosenzweig 2006). Degree attainment in the United States advantages foreign students searching for jobs over those educated abroad, to the extent that US employers have more confidence in worker skills acquired at familiar educational institutions and find it more straightforward to interview candidates on site. Our analysis provides supporting evidence of this employment and migration behavior. We demonstrate that US degree receipt has been an important pathway for the foreign born to participate in the IT workforce over the past two decades. Those entering the United States on student visas and then transitioning to temporary or permanent work visas comprise a significant share of the IT workforce, and the degree receipt of foreign students in IT fields is highly sensitive to the labor market conditions. Despite a substantial literature on high-skill immigration in the workforce (see Kerr 2013 for a detailed review of this literature), few stud-ies have focused on how a US college education, and its interaction with US visa policies, impact foreign-born flows into high-skill occupations. Our analysis begins by presenting a picture of the current level and recent changes in educational attainment of the foreign born and natives working in IT occupations. Notably, foreign-born IT workers are more likely than their US-born peers to hold advanced degrees and a significant portion of them have received their highest degrees from US institutions. Furthermore, foreign-born IT workers are more likely than their US counterparts to hold degrees in science and engineering (S&E) fields, the credentials of which are easier to evaluate by US employers. The next section reviews the institutional parameters that determine entry to the United States for high-skill workers, where we emphasize that unlike student visas, work visas are subject to caps and costly employer petitions. We then examine the growth in enrollment and degrees awarded to the foreign born by US universities. An important finding is that, in the past two decades, degrees received by foreign students at US institutions, particularly at the master's level, have been very responsive to labor market conditions, more so than the responsiveness of their US-born counterparts. In the final section we provide an examination of how the degree receipt location (United States or abroad) affects persistence and earnings in the US labor market for foreign-born workers. Notable findings include that foreign-born workers with US degrees are more likely than their counterparts to remain in the United States, and that labor market premiums/penalties for a US degree vary considerably by country of origin, with workers from China paying a penalty and those from Europe receiving a premium for being educated abroad. For IT workers, the impact on wages for receiving a US degree is almost nonexistent, suggesting that a large component of this influx of foreign students can be attributed to the fact that rather than better wages, a US education provides improved access to the US labor market. An important conclusion of this analysis is that US higher education institutions and immigration policies both play critical roles in determining the flow of high-skill immigrants to the US labor market. Notably, the expansion in capacity of US graduate programsparticularly in science and engineering-and restrictions in work visa policies has influenced foreign student entry to the United States, which in turn has affected the level and composition of high-skill worker immigration. Similarly, wage differentials across countries have influ-enced the inflow of foreign students, and in turn facilitated the expansion of master's programs. Looking ahead, changes that affect access to US postsecondary education for the foreign born, including the cost of US higher education and student visa options, will likely affect the flow of high-skill workers to the US labor market. In turn, changes in the attractiveness of the US labor market-particularly in IT occupations-or changes in the availability of work visas are expected to affect the demand from foreigners for degrees from US universities."}, {"section_title": "II. Descriptive Backdrop: The Changing Composition of IT Workers", "text": "Using any national survey data from the past two decades, we find unambiguous increases in the total number of IT workers and in the representation of foreign-born workers in IT. 3 These foreign-born IT workers are more likely to hold advanced degrees, most of which are from US institutions, and are also more likely to graduate with degrees in computer science or engineering fields than their US counterparts."}, {"section_title": "A. Broad Trends", "text": "We focus here on the sharp increase in college-educated workers employed in the US IT sector, a number that rose from 1.1 million in 1993 to nearly 2 million in 2003, with a more incremental rise to 2.4 million in 2010. This first interval is often referred to as the \"Internet boom\" era. To put it in perspective, these increases account for 0.4% of the total US population in 1993, 0.7% in 2003, and 0.8% in 2010 (table 1). While slightly more than half (54%) of this total increase is accounted for by the growth in US-born IT workers, about 575,000 of the IT workers added between 1993 and 2010 were born abroad, representing an increase from 15.5% to 31.5% of all IT workers during the period, with the increase concentrated among workers younger than 45. While a college degree is widely regarded as a prerequisite to employment in high-skill IT fields, native-born and foreign-born workers differ somewhat in the extent to which they hold postbaccalaureate credentials. In terms of highest degree attained, about 75% of US-born and 50% of foreign-born IT workers held a bachelor's degree, while about half as many US-born as foreign-born (23% vs. 44%) IT workers held a master's degree, and only a third as many US-born as foreign-born IT workers (2% vs. 6%) held PhDs (table 2, panel B). Notably, foreign-born IT workers were more likely and US-born IT workers were less likely than all college-educated workers in the US economy to hold advanced degrees (table 2, compare panels A and B). This \"educational differential\" is particularly noteworthy among younger cohorts in recent years (figure 1)."}, {"section_title": "B. Location of Degrees among Foreign Born", "text": "Not only are foreign-born, college-educated workers more likely than their native counterparts to hold advanced degrees, but large proportions of them are likely to have attained their highest degree from a US university. Table 3 presents the distribution of college-educated immigrant workers who received their highest degree from a US institution both overall and for those employed in IT fields, by year and degree. Among foreign-born IT workers, those with advanced degrees are appreciably more likely to have received their degrees from US institutions than those with only a bachelor's degree. For example, for IT workers 25-34 years old in 2010, 73% of those with a master's degree and 95% of PhD recipients received their highest degree from a US institution versus 52% of those with a bachelor's degree (table 3). In fact, the proportion of foreign-born bachelor's degree-only IT workers who attained their degree in the United States has declined over the period, from 86% to 52%. This change in the composition of degree location is concurrent with a marked change in the pathway of entry by foreignborn IT workers, shifting from an early age of arrival in the United States-often with parents-to arrival as graduate students or young workers. Several explanations account for the attractiveness of US degree programs to high-skill workers from abroad. First, with more than 3,000 institutions of higher education and many large research universities, the US market may present a supply of educational opportunities unavailable in many home countries. In addition, US institutions may be perceived as providing higher-quality educational experiences than are available in many home countries. While higher education quality varies widely in the United States, US universities often dominate global rankings, and hold a particular global advantage in research education in the sciences (Bound, Turner, and Walsh 2009;Bird and Turner 2014). 4 To this end, the earnings of foreign-born IT workers may be treated differently in the labor market based on whether they were educated en-  Natives  Bachelor's  694,431  1,077,515  1,236,683  3,008,628  Percentage of total  74  73  76  74  Master's  223,737  361,020  358,024  942,780  Percentage of total  24  24  22  23  PhD  22,052  32,541  27,390  81,983  Percentage of total  2  2  2  2  Professional degrees  2,973  5,887  5,231  14,091  Percentage of total  0  0  0  0  Total  943,192  1,476,963  1,627,328  4,047,483  100  100  100  100  Foreign Born  Bachelor's  92,767  265,431  374,171  732,370  Percentage of total  53  49  50  50  Master's  68,359  239,426  330,448  638,233  Percentage of total  39  44  44  44  PhD  12,786  34,636  44,638  92,061  Percentage of total  7  6  6  6  Professional degrees  292  987  355  1,634  Percentage of total  0  0  0  0  Total  174,204  540,480  749,613  1,464,297  100  100  100  100 Source: National Survey of College Graduates (1993Graduates ( , 2003Graduates ( , 2010.

Formal Postsecondary Training of IT Workers", "text": "While it is natural to associate degrees in fields like computer science and electrical engineering with employment in IT occupations, the educational credentials of workers in these occupations are more diverse, particularly for natives. Indeed, among native-born IT workers between the ages of 25 and 34 in 2010, only 37% and 43% held a bachelor's or a master's degree, respectively, in computer science and 18% and 22% held a bachelor's or a master's degree, respectively, in engineering, leaving more than 45% with bachelor's degrees in other fields and 35% with master's degrees in other fields (table 4, panel B). A clear impli- cation of this finding is that inflows from other fields, in addition to net new degrees in computer science and engineering, is an important source of supply for the domestic market for IT professionals. For foreign-born IT workers, the concentration of formal training in computer science and engineering is much more marked. In 2010, 82% of foreign-born IT workers held a bachelor's degree in either computer science or engineering, while 81% held a master's degree in one of these two areas (table 4, panel B). This finding suggests that US IT employers select highly skilled immigrants, as computer science and engineering skills are among the most \"portable\" skills, and perhaps that they find it easier to evaluate nontraditional degree credentials among natives than among the foreign born. The finding may also reflect the greater proportion of science and engineering (S&E) degree programs abroad  (1993,2003,2010).

For example, the rate of S&E degree awards among all first university degrees is about 50% in China, 35% in India, and 31% in the United States (NSB 2014, appendix table 2-37). 5"}, {"section_title": "III. Policy and Institutional Context", "text": "The factors that determine the flow of high-skill workers to the US labor market include the quality and quantity of educational institutions in the home country, opportunities for postsecondary study in the United States, relative labor market opportunities, and US visa policies. In this section we focus on the role of US visa policies and its potential behavioral implications. In particular, we note that US visa policies may affect not just decisions to participate in the US labor market and the type and duration of employment, but also educational investments of high-skill, foreign-born workers. 6 Work visa caps may encourage foreign-born job seekers to access the US labor market by entering as students instead. Until about 1990, the primary source of high-skill immigrants to the US labor market was via permanent residency or \"green card\" provisions. But in recent decades, avenues to temporary residency of highskill individuals from abroad-via both temporary work status (primarily H-1B) and student status (primarily F visas)-has become a significant step on the pathway to permanent residency. 7"}, {"section_title": "A. Permanent Residents", "text": "Some degree of preference for high-skill immigrants has long been a part of US immigration policy. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 established a pathway to permanent residency for high-skill immigrants and gave priority to displaced persons \"possessing special educational, scientific and technological or professional qualifications\" (Tichenor 2012). The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 set national quotas, but reserved 50% of each nation's quota for high-skill immigrants. Employment endorsement is one of the four avenues for permanent immigration identified by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (Hart-Celler Act), which replaced the country-wise quotas with a preference system focusing on skills and family ties. 8 Employment-based immigration generally follows a transition from another visa type. Indeed, in 2011, 90% of all employment-based green cards were designated an \"adjustment of status\" rather than new entry (Handbook of Immigration Statistics 2011). However, the capacity to enter the United States as a permanent resident through an employment-based green card is quite limited: only 140,000 such visas are offered each year. 9 An employment-based green card also has significant requirements for employers, who must certify their firm's inability to hire a qualified citizen or permanent resident for the employee's position and file an immigration petition (form I-140) on the employee's behalf. Beyond employer certification, education and skills play a key role in determining preference groupings for permanent visa priority. The highest priority is reserved for those with extraordinary capabilities, including researchers, professors, and multinational executives. Next in line are those who have advanced degrees or whose abilities benefit US interests (e.g., physicians practicing in designated underserved areas). Third in priority are skilled workers, college-educated professionals, and unskilled workers. Two lower levels of priority are also designated. 10 Of all the employment-based green cards awarded in 2011, 66% were issued to foreign-born workers who met one of the first two priorities, and 92% went to those who met one of the first three. Adding to the complexity of this system, visas for any given country are capped at 7% of the annual US limit for family-and employmentbased immigration. This rule, intended to allow immigration from a variety of places, 11 causes considerable lags for those coming from China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines who are not in the highest priority category. Martin (2012) notes that Indian professionals, entering under lower priorities, have had to wait between 5 and 10 years. In March 2014, Indians hoping to acquire visas who fell into the second priority category had waited since November of 2004, while those in the third priority had waited more than 10 years from September 2003. 12 Constraints on employment-based permanent residency opportunities may have several behavioral implications. First, high-skill, foreignborn workers may face constraints in their capacity to stay in the United States or to switch jobs. These constraints are most likely to bind for those from countries like India and China and those with lower educational attainment or priority rankings. Lowell and Avato (2013) provide some evidence that those with temporary work visas tend to face substantial earnings penalties in S&E occupations. While Mithas and Lucas (2010) demonstrate a similar result for temporary work visa holders in the IT industry who earn less than green card holders, Kandilov (2007) and Mukhopadhyay and Oxborrow (2012) estimate that the acquisition of a green card increases earnings by up to 18%. 13 Second, those with the highest returns to staying may make investments in advanced de-grees in order to increase their priority status for a permanent visa. In addition to the traditional employment-based pathway to permanent residency for high-skill immigrants, Congress has occasionally given special treatment to foreign groups that likely included a disproportionate share of high-skill immigrants. 14"}, {"section_title": "B. Temporary Work and Student Visas", "text": "For those without permanent US residency, two other possibilities for immigration and entry into IT and high-skill occupations are the H-1B visa for temporary workers and the F visa for students. Clearly, the direct path to employment as a temporary worker is through the H-1B program, while an indirect route to either a temporary or permanent work visa is through a student visa that yields an in-demand degree. It is critical to understand both options, as together they represent the dominant pathway to entrance to the US labor market among the foreign born. Indeed, in 2010, temporary work visas (H-1B) accounted for about 39% of the first visa status of IT workers age 25-34 and student visas (F) accounted for about 35%, with these shares markedly smaller in older cohorts for whom entry via permanent residency was far more common (table 5, panel B)."}, {"section_title": "C. The H-1B: Temporary Work", "text": "The H-1 visa designation dates to the passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act and is intended to provide an employment window for aliens of \"distinguished merit and ability.\" The original expectation of the H-1 designation was that residency in the United States would be temporary. The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1990 transformed the H-1 visa program into what is now known as the H-1B program, which includes a \"dual purpose provision\" that creates the potential for workers to transition to permanent residency. 15 The H-1B visas are valid for three years with the potential for a three-year extension. 16 The H-1B visas are employer-specific, and require the employer to post a substantial application fee and certify that the foreign employee will be paid the prevailing wage. 17 Workers may enter the United States directly on an H-1B visa or may transfer to an H-1B from another visa classification such as an F student visa. In 2012, about 45% of initial H-1B visa beneficiaries had transferred from another visa classification (US Citizenship and Immigration Services 2013).

The annual number of H-1B visas is currently capped at 65,000, though visas issued to individuals employed at colleges and universities (e.g., researchers and faculty) or nonprofit research organizations are exempt from the cap. During the early 1990s the cap was not reached, but after the cap became binding in the mid-1990s it was raised to 115,000 in 1999 and then to 195,000 in 2001. This limit was maintained until 2004, when the H-1B cap reverted to 65,000 once again, and has been binding ever since. However, also in 2004 the Visa Reform Act 18 authorized that an extra 20,000 H-1B visas be reserved for foreign workers holding advanced degrees from US universities, which may have encouraged foreign students to pursue advanced degrees from US universities to increase the likelihood of eventually obtaining an H-1B visa. 19"}, {"section_title": "D. The F Student Visa", "text": "Given the constraints on permanent and temporary work visas, the US higher education system may function as an important pathway for the foreign born to gain access to the US labor market. Unlike H-1B employment visas, which are subject to a numerical cap and require a costly petition from an employer, visas for postsecondary study in the United States are effectively unlimited in number and do not require expensive institutional intervention. The full-time student visa, F-1, which is the vehicle of entry for most degree programs, is issued to foreign-born students accepted by any certified US higher education institution. 20 As depicted in figure 2, the number of annually issued F-1 visas has risen sharply and steadily since the late 1980s, with the notable exception of a nontrivial decline following both the contraction in the US IT sector and the events of 9/11, which generated greater administrative hurdles to obtaining student visas. Students from Asia contribute the majority of students on F-1 visas, with the number from China increasing very dramatically over the last decade (figure 2). Entry through the F visa program has the potential to improve access to the US labor market by allowing for a limited-period work permission through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which is not subject to a quota. The OPT program, available to international students who have attended a certified US university on a full-time basis for at least one academic year, extends the F visa status for one year for work in jobs related to the eligible student's major area of study. 21 In 2008, Congress revised the OPT program by limiting the possible unemployed period to a maximum of 90 days, and by extending the duration of the visa from 12 to 29 months for those in eligible science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. 22 Our analyses indicate that from 1999 to 2009, about 30% of foreign-born students initially entered the US labor market under the OPT program. 23 In addition to the OPT program opportunity, a US degree versus a foreign degree confers other potential advantages to entering the US labor market. These include an information advantage, as US employers may be more knowledgeable about and confident in hiring individuals with US degrees and an access advantage, as employers may find it more convenient to interview US-based students or graduates. Furthermore, universities screen applicants before offering them admission, which is information useful to the employers and a good signal for prospective job seekers. For their part, the foreign born who want to work in the United States may recognize and exploit these advantages. United States employment is especially attractive to those from devel- Fig. 2. Trends in F student visas issued, overall and by select nationality Source: Department of State, \"Nonimmigrant Visa Issuances by Visa Class and by Nationality\" and \"Nonimmigrant Visas by Individual Class of Admission\"; see http://travel .state.gov/visa/statistics/nivstats/nivstats_4582.html oping countries like India and China, where the same college degrees/ skill sets tend to yield lower wages than they would in the United States (Clemens et al. 2008;Clemens 2013). Although student visas can ease access to US labor markets, demand is restricted by the prerequisite skills for admission and the capacity to finance the course of study. Because costs of attendance differ across program levels (BA, MA, PhD) and types, we expect-and observethat the feasibility of student visas differs across country of origin and by level of study. Also, the demand for postsecondary education in the United States may be influenced by both the option value of US education and the lack of educational opportunities in home countries. In the next two sections, we assemble evidence from US higher education and labor market data that is consistent with the option value interpretation in the context of the IT industry from 1993 to 2010."}, {"section_title": "IV. US Enrollment and Degree Attainment: Cyclicality and Foreign Expansion", "text": "The last three decades have seen substantial changes in the number of foreign students coming to the United States for postsecondary education, the primary countries of origin, and the destination institutions, as established in data collected by the US Department of Education (DOE) and the Institute of International Education (IIE). 24 While there is a rising trend in foreign enrollment since the 1980s, computer science degrees for foreign-born students closely follow labor market cycles. Figure 3 shows total enrollment of graduate and undergraduate students from abroad at US colleges and universities from 1954 to 2011. 25 Since 1980, the average annual growth rate in foreign enrollment for graduate programs has been somewhat greater, at 1.9%, than the average rate for undergraduate programs, but since 2005 enrollment has grown faster for undergraduate (4.6%) than for graduate (2.5%) programs. While foreign students represent a relatively small share of undergraduate enrollment (3.3% in our sample of four-year public and private nonprofit institutions in 2011), they are a much larger share of enrollment in graduate programs. According to the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates data, temporary visa holders accounted for 29% of all doctorate degrees awarded in 2011, 34% of doctorates in S&E fields, and 56% of doctorates in engineering (NSB 2014)."}, {"section_title": "A. Overall Trend in Foreign Enrollment", "text": "In the most recent decade, the post-9/11 dip in enrollment is clearly evident, and would be more marked if we were able to disaggregate by new entrants. While it is often conjectured that the more stringent visa requirements initiated after 9/11, along with a perceived hostile environment, stifled foreign enrollment, some evidence indicates that the decline started before 9/11 in response to contracting economic opportunities in the United States. 26 Still, in the period since the collapse of the financial markets in 2008, enrollment of foreign students in US higher education has continued on an upward trajectory, rising 14.6% in the 2008-2011 interval among undergraduates and 6.0% among graduate students. As we show below, persistent growth is driven by countries less affected by the recent global financial crisis, such as China."}, {"section_title": "B. Trends by Country of Origin", "text": "The relatively steady increase in the enrollment numbers for all foreign students disguises substantial variation by region and country of origin. Table 6 presents leading source countries for US enrollment in 1993 and 2011 for undergraduate and graduate levels. As shown in the top panel, China led the way in 2011 undergraduate enrollment, with nearly 75,000 students, followed by South Korea (38,232) and Saudi Arabia (14,344). Including India, Canada, Vietnam, and Japan, the top seven sending countries account for about 56% of total undergraduate foreign enrollment in 2011. This pattern of enrollment differs markedly from 1993, when Japan was the leading source country and China did not crack the top seven sending countries. The bottom panel of table 6 shows that China and India led the way in sending graduate students to the United States in both 1993 and 2011. Notably, these two countries have experienced appreciable growth over the 1993-2011 interval, with US graduate enrollment increasing by a factor of 2.4 for China and by a factor of 2.1 for India. The nature of Chinese and Indian enrollment at the graduate level has changed some- what over time, shifting from enrollment nearly exclusively at the PhD level to enrollment dispersed between PhD and master's programs and professional degrees. Participation among students from Taiwan in US graduate education dropped dramatically (about 45%) between 1993 and 2011, perhaps reflecting some maturation in the university structure in Taiwan. Country-of-origin participation in US higher education has changed over time and by undergraduate and graduate enrollment, as shown in figure 4. For countries whose development trajectories have been steep over the period, such as China and India, evidence suggests that growth in enrollment at the doctorate level precedes growth at the undergraduate or master's levels. A significant reason for this may be that PhD programs in the United States offer substantial financial aid (in terms of teaching and research positions) unavailable to foreign students at the predoctorate level. Yet, as we discuss in detail below, doctorate education is a relatively small component in graduate education. For affluent western economies with well-developed home country education systems, such as Germany and Canada, undergraduate and graduate enrollment are near the same scale and exhibit modest variation over our period of analysis. In understanding the demand for enrollment at different levels of US education, it is important to consider the barriers created by cost of attendance. Not only must foreign students pay international rates for tuition and fees, but must demonstrate the ongoing capacity to meet all costs of attendance in order to obtain the F visa. While these costs may be prohibitive for foreign-born undergraduates without generous home country support or affluent parents, 27 foreign doctoral-level students of modest means can take advantage of the substantial financial support often available for US doctoral study. Overall, the IIE data show that about 82% of foreign undergraduate students finance their studies through \"personal and family funds,\" 28 while only about 5% of foreign doctoral students rely on their own sources as the primary means of educational support."}, {"section_title": "C. Degrees Conferred: Trends by Field for US and Foreign Students", "text": "Examining degree outcomes provides an indication of the skills that foreign-born and native students bring to the labor market-either in the United States or elsewhere. Foreign-born students are more likely than their US-born counterparts to choose S&E fields of study, and they comprise a substantial share of the graduates from US programs in these fields. Figure 5 focuses on the fields of computer science (CS) and engineering, showing trends over time in degrees awarded at the bachelor's, master's, and PhD levels. A first point of observation is that in 2012 more than 40% of the degrees awarded at the graduate level (master's and PhD) were to temporary residents, demonstrating a substantial increase since the mid-1980s, while degrees awarded to temporary residents remain a fairly modest share of bachelor's degrees in these fields. In particular, there has been a marked increase in the number of master's degrees awarded to temporary residents in these fields since the mid-1990s. The number of master's degrees in CS awarded to foreign-born students increased from 5,007 in 1995 to 12,087 in 2012, while the number in engineering increased from 9,699 to 17,583. The increase in master's degrees in CS and engineering accounts for 37% of the total increase in master's degrees awarded in this period and dwarfs the increase in the number of PhD and bachelor's degrees awarded to temporary residents over this period. 29 The importance of master's degrees awarded to the foreign born from US institutions to the supply of IT workers is also apparent in table 7, which shows an estimated 63% (122,619 in total) of foreign-born master's degree recipients from US universities had student visas as their first visa, relative to about 21% (or 30,802) of bachelor's recipients. An examination of the institutional sources of master's degrees in  Much research has examined the adjustment of choice of major to changes in labor market conditions. A classic set of papers, including Freeman (1971Freeman ( , 1975Freeman ( , 1976) and Ryoo and Rosen (2004), models student enrollment as functions of their expectations of future earnings. These \"closed economy\" modeling approaches, in which the labor supply adjustments in a particular occupation are achieved by the transfer of workers from another occupation and the entrance of new workers from the domestic educational pipeline, were quite successful in predicting the supply response in choice of major to demand shocks in S&E fields. Examining the response to recent US IT booms in the supply of bachelor's degrees, Bound et al. (2013) identified cycles of response with an approximately four-year lag, which produced peaks in 1986 and 2003. They found undergraduate degree adjustments to demand shocks more muted in the more recent period, owing to the flow of foreign-born, high-skill workers into the IT labor pool. 31 Yet, as the US higher education market is unquestionably \"international\"-particularly at the graduate level (Blanchard 2009 andBorjas 2004)-an open question concerns the cyclicality of the foreign student enrollment. Figure 5 shows that the share of temporary residents in each degree category appears to demonstrate more cyclicality than does the total level of degrees awarded. For example, the share of master's degrees awarded to temporary residents decreased by 15% in CS and by 10% in engineering between 2001 and 2007, before rebounding as the market picked up in recent years. This greater cyclicality is consistent with the notion that foreign students are using a master's education in the United States to enter the labor market."}, {"section_title": "V. Foreign-Born Degree Recipients and the US Labor Market", "text": "Evaluating the impact of US postsecondary degree acquisition on the US labor market depends markedly on whether US educationparticularly among temporary visa recipients-leads to long-term work in the United States. Our evidence, presented in more detail below, makes two striking points. First, \"stay rates\" for degree recipients are extraordinarily high-much higher than for other temporary visa recipients. Second, not only do we observe marked differences in crosscountry flows into US degree programs (as discussed in the prior section), but we see marked differences across countries in pathways to entering the labor market and in labor market performance."}, {"section_title": "A. Coming and Going", "text": "Gauging how country of origin differs with the location of highest degree receipt and how degree receipt links to persistence in the US labor market helps to model the determinants of the decision among the foreign born to invest in US higher education. Persistence in the US labor market following degree receipt is hard to measure. Here we present data from several sources that provide a sense of both high overall stay rates and of high propensities to stay among advanced degree recipients. To begin, we consider the likelihood that those studying in the United States transfer from F visas to either permanent residency or temporary work permits (H-1B). While data are limited, in 2000, the most recent year in which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the transition tables, 16,161 international students adjusted from an F student visa to a permanent residency status, which comprises about 16% of the total number of international students graduating in 1999 (Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2001). 32 Using administrative data, Lowell and Avato (2013) estimate that approximately 31,000 H-1Bs were awarded to foreign students in 2003, a total that represents about 40% of the prior year's entire graduating class of international students earning master's and PhD degrees, and about 90% of all foreign graduates in science and engineering. An alternative measure, shown in figure 6, presents the ratio of initial H-1B visas awarded to those who have been in the United States under another visa classification to the number of international graduates of US universities. Our calculation indicates that, on average, about half of each graduating class of international students from 1999 to 2009 changed from student (F) visa status to H-1B status. For doctorate recipients, administrative data merges provide a much better measure of stay rates. Tabulations conducted by the Social Security Administration for Michael Finn (2012) link the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), a census of those receiving PhDs from US institutions, to Social Security Administration data to identify how many of the foreign born on temporary or permanent visas at the time they received their PhDs continued to work in the United States at intervals of one, two, five, and ten years after degree receipt. Finn estimates that, in 2009, 64% of those who received their PhD five years earlier and 66% of those who received their PhD 10 years earlier continued to live in the United States. Stay rates for doctorate recipients tend to be somewhat higher in STEM fields than in other degree areas, and have been trending up over recent years. They also vary by country of origin, the strength of the degree holder's ties to the United States, and their academic ability (indicated by fellowship receipt) (Grogger and Hanson 2013). Focusing solely on PhD holders in STEM fields with temporary visas, Finn finds that 89% of those from China and 79% from India remain in the United States five years after receiving their PhD. 33 Analyzing data from the National Survey of College Graduates, we also find considerable cross-country variation in US degree receipt by educational level and among high-skill, foreign-born US workers. This variation can be related to the likelihood that foreign-born, degreeholding workers used the US education market as a pathway to enter the US labor market. Table 8 presents distributions for highest degree receipt and the proportions earning these degrees in the United States for foreign-born, high-skilled workers from four origin areas: Europe, Canada, India, and China. We note that US workers from China are the most educated in terms of degree attainment, followed by workers from India. In 2010, 68% of Chinese-origin workers in all high-skill jobs and 81% in the IT sector held master's or PhD degrees; among those from India, 56% of workers overall and in the IT sector held advanced degrees. Comparable numbers for immigrants from Europe or Canada are appreciably lower (table 8). Workers from China are also distinguished by the extent to which the US education market is the source of individuals' highest degree. As  NSCG 1993NSCG , 2003NSCG , 2010. Note: For all workers the sample is restricted to all full-time, college-educated workers that are 25 years of age or older. For IT workers the sample is restricted to those working in the IT industry or related occupations and are 25 years of age or older. shown in the right side of table 8, among master's degree holders from China currently working in all high-skill US jobs, 83% to 86% received their highest degree from a US institution across all years-and these proportions are higher in the IT sector. In contrast, among Europeanorigin US workers with advanced degrees in 2010, only 27% of those with a terminal master's degree and 36% of those with a PhD had received these in the United States. That US postsecondary degree receipt is a pathway to entry is validated by review of the data on visa at entry by country of origin. Overall, about 55% of all high-skill, Chinese-origin US workers (and about 64% of those who entered the United States on other than a permanent visa) first came to the United States on a student visa (authors' tabulations from the National Survey of College Graduates [NSCG] [2010]). An implication, then, is that entry on a temporary student visa is likely to be a strong proxy for persistence in the US labor market. Without identifying causality, it is useful to consider the multiple mechanisms through which a US education may lead to labor market persistence. First, self-selection may play an important role; that is, individuals with the most to gain from access to the US labor market may be the most likely to invest in US higher education, which comes at a nontrivial cost of both tuition and forgone earnings. Second, a higher education from the United States may be more valued by US employers than one from abroad. United States employers may feel less sure about the quality of programs or the skill sets of graduates from foreign institutions. United States higher education credentials may serve as a low-cost screening function-helping firms to identify high-skill/ high-quality candidates when the costs of vetting candidates from less familiar origins are likely to be prohibitive."}, {"section_title": "B. Valuing Skills: Differences by Degree Location", "text": "How country of origin and location of postsecondary education correspond to earnings in the US labor market helps explain the incentives for immigration and degree completion in the United States. We continue to focus on those employed in the IT sector because this set of occupations encompass well-defined skills subject to broadly similar demand shocks, but use the overall labor market for college-educated workers as a point of comparison. We consider the earnings for foreign-born relative to native workers with the same degree qualifications and the differences associated with the location of highest degree (United States versus abroad) and timing of US entry, distinguishing between those entering as young children and those entering as adults. 34 We use data from both the NSCG (1993,2003,2010), which has the advantage of precisely measured location and timing of degrees, and the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides more limited education coverage but a much larger sample. Focusing on the wage differentials in the high-skill sector for those arriving in the United States after high school, we analyze earnings differentials between those who completed all of their postsecondary training abroad and those completing their highest degree in the States. The sign and magnitude of this coefficient is indicative of several factors: \u2022 Perceived quality of US versus foreign postsecondary education. While it is widely acknowledged that US universities represent a disproportionate share of the most highly ranked options at the doctorate level, the extent to which undergraduate or master's preparation abroad differs from the United States is far from clear. \u2022 Improved job search. Foreigners graduating from US institutions may be in a better position to search for US jobs than are those living abroad, and this advantage is likely to show up both in terms of increased employment prospects and higher wages. \u2022 Better employer screening. Employers may be better able to evaluate transcripts and academic performance at US universities relative to foreign institutions, while also finding degree information to be more trustworthy when presented by US institutions. \u2022 Foreign-born individuals entering the US labor market directly may be \"selected\" differently from those continuing on from the postsecondary system, with the former group having to be more distinguished in quality to gain work in the United States. While we are unable to distinguish these effects empirically, we are able to provide an estimate of the net effect. Among foreign-born IT workers, those who received their highest degree abroad earned-on average in recent years-a modest premium over those who received their highest degree in the United States. The magnitude of this effect differs somewhat over samples and time periods analyzed. First, in the NSCG, which requires three years of residence in the United States by sample construction, the effect changes from a negative coefficient of -0.0607 in 1993 (in log points, with the negative sign indicating the foreign born who received their highest degree from abroad earned less than the foreign born who earned their highest degree from the United States) to positive coefficients of 0.0622 and 0.0956 in 2003 and 2010, respectively (see panel B of table 9). Examining the ACS over the last decade, we find a differential between degrees granted abroad and in the United States of -0.0095 for the 2001-2010 period and 0.0242 for 2008-2010. This range of coefficients suggests no difference or a modest positive earnings advantage for the foreign born in being educated abroad. That these modest effects shifted over time suggests that the composition of foreign-born IT professionals by country of origin changed somewhat over this period, along with the perceived quality of degree receipt in the United States and abroad. It is worth noting that these results for the IT sector are somewhat different from those found in the high-skill labor market at large, where both parallel regressions and evidence from prior research (e.g., Zeng and Xie 2004) indicate a substantial premium for US education relative to foreign postsecondary education for foreign-born workers. Indeed, we find an overall penalty for foreign education of nearly -.233 in the most recent NSCG and about -.172 log points in the ACS over the most recent decade (see top panel of table 9). 35 The implication is that, across all high-skill occupations, the foreign born with US degrees out earn not only other immigrants with degrees from abroad, but also USborn workers. This result could be explained by US employers applying greater selectivity in hiring the foreign born, or by their perception that postsecondary education received by US-trained immigrants is of higher quality than education received abroad. 36 Two factors may help explain the difference in results found in all job sectors versus in IT occupations. First, location of degree may matter less in IT fields than in other occupations. Second, the changing composition of foreign-born IT professionals by country of origin may have an effect. Hunt (2011) and others note that the returns to English language fluency-associated with a US postsecondary experience-may be smaller in IT than in other fields, which could dampen the wage advantage of a US degree in IT jobs. Moreover, consistent with the lack of a penalty for IT workers, Peri and Sparber (2009) suggest that US natives and the foreign born educated in US institutions may find it easier to transfer their skills from IT fields to management positions and other occupations.

See the appendix for the full set of estimation results. The base specification includes a constant, dummy variables for foreign born, foreign born and immigrated after age 18, highest degree levels, sex, and age groups. Country-specific factors may also play a role in the differential effects of a US education among all foreign-born, high-skill workers versus foreign-born IT workers. Using data from the NSCG and the ACS (table 10), we disaggregate the foreign born place of education effect by country of origin. It is striking that foreign-born IT workers educated in European countries and Canada appear to benefit from degrees from abroad, while those from China face a disadvantage. For IT workers from India, place of postsecondary training has virtually no effect. Given the significant contribution made by foreign workersparticularly workers from China and India-to the US IT labor market over the last two decades, it is striking that the penalty for foreign education is dramatically attenuated in the IT sector relative to all highskill workers (see table 10, panels A and B). One might ask why young people from India, China, and other countries would continue to pursue degrees in the United States given a low, nonexistent, or negative earnings advantage and the relatively high out-of-pocket costs. One explanation is that while US degrees may not provide a strong wage advantage, they do provide improved access to the US labor market given the US visa system. The OPT program allows an extended window of opportunity to look for jobs and H-1B visas can be extended for obtaining an advanced degree-increasing in both cases the potential for employment in the United States. In sum, we find variation by country of origin in the labor market penalty/premium for foreign degree receipt. At the extremes, workers from China pay a penalty and those from European countries receive a premium. Such differences likely reflect the combination of differences across countries in the quality of home-country university options and home-country labor market opportunities that affect selection into the US labor market. Because student visas are not subject to a numerical cap and the foreign born who receive US degrees are advantaged in the award of temporary work visas, studying in the United States is likely to improve US employment prospects even if the obtained degree confers no wage premium and costs more than one available from their country of origin."}, {"section_title": "VI.

About 9.5% of the current high-skill labor force is comprised of those entering the US on student visas and then transitioning to temporary or permanent work visas. In occupations like IT, the share is higher still at 15.7%. Focusing on just those workers under the age of 35-the cohort more likely to be affected by the restrictive H-1B visa policy of the last decade-we find a magnified effect for US higher education, with 16.7% of all current high-skill workers and 26.4% of IT workers entering the United States on student visas (authors' tabulations from the NSCG [2010]). Focusing still more on foreign-born IT workers who did not arrive in the United States at young ages on permanent visas, we find the share receiving their highest degree from US institutions is yet higher. The flow of foreign-born students to US higher education institutions and-potentially-the US labor market depends on home-country economic conditions and education options, labor market opportunities in the United States, and the supply side of the US higher education market. Rosenzweig (2006) proposes two models for foreign student mobility: a \"constrained domestic schooling model\" in which foreign students seek education in the United States due to a lack of homecountry options, and a \"migration model\" in which foreign students enroll in the United States to increase the probability that they will find employment in the United States when they graduate. 37 To the extent that foreign students come from countries with large wage differences with the US labor market and their enrollment rates are sensitive to the US labor market conditions rather than the expanding education opportunities at the home country, the \"migration model\" is fairly important. In this paper, we emphasize that there is substantial interaction between visa policies providing access to the US labor market and education decisions of foreign-born students if the motivation for US education is as described in the \"migration model.\" More restrictive work visa policies may boost the option value of gaining employment subsequent to graduation for those with the weakest home-country options to the extent that the likelihood of employment with a US degree, particularly at the advanced level, is quite high relative to having a degree from abroad. 38 Simply put, our analyses point to the interpretation that demand among foreign students for US higher education is high not because of the relative value of the degree itself, but because studying in the United States is a pathway to employment in the United States, effectively lowering search costs, increasing networking opportunities, and providing a more easily interpretable skill set. 39 On the market-demand side, US employers may prefer US-trained workers because choosing workers from domestic institutions reduces their search and recruitment costs and the uncertainty in skill assessment. Given the high returns in the US labor market for S&E degrees, students from India and China are willing to pay for education in the United States and increasingly have the means (Farrar 2012;Johnson 2011). In turn, US educational institutions value foreign students at least in part for tuition revenues (Bird and Turner 2014). It is for this combination of reasons that there is an expansion of degree programs at the subdoctoral level provided by US educational institutions. Our analyses indicate that postsecondary policies that affect opportunities for study in the United States, such as student visa restrictions or increases in the direct costs for educational programs, will have a substantial effect on the flow of high-skill workers to the US labor market. In turn, elasticity in the supply of US graduate programs-particularly in science and engineering-to meet foreign demand is likely to affect the level and composition of high-skill immigration to the United States. Future changes in the supply of US higher education could have dramatic effects on the flow of high-skill, foreign-born workers to the US economy. For example, US universities may be able to expand opportunities for graduate study-in particular, in master's-level S&E programs-by using technology to increase the scale of programs while reducing marginal costs. On the other hand, continued fiscal contractions, particularly at public universities, may force the shuttering of doctorate programs, which would narrow a channel of entry for foreign graduate students. Of course, the demand side of foreign flows to the US higher education market also merits attention in projections. Two factors may serve to reduce demand for postsecondary study in the United States: the development of university capacity abroad (Freeman 2010) and a decreasing earnings advantage in the US labor market. Particularly at the graduate level, where students from abroad are a large constituency, a large decline in the foreign demand for US degree programs would have a substantial effect on the US market for higher education."}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "For acknowledgments, sources of research support, and disclosure of the authors' material financial relationships, if any, please see http://www.nber.org/chapters/c13402.ack. 1. More concretely, we restrict our analysis to the workers with at least bachelor's degree credentials, and include the following occupations in the IT field: computer and information scientists, computer network architects, computer support specialists, computer system analysts, database administrators, information security analysts, network and computer system administrators, software developers, web developers, other computer information science, computer engineers, electrical and electronic engineers, computer and information system managers, and computer programmers from the occupation list of the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). 2. Bound et al. (2013) argue that the increased availability of foreign high-skilled labor increased the labor supply elasticity to the sector, leading to both a larger growth in sectoral output and a dampened increase in wages. 3. This finding is clear in the Current Population Survey (CPS), the American Community Survey (ACS), the decennial census enumerations, and the periodic National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG 1993(NSCG , 2003(NSCG , 2010, which includes detailed information on the location, year, and field of postsecondary attainment. The National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) draws on the census and ACS for the sampling frame. While the advantage of this survey for the analytics that follow is that we are able to identify whether an individual's postsecondary degrees were obtained in the United States or abroad, a disadvantage is that the NSCG will underrepresent college-educated workers residing in the United States for short periods of time and those leaving the country owing to the expiration of work visas. 4. Based on rankings of research universities, 6 of the top 10 universities and 15 of the top 30 universities are located in the United States. 5. The S&E fields include physical and biological sciences, mathematics and computer sciences, agricultural sciences, social and behavioral sciences, and engineering (NSB 2014). The figure for India is based on enrollment numbers in 2010 and does not cover social sciences (Government of India, Education Statistics at a Glance 2010-11, table 12). 6. For jobs most likely to engage foreign-born workers, permanent residence status or appropriate visas permitting work are most likely required given the difficulty of formal sector transactions with undocumented workers. While nearly 75% of unauthorized immigrants (compared to about 26% of all immigrants) are estimated to hold a high school degree or less, only about 15% are estimated to hold a BA degree or higher (Passel and Cohn 2011). 7. Permanent residents may also become naturalized citizens; typically, permanent residents may apply for citizenship five years after attaining permanent residency. While it is possible to enter the United States directly with permanent residency status, Lowell (2010) estimates that 90% of employment-based and 55% of family-based visa holders move up from temporary visa status. 8. The four main avenues for permanent residency are: family reunification, employment, humanitarian/refugee interests, and diversity (Martin 2012). Family-based immigration is the largest channel for immigration. Immediate relatives (parents, spouses, minor children) are admitted without limit, while there is a cap of 480,000 for other family-based immigration. Some high-skill immigrants are admitted as children via this channel, completing their precollegiate and postsecondary training in the United States. 9. Less than one-half of the employment-based visas have gone to workers themselves, as this total includes dependents of these immigrants in the employment-based visa cap (Orrenius and Zavodny 2010). 10. Additional \"priorities\" include: Fourth priority is given to individuals who have specialized jobs such as physicians, religious workers, and international organization employees. Last priority goes to entrepreneurs who invest at least $500,000 to create and sustain at least 10 permanent jobs.

Lan (2012) studies the impact of the Chinese Student Protection Act on the labor market performance of Chinese doctorate students and finds that the provision of green cards increases earnings and the probability to be employed in non-postdoctoral positions. 14. The Chinese Student Protection Act (CSPA 1992) allowed Chinese nationals (including students) who were present in the United States at the time of the Tiananmen Square violence in 1989 to apply for legal permanent resident status. Of the nearly 50,000 individuals making the transition to legal permanent resident status under CSPA, at least 60% had initial visa classifications indicating high-skill characteristics and about 40% held student visas (Orrenius, Zavodny, and Kerr 2012). Notably, nearly all of these students would have been graduate students given the trivial number of undergraduate students from China enrolled at US institutions in the 1980s. A similar country-specific program is the Soviet Scientists Immigration Act of 1992 that allowed permanent visa status to 750 scientists from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and former Baltic states. Note that the Soviet Scientists Immigration Act is distinguished from the CSPA in that it applies mostly to those who have completed postsecondary education. 15. By statute, H-1B visas are \"are reserved for high-skill workers, requiring that the employee be in a specialty occupation, defined as one that requires 'theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and attainment of a bachelor's or higher, or its equivalent.'\" While the H-1B is the most widely recognized temporary visa, there is a substantial portfolio of other temporary work visa options that can connect foreign-born, high-skill workers to the US labor market. Appendix table 1 of Bound and Turner (2014) summarizes these alternative types. Other temporary visa categories include the L-1 visa for Intracompany Transfers, the O-1 visa for \"Workers with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement,\" the TN visa for NAFTA Professional Workers, and the E-1 visa for Treaty Traders and Treaty Investors. Behind H-1B issuances, L-1 Intracompany Transfer visas are the most issued of the other temporary worker visa categories. In addition, there is some evidence that research universities increasingly use the J-1 category for foreign postdocs and visiting research scientists rather than the more costly H-1B visa. While occupational categories typically using J-1 visas include physicians (including medical residents), teachers, and visiting scholars, the largest single group of J-1 visa recipients is foreign nationals traveling to the United States for summer work or travelcomprising 31% of the 2012 total. 16. In cases where an H-1B holder has applied for a \"green card\" or permanent residences status, but has not achieved current priority date for processing, they may receive a three-year H-1B extension, following from the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000. 17. The minimum application fees total $3,575 in the most recent year and are somewhat larger for firms with more than 25 employees (an additional $750 per employee) and cases requesting expedited processing ($1,225 per employee). 18.

In addition, country-specific free trade agreements designate 1,400 H-1B1 visas for Chilean nationals and 5,400 H-1B1 visas for Singapore nationals. It is notable that neither country-specific visa quota has been filled since inception: the total number of H-1B1 visas for both Chile and Singapore is less than 1,000. 20. The mechanics of receiving an F visa are as follows: Foreign students who wish to study in the United States must first apply to and be accepted by a Student and Exchange Visitors Program (SEVP)-certified school. The school them provides the form I-20A-B, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status-For Academic and Language Students. The student's information given on this form is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor and Information System (SEVIS) database. After submitting the I-20 form, students are required to submit the I-901 SEVIS fee. For F-1 visas, this amount is currently $200 (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] website, \"Fact Sheet: I-901 SEVIS Fee for F, M and J Nonimmigrant Students and Exchange Visitors.\" http:// www.ice.gov/sevis/factsheet/090104_fs.htm). After receiving the SEVIS I-901 receipt, the student can apply for a visa at any US embassy. To maintain the F visa, an individual must refrain from unauthorized employment and maintain a full course load. 21. The mechanics of adjusting to the OPT program are as follows: a foreign student who wishes to work in the US labor market must apply to the designated school office of his/her school within 60 days of graduation. Designated school officials renew his/her Form I-20 by making appropriate notation in SEVIS, then send it out to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), with the application fee paid by the student. The amount of the fee is currently $380. When the Employment Authorization Document (form I-765) is issued by USCIS, the student becomes eligible to work. 22. A further administrative change extended the number of designated STEM programs from about 200 to nearly 400 in May 2011 and June 2012. For further details of the program, and the impact of these policy changes on the stay rate and labor market outcomes of foreign students, see Demirci (2013). 23. To find the transition rates of foreign students into the US labor market through the OPT program, we compare the number of OPT beneficiaries in a year to the number of foreign graduates of US colleges in the previous year. From 1999 to 2009, this transition rate has been around 0.3, which implies that three-tenths of students enter the US labor market initially under the OPT status (figure 6). 24. The DOE distinguishes enrollment and degrees conferred for all students at the level of the institution, further disaggregating by level of enrollment and field of degrees. The IIE has gathered data on the internationally mobile student population since 1948, and provides counts of students by country of origin studying in the United States at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Unfortunately, data providing enrollment by country of origin at the institution level is not available. 25. The year corresponds to the fall year of the academic year. For example, 1954 corresponds to the 1954/55 academic year. 26. Recessionary conditions that limited US job opportunities and continued growth in higher education abroad placed downward pressure on demand for US degree programs. Lowell and Khadka (2011) document the post-9/11 decline and find a 20% decrease in F visas issued between 2001 and 2002, a more modest decline in 2003, and then a period of rebound beginning in 2004. Lowell and Khadka emphasize that, consistent with retrenchment in temporary student enrollment in the mid-1980s, visa declines are most closely aligned with changes in economic conditions, rises in real tuition costs at US universities, and eroding postdegree job prospects in the United States. 27. To be sure, a small number of the \"super-elite\" colleges and universities in the United States are able to offer need-blind admission and full financial aid to international undergraduate students; these institutions include MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Williams, and Middlebury, with most of these institutions opening aid to international students around the year 2000. See http://www.edupass.org/finaid/undergraduate .phtml for a list of universities that offer significant financial aid (both need-based and merit, but not athletic) to international students. 28. Open Doors 2007 \" Table 15 International Students by Primary Source of Funding 2005Funding /06 & 2006 29. While the number of master's degrees in all fields to temporary students increased from 48,756 to 89,145, the number of master's degrees in CS and engineering increased from 14,711 to 29,670. Thus the increase in CS and engineering, in the amount of 14,959, accounts for 37% of the total increase in master's degrees. On the other hand, PhD degrees to temporary residents in CS and engineering increased by 2,728, and BA degrees increased by 2,886. Both of these figures are substantially smaller than the increase in master's degrees. 30. See http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools /top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings. The most highly ranked programs in computer science are: Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, University of California-Berkeley, and University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. 31. Between 1975 and the local peak in 1986, CS and electrical engineering (EE) undergraduate degrees increased by 446%, from 15,285 to 68,307 based on data from the Department of Education's annual \"Earned Degrees Conferred Surveys.\" Then, from 1995 to 2004, degree awards increased by a more modest-though still appreciable-186%, from 42,348 to 78,747. 32. This measure includes all types of transitions to permanent residency, including those based on family green cards. 33. However, for a number of other countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, Finn (2012) finds five-year stay rates under 50%. An inference following Bound et al. (2009) is that persistence rates reflect market forces, not just visa availability. Doctorate recipients from high-income countries with well-established universities may face better home-country options than those from low-income countries. As a result, those from Western Europe and Canada may not choose to stay permanently in the United States unless they obtain employment in top research universities or labs. 34. We find that foreign-born individuals who arrive in the United States at relatively young ages earn a labor market premium relative to those arriving at older ages, on the order of 0.17-0.18 log points, while also garnering a premium relative to natives among IT workers. This is a net effect that includes the potential for substantial assimilation and the likely selection by family circumstances. The same broad pattern holds for all collegeeducated workers. We report parallel regressions for all workers in the appendix. 35. Using the NSCG allows for the observation of field of study in addition to location of degree. As shown in the additional rows of table 9A (and appendix table 11), the estimated effects of the \"location\" of degree receipt change only modestly with the inclusion of field of study and occupation fixed effects. 36. It is noteworthy that even as the appendix table 9A results include fixed effects for occupation (columns [3], [6], and [9]), when we limit the analysis to those in the IT profession we see a decided change in the interaction between \"Foreign Born\" and \"Foreign Degree Receipt,\" with this coefficient ceasing to be negative and significant after 1993. As we discuss in the next paragraph, two factors are at play: first, location of degree may matter less in IT fields than in other occupations and, second, the composition of foreignborn IT professionals by country of origin changes somewhat over this period. 37. Using a cross-section of data, Rosenzweig finds that the number of foreign students is positively related to the number of universities in a home country and negatively related to the home country \"skill price,\" the market wage for a given skill level. Rosenzweig concludes that the migration model is the correct model, meaning foreign students come to the United States for education for an option value to enter the US labor market. However, Hwang (2009) uses a panel of data from an alternate source, and finds a positive relationship between a home country's skill price and enrollment in the United States. She also performs a survey of foreign students at Harvard, from which 35.8% of respondents revealed that their primary reason for studying in the United States was a lack of high-quality options in their home country. In addition, only half of respondents expressed the desire to work in the United States after graduation, and only 22% wished to work in the United States long term. Rosenzweig and Hwang do not disaggregate foreign students into education levels, that is, undergraduate versus graduate, yet we would expect demand determinants are likely very different for undergraduate, master's, professional, or doctorate-level students. 38. Kato and Sparber (2013) test how decreasing H-1B visa quotas for most countries in the early twenty-first century affected foreign enrollment. They find that not only do smaller quotas decrease foreign enrollment, but these restrictions also decrease the average quality of foreign interest in applying to US institutions. Kato and Sparber's results are consistent with the migration model proposed by Rosenzweig, as applicants become less likely to secure employment in the United States after graduation. However, their results may be confounded by the fact that the US student visa program also suffered from additional restrictions and delays in the years following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Kato and Sparber's results are also limited to the undergraduate level. 39. We do not intend to imply that foreign students' only motive for studying in the"}]
