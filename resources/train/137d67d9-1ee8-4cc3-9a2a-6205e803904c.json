[{"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents initial findings about the employment outcomes of bachelor's degree recipients approximately 4 years after they completed their 2007 --08 degrees. These findings are based on data from the second follow-up of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/12), a nationally representative longitudinal sample survey of students who completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree during the 2007 --08 academic year. The study addresses questions related to bachelor's degree recipients' education and employment experiences and includes two follow-ups. The first follow-up, which was conducted 1 year after graduation, explored both undergraduate education experiences and early postbaccalaureate employment and enrollment. This second follow-up, conducted in 2012, examines bachelor's degree recipients' labor market experiences and enrollment in additional postsecondary degree programs through the 4th year after graduation. The Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) series of data collections allows researchers to address questions regarding bachelor's degree recipients' undergraduate experiences, including their participation in various financial aid programs, undergraduate debt, and repayment of that debt; entrance into and progress through postbaccalaureate education; and employment, particularly for graduates who became elementary/secondary teachers. In B&B:08/12, respondents were asked to provide a complete employment history beginning from the date they completed their bachelor's degree requirements. This depth of information on bachelor's degree recipients' employment and job search activities is new to the B&B series of studies, and this First Look, therefore, focuses on employment outcomes. The First Look reports introduce new National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) survey data by presenting selected descriptive information. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based solely on the bivariate results presented: many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a few of those available in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of employment-related information in the study. The release of this report is intended to encourage other researchers to conduct more in-depth analysis of these data using more sophisticated statistical methods. Among the approximately 137,800 undergraduate students who were sampled for the 2007 --08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08), approximately 17,110 students INTRODUCTION were determined to be eligible for B&B:08/12. Eligible students were those who had enrolled at an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and was located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; had completed requirements for a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008; and were awarded a baccalaureate degree by the institution from which they were sampled no later than June 30, 2009. These students represent approximately 1.6 million students who completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008. 1 This report is organized as follows. The first section presents key findings from the detailed tables that follow. Table 1 provides information on the demographic and undergraduate enrollment characteristics of 2007 --08 bachelor's degree recipients. Tables 2 --3 examine the employment and degree enrollment status of graduates in 2012, roughly 4 years after graduating with a bachelor's degree. Table 4 addresses the number of jobs that graduates held within 4 years of graduation, while Table 5 presents the percentage of time that graduates spent employed, unemployed, and out of the labor force in that time frame. Table 6 examines the characteristics of graduates' jobs in 2012. Appendix A provides a glossary of variables used in this publication and their definitions. Appendix B provides details about the methods and procedures used for B&B:08/12. It contains information on data sources, sample design, imputation, weighting, and quality of estimates, including standard errors for estimates presented in table 1 (table B-13).

A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted during NPSAS:08 for these two types of institutions. However, these two types of institutions are irrelevant to B&B:08/12 because they do not include baccalaureate recipients. Interested readers can refer to Cominole et al. (2010) for more information regarding the institution bias analysis."}, {"section_title": "Bias Analysis: Student-Level", "text": "As shown in table B-3, the NPSAS:08 weighted study response rate for students was above 85 percent overall and for each type of institution, so student-level nonresponse bias analysis for NPSAS:08 was not necessary for any type of institution. As shown in table B-6, the B&B:08/09 weighted response rate for students was below 85 percent overall and for each type of institution for the student interview and for the combined student interview and transcript. Therefore, a student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for B&B:08/09. See Wine et al. (2013) for bias analysis details. As shown in table B-8, the bookend, panel, and transcript panel weighted response rates were below 85 percent overall and for all three types of institutions, so a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within each type of institution. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, and some variables were added that were not included in the nonresponse weight adjustment. The following variables were used for nonresponse bias analysis: 8 First, for the variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated by comparing estimates from base-weighted respondents with those of both nonrespondents and the full sample to determine if the differences were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The two comparisons yielded identical bias estimates but not always the same significance-testing results. Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for key variables included in the models. Third, using base weights adjusted for nonresponse, bias was re-estimated and statistical tests were performed to check for any remaining significant nonresponse bias. Finally, to better understand the effect of poststratification on efforts to reduce nonresponse bias, two additional sets of estimates were created. The first, the difference between respondent means before and after poststratification, represents the effect of poststratification on nonresponse adjustments. The second, the difference between base-weighted full sample means and the poststratified respondent means, represents the cumulative effect of all weighting and adjustment steps. Bias estimates and differences were suppressed for variable categories with fewer than 30 nonrespondents. As shown in table B-10, the nonresponse weighting adjustment eliminated some, but not all, significant bias on these characteristics. Before weighting, the percentage of variable categories that were significantly biased ranged from 2.9 percent among for-profit institutions with the panel and transcript panel weights to 49.0 percent among public institutions with the panel weight. ranged from 0.0 percent among private nonprofit institutions with the bookend and transcript panel weights to 13.8 percent among for-profit institutions with the bookend weight. The mean and median estimated relative bias among for-profit institutions increased after the nonresponse weight adjustment, but this increase affected a small portion of the students (5.2 percent of eligible sample members, unweighted). Overall, significant bias remained for two or fewer categories of major and both categories of sex for each analysis weight. Significant bias estimates ranged from -2.0 to 2.0 percent. Among public institutions, two or fewer categories of institution enrollment and three or fewer categories of major had remaining significant bias for each analysis weight. Additionally, both categories of sex were significantly biased for the transcript panel weight. The significant bias estimates ranged from -1.9 to 2.3 percent. Among private nonprofit institutions, one category of region had significant bias of -1.5 percent for the panel weight, and no variables had significant bias remaining for the other two weights. Among for-profit institutions, two or fewer categories of enrollment had remaining significant bias for each analysis weight, and both categories of state aid status had significant bias for the bookend weight. The bias estimates ranged from -6.1 to 5.0 percent. As shown in table B-11, across all three weights, the mean and median absolute differences between means for respondents before and after poststratification adjustment were less than 2.0 for the overall, public, and nonprofit institutions and greater than 4.4 for the for-profit institutions. The differences between means for the full sample and respondents after poststratification adjustment were similar, with differences less than 2.0 for the overall, public, and nonprofit institutions and greater than 3.4 for the for-profit institutions."}, {"section_title": "B-22", "text": "APPENDIX B-B&B:08/12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "Bias Analysis: Item-Level", "text": "NCES Statistical Standard 4-4-3A states: ''For an item with a low total response rate, respondents and nonrespondents can be compared on sampling frame and/or questionnaire variables for which data on respondents and nonrespondents are available. Base weights must be used in such analysis. Comparison items should have very high response rates. This approach may be limited to the extent that items available for respondents and nonrespondents may not be related to the low response rate item being analyzed'' (Seastrom 2012). Moreover, NCES Statistical Standard 1-3-5 states: ''Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip item for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse. . . . In the case of constructed variables, the numerator includes cases that have available data for the full set of items required to construct the variable, and the denominator includes all respondents eligible to respond to all items in the constructed variable'' (Seastrom 2012). The item response rate is calculated as: A student is defined as an ''item respondent'' for an analytic variable if that student had data for that variable from any source, including logical imputation. ''Item nonrespondents'' for analytic variables are students who did not have data for that variable from any source. NCES Standard 1-3-5 also states that response rates for composite variables must account for missing inputs prior to imputation. As shown in table B-12, the weighted item response rates for items used in this First Look report for all students ranged from 90 percent to 100 percent. The weighted item response rates by type of institution ranged from 84 percent to 100 percent. One item had a weighted response rate below 85 percent. As shown in table B-12, the response rate for the item RACE (race/ethnicity) was below 85 percent at forprofit institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for this item. The procedures used for the item-level nonresponse bias analysis are the same as those APPENDIX B-B&B:08/12 TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY B-23 used for the student-level nonresponse bias analysis presented above, and a subset of the variables used for the student-level analysis are used for the item-level analysis. 9 The percentage of variable categories for which the item RACE had statistically significant bias prior to imputation was 24.0 percent for students in for-profit institutions. The mean and median percent relative absolute biases were 22.6 and 15.1 percent, respectively, for students in for-profit institutions.
