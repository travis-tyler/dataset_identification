A common approach to distinguish between explained and unexplained components follows the seminal papers of Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973) , and overbars denote means, it is straightforward to show that\nIn this expression, the first and second terms on the right hand side represent the explained and unexplained components of the difference in mean outcomes, respectively.\nBoth seminal articles pointed out that the decomposition in Eq. (1) is not unique because an equally compelling alternative decomposition exists:\nWhile the first term on the right hand side of Eq. (2) is still interpreted as the explained component, this alternative calculation generally will yield different values from Eq. (1), and there is often little reason to prefer one to the other. Many papers acknowledge this ambiguity by simply reporting both decompositions.\nSeveral papers have proposed alternative O-B decompositions, with perhaps the most widely adopted alternative proposed by Neumark (1988) .\n1 That paper develops a decomposition based on a pooled regression without group-specific intercepts. It is important to emphasize that Neumark (1988) does not analyze the measurement issue of whether his pooled decomposition or those based on Eqs. (1) and (2) distinguish between explained and unexplained gaps. Rather, he analyzes what fraction of an unexplained wage gap, already purged of productivity differences, represents discrimination, demonstrating that different assumptions regarding employer behavior can lead to each of the three decompositions. 2 Despite this difference in motivation, the pooled decomposition he proposed has been adopted Labour Economics 17 (2010) 284-290 \u204e Corresponding author.

Oaxaca and Ransom (1994) provide an integrative treatment of the various methods.\n2 Neumark (1988) shows how different assumptions regarding employer preferences lead to different estimates of the wage structure that would prevail in the absence of discrimination, and therefore different estimates of discrimination. His analysis starts from the assumption that the set of observable characteristics is sufficiently rich to remove all productivity differences between the groups of interest, so that any unexplained differences represent discrimination or favoritism. We suspect that few researchers interested in decomposing group differences into explained and unexplained components intend to make such an assumption.

They estimate the pooled regression including an indicator variable for group membership as well as the other observable characteristics, interpreting the coefficient on the group indicator as the unexplained component. For example, this method has been applied to the measurement of union wage premiums (e.g., Lewis, 1986) , racial test score gaps (e.g., Fryer and Levitt, 2004) , and racial wage gaps (e.g., Neal and Johnson, 1996) .\nIn this paper, we compare these various methods for assessing the unexplained gap in mean outcomes between two groups. Our analysis yields two principal findings. First, we show that the coefficient on the group indicator from a pooled OLS regression is an attractive approach for obtaining a single measure of the unexplained gap. Second, we show that the pooled O-B strategy systematically overstates the role of observables in explaining mean outcome as compared to OLS with a group indicator, thereby understating unexplained differences. 4 The intuition for this result is straightforward: the pooled regression coefficients on observable covariates are biased due to the omission of group-specific intercepts, which in turn causes the role of observables to be overstated. We then provide three empirical examples that explore the practical importance of our analytic results, two based on wage gaps and one based on test score gaps."}, {"section_title": "The relationship among four measures of the unexplained gap", "text": "As in the Introduction, let y be the scalar outcome of interest, d be an indicator variable equal to 1 for an individual in group 1 and 0 otherwise, X be the vector of observable characteristics (including a constant but not d), and overbars denote means. We study four different measures of the unexplained gap in y\u0304between groups 0 and 1. The first two measures come from the standard O-B decompositions listed in Eqs. (1) and (2): define Gap 1 to be X \u0305 0 (\u03b2\u03021 \u2212\u03b2\u03020), the final term in Eq. (1), and similarly define Gap 0 to be the final term in Eq. (2). The third measure, Gap p , is the unexplained component from Neumark's (1988) proposed decomposition,\nwhere \u03b2\u0302p is defined to be the coefficient vector from the pooled regression of y on X. The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (3) is again interpreted as the explained component, and the sum of the final two terms is the unexplained component, Gap p . If y denotes a wage, for example, then these two terms correspond to each group's advantage or disadvantage relative to the pooled wage structure. Finally, the fourth unexplained gap measure, Gap OLS , is the coefficient on d from the pooled OLS regression of y on d and X. We compare these gaps by specifying a population data generating process and then deriving what each of the gaps measure."}, {"section_title": "The case in which coefficients are equal across groups", "text": "We begin by assuming that the mean outcomes between groups 0 and 1 differ only by a constant and that the outcome is influenced by only one observable characteristic x. These assumptions simplify the exposition substantially, but as we describe below, all of the results in this section extend to the case in which the outcome depends on a vector of characteristics X. We relax the assumption of equal coefficients across groups in the next subsection.\nSpecifically, suppose the population relationship between y, d, and x is\nwith \u03b5 orthogonal to d and to x conditional on d. 5 Under these strong assumptions, a sensible definition of the population unexplained gap is \u03b4 d . Moreover, under these assumptions, the probability limit of Gap OLS is \u03b4 d .\nTo derive probability limits of the other estimates of the unexplained gap, we introduce some additional notation. An O-B unexplained gap can always be written as the difference in overall mean outcomes minus the difference in predicted mean outcomes, and both of these differences can be denoted by linear projections. Letting b(z|w) denote the slope from a linear projection of z on w and a constant, a general expression for an O-B unexplained gap is\nwhere \u03b8\u0302is a coefficient computed from sample data. The choice of \u03b8\u0302is what distinguishes different O-B decompositions from each other. For example, Gap 1 is obtained when \u03b8\u0302is the OLS slope coefficient from a regression of y on x and a constant using data from group 1, while Gap 0 is obtained when \u03b8\u0302is the OLS slope coefficient using data from group 0. Consider the probability limit of an O-B gap under the data generating process described by Eq. (4) \nThus, the estimated gap converges to \u03b4 d whenever plim \u03b8\u0302= \u03b4 x . Because plim \u03b8\u0302= \u03b4 x in both group-specific regressions, the probability limits of Gap 0 and Gap 1 are \u03b4 d , implying that Gap 0 , Gap 1 , and Gap OLS are asymptotically equivalent. In contrast, Gap P generally will not converge to \u03b4 d . The difference arises because, in a pooled regression that does not include the 3 For examples of articles that adopt this pooling approach, see Oaxaca and Ransom (1994) , Mavromaras and Rudolph (1997) , DeLeire (2001), Hersch and Stratton (2002) , Jacob (2002) , Boden and Galizzi (2003) , Gittleman and Wolff (2004), and Yount (2008) . 4 To our knowledge, the only references to this issue in the literature are in Fortin (2006) and Jann (2008) . Both papers discuss the idea that omitting a group indicator can transfer some of the unexplained gap to the explained portion. However, neither paper develops a general expression for the bias. In addition, both discuss the issue in a context where the group with better outcomes also has larger values of characteristics positively associated with outcome (e.g., males having more education in a model of male-female wage gaps). It has not previously been shown that the bias relative to pooled OLS with a group indicator exists whenever the groups have different mean characteristics (i.e., whenever O-B decompositions are used).\ngroup-specific intercept d, plim \u03b8\u0302typically does not equal \u03b4 x due to omitted variables bias. To see this formally, consider the probability limit of Gap P , \nIt is useful to compare this expression to an alternative representation of the probability limit of Gap \nThe ratio of the two gaps, var(d(x))/var(d), equals the probability limit of (1 \u2212 R 2 ) from the auxiliary regression of d on x, so the gaps are equivalent only when d is orthogonal to x (in which case observed characteristics explain none of the between-group differences in outcomes). In all other cases, the probability limit of Gap P is smaller than the probability limit of Gap OLS , which we have shown to be equivalent to \u03b4 d and the probability limits of Gap 0 and Gap 1 . The intuition for this result is straightforward. The omission of d from a pooled regression leads to omitted variables bias in the estimated coefficient on x. Because the coefficient on x captures both the direct effect of x on y and the effect of d on y indirectly through the correlation between d and x, it tends to explain \"too much\" of the gap in outcomes, leading the unexplained gap to be too small. We illustrate this effect in Fig. 1 for the case in which x\u03041 N x\u03040, y\u03041 N y\u03040, and \u03b4 x N 0. The total gap in mean outcomes is y\u03041 \u2212 y\u03040, and based on the group 1 regression line (the top line in the figure), the explained gap is y\u03041 \u2212 A and the unexplained gap is A \u2212 y\u03040. Note that the steepness of the line determines the magnitudes of the explained and unexplained gaps, so Gap 1 and Gap 0 are identical because the group 1 and group 0 lines are parallel. In contrast, the regression line for the pooled regression (denoted as the dashed line in the figure) must be steeper than either group line due to omitted variables bias. As a result, Gap P must be less than the other three unexplained gap measures. 6 Finally, in Appendix A1 we show that the asymptotic relationship given in Eq. (9) is also an exact result that holds in finite samples. Further, although we have assumed x is a scalar for notational convenience, the relationship between Gap P and Gap OLS holds when x is vector-valued and regardless of whether model (4) , we once again begin by assuming that the outcome is influenced by only one observable characteristic x. We assume again that \u03b5 is orthogonal to d and to x conditional on d, but now we allow the coefficient on x to vary between the two groups,\nEq. (6) showed that the probability limit for an O-B unexplained gap based on \u03b8\u0302can be written as , and Gap 0 .\n6 Neumark (1988) , p. 293, makes a similar point about the case illustrated in Fig. 1 .\nWe note, however, that our finding that Gap P is smaller in absolute value than Gap OLS does not require that x1 N x0, or that either measure is bounded between zero and the overall difference in mean outcomes. 7 An implication of these results is that, while Gap OLS and Gap P will always have the same sign, the sign of the explained component can differ depending on which approach is used. If y1 N y0, x1 b x0, and \u03b4 x N 0, then y1 N y0 will be smaller than Gap OLS and the associated explained component will be negative. In this situation, y1 N y0 may be larger than Gap OLS multiplied by (1 \u2212 R 2 ) from the auxiliary regression of d on x. If so, y1 N y0 will be larger than Gap P , so that the explained component will be positive. The use of Gap P would therefore imply that observable characteristics explain a positive fraction of an outcome gap, despite the fact that the group with \"better\" outcomes has \"worse\" observable characteristics.\nAs we show in the Appendix A, Gap OLS is a weighted average of \nwith the weights given by sample analogs of the following: w 1 \u2261plim\u0175 1 = Pr\u00f0d = 1\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 1\u00de Pr\u00f0d = 1\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 1\u00de + Pr\u00f0d = 0\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 0\u00de \u00f014a\u00de w 0 \u2261plim\u0175 0 = Pr\u00f0d = 0\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 0\u00de Pr\u00f0d = 1\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 1\u00de + Pr\u00f0d = 0\u00devar\u00f0x jd = 0\u00de :\nIt is straightforward to show that these weights are bounded by 0 and 1, implying that Gap OLS is always bounded by Gap 1 and Gap 0 . In addition, the structure of these weights is intuitively appealing, with , identical to the O-B decomposition proposed by Cotton (1988) . Although Eqs. (14a) and (14b) hold exactly when x is a scalar, they are only suggestive of the relationships among the gaps when X is a vector of characteristics. In the vector case, Gap OLS is not necessarily bounded between Gap 0 and Gap 1 . 8 However, the relationship among the three measures depends on similar quantities as in the scalar case, making it unlikely that Gap OLS will deviate far from the bounds; the extent it deviates from the bounds is an empirical issue that we return to below. In the vector case, Gap OLS will still tend to Gap 0 or Gap 1 depending on the relative group sample size and the variance of observables. To see why, recall that Eq. (5) implies that all three gaps can be written as the total gap minus a gap-specific explained portion, (X \u0305 1 \u2212 X \u0305 0 )\u2032\u03b8, with the choice of \u03b8\u0302uniquely determining the gap. Gap 0 is based on \u03b2\u03020, Gap 1 is based on \u03b2\u03021, and Gap OLS is based on \u03b2\u0302O LS , the slope coefficient on X from a pooled regression of y on X and d. The coefficient vector \u03b2\u0302O LS will be closer to \u03b2\u03021 (and therefore Gap OLS will be closer to Gap 1 ) when group 1 is a larger share of the sample and when the variances of the X's are larger in group 1 than in group 0. Our empirical results in the next section will demonstrate the extent to which Gap OLS deviates from Gap 1 and Gap 0 in three different contexts, as well as the extent to which Gap P deviates from Gap OLS ."}, {"section_title": "Empirical examples", "text": "We demonstrate the practical importance of the analytic results shown above by presenting three empirical examples: the malefemale wage gap among full-time, full-year workers using Current Population Survey (CPS) data; the white-black wage gap among fulltime, full-year working males using CPS data; and the white-black test score gap in kindergarten using the fall 1998 assessment of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). For the first two outcomes we first show results for 1985 and 2001, and for the last we present separate results for reading and math test scores.\nFor both sets of wage gap results, we use a relatively sparse set of regressors, controlling for age, education, and occupation. 9 We define full-time, full-year workers as those who are at least 18 years old and are working more than 30 h a week and 40 weeks a year. The hourly wage is measured as annual earnings divided by annual hours, and all models examine the gap in the log hourly wage. For the male-female results, we include all men (group 1) and women (group 0) and control for whether an individual is black. For the white-black results, we only include males who report being black (group 0) or white (group 1). In analyzing white-black test score differentials, we follow the specifications of Fryer and Levitt (2004) , who show that seven covariates are sufficient to explain the entire gap in kindergarten test scores between whites and blacks based on Gap OLS ."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "We provide the results in Table 1 .

See Fryer and Levitt (2004) for more details on these measures, and see Appendix Tables 1 and 2 for summary statistics for the estimation samples we use. As further illustration of the relationships among the four Gap measures, Figs. 2 and 3 show the white-black and male-female wage gaps for each year between 1985 and 2007. In the male-female case shown in Fig. 2 , the plots of Gap OLS , Gap 1 , and Gap 0 are quite similar.\nGap P is substantially lower in all years, due to the relatively high power of the covariates in explaining group membership, i.e., men and women are substantially different on observable dimensions.

Our analysis yields two principal findings. We show that, in the case of a single observable characteristic, the coefficient on the group indicator from a pooled OLS regression is a weighted average of the unexplained gaps from the two standard O-B approaches, with intuitively sensible weights that are bounded between 0 and 1 and sum to 1. The strict bounding result on these weights, however, does not extend to the case when there is more than one regressor. Thus, although the unexplained gap from a pooled OLS regression reflects the overall relationship between the observable characteristics and the outcome variable, this unexplained gap is no longer strictly bounded by the two standard O-B gaps. In contrast, we show that the O-B pooling strategy without a group indicator systematically overstates the contribution of observables to mean outcome differences, therefore understating unexplained differences. Thus, in circumstances where the decompositions are used to separate between explained and unexplained gaps, the O-B pooling strategy systematically fails to do so.\nTo explore the practical significance of our results, we provide empirical examples involving white-black and male-female wage differentials and the white-black kindergarten test score gap. These examples demonstrate that Gap OLS is typically close to the standard Oaxaca-Blinder unexplained gaps but systematically larger than Gap P . Gap P will deviate from Gap OLS to the extent that there are differences in the means of observable characteristics between the two groups. This deviation can be large enough to drive Gap P substantially below both standard O-B measures, as is the case with the male-female wage differentials. Taken together, our analytical and empirical results suggest that the pooling O-B decomposition without a group-specific indicator should not be used to distinguish between explained and unexplained gaps, although this method may be useful to assess how much of an unexplained gap represents discrimination if specific assumptions are met. In contrast, Gap OLS provides an attractive summary approach to separate between-group mean differences into explained and unexplained components."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We thank Jeff Biddle, Marianne Bitler, Jonah Gelbach, Kevin Hallock, David Neumark, Mathias Sinning, Gary Solon, Mel Stephens, and Steve Woodbury for very useful comments on an initial draft.
