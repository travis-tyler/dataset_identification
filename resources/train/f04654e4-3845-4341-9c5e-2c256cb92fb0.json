Water demand is met by pumping ground water from aquifers or by conveying surface water through a system of reservoirs and canals. Water-withdrawal data in Arizona are collected by Federal, State, and local government agencies as well as by private organizations. Anthropogenic water use is a significant component of the hydrologic cycle in Arizona, and accurate spatial and temporal water-use data are useful for management of this valuable resource. Water-withdrawal data provide important information on how water demand affects the State's water resources.

Ground-water withdrawal data for mining represent withdrawals for metal mines and industrial-mineral mines. Ground-water withdrawal data for thermoelectric-power use represent withdrawals used for generating electricity. For 1991-2000, the USGS did not compile surface-water withdrawals for municipal, mining, and thermoelectric-power uses according to ADWR ground-water basins. Drainage withdrawal data represent withdrawals used to dewater the root zone in agricultural areas and withdrawals from Minute No. 242 (242 well field) used to address the problem of salinity of the Colorado River.

Annual reports from 1955 to 1969 were published by the Arizona State Land Department. The Arizona Water Commission (precursor of the ADWR) published annual reports from 1970 to 1974, and the USGS published the reports from 1975 to 1990. In the 1975 report, annual ground-water withdrawals for some areas were estimated for years as far back as 1915. Estimates of the distribution of annual ground-water withdrawals in Arizona by use category were published only from 1975 to 1990. Groundwater withdrawals were estimated for irrigation, municipal, industrial, and livestock use, and for drainage of agricultural lands.\nThe withdrawal data and periodic water-level measurements are used in studies of Arizona's ground-water resources. Since 1939, the USGS and State of Arizona agencies have conducted joint studies to define the quantity, chemistry, and areal distribution of the resources and to monitor the effects of large-scale ground-water withdrawals. The USGS, in cooperation with the ADWR, published a series of reports from 1981 to 1994 entitled \"Annual summary of ground-water conditions in Arizona\" that included groundwater withdrawals by basin.

The semi-arid to arid climate necessitates the use of ground water and (or) surface water for irrigation of nearly all agricultural fields in Arizona. Water withdrawals in the irrigation category are predominantly used for sustaining plant growth; however, the category also includes water used for chemical application, dust suppression, and leaching of salts from the root zone, and includes water lost in conveyance (Hutson and others, 2004) . The category includes self-supplied withdrawals and deliveries from a combination of irrigation districts or government agencies. Data are presented for estimated ground-water withdrawals and for metered surface-water withdrawals.\nSurface water is withdrawn for irrigation.\nGround water is withdrawn for irrigation.\nPrior to 1991, the USGS estimated ground-water withdrawals for irrigation of crops in Arizona by using a power-divider method that used pump-efficiency and energyconsumption data. This method required field measurements of the discharge rate and the power-use rate for individual wells to provide an estimate of the average power required to pump 1 acre-foot of water from the well (Don Bills, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 2004). This method is no longer feasible for most of the basins because power data are not readily available. New methods have been used to compile or estimate water withdrawals and irrigated acreage for 1991-2000. Where available, metered groundwater and surface-water withdrawal data were used. Power data for 1991-94, however, were used to estimate groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in the Little Colorado River Plateau and Kanab Plateau Basins. Estimated ground-water withdrawals for these basins for 1995-2000 were extrapolated from the power data for 1991-94. For the remaining areas, estimated total withdrawals (ground water and surface water) were derived from calculations based on crop acreages, consumptive water requirement rates for crops, and irrigation efficiency for each county.\nMost of the crop-acreage data used to estimate withdrawals, by county, are from the Arizona Agricultural Statistics Service (AASS, annual reports entitled \"Arizona Agricultural Statistics,\" published from 1992 to 2001). In some cases, county crop acreages were not published by the AASS in order to avoid disclosure of individual operations. Where the county crop-acreage data are not available, they are estimated from acreage data for prior years and (or) the 1992 and 1997 Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1999).\nMeasuring ground-water pumping rate for estimation of withdrawals for irrigation.\nBarley.

Inputs to the modified Blaney-Criddle method are latitude, average monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation, crop type, and crop planting and harvesting dates. Outputs from the modified Blaney-Criddle method are the consumptive water requirement by crop type for each month and the total for the growing season. Consumptive water requirement is the depth of irrigation water (feet), including precipitation, that is required consumptively for crop production (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1967). Crop consumptive irrigation requirement is the planted acreage of the crop in the county multiplied by the consumptive water requirement and is reported in acre-feet.\nCounty irrigation efficiency is the percentage of the crop consumptive water requirement divided by the total quantity of water withdrawn for irrigation in a particular county. Annual crop consumptive water requirements and irrigation withdrawals were estimated for all Arizona counties for 1980-90. The average county irrigation efficiency calculated for the 11-year period of 1980-90 (David Anning, U.S. Geological Survey, oral commun., 2004) was used for estimating withdrawals in this report. County irrigation efficiency takes into account conveyance losses and application losses. Conveyance losses are estimated as the difference between the volume of water applied to crops and the volume of water diverted from the source. Application losses include surface runoff, deep percolation, and losses due to irrigation system evaporation.\nA variety of crops with different consumptive water requirements are grown in Arizona in a season. For 1991-2000, consumptive water requirements were estimated for the most common crops: alfalfa and other hay, barley, citrus and noncitrus orchards, corn, cotton, vegetables, and wheat. Estimated county irrigation withdrawals for a particular crop are based on the planted acreage of the crop, consumptive water requirement for the crop, and county irrigation efficiency. The following formula was used to estimate the withdrawal in a county for a particular crop:\nwhere W is irrigation withdrawal, in acre-feet, for a particular crop; A is planted acreage of the crop in the county, in acres; C is consumptive water requirement for the crop based on the modified Blaney-Criddle method, in feet; and E is irrigation efficiency for the county, in decimal fraction.\nCotton.\nCorn.\nVegetables (peppers)."}, {"section_title": "Wheat.", "text": "Total irrigation withdrawals for the county were then determined by adding together withdrawals for each crop grown in the county. County withdrawal data were then disaggregated into the ground-water basins delineated by the ADWR. These basins, in most cases, cross county boundaries, and each county may include parts of several basins. The withdrawal data were disaggregated on the basis of the spatial distribution of irrigated acreage as determined from satellite images and aerial photographs and were estimated annually for each basin for 1991-2000.\nIn 2004, the USGS, in cooperation with the ADWR, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation, prepared a map of agricultural areas in Arizona ( fig. 4 ). Agricultural field boundaries were delineated on the basis of satellite images and aerial photographs to disaggregate county crop acreage and compile the data by ADWR ground-water basins. For various reasons, different satellite images and aerial photographs were used by different agencies for digitizing field boundaries. Field boundaries were delineated using land satellite (Landsat) Thematic Mapper (TM) images, Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terra (SPOT), Carterra Digital Ortho Quads (DOQ-5), or Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs), or a combination of these sources to create a geographical information system (GIS) coverage. TM images, taken in 1993, were received from the Landsat 5 satellite and have a ground resolution of 30 meters. The SPOT satellite imagery (1997) has a ground resolution of 10 meters. Space Imaging's Carterra DOQ-5 product (1998) is a digital orthorectified satellite imagery that is formatted into USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles and has a ground resolution of 5 meters. A DOQ is a computer-generated image of an aerial photograph in which the image displacement caused by terrain relief and camera tilt has been removed; it has a ground resolution of 1 meter. DOQ images from 1992 to 1997 were used in this report.\nWhen metered ground-water or surface-water withdrawal data were not available for a particular basin, total irrigation withdrawal typically was estimated from the annual county consumptive water requirement and basin-wide irrigated acreage as determined from satellite images and aerial photographs. For several basins, irrigated acreages were estimated from published reports of other agencies or from unpublished information supplied to the USGS. Total irrigation withdrawal for a particular basin was estimated using the following formula:\nwhere WB is total irrigation withdrawal for a particular basin for a given year, in acre-feet; WT is total irrigation withdrawal for the county in which all or part of the basin lies for a given year, in acre-feet; AT is total planted acreage of crops in the county for a given year, in acres; and PB is irrigated acreage in the basin as determined from satellite images and aerial photographs, published reports, and unpublished information supplied to the USGS, in acres.\nWhen measured surface-water withdrawals were available for a basin, irrigation ground-water withdrawals were estimated by subtracting the metered amount of surface water from the total irrigation withdrawals. For the Yuma Basin, metered surface-water data are available; however, ground-water data are not available and the common practice of multicropping in the basin makes it difficult to accurately estimate irrigation withdrawals. Consequently, ground-water withdrawals for the Yuma Basin are estimated on the basis of withdrawal data reported for 1990. Both surface-water and ground-water withdrawals are delivered to agricultural fields in the Little Colorado River Plateau, Lower San Pedro, Salt River, Tonto Creek, Upper San Pedro, Verde River, and Virgin River Basins; however, the surface-water deliveries are not measured in these basins and are not presented in this report. This report includes only annual metered surface-water withdrawal data for irrigation.\nEstimates of annual ground-water and surface-water withdrawals for irrigation for 1991-2000 are summarized in tables 2 and 3 and are represented graphically in figures 5 and 6. The amount of water withdrawn for irrigation in some basins can vary greatly from year to year. This variation is primarily due to differences in the consumptive water requirement for different crops and to differences in irrigated acreage. The largest ground-water withdrawals in the study area from 1991 to 2000 were in the Gila Bend Basin. Withdrawals in the basin were smallest (203,000 acre-feet) in 1998 and largest (294,000 acre-feet) in 2000 (table 2 and fig. 5C ). Most of the surface-water withdrawals during 1991-2000 were in the Lower Gila, Parker, and Yuma Basins (table 3) . Surface-water withdrawals in the Parker Basin fluctuated from a minimum of 611,000 acre-feet in 1992 to a maximum of 748,000 acre-feet in 1996 (table 3 and fig. 6 ).\nGround-water withdrawals in the Duncan Valley and Safford Basins in 2000 were 13,500 and 142,000 acre-feet, respectively (table 2). In addition 53,500 acre-feet of surface water was diverted from the Gila River to agricultural lands in the Safford Basin in 2000. Part of the surface water diverted to the Safford Basin was then delivered to agricultural lands in the Duncan Valley Basin; consequently, only the amount diverted to the Safford Basin is shown in table 3. The increase in ground-water withdrawals in the Duncan Valley and Safford Basins in some years was offset by a decrease in the amount of surface water diverted.\nGround-water withdrawals in the Willcox Basin were smaller in 1992 (112,000 acre-feet) and 1999 (104,000 acre-feet) than in other years, primarily because of differences in consumptive water requirement rates for different crops (table 2 and fig. 5C ). Ground-water withdrawals in the Butler Valley Basin generally have increased from 1994 to 2000. Between 1991 and 1993, no crops were planted in the basin (Bill Remick, Arizona Department of Water Resources, written commun., 2004). In the Bill Williams Basin, groundwater withdrawals remained at 18,500 acre-feet from 1991 to 1994 and decreased to about 4,200 acre-feet from 1995 to 2000 (table 2 and fig. 5A ). The decrease primarily was due to the retirement of some agricultural lands in the basin after 1995 (Andrew Hautzinger, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, oral commun., 2004). The amount of ground water withdrawn for irrigation varied from year to year in the Gila Bend, Lower Gila, Safford, and Yuma Basins, primarily because of differences in consumptive water requirement rates for different crops and fluctuations in measured surface-water withdrawals. The largest surface-water withdrawals for irrigation were in the Lower Gila, Parker, and Yuma Basins where surface water is readily available from the Colorado River (table 3) . In these basins, surface water constituted most of the total irrigation withdrawals (tables 2 and 3); surface-water withdrawals supply almost all water for irrigation in the Parker Basin. Because of the climate and the availability of water, some farmers are multicropping in the Lake Mohave, Parker, and Yuma Basins. Multicropping also is practiced in other parts of the study area, such as the Lower Gila and Gila Bend Basins. Within the study area, annual metered surface-water withdrawals for irrigation are greater than estimated annual ground-water withdrawals. This is due to the availability of surface water in agricultural areas along the Colorado River."}, {"section_title": "Municipal", "text": "Municipal-withdrawal data in this report represent water withdrawn by public and private water suppliers and selfsupplied domestic users. Public and private water suppliers deliver water to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal users. Self-supplied domestic withdrawals primarily are for residential use. Annual estimated ground-water withdrawals for municipal use are listed by ADWR basin for areas outside of AMAs (table 4) .\nIn the study area, complete data sets from the private and public-water suppliers were not available for the Agua Fria, Cienega Creek, Ranegras Plain, and San Simon Wash Basins. Therefore, municipal ground-water withdrawals for these basins from 1991 to 2000 were estimated using population in the basins and per-capita water use for the county in which the basins are located. Populations were estimated from the 1990 population listed in the Arizona Water Resources Assessment report, which was taken from the 1990 Census and the 2000 Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) Census data set (Arizona Department of Water Resources, 1994; U.S. Census Bureau, 2000) . Per-capita water use was estimated from averages of data for 1990, 1995, and 2000 that were reported for the State in the reports entitled \"Estimated use of water in the United States\" (water.usgs. gov/watuse/). Per-capita water use was calculated by dividing the withdrawals by public and private water suppliers for each county by the estimated population served in the county for 1990, 1995, and 2000.\nMunicipal ground-water withdrawals for 17 basins are listed as less than 300 acre-feet per year (table 4) 4 and fig. 7C ). A combination of ground water and surface water is withdrawn for municipal use in some parts of the State. In these areas, fluctuations in surface-water withdrawals for municipal use in a particular year will affect the amount of ground water withdrawn. Municipal ground-water withdrawals in most of the basins increased steadily from 1991 to 2000 (table 4 ) as a result of population growth. In addition to population growth, the amount of water withdrawn also can be affected by climate, water-saving technologies, pricing, and use of alternative sources, such as water harvesting."}, {"section_title": "Public Water Suppliers", "text": "Withdrawals from public water suppliers refer to ground water withdrawn by a publicly owned, community water system for use by cities, rural water districts, mobilehome parks, Indian reservations, or military bases. Data for municipal withdrawals by public water suppliers were obtained primarily by telephone or written surveys. Several suppliers, however, did not provide the USGS with withdrawal data for some years. Missing data from these suppliers were estimated by extrapolating data from other years. Several public water suppliers reported water deliveries rather than ground-water withdrawals. In these instances, ground-water withdrawals were estimated by adding 10 percent to the water deliveries reported to the USGS to account for water losses in the distribution systems. The 10 percent water losses in the distribution system were based on the average of water losses for 1995 that were reported for Arizona in the report entitled \"Estimated use of water in the United States\" (water.usgs. gov/watuse/).

Some private water suppliers are not required to report their deliveries to the ACC; withdrawals by these suppliers are not included in this report. Ground-water withdrawals were estimated by adding 10 percent to the water deliveries to account for losses in the distribution systems. The losses in the distribution systems were based on the average of data for 1995 that were reported for Arizona in the report entitled \"Estimated use of water in the United States\" (water.usgs.gov/ watuse/). In some years, the data provided were incomplete because some suppliers did not report their deliveries to the ACC. Another problem was that data were sometimes reported to the ACC in incorrect units. In many cases, the suppliers reported their deliveries in gallons or other units instead of thousands of gallons, which was the requested format.\nSteps were taken to rectify the data from the ACC. Missing data were estimated by extrapolating available data from other years. To detect errors caused by the use of incorrect reporting units, the ratio of reported deliveries to the total number of customers served by the suppliers was compared to the reported deliveries and number of customers served for previous or subsequent years. In some instances, the reported deliveries were off by one or more orders of magnitude. In instances where the data were suspected to be erroneous, the delivery data were modified to agree with estimates obtained through this comparison procedure."}, {"section_title": "Self-Supplied Domestic Users", "text": "The self-supplied domestic water users are all individuals who do not receive water from public or private water suppliers. Domestic wells are the principal source of water for most homes in rural areas of Arizona. Self-supplied domestic Self-supplied domestic well.\nwater use includes water for household purposes such as drinking, food preparation, washing clothes and dishes, bathing, flushing toilets, washing vehicles, and watering lawns and gardens. Ground-water withdrawals for self-supplied domestic uses for 1990, 1995, and 2000 were estimated to be about 1 percent of the total ground-water withdrawals reported in the USGS Circular report series entitled \"Estimated use of water in the United States\" (water.usgs.gov/watuse/). In some of the ADWR ground-water basins, however, water withdrawals by self-supplied domestic users could represent a substantial percentage of the municipal withdrawals.\nSelf-supplied domestic withdrawals are rarely measured or reported. Consequently, these withdrawals were estimated from the self-supplied domestic population and the percapita water use. The self-supplied domestic population was estimated on the basis of the 1990 Census of Population and Housing (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992).\nTo determine the self-supplied domestic population in each ADWR ground-water basin, the individual county population had to be disaggregated into separate ADWR ground-water basins. This was done using tables and maps from the U.S. Census (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992) . After disaggregating the county population into the ADWR ground-water basins, the population for each basin in a county was added together and the total was compared with the county population to verify the result. The population in each ground-water basin was then multiplied by the percentage of housing units in the basin that did not obtain water from public and (or) private water suppliers for 1990. The resulting number is the self-supplied domestic population in the basin. No information is available from the U.S. Census for the selfsupplied domestic population in Arizona since 1990.\nSelf-supplied domestic withdrawals for each basin were estimated by multiplying the self-supplied domestic population in each county by the estimated per-capita water use from (1994) for the San Pedro River watershed (boundaries undefined). Ten Eyck estimated that a typical household of three people used 1.0 acre-foot of water per year for residential purposes. Because no information is available for the self-supplied domestic population after 1990 from the U.S. Census, the self-supplied domestic population totals and withdrawals were assumed to be constant for 1991-2000. The ADWR estimated and reported self-supplied domestic withdrawals in the Upper San Pedro Basin for 1990 (Linda Stitzer, Arizona Department of Water Resources, written commun., 2004 . Self-supplied domestic withdrawals for the Upper San Pedro Basin for 1991 through 1999 were estimated by extrapolating the ADWR data from 1990 and 2000."}, {"section_title": "Mining", "text": "Water withdrawn for mining in Arizona is used for the extraction of naturally occurring materials and for dewatering, milling, dust control, washing of equipment, and other activities and preparations that are part of mining activities. Mines in Arizona are categorized as either metal mines or industrial-mineral mines others, 1994, 2000) in this report. Metal mines include copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum. Industrial minerals include sand and gravel, cement, coal, clay, diatomite, gypsum, and silica (Phillips and others, 2000) .\nCopper and coal mining rank first and second in economic importance in Arizona, respectively (Phillips and others, 2000) . Arizona has continued to be the leading producer of copper in the Nation and accounted for about 62 percent of the U.S. copper production in 1991 and about 65 percent in 2000 others, 1992, 2002) . Metals such as gold, molybdenum, and silver commonly are recovered from ore that is primarily mined for copper. Mines in the Black Mesa and Kayenta areas produce high quality low sulfur coal in the Little Colorado River Plateau Basin (Phillips and others, 2000) .\nGround-water withdrawal data for mining were collected or estimated for mines in ADWR ground-water basins outside of AMAs (table 5) . Ground-water withdrawal data were obtained directly from each mining company. The companies provided the ground-water withdrawal data over the telephone, by fax, or by e-mail. Some of the mining companies contacted do not use water for their operations and are considered to be dry mining. Ground-water withdrawal data for one of the copper mining operations were not available after 1994. For that mining company, correlations between ground-water withdrawals and copper production for 1991-94 were used to estimate the withdrawals for 1995-2000. Copper production information was obtained from the Arizona Department of Mines and Minerals (Niles Niemuth, Arizona Department of Mines and Mineral Resources, written commun., 2001) . Withdrawals can change from year to year as mining companies change their methods of extracting ores and as market prices fluctuate.\nMost sand and gravel and cement operations do not meter their ground-water withdrawals and lack gages on their wells. Ground-water withdrawal data were estimated for most of the sand and gravel operations and some of the mining operations that did not respond to inquiries about water withdrawals. The withdrawals were estimated on the basis of daily operating hours of the facilities and rated discharge capacity of the wells. Annual ground-water withdrawals were estimated by using the following formula: \nwhere V is volume of water pumped, in acre-feet; Q is pumping rate, in gallons per minute; D is 365 days per year; H is hours of operation per day; M is 60 minutes per hour; and 325,851 is factor to convert gallons to acre-feet.\nGround-water withdrawals for mining were largest in the Lower San Pedro Basin (table 5 and fig. 8 ). Ground-water withdrawals for mining decreased substantially from 32,500 acre-feet in 1996 to 16,000 acre-feet in 2000 (table 5 ). In the Salt River Basin, ground-water withdrawals for mining decreased substantially from 11,000 acre-feet in 1996 to 5,000 acre-feet in 1998 (table 5) . Annual increases or decreases in ground-water withdrawals for mining are mostly due to fluctuations in mineral production, which is driven by market prices. Variations in the amount of highway construction also can contribute to changes in water withdrawal for mining. Ground-water withdrawals and energy generated in the Little Colorado River Plateau Basin increased from 1991 to 1994, decreased in 1995, and increased steadily from 1996 to 2000 (table 6 and fig. 9 ). Ground-water withdrawals increased by 5,500 acre-feet, or 20 percent, and energy generated increased 5, 000 gigawatts, or 42 percent, between 1991 and 2000 (table 6 and fig. 9 ). In general, there is a positive correlation between ground-water withdrawals and power generated in the Little Colorado River Plateau Basin.\nGround-water withdrawals for thermoelectric-power generation in the Willcox Basin decreased from 1991 to 1993, increased in 1994, decreased from 1994 to 1996, and increased steadily from 1997 to 2000 (table 6 and fig 10) . There is a positive correlation between ground-water withdrawals and power generated in the Willcox Basin from 1996 to 2000; however, there is no correlation from 1991 to 1995.\nThe demand for electricity and, consequently, the amount of water withdrawn by powerplants are influenced by various economic conditions: income, population, weather, and the price of electricity. The data generally indicate an increasing trend in power production and ground-water withdrawals. "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Access to adequate water supplies is a primary factor in economic development in Arizona. Because of the mostly semiarid to arid climate in the State, water demand is met by pumping ground water from aquifers or by conveying surface water through a system of reservoirs and canals. Waterwithdrawal data provide important information on how water demand affects the State's water resources. Information on water withdrawals also can help planners and managers assess the effectiveness of water-management policies, regulations, and conservation activities.\nGround-water withdrawal data were collected, compiled, and estimated for irrigation, municipal, mining, thermoelectric-power, and drainage use in Arizona Department of Water Resources ground-water basins outside Active Management Areas for 1991-2000. Data for metered surfacewater diversions also were compiled. Both surface-water and ground-water withdrawals are delivered to agricultural fields in the Little Colorado River Plateau, Lower San Pedro, Salt River, Tonto Creek, Upper San Pedro, Verde River, and Virgin River Basins; however, the surface-water deliveries are not measured and are not presented in this report. This report includes only annual metered surface-water withdrawals for irrigation.\nWater withdrawal in Arizona is dominated primarily by agriculture use and secondarily by municipal use for rapidly growing urban populations. Because of low rainfall, agriculture in Arizona depends heavily on the State's water resources. Several methods were used to compile or estimate water withdrawals and irrigated acreage for 1991-2000. A variety of crops are grown in Arizona, and different crops use different amounts of water over the course of the growing season. For 1991-2000, consumptive water requirements were estimated for the most common crops: alfalfa and other hay, barley, citrus and noncitrus orchards, corn, cotton, vegetables, and wheat. Total withdrawals were calculated as the county irrigation efficiency and consumptive water requirement within the study area.\nThe largest ground-water withdrawals for irrigation were in the Gila Bend Basin and ranged from 203,000 acre-feet in 1998 to 294,000 acre-feet in 2000. The largest surface-water withdrawals for irrigation were in the Lower Gila, Parker, and Yuma Basins where surface water is available from the Colorado River. In some of the basins, the amount of water used for irrigation varied greatly from year to year. This was due to differences in consumptive water requirement rates for different crops and differences in irrigated acreage.\nWithdrawals categorized as municipal in this report include water supplied by public and private-water suppliers, and self-supplied domestic users. Municipal ground-water withdrawals for most of the basins steadily increased from 1991 to 2000, following the trend of increasing population. The largest withdrawals were in the Little Colorado River Plateau Basin where they increased from 20,500 acre-feet in 1991 to 27,000 acre-feet in 2000. Population growth is the primary cause for the increase in municipal ground-water withdrawals during 1991-2000.\nIn most years, the largest ground-water withdrawals for mining were in the Lower San Pedro Basin. Ground-water withdrawals for mining decreased substantially from 32,500 acre-feet in 1996 to 16,000 acre-feet in 2000. In the Salt River Basin, ground-water withdrawals for mining decreased substantially from 11,000 acre-feet in 1996 to 5,000 acrefeet in 1998. Annual increases or decreases in ground-water withdrawals for mining primarily are due to fluctuations in mineral production, which is driven by market prices.\nGround-water withdrawals by thermoelectric powerplants increased by 5,500 acre-feet, or 20 percent, between 1991 and 2000. There is a positive correlation between ground-water withdrawals for thermoelectric power generation and power generated in the Willcox Basin from 1996 to 2000; however, there was no correlation from 1991 to 1995. The demand for electricity is influenced by various factors, including personal income, population, weather, and the price of electricity.\nData on ground-water withdrawals for irrigation drainage represent withdrawals for dewatering the root zone in agricultural areas and withdrawals from the 242 well field, which provides water deliveries to Mexico as obligated by treaty. Ground-water withdrawals for drainage of agricultural lands and from the 242 well field varied from year to year."}]
