Among many diverse benefits, wetlands provide vital habitat for numerous commercially and ecologically important aquatic and terrestrial organisms; perform critical nutrient cycling functions including waste regulation; provide upland areas a buffer against coastal hazards such as hurricanes; are capable of mitigating shoreline erosion and attenuating flood waters; and provide abundant opportunities for human recreational activities including fishing and birding (Barbier et al., 2010;Costanza et al., 2008;Farber, 1987;Kennish, 2001;Yoskowitz et al., 2012). Eustatic sea level rise (SLR) is an increase in global sea level caused by an adjustment of the volume of the world's oceans due to changes in temperature, salinity, density, and liquidsolid states (Church et al., 2013). An increase in ocean heat content as a direct result of the warming of earth's climate is an important element of sea-level rise, resulting in ocean thermal expansion coupled with the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and ice caps (Church et al., 2013;Church and White, 2011;Parris et al., 2012). The rate of SLR has been persistently accelerating for decades. The mean rate of global eustatic SLR averaged 1.7 mm/year from 1901 to 2010, 2.0 mm/year from 1971 to 2010, and 3.2 mm/year from 1993-2010 (Church et al., 2013). Rates of SLR are predicted to continue to increase beyond the end of this century (Church et al., 2013;Parris et al., 2012;Zervas, 2009). The impacts of SLR and global climate change will be far reaching for coastal and estuarine ecosystems, including increased erosion and inundation, migration and submergence of coastal environments and landforms, alterations in freshwater inflows, and increased frequency, duration and elevation of storm surge flooding (Cahoon et al., 2006;Church et al., 2013;Poff et al., 2002). Wetlands on the upper Texas coast are particularly vulnerable to SLR due to high rates of local land subsidence, low-lying topography, low sediment supply, low tidal range, and the presence of extensive development acting as a physical barrier to the upland migration of wetlands as sea level rises (Morton et al., 2006;Paine, 1993;Twilley, 2001). The tide gauge at Pier 21 on Galveston Island has recorded a rise in relative sea level of about 0.63 meters since 1908, with roughly half of this rise attributable to eustatic SLR and the remainder caused by local land subsidence (Donoghue, 2011;Zervas, 2009). On the upper Texas coast, 17% of estuarine marshes were lost between 1950s and 2001 due the effects of inundation and erosion induced by sea level rise and human-related activity, including increased development and the draining and filling of wetlands (White et al., 2005). Currently, the population of the greater Houston area, the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States and home of the one of the world's largest petrochemical complexes, has incomplete information on the extent of projected SLR and its associated environmental impacts. These information gaps pose a severe threat to the sustainability of the region's natural and built environments into the next century. Given the vulnerability of wetland habitats to SLR, this study will employ the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to project future changes in the distribution of specific environments in a quantitative, spatio-temporal manner. The results of this project will be used in further studies to evaluate the current and future ecological services of the coastal area and the likely socio-economic costs of SLR in the region. Additionally, a key component of the future work associated with this project will be to disseminate results to the public via a website in order to increase awareness of the impacts of SLR. Adding to the knowledge of wetland transition dynamics in the face of changing shorelines and making this data publically available for visualization and analysis will provide essential information to natural resource managers and decision makers as they plan for the protection, conservation, and restoration of these critically important coastal environments."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed assessment of the vulnerability of wetland habitats to long-term sea level rise by implementing SLAMM. The present study set out to fulfill the following objectives: "}, {"section_title": "Wetlands", "text": "Wetlands are transitional lands between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the land is either inundated by shallow water or the water table is at or the near the surface (Cowardin et al., 1979). The wetland ecosystem in the Galveston Bay area encompasses a variety of habitats including fresh marshes, salt marshes, mangroves, tidal flats, scrub-shrub wetlands, and swamps. The functioning of estuarine wetlands is controlled by interactions between geomorphological and biotic processes, wherein feedbacks between elevation, tidal flooding, sediment supply, organic productivity, and sea level are the primary determinates of long-term marsh morphodynamics (Allen, 1990;Cahoon et al., 2006;Nyman et al., 2006;White et al., 2002). The distribution of wetland sub-environments is proportional to the tidal frame, occupying elevations between the mean high and low spring tide levels, and are thus considered to be tied with local mean sea level (Figure 1) (McKee and Patrick, 1988;Pethick, 1981). On the upper Texas coast, wetlands exist within a narrow elevation range. Wetland sub-environments can shift from tidal flats to vegetated marsh to upland plant communities with just a 0.5 m change in elevation (Gibeaut et al., 2003b). Wetlands are critically important ecosystems, conferring significant benefits to both the natural environment and humankind. Wetlands provide coastal areas protection from waves, wind, storm surge, and coastal erosion. Coastal wetlands weaken the effects of storms by acting as a non-open water buffer zone between storm landfall and populated areas, decreasing the fetch of wind to form waves, increasing drag on water motion, reducing direct wind effect on the water surface, and directly absorbing wave energy (Barbier et al., 1997;Costanza et al., 2008;Farber, 1987). The presence of wetland vegetation further aids coastal protection by providing soil retention, sediment stabilization, and reducing water depth, which consequently reduces storm surges and waves (Costanza et al., 2008). Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, supporting rich biodiversity and intricate food webs through complex interactions between water, soils and organisms. Wetlands provide suitable reproductive habitat and nursery grounds for a number of ecologically and economically important fish, mollusk, and crustacean species as a result of the ecosystem's high production of organic material and potential for predator avoidance offered by a sheltered, shallow habitat (Boesch and Turner, 1984;Queen, 1977). Marshes are also extensively used by waterfowl, including a number of endangered species such as the whooping crane, for feeding, reproducing, and roosting (Shaw and Fredine, 1956). Marshes and swamps are highly efficient at nutrient cycling, an important process by which nutrients such as nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus that are essential for the growth of organisms are acquired, processed, and stored (Barbier et al., 2010;Mitsch and Gosselink, 2000). Healthy ecosystems are dependent upon efficient cycling and availability of nutrients (Lavelle and Berhe, 2005). A nutrient surplus can lead to eutrophication (i.e., the depletion of oxygen) of soils and water, while a nutrient deficit can cause soil exhaustion and loss of fertility. Nutrient regulation is directly related to water quality and clarity, food production, and the presence of fish (Farber et al., 2006). Wetlands aid nutrient regulation in a variety of ways, including denitrification through the uptake of nitrogen by vegetation, absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and storing carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in soils and plant matter (Verhoeven and Meuleman, 1999). Wetlands also play a key role in the stabilization of climate through their capacity to sequester millions of tons of carbon annually (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986). Wetlands serve as carbon sinks through the uptake of carbon dioxide via photosynthesis by marsh macrophytes and microbiota, followed by the burial and slow decay of biomass in the form of long-stored peat (Mitsch and Wu, 1995). This process is important in permanently storing carbon since peat shifts the stored carbon from the short-term (10-100 years) carbon cycle to the long term (1000 years) carbon cycle (Barbier et al., 2010;Mitsch and Wu, 1995). Additionally, the wetland environment provides for sensory enjoyment through its unique and aesthetic landscape, structural variety, diversity of flora and fauna, and quality of water (Yoskowitz et al., 2012). These natural areas provide opportunities for tourism and recreational activities including fishing, hunting, and birding."}, {"section_title": "Wetland response to sea level rise", "text": "Due to the wetlands on the upper Texas coast existing within a narrow elevation range, even a small increase in sea level can cause the conversion of low marsh and tidal flats to open water and of irregularly flooded salt marsh to regularly flooded salt marsh (Gibeaut et al., 2003b). As sea level rises, the distribution of wetlands change in response to transitioning soil conditions (DeLaune et al., 1983). In general, a marsh can respond to sea level rise in 3 ways: it can drown, remain stable, or grow (Stevenson et al., 1985). The ability of wetlands to survive SLR depends on factors such as slope, sediment supply, SLR rate, shoreline erosion rate, availability of accommodation space, and the presence of fixed structures which may impede landward migration ( Figure 2) (Brinson et al., 1995;Redfield, 1972). place at the shoreline. B.) Salt marsh migration is physically blocked by development and erosion takes place at seaward boundary, \"squeezing\" the marsh. C.) Salt marsh migration is stalled due to steep slope with erosion occurring at shoreline, \"squeezing\" the marsh and eventually causing a net loss of area. Wetlands can maintain their extent or grow through the landward and seaward horizontal expansion of wetland area. Given a setting with a high sediment supply, a gently sloping platform, low wave energy and the absence of human-made or natural barriers obstructing the landward migration of wetlands, the marsh can migrate upward onto dry uplands and seaward as the shallow lagoon fills with sediment. If sediment supply is low and high wave energy prevents seaward expansion of wetlands, the marsh experiences erosion at the seaward boundary. If wetland vertical accretion keeps pace with the rate of SLR, the wetland area can expand where inland migration is greater than erosion of the seaward boundary. Without an increase in vertical growth, the increased frequency of tidal inundation induced by SLR increases salinity, depletes the oxygen supply in the soil available to plant roots, and impairs the metabolism of vegetation (Koch and Mendelssohn, 1989;Mendelssohn et al., 1981) As the marsh vegetation dies, there is a loss of deposited organic material and a decrease in the sediment trapping capability of the marsh, rendering the marsh incapable of surviving (DeLaune et al., 1987). Additionally, if the upland slope is too steep or there is a physical obstruction preventing wetland migration, overland migration stalls. The wetlands may also become narrower as waves deteriorate the seaward edge, resulting in an overall loss of wetland area."}, {"section_title": "SLAMM modeling of sea level rise effects", "text": "The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) is a rule-based spatial model built for predicting land-cover changes induced by SLR in coastal areas at a local or regional scale.

Choosing a model involves taking into account trade-offs between complexity, scale, cost, accessibility, required expertise and scientific accuracy (Mcleod et al., 2010) . SLAMM presents an improvement over relatively simple inundation models, commonly referred to as \"bathtub models\", which require only an elevation dataset and projected water levels to project potential inland extent and depth of flooding (NOAA Coastal Services Center, 2012). Bathtub models should only be applied when still water elevation and SLR shows small spatial variation, waves have no effect on water level, and the area is fully connected to open water (Spaulding, 2014). Additionally, bathtub models do not take into account feedbacks of physical and biophysical processes that affect changes in elevation and shorelines, including edge erosion, land subsidence, and vertical accretion of the marsh platform. A more complex analysis tool that assesses the vulnerability of wetlands is the Barataria-Terrebonne Ecosystem Landscape Spatial Simulation (BTELSS) (Reyes et al., 2000). Similar to SLAMM, this model projects local or regional scale changes to coastal habitats as a result of SLR. However, BTELSS includes more complex ecological feedbacks than SLAMM, requiring input data detailing air temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitation, river discharge, sediment load, regional salinity, plant growth and mortality rates, and salinity tolerances of marsh vegetation. In addition to outputting habitat switching maps, BTELESS includes map outputs of plant productivity, salinity, open water circulation, and sediment transport (Mcleod et al., 2010;Reyes et al., 2000). Although including these important and complex feedbacks means BTELSS is the more scientifically accurate model, it has a much higher computational cost than "}, {"section_title": "Study Area 2.1 Physical setting", "text": "The Galveston Bay complex is the largest marginal marine embayment in Texas, covering over 1500 km 2 . The bay system is located on the upper Texas coast and consists of several bays, including Galveston Bay, East Bay, West Bay, Christmas Bay, and Trinity Bay ( Figure 5). The bays are separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Bolivar Peninsula, Galveston Island and Follet's Island. Galveston Island is a broad accretionary barrier island, relatively wide along its northeastern half and narrowing in the southwest towards San Luis Pass. The barrier island is characterized by well-preserved relict beach ridge and swale topography which parallels the Gulf shoreline, with the swales containing extensive estuarine and palustrine marshes ( Figure   6) (Lankford and Rogers,1969.;White et al., 2004) Bolivar Peninsula in the northeast is also progradational and displays large relict flood-tidal delta and washover fan complexes extending into Easy Bay, containing extensive salt and brackish marshes (White et al., 2004 (Morton and McGowen, 1980;Wallace and Anderson, 2013).  Exchange of marine waters with the estuarine system occurs at the tidal inlet San Luis  (Deiner, 1975). The Galveston Bay complex is located in the Quaternary Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. The surface geology ranges in age from Holocene to Pleistocene. The Holocene alluvium deposits of the Galveston Bay area lie on top of the Pleistocene sediments of the Beaumont Formation that were sub-aerially exposed during the last glacial advance (Figure 7) (Lankford and Rogers, 1969). Most Pleistocene deposits are alluvial and deltaic sediments of clay, silts, and sand. Pleistocene shoreline deposits associated with interglacial advances of the sea are represented by the ancient sand barrier island chain known as the Ingleside barrier strandplain, which forms an irregular but well-defined ridge parallel to the coast (Lankford and Rogers, 1969;Wilkinson et al., 1975). Climate regime has an important influence on the physical, chemical and biological processes and morphology of estuaries (Morton, 1994). The study area lies in the subtropical, humid climactic zone in Texas (Larkin et al., 1983). Figure 8 shows the precipitation gradient present on the Texas coast. On average, the upper coast receives twice as much annual precipitation as the south Texas coast. Despite its relatively small drainage area, the Trinity River has the greatest average annual discharge of Texas rivers due to its location in the moist subhumid climatic belt (Lankford and Rogers, 1969).  (Mesinger et al., 2006) and provided by NOAA/ESRL Physical Science Division."}, {"section_title": "Physical processes", "text": "Estuaries and wetlands are affected by a variety of hydrodynamic processes closely associated with physical and meteorological conditions, including wind, tides, waves, currents, and storms. Along the upper Texas coast, the prevailing winds, waves, and currents produce a westerly longshore current in the area (Morton and McGowen, 1980). Wind is a highly important morphological agent in the region because of its influence on waves, tides, currents and aeolian processes. Prevailing south and southeasterly winds occur during winter, spring, and summer; more easterly winds occur during fall; northerly winds predominate in winter months and are associated with the passage of cold fronts ( Figure 9) (Curray, 1960).The highest wind velocities occur with tropical storms and hurricanes that strike the Texas coast every two years on average (McGowen et al., 1977). The Galveston Bay system is located on a microtidal, wave dominated coast (Hayes, 1980). Average wave heights are 0.6 meters and 1.2 meters in water depths of 3 meters and 15 meters respectively, reaching up to 6 meters during storm conditions (Morton and McGowen, 1980). Tides are semi-diurnal and diurnal, with a mean tide range of approximately 0.5 meters in the Gulf and 0.2 meters in the bays. Storm tide levels often reach 1.2-1.5 meters within the bays (Shepard and Moore, 1960). Due to the limited tide range, astronomical tides exert relatively small influence on sediment transport within the estuary, although wind-generated tides in the bays can be substantially higher. The wind effect can add as much as 0.3 m to the astronomical tide, submerging the wetlands fringing the bay and barrier island shorelines (Shepard and Moore, 1960)."}, {"section_title": "Subsidence and relative sea level rise", "text": "On the upper Texas coast, the local rate of SLR has been exacerbated by local land surface subsidence. The greater Houston area has been affected by land subsidence perhaps more than any other metropolitan area in the United States (Coplin and Galloway, 2007). The average rate of relative SLR in Galveston from 1909 to 2003 (6.5 mm/year) is much higher than the global eustatic rate (1.8 mm/yr) as measured from the tide gauge at Pier 21 on Galveston Island, which provides the longest continuous record of sea-level variations along the Texas coast (Church et al., 2013;Penland and Ramsey, 1990;Zervas, 2009). Subsidence in the greater Houston area has persisted for decades due to oil and gas extraction, compaction of Holocene sediments, andmost significantlygroundwater withdrawal (Morton, 2003;Penland and Ramsey, 1990;White and Morton, 1997;White and Tremblay, 1995). Groundwater was the primary source of municipal, industrial, and agricultural water for the Houston area from the 1940s through 1970s (Kasmarek et al., 2009). The withdrawal of groundwater from the underlying Chicot and Evangeline aquifers resulted in a decrease of hydraulic pressure as water levels declined, increasing the burden on clay and silt layers. These layers then are permanently rearranged and compacted by the increase in pressure, causing widespread land-surface subsidence (Kasmarek et al., 2009;Kreitler et al., 1977). In 1975, the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District (HGSD) was created by the Texas Legislature to reduce subsidence in the region, focusing on vulnerable low-lying coastal areas (Neighbors, 2003). In 1985, the HGSD developed a water use regulatory plan transitioning from groundwater reliance to surface wasters as the primary supply source. Since the 1990s, subsidence rates have stabilized in areas where groundwater withdrawal has been reduced (Kasmarek et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Wetland environments", "text": "The estuarine wetland system components in the study area consist of tidal flats, salt marshes, and scrub-shrub marshes ( Figure 10A (White et al., 2004). Transitional marshes may represent a stable community or a successional stage leading to a forested wetland (Brinson et al., 1995;Cowardin et al., 1979) Swamps are riverine forested wetlands found on the floodplains of rivers and streams that cross the coastal plain ( Figure 10D). Swamps in the area include tidally-influenced and non-tidal swamps. Major vegetation types in this area include Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatic. Inland fresh marshes are wetlands that are above the salt elevation and not affected by estuarine tides ( Figure 20E) (Cowardin et al., 1979). The amount and frequency of flooding in these environments is related to the elevation of the water table, which is dependent upon the amount of rainfall and height above sea level (Gibeaut et al., 2003b) (White et al., 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Delineating the study area", "text": "The inland boundary of the study area was developed using Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model outputs.

The outputs of this model are widely used for the purpose of strategic emergency preparedness planning. The Maximum of the Maximum Envelope of High Water (MOM) SLOSH product is a vector grid output which combines the highest storm surge value for all modeled hypothetical hurricanes of a given storm category within the model basin at mean and high tide ( Figure 11). For this project, the MOM for a category 5 hurricane striking Galveston Bay at high tide was used with 2 meters of additional SLR added to storm surge height. High tide was used to capture inundation risk associated with tidal variability. Since 1.8 meter of SLR by 2100 is the highest SLR scenario used in this study, two meters of SLR was used to cover the entire area likely to be inundated after a hurricane plus SLR by the end of the study time span.

To create the wetlands land-cover raster, a \"SLAMM_classs\" column was added to the 2012 NWI polygon shapefile.

Land-surface elevations from these data sources are recorded daily. For all 44 sites, observed subsidence values were plotted against time and a rate in mm per year was calculated using a linear regression approach. These data all have varying time-spans and number of observations, with the oldest data source beginning recording land-surface elevations in 1974. Sites are more concentrated in the northwest region of the study area where development is denser, with very few available sites in the more rural eastern and southern regions. Since the HGSD implemented a groundwater withdrawal regulatory plan in 1999, only subsidence data from that year or later was included in the interpolated grid. In addition to subsidence data provided by HGSD, relevelling data were obtained from the National Geodedic Survey measurements of benchmarks in the area. These benchmark measurements provide additional elevation information for 33 releveling sites on Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Observations from each releveling site varied from 2 to 10 measurements, with dates ranging from 1905 to 1987. These data were primarily used to compensate for the very few sites from HGSD existing in the eastern and southern regions of the study area. The weighted mean subsidence rate (mm/year) for 34 PAM and CORS sites were calculated where the weight is defined by the total observations in each site based on the three reference CORS. However, the subsidence rate for the 8 extensometers were calculated without using the weighted mean approach as they only have one reference frame unlike PAM and CORS. Among different interpolation methods tested, Kernel Smoothing appeared to give the best result based on the comparison of root-mean-square (RMS) to average standard error, which indicates that the predicted values do not deviate much from the measured values. Additionally, the optimal result should have a mean prediction error as close to 0 as possible and a RMS Standardized value close to 1, indicating that the prediction is unbiased and the standard errors are accurate. For Kernel Smoothing, the best method tested was 1 st order polynomial interpolation weighted by the frequency of sampling at each site. The kernel function used was the fifth-order polynomial function. This interpolation was done at a 10-meter resolution.

SLAMM's default lower bound for the regularly flooded marsh is 0 half tide units, which is equivalent to mean tide level. One half tide unit is equivalent to the elevation of mean higher high water minus the mean tide level. The developers have noted that this elevation range may extend below MTL in macrotidal environments (Clough et al., 2010). Although the Galveston Bay system is microtidal, wind-generated tides in the bay are substantially higher than astronomical tides that are recorded by the NOAA tide gauges used to define the great diurnal tide ranges used in this study. Using tide charts for water level prediction does not pass the National Ocean Service's standard of predictions being within 15 cm 90% of the time along the entire Texas coast (Steidley et al., 2005). Astronomical tides on the Texas coast are strongly affected by meteorological influence which is almost an order of magnitude more important than diurnal exchanges, and two orders of magnitude greater than the semi-diurnal exchanges (Smith, 1977). The wind effect can add as much as 0.3 m to the astronomical tide, inundating the fringing wetlands on bay and barrier island shorelines (Shepard and Moore, 1960).

No SLR, accretion, or erosion is imposed on this time zero run so that land cover classifications output are based only on land elevations and the SLAMM conceptual model. To calibrate the model, elevation ranges for the habitat types were altered until the recommended threshold 5% discrepancy between simulated time zero and actual time zero land-cover was achieved. Some discrepancy can be attributed to a horizontal DEM to NWI off-set. The elevation ranges for habitats are not exclusive and may overlap. Only slight changes were made to the SLAMM conceptual model. The lower boundary of the irregularly flooded marsh was changed from the default value of 0.5 HTU to 0.25 HTU. The lower boundary of the regularly flooded marsh was adjusted from the default 0 HTU (which corresponds to mean tide level) to -0.95 HTU, which is slightly above mean lower low water.

The most significant effects of SLR are seen after the year 2050, where the rate of SLR accelerates in all 3 scenarios. In each SLR scenario, there is a dramatic decrease in the amount of inland-fresh marshes and swamps ranging from a combined 18% loss by 2100 in the Low Scenario to 44% in the High Scenario. The model predicts these habitats will transition to transitional scrub-shrub wetlands, regularly flooded marsh or tidal flats. The irregularly flooded marsh is similarly vulnerable to the effects of SLR, declining 63% in the Moderate Scenario and 98% in the High Scenario by 2100. In the Low Scenario, however, this habitat remains stable until 2100 suggesting it is resilient in the face of a slower rate of SLR. The high marsh within SLAMM converts to regularly flooded marsh when inundated or tidal flat when eroded. High marsh areas are less resilient to SLR relative to the low marsh due to their lower vertical accretion rates and limited salt tolerance. Similar conversions of high marsh to low marsh due to SLR have been documented in New England marshes (Warren and Niering, 1993). Although a net loss of wetland habitat doesn't occur, the change in vegetation assemblages could have important consequences for wildlife and marsh functions (Callaway et al., 1997). Due in part to this predicted conversion of upper marsh to lower marsh, the regularly flooded marsh is predicted to gain area by 2100 in all SLR scenarios. The model predicts that the low marsh will be able to migrate upland at a rate that outpaces inundation and shoreline retreat. The rate of SLR is at least as important as the magnitude of sea level change. By comparing the results of the three scenarios when they are at about the same amount of SLR, how time affects the landscape's ability to adapt can be quantified. In 2025 of the High Scenario, 2050 of the Moderate Scenario, and 2100 of the Low Scenario, the amount of SLR is at about 0.2 m. Given that it takes the greatest amount of time to reach ~0.2 m of SLR in the Low Scenario, this allows the landscape the most time to adapt. The amount of change in the area of inland fresh marsh, undeveloped dry land, and non-tidal swamp doesn't vary much between the 3 scenarios at the same amount of SLR since these habitats display fewer feedbacks between SLR, elevation, and accretion (Table 26). However, the status of the salt marshes varies much more substantially at the same amount of SLR. The most growth at ~0.2 m of SLR of the regularly flooded marsh occurs in the Low Scenario, followed by the Moderate Scenario. Similarly, the smallest decrease in the area of the high marsh is seen in the Low Scenario. Furthermore, there is an overall decrease in tidal flats in the Low Scenario (-14%) versus a dramatic increase (+147%) in the High Scenario, indicating there is far less inundation happening even at the same amount of SLR since the growth in the area of tidal flats within SLAMM is indicative of erosion or inundation of other marsh land cover classes, especially the low marsh. These results suggests that given more time to adapt to the same amount of SLR, the salt marsh will more likely be able to adjust its vertical position to keep pace with SLR. Several studies have shown that the greater frequency of inundation, the higher the rate of vertical accretion (Pethick, 1981;Stevenson et al., 1985). Within SLAMM, cell elevations are essentially used as a proxy for frequency of inundation. As SLR decreases cell elevations relative to MTL, the vertical accretion rates of both the low and high marshes increase (see the Accretion Rate section). The growth of the low marsh and equilibrium of the high marsh in the Low Scenario suggest a positive relationship between low and slow SLR and accretion. The effects of SLR summarized above are generalized for the entire study area. Examining model results at the subsite level gives a better idea of the spatial variability of landscape response to SLR. The following discussion will look at the 4 individual subsites within the study area."}, {"section_title": "East Bay", "text": "East Bay faces some of the most severe effects of SLR in the study area (Figures 32-34). In all SLR scenarios, significant amounts of developed areas on the barrier island are inundated: 87% by 2100 in the High Scenario, 45% in the Moderate, and 23% in the Low.   The salt marshes most likely to be affected by SLR in this region lie on the Quaternary alluvium and barrier island deposits of clay, silt and sand that compromise the margins of the bay. Marshes on the Beaumont formation are the most resilient to flooding due to the surface being higher than that of surrounding deposits. Higher rates of subsidence on the alluvium and barrier island deposits (2.88 mm/year on average) than on the Beaumont formation (1.84 mm/year), make these marshes even more vulnerable to submergence. In the High Scenario, the greatest increase in the area of the irregularly flooded marsh occurs between 2025 and 2050 (+685% from time zero), corresponding to the tine when SLR has risen enough for the ridge to be overtopped allowing the marsh to migrate upland. However, after 2050 the area of low marsh begins to decrease dramatically from a high of 157,000 Ha in 2050 to 52,000 Ha in 2100. This loss is likely due to the increase in the rate of SLR that occurs after 2050. More inundation and erosion are occurring along the shoreline, converting low marshes to tidal flat or open water, at a rate outpacing that of upland expansion. Additionally, sea level has risen high enough to completely overcome the ridge, inundating the seaward-most fringe of marshes that have migrated there. A similar trend is apparent in the Moderate Scenario. The largest amount of growth from the beginning of the simulation occurs in 2075 (+692% ), when sea level reaches high enough to topple the topographic ridge of the Beaumont formation. Between 2075 and 2100, however, 43,000 Ha of low marsh is lost. Again, this is likely due to the acceleration in the rate of SLR. However, not as much marsh is lost as in the High Scenario. Sea level has not risen high enough to completely overcome the ridge, so the marshes located behind it are still protected from submergence. By 2100 in the Low Scenario, when sea level is 0.21 m higher, there is some low marsh migration past the ridge in relatively lower topographic areas. Low marsh area is successively gained in each time step, indicating the amount of submergence at the shoreline never exceeds upland expansion. In both the High and Moderate scenarios, low marsh losses begin after sea level rises higher than about 0.5-0.6 meters. This suggests an upper sea level limit of both magnitude and rate of rise at which marshes can keep up with SLR before being inundated at a rate that outpaces migration. The low marsh in all scenarios in East Bay grows at the expense of other marsh environments, especially irregularly flooded marshes and transitional marshes. In the High and Moderate scenarios, the high marsh loses 97% and 89% respectively of its total area by 2100. In the Low Scenario, the high marsh remains relatively stable, losing only 3% by 2100. The transitional marsh incurs losses by 2100 in all scenarios in East Bay. These marshes are converted to regularly flooded salt marshes as sea level rises. The transitional marsh is only able to maintain or expand its extent through the conversion of those inland fresh marshes and swamps, habitats which are limited in extent in the East Bay area. In the High and Moderate scenarios, the only inland-fresh marshes remaining at the end of the simulation in East Bay are those that are protected by a dike. In the Low Scenario, some inland fresh marshes still exist at higher elevations by 2100, but they have lost 57% of their area."}, {"section_title": "West Bay", "text": "In West Bay, the effects of SLR are also significant. In the High Scenario, 63% of developed areas are inundated by 2100; 20% in the Moderate Scenario; and 3% in the Low Scenario (Figures 36-38). The effects on development are less severe than in East Bay due to the relatively higher elevations of developed land in West Bay. The development in this area is far more consequential, containing both the city of Galveston and Texas City (Figure 39). Although Texas City is protected by a dike, it does not completely enclose the city thereby allowing rising water levels to infiltrate (Figure 40).      Figure 40: Texas City is protected by a dike that is never overtopped by SLR in any scenario modeled in this project. However, openings in the dike identified by white arrows allow water to infiltrate the city. The elevation of the ridge separating alluvium from the Beaumont formation is also higher on average in this region compared to West Bay (0.83 m vs 0.67 m). Additionally, the tide range is lower. Therefore, the salt marsh is not able to migrate over the ridge as readily as it does in East Bay. The increase in low marsh area is still present in 2050 of the High Scenario and 2075 of the Moderate Scenario, but the rate of growth is not as high as in East Bay. In the High Scenario, low marsh is lost between 2050 and 2075 as the rate of SLR increases, converting to tidal flats or open water. However, there is a rebound in area by 2100, with the marsh regaining 46% of its lost area from the previous time-step as upland transitional marshes are converted to low marsh. In the Moderate Scenario, regularly flooded marsh is not lost until after 2075. The low marsh loses 25% of its area to open water or tidal flats and upland migration is minimal. In the Low Scenario, the low marsh increases at each time step as sea level rises slowly, allowing the marsh time to grow through upland migration. Similarly to East Bay, West Bay suffers losses of over 90% of the high marsh area in the High and Moderate Scenarios, converting to low marsh as sea level rises. In the low scenario, the high marsh remains stable from a lack of inundation. The transitional marsh in this region appears to be resilient to SLR. In the Low and Moderate Scenarios, the area of transitional marsh increases at each time-step at the expense of the inlandfresh marshes in the area. This is also true for the High Scenario, except that the transitional marsh decreases from 2075-2100 by 9% transitioning to regularly flooded marsh. Due to the conversion to transitional marsh, by 2100 the only inland-fresh existing in the High and Moderate Scenarios are diked.

As inland-fresh marshes and non-tidal swamps are inundated, they are converted to transitional marshes or eroded to tidal flat if the fetch exceeds 1km. Permanently flooded swamps are unable to regenerate, meaning this habitat is likely lost forever. The greatest losses of non-tidal and cypress swamps occurs in 2075 of the High Scenario and 2100 of the Moderate Scenario as these habitats are converted to transitional marshes. These results indicate that these habitats are most affected when SLR reaches or exceeds 0.7 meters due to their location at higher upland elevations along the length of Trinity River.   Inland-fresh marshes lose area at each time-step in all SLR scenarios as they are converted to transitional salt marshes. In the High Scenario, the only inland-fresh marshes predicted to persist are those that are designated as diked. In the Low and Moderate Scenarios, some unprotected inland-fresh marshes survive further up the Trinity River by 2100, but they have lost a significant 21% and 44% of their area respectively. Tidal fresh marsh and tidal swamps are predicted to almost entirely transition to high and low marsh as sea level rises, resulting in a net gain in salt marsh habitats by 2100. Tidal fresh marshes and tidal swamp habitats both lose 99% of their area by 2100 in the High Scenario. In the Moderate Scenario, 67% of tidal fresh marsh is lost and 87% of tidal swamps by 2100. These habitats are able to remain stable in the low scenario, however. This is likely due to fewer fresh marshes being inundated since SL hasn't risen high enough to affect these upland habitats. In this region, marsh environments at time zero are constrained to the topographically lower Holocene-aged incised valley relative to the river terrace formed by the Trinity River, lying on the Pleistocene surface ( Figure 76). As SLR proceeds, these habitats are only able to transition upriver, not upland onto dry land. The slope separating the older Pleistocene strata from the alluvium is much steeper here than in West and East Bays due to the higher elevation of the Beaumont and Deweyville formations in this region of Galveston Bay, limiting the ability of the wetlands to expand.

This work improved upon previous SLAMM modeling done in the Galveston Bay area through the development of an accurate, recent, and high resolution topography dataset and a spatially explicit subsidence rate grid. Additionally, changes were made to the SLAMM code to better simulate the physical processes affecting the area and to facilitate the use of the most current SLR projections. The results of SLAMM indicate that there are critical impacts of SLR to the wetlands and dry land areas surrounding Galveston Bay. Due to the effects of widespread subsidence, the rate of relative SLR in this study area is among the highest in the world. The magnitude of landscape changes increases the higher and faster sea level rises. However, as the results of the low SLR scenario suggest, even small changes in sea level can have dramatic effects on the landscape. Since the rate of SLR is projected to accelerate in the second half of the century, the greatest impacts of SLR are accordingly observed after 2050. Fresh marshes and swamps are particularly vulnerable to the effects of SLR, incurring substantial losses even after low amounts of SLR. These losses are especially dramatic in the area around the Trinity River. This result corresponds with observed past wetland losses as marsh land has been replaced by open water and barren flats since the 1950s in the Trinity River delta (White and Calnan, 1990). Regularly flooded marshes appear to be the most resilient wetland type. The low marsh is able to survive by migrating upslope at a rate that exceeds that of inundation at the shoreline. The greatest barrier to migration is the barrier that separates the Holocene alluvium from the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation where it outcrops on the surface. Once this barrier is overtopped by SLR, overland migration is unimpeded barring the presence of development. The irregularly flooded salt marsh faces a high risk of submergence in the Moderate and High Scenarios. In the High Scenario, the high marsh loses so much area by 2100 that the salt marsh environment as a whole incurs a net loss despite substantial gains in regularly flooded salt marsh. The lower tolerance to salinity and lower rates of vertical accretion compared to the low marsh makes this wetland type less likely to survive SLR. Upland agricultural lands and development, including homes and important infrastructure, are also at risk of substantial inundation due to SLR. While it is beyond the scope of this current study to evaluate the economic impacts of damages to property and infrastructure, these results suggest SLR will significantly impact the population residing on the upper Texas coast. Since the bay system is located within the greater Houston area, the fifth largest metropolitan area in the US, these impacts will be especially substantial. Conservation of wetland habitats is critically important for both environmental and economic reasons. Improving the understanding of how SLR impacts coastal environments through quantitative, spatial, and temporal information can aid in the development of sitespecific strategic conservation measures to minimize the vulnerability of natural and built environments. Organizations tasked with designing and implementing realistic, effective adaptation or restoration projects that take into account the potential effects of SLR can use these results to (1) determine the most vulnerable habitats and the wildlife associated with them, 2identify areas where physical obstructions exist that prohibit inland migration and create buffer areas that allow for wetland expansion, and (3) propose coastal zone management policies that discourages development in vulnerable areas. The sooner these strategies are implemented, the more likely coastal communities and habitats will be able to positively adapt to the imminent environmental changes SLR will cause.
