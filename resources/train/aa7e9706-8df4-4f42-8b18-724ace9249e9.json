All watershed management plans must meet the new requirements (known as the Nine Elements) to be eligible for implementation funds through the Section 319 grant program. These requirements call for additional quantification of sources of nonpoint source pollutants and expected reductions in pollutants with recommended Best Management Practices. The St. Joseph River Watershed Management Planning Project was initiated in December 2002. New efforts are being completed to quantify sources of impact in the basin including nonpoint source modeling of agricultural and urban land covers. This report addresses the latter. The St. Joseph River Watershed is a large (4,685 square miles), bi-state watershed (Figure 1). Field scale data collection and analysis are not feasible at such a large scale. Therefore, GIS-based models are necessary to understand current nonpoint source loading conditions and to characterize pollutant sources. Predictive tools are necessary to model watershed changes and the associated water quality threats. The Great Lakes Commission awarded a $6,000 grant to the Friends of the St. Joe River Association, Inc. to conduct limited build-out analyses using the ArcView extension, Landscape Analyst as a tool to help the Watershed Management Plan (currently in development) meet the Nine Elements. Under contract to the Friends of the St. Joe River Association, Kieser & Associates (K&A) used Landscape Analyst to project future development in the watershed and to model potential threats to existing open space. Identification of threats to open space and loss of farmland is used here to signal the need for preservation and smart growth, as well as implementing the Watershed Management Plan. This effort was also designed to illustrate the impacts on water quality from unplanned growth with no stormwater management. A nonpoint source loading model for sediment and phosphorus was used to estimate loads to the St. Joseph River from future potential development in these regards. It is envisioned that these exercises will also underscore the importance of ongoing land use planning efforts."}, {"section_title": "Model Overview", "text": "Landscape Analyst, developed by the Canaan Valley Institute (West Virginia), is an ArcView 3.2 GIS extension designed for watershed simulations. The development model within the extension, was used to simulate potential future changes to the landscape. The model identified areas where future development can occur in the watershed based on physical constraints such as topography. These results were used to identify where preservation may be needed and where increased stormwater runoff may be expected. Those new areas of potential development identified by Landscape Analyst were used as inputs to adjust the empirical nonpoint source load model run for current land cover conditions for the Watershed Management Planning Project (K&A, 2003). The adjusted nonpoint source load model predicted associated changes in stormwater runoff and loading of sediments and phosphorus to the St. Joseph River with new development assuming no stormwater management practices are applied. Landscape Analyst also includes many indicators of watershed conditions. Indicators were used to identify forested areas to confirm preservation priorities developed through subwatershed scoring in the Watershed Management Planning Project. In addition to modeling potential threats to the watershed, a goal of this effort was to assess the use of Landscape Analyst as a tool for watershed planning and analysis in the St. Joseph River Watershed. The Watershed Management Planning Project is unique in the fact that it encompasses a large geographic unit that includes two states. This modeling project therefore presents an innovative method for identifying and quantifying potential watershed threats at a large scale."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This section discusses the approach used by K&A to use the Landscape Analyst model for projecting future development and the associated water quality impacts in the St. Joseph River Watershed.

The stream network from the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1997) was also utilized, while road data were derived from U.S. Census TIGER files (U.S. Census, 1995). The geographic extent of the modeling was defined by a watershed delineation completed for the Watershed Management Planning Project (K&A, 2003).

This is due to the fact that the model adjusts the available user inputs based on the size of the geographic area. Because the study area, i.e., the St. Joseph River Watershed, is so large, the model did not allow smaller user inputs. In order to verify this, the model was also run for Elkhart County alone to refine predictions and to evaluate the utility of the model at a smaller scale for possible use by land use planners.

Two scenarios were attempted: one in which agricultural lands were developed, and one in which forested lands were developed. However, a visual review of the grid file output of the model revealed that both scenarios resulted in the same areas being predicted for development. This was confirmed by an area analysis in which the 2000 land cover grid file was intersected with each development prediction scenario. The two scenarios projected development on the same absolute areas and ratios of land cover type, regardless of the user input. The model also predicted development on all land cover types, including wetlands, open water and currently developed lands, even though the user input specified only forest land or only agricultural lands to be developed. This type of issue was identified by another user of the model (Fongers, personal communication, 2004). Assistance from the Canaan Valley Institute did not result in a correction of this issue. Assistance was limited due to a lack of funding support for the extension (Kemlage, personal communication, 2004). Therefore development projected on wetlands, open water and currently developed lands (i.e., approximately 25% of the total) was disregarded, and the following data analysis was applied to the model output to produce representative results for this exercise."}, {"section_title": "County-scale Analysis of Future Development", "text": "Landscape Analyst simply identifies areas in which development is expected based on physical constraints within the watershed. Further analysis is therefore necessary to place that projection in the context of actual population growth. This section discusses the application of U.S. Census data and land development patterns within jurisdictional units, i.e., counties, to the development model output. For each county in the St. Joseph River Watershed, the areas of projected development (output of the development model) on each current land cover type were tabulated using the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcView 3.2 (for example, the acres of forested land cover expected to be developed in Branch County). The areas in which development was projected on currently developed lands, wetlands and open water were disregarded, as discussed above in the Model Limitations section. The areas in which development was projected on cultivated land and grassland were summed as agricultural land, and the areas projected on forested and scrub-shrub land were summed as forest land. Those areas projected for these two land use categories were used as future development in further calculations. The total acreage of projected developed land (agricultural and forested land) in each county was compared to the acreage of currently developed land identified by the 2000 land cover. The projected acreage to be developed in each county was reported as a percentage of that county's current (2000) development. To gauge the time to reach the projected development build-out at current trends, the population growth rate (from 1990 to 2000) was identified for each county from U.S. Census data (U.S. Census, 2000, Attachment B). The relationship of land development to population growth was derived from a study of sprawl by the Brookings Institution (2001). The average Midwest urban area develops land at a rate 4.5 times that of population growth. The publication also identified these sprawl factors for metropolitan areas in the watershed including Kalamazoo, MI; South Bend-Mishawaka, IN; and Elkhart-Goshen, IN. Specific rates were applied to the counties containing these metropolitan areas (see Table 2). Benton Harbor, MI was also included in the report. However, it reported a decrease in population from 1982 to 1997. Therefore, the average rate (4.5) was applied to Berrien County. The following formula was used to calculate the time, in years, for each county to reach full development as predicted by the development model: percent development projected * 10 years sprawl factor * percent population growth from 1990-2000 Based on the current (2000) and projected development from Landscape Analyst, the percentage of total future developed land as a portion of total land area was also calculated for each county by: current developed acreage + projected developed acreage total acreage of portion of county within the watershed"}, {"section_title": "Nonpoint Source Loading", "text": "An empirical nonpoint source phosphorus and sediment loading model using USGS 1992 land cover data was run in 2003 for the Watershed Management Planning Project to identify critical subwatersheds (K&A, 2003). The model output identified annual runoff volumes, annual sediment loading and annual phosphorus loading from each geographic unit (subwatershed). A rudimentary calibration to published loading data for the basin in the 1990s was completed for this empirical model. For this report, the load model was updated using the 2000 land cover data and run at the subwatershed and county levels to be consistent with the Landscape Analyst model run. The area of expected urban land development in each subwatershed and in each county was calculated in GIS. These land areas were used to adjust the land cover input in the nonpoint source load model. The area of projected developed land in each unit was used to increase the area of residential land cover (by 75% of future developed land) and the area of the commercial/industrial/transportation (referred to as commercial) land cover (by 25% of the future developed land) in the model (Equations 3 and 4, respectively). These percentages were based on a Brookings Institution (2004) study that indicates that the majority of new development from 2000 to 2030 will be residential. The projected developed land in each county was used to decrease the agricultural and forested land uses in the loading model (Equations 5 and 6, respectively). At the subwatershed level, the total acres of projected development were subtracted from the current forest and agricultural land area at an average watershed percentage of 10% and 90%, respectively. That is, 10% of the new development was projected to occur in forested areas, and 90% was projected to occur in agricultural areas. These percentages were derived from the county level analysis as the average distribution of land types in which development was projected to occur.

St. Joseph, IN; St. Joseph, MI; Kalamazoo, MI; Kosciusko, IN and Elkhart, IN counties were predicted to have the most future developed land (as a percentage of total land area). Of these counties, St. Joseph, IN and Elkhart County were projected to reach this level of development in the shortest period of time (26.4 and 66.3 years, respectively).

Of those counties with the greatest future developed land, Kalamazoo County has the potential to increase its developed land by the greatest percentage (959%) from current development. However, it is expected to take the longest time to reach this level of development (1,400 years) due to its relatively low population growth (6.8%) and rate of sprawl (3.1) below the Midwest average (4.5).

For planning purposes, the county in which each subwatershed predominantly falls was identified. Two subwatersheds, #42 in VanBuren County (a 32,900acre subwatershed in the Dowagiac River drainage) and #65 in St. Joseph County, MI (a 23,500-acre subwatershed at the mouth of Portage River) each have over 9,000 acres of projected development. For the Watershed Management Planning Project, subwatersheds were scored for preservation based on mapped attributes (K&A, 2004). Those subwatersheds were grouped into larger subwatershed units, and the scores were averaged. Two units scored the highest for preservation (primarily because they were small drainages in which the preservation score was not averaged over many units). They drain directly to the St. Joseph River in St. Joseph, MI, and Cass Counties and are known as Mill Creek (Subwatersheds #89 and #104) and Trout Creek (Subwatershed #124). These subwatersheds are shaded in the Attachment C table. The model did not predict much development in these units, compared with development predicted in other subwatersheds. It did, however, identify over 1,200 acres in each that could be developed based on the model constraints. The scoring procedure conducted for the Watershed Management Planning Project also identified the eight drainage units (in bold in Attachment C) which scored highest for preservation at the individual subwatershed level. A high preservation score means that the watershed has a high percentage of forested and wetland land cover, according to the USGS 1992 land cover dataset used for the nonpoint source model and the subwatershed scoring. Two of these subwatersheds have over 4,700 acres projected for development (#51 in Cass County, Dowagiac Creek and #12 in Kalamazoo County, Gourdneck Creek)."}, {"section_title": "Development in Elkhart County", "text": "The development model was also run on Elkhart County alone because it is almost entirely within the St. Joseph River Watershed and it was projected to have one of the greatest percentages of future developed land. With the smaller geographic scope, the model allowed for a distance threshold of 2.2 miles from current development and roads. The model was again attempted with two different user inputs: forested land as developed and agricultural land as being developed. The outputs (acres of future land developed on all current land cover types) were quite different between the two scenarios (approximately 50,000 acres vs. 61,000, respectively). When the model was run at the whole watershed level, approximately 78,000 acres were predicted to be developed in Elkhart County on all land cover types. [The model predicted 52,335 acres to be developed on the appropriate land cover types, as discussed in the Model Limitations section (see Table  3).] However, the county-scale model run also projected future development in wetland areas, open water areas and areas where development is currently located, as did the watershed scale run. The county level run of the model with forested land selected for future development projected 3,800 acres to be developed on forested and shrub lands. The scenario in which agricultural land was selected to be developed predicted 36,000 acres of agricultural land to be developed. Therefore, 39,800 acres are projected to be developed (95% of which is on agricultural land) when the distance threshold is 2.2 miles in contrast to 10.9 miles with the watershed-scale model run. Table 3 illustrates that when the model was run at the whole watershed level, 90% of the 52,335 acres of new development were predicted to occur in agricultural areas. This exercise illustrates that running the model on a smaller geographic scale allows smaller distance thresholds to be used. However, the model outputs must still be carefully considered because development is projected in more places than on the specified land uses."}, {"section_title": "Nonpoint Source Load Model", "text": "The nonpoint source load model run for the Watershed Management Planning Project (K&A, 2003) was updated with the NOAA 2000 land cover data. The new development predicted by the Landscape Analyst based on 2000 land cover data was used to adjust the model to calculate associated increases in stormwater runoff and nonpoint source loading of sediments and phosphorus at the county level (Table 4). St. Joseph County (MI) is expected to increase in stormwater runoff and pollutant loading by the greatest percentages. This is due to the fact that it is largely undeveloped and was predicted to have 104,807 acres of additional development. Only 3.9% of the county land area, all of which lies within the St. Joseph River Watershed, is currently developed. It is also expected to have the greatest percentage of future developed area (35.5%) after St. Joseph County, IN, which is currently 30% developed. However, it is predicted to take almost 300 years to reach this level of development. Expected changes in runoff and loading by subwatershed are tabulated in Attachment C for the 217 drainage units used in the empirical loading model. The attachment includes the percent change from current levels to projected levels. These projections can be used with planning tools by municipalities and county governments to identify areas threatened by development (based on topography and distance to roads and current development). Table 5 lists the total St. Joseph River Watershed calculated runoff volume and nonpoint source loads in relation to the original values (2000). The future development increases signal impacts to the watershed from future development. The increase in phosphorus loading is the greatest because the future predicted development is primarily residential (75%), which produces the highest concentration of phosphorus in runoff of all land cover types, according the estimated mean concentrations. Land cover data available from the USGS (1992) was used in the nonpoint source model conducted during the Watershed Management Planning project (K&A, 2003). More current land cover data (2000) has since become available (from NOAA) and was used to update the nonpoint source model and as a baseline for the development predictions.

A large area of interior forest land was also identified in northeast LaGrange County."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The Landscape Analyst ArcView extension was used to conduct a build-out analysis of the St. Joseph River Watershed. This analysis predicted areas where future development can occur based on topography, distance to roads and distance to current development. The model results were used with U.S. Census data to predict the rate at which each county could be developed. The extension and other modeling tools were also used to determine on which current land use types development is predicted to occur. Changes in land cover were then used to examine potential stormwater load increases. The Landscape Analyst model was developed by the Canaan Valley Institute through a federal grant, but is not supported nor updated through any continual funding. It is offered at no charge through an online download of the extension. Available technical assistance and help documents are limited. The institute was contacted regarding several model issues, though the large distance threshold (10.9 miles) allowed as a minimum and the placement of projected development on areas not specified by the user were of primary concern. The distance threshold could be corrected by running the model at a smaller geographic scale, as evidenced by the Elkhart County level run. Therefore, the whole watershed level run could be considered a screening tool by which Elkhart County was identified as a critical county ( Table 3). The projection of future development on areas not specified by the user could not be corrected in the model. Those land areas were simply ignored and only the development projected on agricultural land and forested areas is reported. However, the future land cover map (Figure 2b) shows all development predicted by the model. Further, the largest forest patch indicator could not be executed. Though visual observation of the forest interior indicator (Figure 4) produced a similar outcome for the project. Despite these shortcomings, output from the Landscape Analyst extension has provided useful information to illustrate the potential impacts of future development in the watershed. Elkhart County was identified as a critical county because it was predicted to have one of the greatest percentages of future developed land (29.6%), as a proportion of total land area, in a relatively short period of time (66.3) years. This is based on a 17% growth rate from 1990 to 2000. However, the relatively low sprawl rate of 1.37 (identified in Table 2) extends the time frame needed to reach the future predicted development (from the Midwest average sprawl rate of 4.5). This sprawl rate indicates the development in the Elkhart-Goshen metropolitan area is much more dense than most Midwest areas. Therefore, less land is used for development. Denser development requires innovative stormwater management techniques, such as permeable pavement and other Low Impact Development techniques. It is desirable because it actually results in less watershed imperviousness due to less extensive road and driveway networks to access sprawl development. During the Watershed Management Planning Project, subwatersheds were scored for BMP implementation priority based on the presence of identified impaired water bodies [inclusion on the 303(d) list] and the percentage of developed land uses (urban and agriculture). Of the six major subwatersheds scoring highest in this analysis, five fell partly or wholly in Elkhart County. (A higher score means the area is more impacted.) Three of these drainage units are parts of the Elkhart River Watershed. Analysis of USGS water quality monitoring data revealed the Elkhart River to be a large contributor of suspended solids and phosphorus to the St. Joseph River Watershed (analysis conducted for the Watershed Management Planning Project). St. Joseph County (IN) was also identified as a critical county due to a high potential for future developed land (53.2% of the land in the watershed). However, the portion of this county in the watershed is already 29.7% developed. It also has the highest sprawl factor of the three metropolitan areas (4.03) in the watershed. (This value is below the Midwest average of 4.5.) This analysis indicates that the county is currently largely developed, but has the potential to add even more developed land. This is supported by current growth trends in areas spanning South Bend and Mishawaka. A watershed group in this area, the Juday Creek Task Force, is active in encouraging stormwater management at new developments. St. Joseph County (IN) and Elkhart County are the most developed counties in the watershed and are both continuing to grow, based on Census data. Therefore, they are assigned the greatest priority for stormwater management and land use planning. Berrien County is the third most developed county in the watershed, but has the lowest growth rate of any county in the watershed. Therefore, Berrien County is assigned the lowest priority in the watershed, based on this analysis. During the Watershed Management Planning Project, subwatersheds were also scored on mapped attributes for preservation potential (K&A, 2004). Scoring was based on forested and wetland land cover, and on the presence of identified trout streams. The preservation scoring identified major drainage units and individual subwatersheds having the greatest amount of natural resources, based on current land cover. It was rationalized that those with large areas of intact, undisturbed lands should be preserved. The development model in Landscape Analyst was used to determine which of these areas with the greatest remaining natural resources have the potential to be developed and, thus, have threatened resources. It also addressed the consequences of doing nothing (a \"no-action scenario for land use planning) to protect these natural resources. St. Joseph County, MI, which scored highly for preservation due to its forested land, was actually predicted to have over 90% of its development occur in agricultural lands. VanBuren County, also prioritized for preservation, was predicted to have the greatest percentage of development in forested areas (19.3%). Subwatersheds in the Dowagiac River Watershed (which lies in VanBuren, Cass and Berrien Counties) were identified as having the most potential for development (#42, VanBuren County) of all of the subwatersheds and as having the one of the greatest acres of potential development of those prioritized for preservation (#51, Cass County). (Subwatershed 12 in Kalamazoo County was predicted to the have the greatest number of acres developed, of those subwatersheds prioritized for preservation. However, Subwatersheds 12 and 11 contain the Gourdneck State Game Area, which is protected by the MI Department of Natural Resources.) Further, VanBuren County is predicted to have most of its new development on forested land. This points to the need for preservation and strengthens the importance of the ongoing efforts in the Dowagiac River Watershed. This particular watershed was the subject of a 2002 watershed management planning project and is undergoing hydraulic restoration activities by the Army Corp of Engineers. VanBuren County is also drained by the PawPaw River Watershed, which contains rare prairie fen habitats (Friends, 2002(Friends, -2004. Subwatershed #2 in the PawPaw River Watershed was also prioritized for preservation. The development model predicted that 3,624 acres in this subwatershed could be developed. The PawPaw River joins the St. Joseph River in Berrien County. Although Berrien County was assigned the lowest priority in this analysis, the portions of that county drained by the PawPaw River Watershed should remain a priority. The PawPaw River Watershed is a critical area based on preservation scoring and prioritization of VanBuren County. The development model predicts future development based on physical constraints, i.e., topography and location in relation to current development and roads. It does not account for economic and social impacts on development, nor for land use planning policies. The model simply identifies areas that could be developed at some time in the future. Further, the nonpoint source load model assumed that no stormwater BMPs are installed with the future development. It simply predicts the runoff and load based on rainfall depth and land use types. It also does not account for transport to and within the stream network. These values are meant to be used for comparison purposes to illustrate the potential impacts of unplanned development and to compare geographic units within the watershed. Based on this analysis at the county level, Elkhart County is prioritized for urban BMP implementation and VanBuren County is prioritized for land use planning related to preservation. Landscape Analyst is a powerful tool that was developed with limited funding. Therefore, resources are currently not available to update or debug the program or to provide technical support. However, the development model outputs could be manipulated and utilized with published data on land development patterns and population growth to predict potential future impacts to the St. Joseph River Watershed. When the outputs are carefully considered, they provide useful insights into future land use pressures and potential water quality threats. The development model is also applicable at a smaller geographic, such as the county or subwatershed levels, for land use planning efforts. Landscape Analyst is useful for future watershed management planning efforts in light of the quantitative requirements associated with USEPA's Nine Elements. Additional refinements, as noted here, would be useful. Funding for updates to the extension and technical support should be a priority to aid watershed planning efforts using this tool. Calibrating the development model output with U.S. Census data and sprawl factors further supports the utility of the model at the local level. A linkage between the model and population statistic databases could result in a powerful land use planning tool. Further, use of the extension indicators to identify agricultural land in riparian areas could be useful for targeting appropriate BMPs such as buffers, livestock exclusion and drainage protection. Although there were issues encountered using this tool, we believe the results to be reasonable and reliable for the purposes of this effort. When coupled with Census data, the development model is useful for predicting watershed threats. Lastly, the model works with ArcView 3.2 only. This version, however, is no longer supported by ESRI, the software developer. New GIS software, ArcGIS, is now available for mapping. Ideally, two versions of the extension software could be updated/developed to allow compatibility with ArcGIS and ArcView 3.2. 12/15/2004 3:14 PM The 1992 USGS land cover data are available for the entire United States for download from the USGS website (http://edc.usgs.gov/products/landcover/nlcd.html). Those data were used in 2003 for the nonpoint source load model conducted for the St. Joseph River Watershed Planning Project (K&A, 2003). Since that time, 1995 and 2000 land cover data became available from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program. These data cover the United State coastal areas, including land draining to the Great Lakes. The 2000 data were used to update the nonpoint source load model from 1992 data and as a baseline for the Landscape Analyst development model. Although NOAA and USGS use the same type of satellite image data for land cover classification, and the classification process is also similar between the two agencies, they have different purposes for such data and hence, differing final classifications. NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program is interested in coastal habitat change, and its land cover classification reflects this by giving more detailed sub-classes for wetlands and coastal lands but less for human-influenced land uses (developed lands and agricultural lands) compared to 1992 USGS data. For the nonpoint source modeling, the land cover types were grouped into classes, as show in Table D-1. It can be seen from the table that the NOAA data contain several divisions for wetland and shoreline land uses, while the USGS data contain more distinctions for human-influenced land uses. The USGS land cover data used for the 2003 nonpoint source loading were calibrated to loading data from a USGS study of major tributaries to Lake Michigan and Lake Superior (Robertson, 1997). Thus loading values generated from 1992 land cover data are considered representative of the watershed loading because USGS data define human-influenced land uses (which affect runoff) more distinctly than the NOAA data. The NOAA data were still considered adequate to use as a baseline for the Landscape Analyst development model which simply needed the general land cover divisions of: developed, forest, agriculture and wetlands. The nonpoint source loading model was updated with the 2000 land cover data to serve as a new loading baseline. It was then refined with the output of the build-out analysis to illustrate potential increases in runoff from future development. The validity of using the nonpoint source loading estimates calculated with the NOAA data stems from the desire to obtain a comparison of future loading from predicted development to baseline loading (i.e., the percentages reported in Tables 4 and 5 of the report text). The land cover distribution and associated nonpoint source loading of sediments and phosphorus were compared among the 1992, 1995 and 2000 land cover data sets (see Table D-2). This comparison highlights significant discrepancies among the data sets for open water and wetland land cover types which seem to infer these are increasing in area over time. This is not considered realistic and thus, suggests incompatibility for comparing loading estimates between USGS and NOAA data. Therefore, forest lands and agricultural lands, though shown to be decreasing over time resulting in a decrease in sediment loading from 1992 to 2000, cannot be rationalized. Other differences or discrepencies included the following: \u2022 For the NOAA data, grassland and cultivated lands were summed as agricultural lands because the acreage of cultivated lands alone was much lower than the agricultural land in the USGS data set."}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "With the USGS data, row crops, pasture/hay and small grains formed the agricultural land grouping. A separate grassland land cover type was grouped into the forest/open space grouping.\nResidential land increased sharply from 1992 to 1995 and then dropped in 2000. Only one land cover type in the NOAA data was available for the residential grouping, while three land cover types were delineated with the USGS data.\nThe residential and agricultural land cover types signal that the USGS data are more refined for human-influenced land cover types which is more useful for nonpoint source load estimates.\nFrom the 1992 USGS data to the 2000 NOAA data, commercial land rose sharply over time. This may be because the NOAA grouping for high intensity development may include both commercial and residential land uses. There are irreconcilable changes even within the 1995 and 2000 NOAA land cover data sets. For example, total acreage for the residential and commercial/industrial/transportation land cover groupings decreased from 172,667 acres in the 1995 NOAA data set to 170,147 acres with the 2000 NOAA data. This is not considered representative of the watershed, as it is known that development has increased over time. This may be partially explained by the limitations of the ArcView data processing capabilities. The NOAA data were made available as one large grid file encompassing all of the area of Michigan and Indiana draining to Lake Michigan in an Albers Conical Equal Area projection. These data needed to be reprojected to Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 16 to be compatible with the other GIS files used in this modeling exercise. However, the file was too large for ArcView to reproject in one step. It had to be cut into smaller pieces, which were reprojected individually. The pieces in the new coordinate system were then \"mosaiced\" back together. This data processing may have resulted in the loss or alteration of some \"grids\" from the original file. The USGS data did not have to manipulated in this way. Regardless of these data discrepancies, the 2000 NOAA data set was considered valid to serve as a baseline for the development model to project future development and to calculate percent changes in stormwater runoff and nonpoint source loading associated with such development.
