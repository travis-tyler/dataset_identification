[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease is a now global pandemic with severe health, social, and economic consequences. There are over 200,000 deaths in the United States (US) as of October, 2020 (CDC, 2020b); however, little is known about the risk factors of severe COVID-19 beyond older age and a few known comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), asthma, and chronic lung diseases (Guan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . In addition, large geographic disparities in COVID-19 mortality exists in the US, which cannot be totally explained by the established risk factors alone (Stephanie et al., 2020) . A recent study showed that 29% and 22% of the COVID-19 patients in the US who were hospitalized or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), respectively, did not have any of the comorbidity included in the current guideline (Chow et al., 2020) . It is thus critical to identify additional risk factors contributing to COVID-19 severity and mortality.\nThere is a large overlap between the currently known risk factors (i.e., comorbidities such as hypertension, DM, CVD) of severe COVID-19 and the diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to environmental factors. Multiple studies have shown the adverse effects of exposures from the natural (e.g., air pollution Brook et al., 2010; Eze et al., 2015;  Guarnieri and Balmes, 2014)), built (e.g., walkability (Creatore et al., 2016; Lovasi et al., 2011; al., 2020b; Yongjian et al., 2020) , suggesting that environmental exposures may be important determinants of COVID-19 severity. Further, environmental exposures can induce inflammation (Halonen et al., 2010; Keita et al., 2014; Ostro et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014) , which is believed to be an important contributing factor to rapid clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020) . It is plausible that environmental exposures may be important determinants of severe COVID-19.\nTraditional environmental health studies usually examine environmental factors separately without considering the totality of the external environment (i.e., the external exposome) (Niedzwiecki et al., 2019; Wild, 2012) . Such approach is limited to generate timely findings for COVID-19 because of (1) the time-consuming process to conduct separate studies on individual exposures, and (2) the difficulties to control for potential confounding by coexposures. The external exposome is defined as all exposures from the external environment that an individual experiences across the lifetime (Wild, 2012) , which is an ideal framework to identify novel environmental factors associated with COVID-19 mortality as it can systematically and efficiently screen hundreds of environmental exposures Niedzwiecki et al., 2019; Wild, 2012; Zheng et al., 2020) . In this study, we analyzed the countylevel COVID-19 mortality data in the US to examine the association between the external exposome and COVID-19 mortality by integrating data on a wide range of environmental factors.\nUsing the agnostic and hypothesis-free external exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) approach with integration of multi-source environmental big data, we aimed to identify novel external exposome factors associated with COVID-19 mortality."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (3) meeting vital records criteria with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19\n(CDC, 2020a).

The best transformation was determined based on the Pearson P statistics. Supplemental Table 2 shows the chosen transformations and parameters for all the external exposome variables. All continuous variables were also z-score standardized (mean=0 and standard deviation=1). Missing data for all external exposome factors and potential confounders were imputed using the chained equations method by the mice package in R. A variable was considered as a predictor in the imputation model if its proportion of nonmissing values among counties with missing values in the variable to be imputed was larger than 40% and they were correlated (i.e. with the absolute correlation value>0.4) with the variable to be imputed or the probability of the variable being missing. We imputed a single dataset given the minimal impacts of the imputation procedure due to the large sample size and small fractions of missing data.\nIn this external ExWAS, we used the standard two-phase EWAS-MLR approach (environment-wide association study followed by a multivariable regression step including the identified hits) (2016; Patel et al., 2013) . In Phase 1, we randomly split the data into a 50% discovery set and a 50% replication set. We considered all the 337 external exposome variables for associations with COVID-19 deaths after accounting for multiple comparisons. Mixed effect negative binomial regression models were fitted for each external exposome factor after adjusting for all the potential confounders with population set as the offset and a random intercept by state. The probability function is given by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f\nwhere is the number of COVID-19 death for the th county in state , is the mean parameter, and is the over dispersion parameter. The mean parameter is then modelled as:\nwhere and are the external exposome variable and confounders for the th county in state , is a random intercept for state, and is the population size for the th county in state , which is included as an offset. To account for the multiple testing, the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 Figure 1 shows the flow chart summarizing the external ExWAS methods employed in this study. All analyses were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof performed using the R statistical software (version 3.6; R Development Core Team).

Using the standard two-phase EWAS-MLR approach, we assessed the association of 337 external exposome variables with COVID-19 mortality (till October 31, 2020) in the contiguous US. After accounting for multiple testing and high correlations among the exposures, 4 county-level external exposome variables with higher COVID-19 mortality (Coker et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Fattorini and Regoli, 2020; Hendryx and Luo, 2020; Konstantinoudis et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Yongjian et al., 2020) . Long-term air pollution exposures can induce inflammation (Chuang et al., 2007) , which may lead to severe symptoms among COVID-19 patients. In Phase 1 of our study, O 3 was significant in the discovery set only, and PM 10 and SS were significant in the replication set only. Only NO 2 remained significantly associated with county-level COVID-19 mortality after addressing multiple testing and account for the potential confounding due to co-exposures to other external exposome factors. This finding is consistent with several other studies conducted in the US and Europe (Conticini et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020) . To our knowledge, no study has examined air toxicants beyond the criteria air pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide, lead, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide). Using the county-level population exposure estimates from NATA, we found that benzidine was associated with county-level COVID-19 mortality. Benzidine is widely used for the detection of blood and as a reagent in the production of dyes (EPA, 2016a). In addition, the sensitivity analyses using COVID-19 mortality data reported by September 30, 2020 additionally found methyl bromide, chloroform, and antimony compounds to be associated with COVID-19 mortality, although chloroform and antimony compounds were not significant in either the discovery or replication sets and methyl bromide was significant only in the discovery set in Phase 1 of the main analyses. Methyl bromide is extensively used as a pesticide (Committee on Acute Exposure Guideline Levels -National\nResearch Council, 2012), and antimony is primarily used in grid metal for lead acid storage batteries (Winship, 1987) . Both of them have been known to cause inflammation and fibrosis (Boorman et al., 1986 ; Committee on Acute Exposure Guideline Levels -National Research J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Council, 2012; Winship, 1987) , which are believed to be important contributing factors to rapid clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020) . Chloroform is primarily used in industry as a solvent and can also be present in chlorinated water as a byproduct of water chlorination (McCulloch, 2003) . While long-term exposure to chloroform and benzidine is known to cause adverse effects on the liver and central nervous system (EPA, 2016a; EPA, 2016b), it is largely unknown how they may contribute to COVID-19 mortality, and future studies are needed to confirm the associations and understand the underlying mechanisms.\nTo date, no study has examined whether long-term exposures to the built and social environments are associated with COVID-19 mortality. In this study, we found that increased long-term access to reduced-price lunch was protective of COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that long-term food security may play an important role in COVID-19 outcomes. While the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, previous studies showed that food environment is a major contributing factor for obesity and many other health outcomes (Dubowitz et al., 2012; Morland and Evenson, 2009 ). In addition, we also found that a higher percent of addresses currently in service but were classified as - No-Stat\u2016 (i.e., vacant, under construction, or inactive (USPS, 2020) ) in the previous quarter is associated with lower COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that living in counties with decreasing vacant lands are protective of COVID-19 mortality.\nPrevious studies have shown that vacant land may lead to negative health outcomes due to their association with higher levels of chronic stress and less social interactions (Garvin et al., 2013) .\nOur study has several strengths. By using the agnostic external ExWAS approach, we examined the associations between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposures to a variety of external exposome factors, which addressed limitations of previous studies that assessed only a small fraction of these factors separately (Coker et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2020; Hendryx and Luo, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020; Konstantinoudis et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) . In addition, we spatiotemporally linked data characterizing the natural, built, and social environments of each county in the contiguous US to account for the spatiotemporal dynamic nature of external exposome factors. Furthermore, a wide range of potential confounders have been adjusted.\nSeveral limitations also need to be acknowledged. First, this is an ecological study with COVID-19 mortality data only available at the county level. It is important to note that the results of this study should not be used to make individual-level inferential statements due to the potential ecological bias. However, as risk factors beyond older age and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 are largely unknown, the novel external exposome factors identified from this study may generate new hypotheses to be tested in future investigations when nationwide individuallevel COVID-19 data are available. Second, although we obtained county-level COVID-19 death data from JHU CSSE, which is considered as the most comprehensive data source for COVID-19 in the US (JHU CSSE, 2020), the quality of the COVID-19 data may change substantially over time across different counties within the US. However, the consistent findings observed in the sensitivity analyses suggest that the results we observed are robust. Third, the standard twophase EWAS-MLR approach we used did not consider nonlinear association and potential interactions, and many of the exposures considered may be subject to potential measurement error. In addition, although many environment factors have been included to characterize the external exposome, this list is not exhaustive, and continuing efforts are needed to further improve the measurement of the external exposome."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Mortality rate ratio (MRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each standard deviation increase.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}]
