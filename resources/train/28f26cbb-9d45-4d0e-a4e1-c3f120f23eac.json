[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose-Previous reports from the Framingham Heart Study have identified cross-sectional associations of arterial stiffness, as reflected by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV) and systolic blood pressure with vascular brain injury. The purpose of this study is to examine free water (FW), fractional anisotropy (FA), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in relation to arterial stiffness among subjects of the Framingham Offspring and ThirdGeneration cohorts. Methods-In 2422 participants aged 51.3\u00b111.6 years, FA, FW, and WMH were related to CFPWV using voxel-based linear and generalized linear regressions, adjusting for relevant covariables. Mean FW, mean FA, and WMH burden (log transformed) were computed within white matter (WM) region and related to systolic blood pressure and CFPWV using multiple mediation analyses. Results-CFPWV was found to be associated with higher FW, lower FA, and higher WMH incidence in WM areas covering, respectively, 356.1, 211.8, and 10.9 mL of the WM mask. Mediation analyses revealed that the effect of systolic blood pressure on FW was mediated by CFPWV (direct and indirect effects: a=0.040; P<0.001, and a\u2032=0.020; P>0.05). Moreover, the effect of CFPWV on FA was mediated by FW (direct and indirect effects: b=\u22120.092; P<0.001, and b\u2032=0.012; P>0.05), whose effect on WMH was, in turn, mediated by FA (direct and indirect effects: c=0.246; P<0.001, and c\u2032=0.116; P>0.05).

[4] [5] [6] These imaging markers of brain aging also are associated with reduced cognitive ability 6 and increased likelihood of incident stroke, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. 7 Recent analyses from the FHS (Framingham Heart Study) Third-Generation (G3; average age 43 years) cohort suggested that hemodynamic alterations may play a central role in the early development of white matter (WM) degeneration, which leads to symptomatic disease in later life. 8, 9 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures the displacement of water molecules, which in a typical brain imaging experiment displace a few tens of microns. 10 DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) reflects how water directionality is constrained along axons and characterizes the microstructural properties and integrity of WM. Nonetheless, standard single shell DTI"}, {"section_title": "Stroke", "text": "June 2017 algorithms are contaminated by partial volume of extracellular water, reducing the sensitivity and specificity of most metrics derived from DTI, including FA. 10 Consequently, efforts have been recently deployed to quantify this amount of extracellular water, also referred as free water (FW). FW reflects the amount of water molecules that do not experience flow and are not restricted by their surroundings and, therefore, is independent to water directionality, as opposed to FA. Although interest in this new imaging metric has been increasing in the context of sensitivity improvement of DTI in the vicinity of the ventricles and for the delineation of fibers such as the fornix, 11, 12 recent studies have also found that FW content constitutes a strong biomarker of subtle cerebral injury in individuals with various pathologies including Parkinson disease and schizophrenia. 13, 14 The present study, therefore, had 2 objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of FW as a marker of WM injury in association with elevated blood pressure and arterial stiffness among normal adult individuals. Second, despite our cross-sectional design that does not permit conclusions based on the chronology of mechanisms that arise with hemodynamic alteration, we used mediation analysis to propose a potential scenario of how hemodynamic alterations may first lead to increased FW content that subtly contributes to WM degeneration, as identified by reduced FA, to finally result in WMH formation. The study sample includes 2422 individuals from the G3 and Offspring community-based cohorts of the FHS aged from 25 to 89 years.\nJune 2017 emphasizes the importance of early detection of change in WM properties as a preventive strategy against WM injury and subsequent cognitive decline. In the present study, the association between elevated arterial stiffness and excess of FW content involved almost the entire cerebral WM, with associations between CFPWV and FW being strongest in regions where WMH occur (Figure 1 ). This finding suggests that FW may constitute a sensitive biomarker to assess and monitor therapies aimed at achieving the goal of reduced vascular brain injury, although the potential reversibility of increased interstitial FW has yet to be determined."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Participants", "text": "The design of the FHS G3 and Offspring cohort studies has been detailed previously. 15 A total of 2606 subjects underwent both brain MRI and arterial tonometry between 2009 and 2013. All subjects at assessment number 8 for the Offspring cohort and assessment number 2 for the G3 cohort were given the option to receive an MRI. As previously described, 16 all subjects who agreed to have MRI and were not excluded for health reasons were included in this analysis. Participants with prevalent stroke or dementia at the MRI evaluation, however, were excluded from the present analysis. Briefly, stroke was defined as an acute onset focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular pathogenesis, lasting \u226524 hours or resulting in death. Dementia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition). 17 Participants were also excluded from the present analysis for the following reasons: other neurological disorders that might confound the assessment of brain volumes, bad quality or incomplete tonometry data or with poor brain MRI quality, resulting in a sample of 2422 individuals.

CFPWV was calculated from tonometry waveforms and body surface transit distance, which were adjusted for parallel transmission in the brachiocephalic artery and aortic arch with the use of the suprasternal notch as a fiducial point. 18 The carotid-femoral transit path spans the descending aorta, making CFPWV a measure of descending thoracic and abdominal aortic stiffness. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure were measured as the average of 2 physician-recorded blood pressures in a seated position.\nWe used DTI measures of FW content, of FA, which is a sensitive indicator of WM integrity and of WMH. FW and FA were computed from DTI using previously described algorithms. 12, 19 Segmentation of WMH and total cranial volume were performed from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T1-weighted images by automated procedures previously described. 20, 21 FW, FA, and WMH maps were finally coregistered to a minimum deformation template for group statistical analyses. Each voxel in these coregistered multimodal volumetric images corresponds to the same location in the brain across all individuals. This allows corresponding imaging measures (FW, FA, or WMH occurrence) to be related to a host of independent variables.

To achieve this goal, we used separate linear and generalized linear regressions with FW (continuous measures), FA (continuous measures), or WMH (occurrence) as the dependent variables (separate models for each) and CFPWV as independent variable, adjusting for a set of standard risk factors including age, sex, use of antihypertensive therapy, total cholesterol, presence of diabetes mellitus, total cranial volume, and time between clinical and MRI exams.\nHigher CFPWV was associated with larger FW within voxels (referred to as R FW ) that covered 356.1 mL of the WM (Table  I in the online-only Data Supplement). WM tracts most implicated as a function of volume included the superior, anterior, and posterior part of the corona radiata (13.50, 12.32, and 7.03 mL, respectively); the body, splenium, and genu of corpus callosum region (12.03, 9.30, and 6.49 mL, respectively); and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (11.89 mL; Figure 1 ).\nHigher CFPWV was associated with lower FA within voxels (referred to as R FA ) that covered 211.8 mL of the WM (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Figure 2 shows the mediation analyses results relating SBP, CFPWV, FW, FA, and WMH.

The significant mediation effect in this model reflects the fact that the influence of SBP on CFPWV was highly significant (\u03b2=0.165; P<0.001) and the influence of CFPWV on FW (\u03b2=0.122; P<0.001). Similarly, model 2 revealed that CFPWV had a direct effect on FA (b=\u22120.092; P<0.001), that no longer remained significant when FW was included as a mediator in the model (indirect effect: b\u2032=0.012; P>0.05; mediation effect: \u03b2=\u22120.104; P<0.001), and whose effect on FA was found to be highly significant (\u03b2=\u22120.851; P<0.001).

Because FW seemed to be more sensitive to arterial stiffness ( Figure 1 ) than FA and WMH, in terms of both spatial extent and association's strength, we then conducted mediation analyses to investigate whether the reported association between abnormal hemodynamic measures and WMH 9,22 may be mediated by DTI-derived measures, including FW and FA. Briefly, mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through a third variable (the mediator). 23 Mediation analyses investigate the effect of SBP on FW with CFPWV as a mediator (model 1), the effect of CFPWV on FA with FW as a mediator (model 2), and the effect of FW on WMH with FA as a mediator (model 3).

Recently, however, the SardiNIA study brought new insights in the understanding of the cross-talk trajectory of PWV and SBP over time by showing evidence of a striking dissociation in the trajectories PWV versus various measures of blood pressure with advancing age. 27 This finding challenges the notion of a tight coupling between blood pressure and PWV, particularly in later life. Therefore, although our mediation analyses suggest that the effect of SBP on FW content is modulated by CFPWV, and not the reverse, this cross-sectional study cannot resolve the question as to whether vascular mechanical or hemodynamic alterations initiate this process. Longitudinal assessments, emphasizing the earliest changes in SBP and CFPWV, particularly in younger individuals, are likely necessary to further examine this question."}, {"section_title": "Extracellular Water", "text": "The main finding of this work is that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the content of FW within most of the cerebral WM, particularly in the area of the middle cerebral artery WM vascular territory, suggesting that FW constitutes a more sensitive biomarker of WM injury in association with hemodynamic alteration than FA and WMH (Figure 1 ). Increasing numbers of DTI studies have reported that correcting for extracellular water content improves the sensitivity of DTI in the vicinity of the ventricles and for the delineation of fibers such as the fornix. 12 However, only a few studies have examined FW content, as estimated from DTI images, specifically as a biomarker of cerebral injury, in individuals with pathologies including Parkinson disease or schizophrenia. 13, 14 To our knowledge, this study is the first study to investigate differences in FW content at voxel-based level among participants in a large community-based study. Using this approach, we found evidence of strong and spatially distributed associations between increased arterial stiffness and the content of FW, identifying a potentially new stage in the pathological process leading to WMH (and possibly small vessel cerebral infarction). It also raises the question of how the biological mechanisms that lead to stiffening of the arterial wall promote an increase in extracellular water content.\nOne hypothesis is that stiffening of the aorta increases transmission of pulsatile energy into small vessels that are not accustomed to high levels of pulsatility. High levels of pulsatility could lead to changes in precapillary pressure gradients thereby resulting in greater flow of solute into the interstitium until interstitial pressure equilibrates with intravascular pressure and a new equilibrium is achieved, albeit with an expanded extravascular FW content. A second hypothesis is that arterial stiffening and elevated blood pressure may result in subtle blood-brain barrier dysfunction, shifting the equilibrium point between arterial and osmotic pressure, which in turn may allow extra water, toxins, proteases, or other substances in the blood to enter the brain interstitial space and disturb the composition of the interstitial fluid within the WM milieu. Additional studies relating arterial stiffness to measures derived from additional MRI sequences such as dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging 28 could be used to directly test this hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "FW Excess and WM Integrity", "text": "A second important finding is that although, by their nature, WMH are expected to be associated with the amount of FW content, in our analysis, this association was mediated by differences in FA. The underlying process by which this occurs, however, is unclear. One hypothesis could be that alterations in the composition of interstitial fluids, through the increase of FW, may contribute to subtle demyelination and axonal destruction over time. Indeed, previous studies have reported associations between reduced FA and higher level of interstitial proteins, including \u03b2-amyloid protein. 29 The design of the present study, however, does not enable identification of the components within FW that may be implicated in the degeneration process of demyelination or axon loss in neural fiber tracts.\nA second hypothesis is that, rather than demyelination, an increase in FW content may result in axonal dispersion, lessening the constraint of water directionality along axons, as reflected by reduced FA. Again, our cross-sectional design does not allow us to conclude that FW increase precedes or is concurrent to a decrease in FA. Longitudinal studies using probabilistic tractography, which measures voxel-based connectivity index along WM pathways that reflects fiber organization such as tract geometry and length, may help to answer this question."}, {"section_title": "WM Hyperintensities as the Peak of WM Injury", "text": "The present study showed, for the first time, voxel-based associations between arterial stiffness and occurrence of WMH, extending findings of previous studies reporting such associations, but at the regional level. 9, 22 WMH burden was also found to be associated with FA. These results confirm, within a larger cohort, previous DTI studies, which show that WM degeneration is an insidious and continuous process, with WMH constituting the most advanced stage of injury. 30 Recent studies have extended this finding using different quantitative imaging techniques. For example, larger burden of WMH was found to be associated with reduced cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, and increased bloodbrain barrier permeability. 31, 32 Importantly, WMH constitute the end stage of demyelination and axonal damage, as reported by pathology studies, 33 and although the excess of FW content might be reversible, much of WMH, as they appear on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, likely reflect permanent damage, as supported by longitudinal MRI studies that tracked individual lesions over time. 30 This evidence, in addition to the evidence that WMH burden is associated with trajectories of significant cognitive decline,"}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "The strengths of this study are the large, population-based setting with quantitative and sensitive measurements of WM integrity. Original features of this study are the wide age range of the study cohort as compared with previous publications. There, however, are limitations including the crosssectional design that limits our ability to establish causal relations between arterial stiffness and brain aging measures. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to support the proposed order of cerebral mechanisms arising from differences in CFPWV. The present study also did not aim to decipher the conundrum of SBP and CFPWV as briefly described above and more fully addressed in other publications 25 but instead proposes a hypothesis to explain how their combination contributes to WM degeneration. Finally, the FHS cohort is mostly of white descent and therefore does not fully represent the general population of the United States for whom the impact of hypertension and vascular stiffness may be even more relevant."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The present study finds that FW is a sensitive measure of subtle brain injury in association with increased CFPWV and proposes a biomechanical hypothesis to explain how hemodynamic alteration may lead to late clinically relevant WM degeneration (ie, WMH).
