In the Caribbean region, SIDS are particularly exposed due to the high concentration of population, infrastructure, and services at the coast (Rhiney 2015) which will bear the brunt of CV & C impacts in the region, particularly of those associated with (i) sea level rise (SLR), (ii) potential increases in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones and other extreme events, and (iii) increasing air/sea surface temperatures and coastal water acidification (Simpson et al. 2010; Bender et al. 2010; Nurse et al. 2014; Stephenson and Jones 2017) . It has been suggested that the Caribbean states might face climate-related losses in excess of US $ 22 billion annually by 2050 (Bueno et al. 2008) .\nAll SIDS depend on international transportation for accessibility and connectivity and interactions with the global community and markets. The Caribbean SIDS are also major international tourism destinations based on the traditional \"Sun, Sea and Sand (3S)\" tourism model (Phillips and Jones 2006) , with tourism accounting for between 11 and 79% of their gross domestic product (UNECLAC 2011; Scott et al. 2012) . As international trade and tourism are exclusively facilitated by coastal airports and seaports, these assets form lifelines of the Caribbean socioeconomic development (UNCTAD 2014) .\nTransport infrastructure and related operations that are situated at the coast are likely to be seriously affected by the impacts of CV & C. Coastal flooding may inundate low-lying coastal airports, whereas higher mean temperatures and more frequent heat waves can affect runways (heat buckling) and aircraft lift, resulting in payload restrictions and disruptions (Coffel et al. 2017) ; thus, runways may require relocation and/or extension, which may not always be feasible due to topographic constraints. Seaports will be also incrementally affected by SLR and storm events; their quays, jetties, and breakwaters may require redesigning and/or strengthening (Takagi et al. 2011; Becker et al. 2013 Becker et al. , 2016 Asariotis et al. 2017) . Increasing sea levels could alter nearshore flows inducing port scouring and/or silting, whereas changes in the wind and wave regimes may require specific adaptation measures (UNECE 2013) . Heavy rainfall can affect services and induce flash floods and landslides that can have an impact on coastal transportation assets and their connecting road network (Fay et al. 2017) .\nSIDS capacity for adaptation and resilience building with regard to their critical transport infrastructure is constrained by their terrain, unfavorable economies of scale, and lack of the financial and human resources required to carry out the vulnerability assessments that are necessary to identify requisite adaptation options. A g a i n s t t h i s b a c k g r o u n d , a n U N C TA D U N Development Account project was carried out to design and test new approaches, in order to develop a methodological framework for assessing climate impacts on the critical coastal transportation assets of Caribbean SIDS (https://sidsportclimateadapt.unctad.org).\nTwo Caribbean SIDS were selected as case studies: Jamaica and Saint Lucia ( Fig. 1 ). The present contribution presents the assessment of potential vulnerabilities to CV & C of Jamaican and Saint Lucian international airports and seaports, focusing on potential operational disruptions and coastal inundation of these assets caused by changing climatic factors. Assessments have been carried out for the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, as well as for different periods in the present century under different scenarios.\nThe study sites Jamaica (land area 10,990 km 2 , population 2.7 million) forms part of an emergent carbonate platform at the northern Nicaraguan Rise (Draper et al. 1994) , whereas Saint Lucia (area 616 km 2 , population 185,000) is located at the southern section of the 850 km long, Lesser Antilles volcanic \"double\" arc ( Fig. 1) which is built on mid-Eocene to Holocene volcanics and sediments (Macdonald et al. 2000) . As all SIDS, both islands rely heavily on their international airports and seaports for connectivity.\nIn Jamaica, the assets selected for assessment are Sangster International Airport (SIA) in the north and Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA) in the south, as well as the Historic Falmouth Cruise Port (HFCP) in the north and the main cargo handling Kingston Freeport and Container Terminal (KCT) in the south ( Fig. 1 and Online Resource 1). Seventy percent of international passengers arrive at SIA at Montego Bay, whereas NMIA, located in the capital Kingston, caters mostly for visiting family and business travelers (1.6 million passengers in 2016). SIA is built at the coast; its runway runs parallel to an undulating coastline (average distance 195 m). NMIA covers about 230 ha and is surrounded by Kingston harbor bay to the north and the open Caribbean Sea to the east and south. Its runway is surrounded by extensive stands of mangroves/saltmarshes. NMIA can only be accessed via the Norman Manley Highway that runs along a low elevation spit, known as the \"Palisadoes road\". HFCP is a major asset for the island's cruise ship industry due to its location and ability to host large cruise vessels, whereas KCT is a regional transhipment hub. HFCP covers a land area of about 11.5 ha; sea access is provided by an artificial channel through a fringing reef, deep enough to facilitate access of large cruise ships. KCT is located in the large natural Kingston harbor bay and comprises three terminals (UNCTAD 2017a).\nIn Saint Lucia, the assessed critical international transportation assets are George Charles International Airport (GCIA) and Castries seaport (CSP) located in the capital Castries; and Hewanorra International Airport (HIA) and Vieux Fort Seaport (VFSP), both situated at the southern coast of the island ( Fig. 1 and Online Resource 1). HIA facilitates about 77% of all air traffic (840,000 passengers in 2016), serving as the gateway for international long-haul flights, whereas GCIA handles mainly regional flights. CSP and VFSP seaports handle a significant fraction of the total OECS container traffic, with Port Castries being also a major cruise ship destination (677,400 arrivals in 2016). The northern side of the GCIA runway is separated by a single lane road from an open sea facing a beach (the \"Vigie\" beach), whereas its western end is bounded by an elevated and armored coastline. CSP is located in a natural harbor bay; a 12.8 m deep approach channel allows large cruise ships to call. The eastern end of the HIA's runaway is located about 150 m from the shoreline that forms on a beach fronted by coral reefs; a diverted local river (La Tourney River) runs parallel to the western part of the runway. Finally, VFSP is located about 5 km from HIA, surrounded by lowlying land and approached by a narrow road, not ideal for containerized traffic (UNCTAD 2017b).\nBoth islands face moderate to high climatic risks; Kreft et al. (2016) ranked Jamaica and Saint Lucia as 53rd and 49th, respectively, out of 180 countries for the period 1996-2015. Since 1850, 135-144 tropical storms and hurricanes have passed within a 300-km radius of the critical transportation assets of Jamaica, with some of them inflicting human losses and serious damage (Online Resource 2). Saint Lucia has also been hit by tropical storms/hurricanes that have caused human losses and In Jamaica, average temperatures range from 24 to 27\u00b0C, increasing by 0.16\u00b0C/decade; in recent years, extreme temperatures (33-37\u00b0C) are commonly recorded in summer. There is no discernible trend in the mean precipitation, but in recent decades, the intensity and occurrence of extreme rainfalls, floods, and landslides have been increasing (CARIBSAVE 2012; PIOJ 2012) . Winds are typically from E-NE to SE, with both annual and seasonal marine wind speeds increasing since the 1960s (CSGM 2012). SLR records from Cabo Cruz (Fig. 1) show a rising trend (http://www. psmsl.org/data/obtaining/stations/1910.php) that exceeds the recent Caribbean average trend of 1.76 \u00b1 1.3 mm/year (Torres and Tsimplis 2013; Nurse et al. 2014) .\nIn Saint Lucia, mean daily temperatures are between 23.3 and 30.9\u00b0C. Mean annual temperature has been increasing by about 0.16\u00b0C/decade, together with the frequency of warm days and nights. Winds are typically from E-ENE and E-SE, and average annual rainfall is about 1265 mm at the coast, but can reach up to 3420 mm in the interior; no long-term trends are discernible (CARIBSAVE 2012; ESL 2015) . Based on tidal records from Fort-de-France, Martinique (Fig. 1 "}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "CV & C impacts on the critical international transportation assets of Jamaica and Saint Lucia were estimated by applying the following approaches: (a) an assessment of direct impacts of changing climatic factors on operations, using an \"operational thresholds\" approach; and (b) modeling of the marine inundation of the assets due to extreme sea levels (ESLs) under different scenarios. Impacts under the AOSIS advocated 1.5\u00b0C SWL were assessed. As timelines are important in vulnerability assessments and the planning/design of adaptation measures, the 1.5\u00b0C SWL was translated into date years. The date years when the 1.5\u00b0C SWL will be reached have been projected using the complete ensemble of CMIP5 general circulation models (Taylor et al. 2012) and following an approach similar to Alfieri et al. (2017) . The analysis projected that the 1.5\u00b0C SWL will be reached by 2033 under the IPCC RCP4.5 and by 2028 under the IPCC RCP8.5 scenarios (see also . Therefore, ESLs (and resulting coastal inundation) for the 1.5\u00b0C SWL are based on climatic projections for 2030. It should be noted that the results are valid for these date years, since SLR is a time-lagged process and will continue long after temperatures have stabilized (e.g., Jevrejeva et al. 2012 ). In addition, ESLs and inundation are projected for different periods in the century under different scenarios. In this study, we assess future inundation on the basis of two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. RCP4.5 may be considered as a moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario and RCP8.5 as a business-as-usual scenario.\nThe \"operational thresholds\" approach Operational thresholds were used to determine the climatic conditions under which facility operations might be impeded. The approach included the following steps. (1) Identification of operational thresholds (e.g., extreme temperatures and rainfall under which facility operations could be severely impaired); as specific facility thresholds were not available, generic thresholds were used. (2) Collation of climatic data. (3) Operational thresholds and climatic projections were compared to assess threshold exceedance frequency. Given the complex topography of the study areas, the spatial resolution of the climatic data is important. Therefore, the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre's (CCCCC) downscaled climate projections from the RCM PRECIS, available for the SRES A1B scenario, were used (http://clearinghouse. caribbeanclimate.bz). It should be noted that, in terms of both emissions and potential impacts, A1B approximates the RCP6.0 scenario (e.g., van Vuuren and Carter 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal inundation", "text": "Extreme coastal inundation is driven by ESLs, considered here as the sum of the mean sea level (MSL), the astronomical tide (\u03b7 tide ), and the episodic coastal water level rise (\u03b7 CE ) due to storm surges (SSL) and wave setups. ESLs for present and future conditions were obtained according to the approach described in Vousdoukas et al. (2018) . Projections of SLR were extracted from Hinkel et al. (2014) , whereas presentstate (\u03b7 tide ) was obtained from the TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Inverse Solution (Egbert and Erofeeva 2002) . Given the focus on extreme events, the maximum tide \u03b7 max tide \u00c0 \u00c1 was used. DFLOW FM was then utilized to assess changes in global tidal elevations due to SLR . Hindcasts of waves and storm surges were obtained through dynamic simulations forced by ERA-INTERIM atmospheric conditions. Storm surges were simulated using a flexible mesh setup of the DFLOW FM model (Jagers et al. 2014; Muis et al. 2016) , and waves using the third-generation spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III ).\nRegarding tropical cyclone effects which are not represented in global re-analyses (Hodges et al. 2017) , these have been simulated using the DFLOW FM model. The spider-web module (Deltares 2014) was utilized to generate higher resolution atmospheric forcing, considering all tropical cyclone tracks since 1985, available by the IBTrACS besttrack archive (Knapp et al. 2010) . Each event produced a global dataset of storm surge levels, since the domain of the tropical cyclone simulations is global. These were then combined with those from the ERA-INTERIM re-analysis, selecting the highest value. Cyclone effects on the waves were considered using the peak maxima of H s measured by altimeter data provided by six different satellites (Queffeulou and Croiz\u00e9-Fillon 2014) : ERS-2, ENVISAT, Jason 1 and 2, Cryosat 2, and SARAL-AltiKa. Projected changes in waves and storm surges were estimated through simulations forced by outputs from six CMIP5 climate models (Vousdoukas et al. ) for 1980 (Vousdoukas et al. -2005 and during the present century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Storm surges and waves result in episodic meteorological coastal water level rises that contribute to ESLs. Given the lack in the detailed nearshore bathymetric/ topographic data required to resolve wave nearshore processes, the contribution of waves to ESL is limited to the nearshore wave setup, not including potential contribution from the wave run-up (see also Discussion).\nOffshore H s , T p , and mean wave direction have been provided by WAVEWATCH III. Offshore wave characteristics vary between islands due to, amongst others, sheltering effects while obstacles which are not resolved by the model resolution are handled by the approach described in Mentaschi et al. (2018) . Nearshore conditions (from 50 m water depth) were estimated through wave refraction and shoaling calculations based on the approach described in Part II, Chapter 2 of the Coastal Engineering Manual (CEM 2002). Wave incidence angles were obtained combining the mean wave direction from the model data with the mean shoreline orientation along 500 m long coastline sections, whereas seabed slope in the shoaling and surf zones was assumed as 1.5%, a widely acceptable generic approximation (CEM 2002) . Wave setup was estimated also through a generic approximation in relation to the significant wave height H s that is based on an analytical solution of standard energy balance and linear wave theory equations (Holthuijsen 2007) . More elaborate approaches (e.g., Zijlema et al. 2011; FEMA 2015) would have required detailed nearshore bathymetric information that has not been available for the purposes of the study. Therefore, \u03b7 CE has been estimated according to\nNon-stationary extreme value analysis ) was applied to the \u03b7 CE time series to obtain values for different return periods, derived for historical and future runs. Final \u03b7 CE projections were obtained after adjusting the reanalysis values according to the relative changes obtained from the CMIP5 simulations. More details on the approach to estimate ESLs during the present century can be found in Vousdoukas et al. (2017 Vousdoukas et al. ( , 2018 .\nESLs were projected for the Jamaican and Saint Lucian coasts for the baseline historical period (1995), the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, and different periods in the century under different scenarios, for nine return periods (1, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100, 1/200, 1/500, 1/1000 years). Inundation maps for the critical transportation assets were obtained following Vousdoukas et al. (2016) , using the Lisflood-ACC (LFP) model (e.g., Neal et al. 2011) . Simulations were carried out for 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, 2080 , and 2100 under the examined RCPs.\nIn Jamaica, simulations were based on the SRTM DTM (1 arcseconds, about 30 m resolution), whereas in Saint Lucia, a higher resolution (of about 5 m) DEM (http://www.charimgeonode.net/layers/geonode:dem) was used. Since regional and especially global DEMs are often characterized by vertical bias (e.g., Chirico 2004), bias correction was applied using in situ data of the mean sea level and the terrain elevation, as follows: (i) elevations relative to mean sea level at control areas (i.e., extensive flat areas such as airport runways and seaport berthing docks) were obtained through communication with facility managers and in situ measurements, (ii) the elevation was extracted from the DEM used in the inundation modeling for the same control areas, and (iii) biases were corrected, ensuring that the DEM elevation is always expressed relative to MSL = 0 (which is the theoretical datum in the SRTM data). Finally, land hydraulic roughness was derived from land use maps (https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Climatic operational thresholds", "text": "The ability of airport and seaport staff to safely work outdoors depends on the heat index, i.e., a combination of temperature and relative humidity. According to NOAA (http://www.nws. noaa.gov/om/heat/heat_index.shtml), temperatures over 30.6 and 32.5\u00b0C combined with 80% relative humidity present \"high\" and \"very high\" risks, respectively. Our analysis suggests that, under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, staff working outdoors at the Jamaican and Saint Lucian international transportation assets could be at \"high\" risk for 5 and 2 days/year, respectively. Under a standard SRES A1B scenario transient warming scenario, such days could increase to 30 and 55 days/ year, respectively, by 2081-2100 (Table 1) .\nHigher temperatures will reduce aircraft lift, requiring reduced payloads and/or longer runways (Coffel et al. 2017) . Takeoff length requirements vary by aircraft type. In this study, the temperature thresholds beyond which aircraft used in the area will require runways longer than those currently available at the Jamaican and Saint Lucian airports have been estimated, together with the number of days over the threshold. For example, it was found that under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, Boeing 737-800 aircraft (Boeing 2013) , which serve all studied airports, will have to decrease their takeoff load for 65 days/year at SIA and 24 days/year at NMIA, whereas by the 2070s and under SRES A1B, such days could increase at least twofold for SIA and fourfold for NMIA (Table 1) . As the maximum temperature projections are available at a daily scale (as all used model projections), the degree of operational disruptions that also depends on the duration of extreme heat during the day and on air traffic schedules could not be detailed further. It should be noted that the example in Table 1 refers to a medium size/range aircraft that requires less lengthy runways than the long-haul aircrafts serving Caribbean routes (e.g., the Boeing 777 series, UNCTAD (2017a)); therefore, the results shown in Table 1 are likely to represent conservative estimations of such operational disruptions. Finally, the projections assume no targeted aircraft design changes. Extreme heat can also raise energy demand/costs for heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems. According to a generic standard, 1\u00b0C warming will result in a 5% increase in energy requirements (assuming current technology) (IDB 2015) . Using a temperature rise of about 0.7\u00b0C between the pre-industrial and the baseline (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) periods (Hawkins et al. 2017) , increases in energy requirements were estimated for 0.8, 1.3, and 3\u00b0C temperature increases above the baseline, i.e., for the 1.5\u00b0C SWL and for 2 and 3.7\u00b0C temperature increases since the pre-industrial levels, respectively (Table 1 ). It was found that for the Jamaican seaports, the 1.5\u00b0C SWL (2030) will increase the baseline energy requirements by 4% for 214 days/year, whereas a 3.7\u00b0C rise (2081-2100) will increase energy requirements by 15% for 215 days/ year. Saint Lucia seaports are projected to experience similar trends (Table 1 ). Extreme rainfall can severely limit visibility and inhibit operations (e.g., crane operations at commercial seaports). Future disruptions due to intense (> 20 mm/day) and very heavy rainfall (> 50 mm/day) are projected not to differ significantly from those of the baseline period (Table 1) . Strong winds can prevent aircraft takeoff and landing (with a generic passenger aviation threshold of 11.2 m/s) and affect the maneuverability and berthing of ships at seaports; winds over 18 m/s (40.3 mph) may force seaport shutdowns. Our projections show that future winds will not appreciably affect airport and seaport operations on the basis of these thresholds (but see also Nurse 2013).\nIt appears that most operational problems for the Jamaican and Saint Lucian critical coastal transportation assets (apart from coastal inundation) will be due to rising temperatures, with rainfall and wind effects projected to have minor impacts. However, as the climate projections from the CCCCC database do not include the effects of tropical storms/hurricanes, these estimates might be considered as conservative. Also, facility-specific operational sensitivities that cannot be captured by generic thresholds (e.g., the disruptive effects of wind and wave directional changes on ship berthing) may increase operational disruptions. In any case, large increases in operational disruptions are projected, even under the AOSIS advocated 1.5\u00b0C SWL."}, {"section_title": "Extreme sea levels and coastal inundation", "text": "Projected ESLs are higher in Jamaica than in Saint Lucia (Fig. 2) . In Jamaica, the baseline 100-year ESL (ESL 100 ), i.e., the combination of the SLR, tides, and the 100-year \u03b7 CE , has been estimated as 1.96 m, whereas in Saint Lucia, the baseline 100-year ESL has been estimated as 1.29 m. ESLs in Jamaica under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL are projected as 1.43, 1.60, 1.88, and 2.14 m for the 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year event, respectively (Fig. 2a) ; an increase of about 0.17 m is projected compared to baseline for the 100-year event. In Saint Lucia, ESL 100 is estimated as 1.41 m under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL. In both islands, ESLs are projected to increase during the century, with the rise being faster under RCP8.5 (Fig. 2b) .\nEstimation of the contributions of each of the components of the ESLs and their time evolution has shown that whereas \u03b7 CE is the primary ESL contributor, its dominance will decrease in the course of the century. For example, contributions of SLR, tides (\u03b7 max tide ), and \u03b7 CE to the ESL 100 under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL in Jamaica have been estimated as about 7, 10, and 83% (for both RCP scenarios), whereas in Saint Lucia, the estimates are 10, 20, and 70%, respectively. However, \u03b7 CE is projected not to change much over the course of the century. In Jamaica, for example, the contributions of SLR, tides (\u03b7 max tide ), and \u03b7 CE to the ESL 100 change between the baseline and the 1.5\u00b0C SWL have been estimated as about 81, 5, and 14% (RCP 4.5), and 89, 5, and 6% (RCP8.5), respectively; for Saint Lucia, such estimates have been 80, 17, and 3% (RCP 4.5), and 80, 16, and 4% (RCP8.5), respectively. As the century progresses, SLR is expected to gather pace and dominate further the ESL increases (Tables S5 and S6 , Online Resource 4).\nThe return periods of the extreme sea levels (ESLs) form fundamental design parameters for coastal transportation infrastructure and/or any proposed technical adaptation measures. Thus, the evolution of the return periods of extreme sea levels has been estimated for different periods in the twenty-first century. Our results suggest that the ESL return periods will significantly decrease over time (Fig. 2c, d ). In Jamaica, the baseline ESL 100 will occur every 50 years under 1.5\u00b0C SWL. By 2080, under RCP8.5, the baseline 100-year event will occur about every 9 years (Fig. 2c) . Our results also indicate that the 100-year event projected under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL will occur about every 6-7 years by 2100, under RCP8.5 (see also Table S4, Online Resource 4). In Saint Lucia, the ESL return periods are projected to decrease faster than in Jamaica. Under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, the baseline 100-year event will occur about every 10 years, occurring every year after the early 2040s (Fig. 2d) . The 100-year event projected under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL will occur about every 20 years by 2050 under RCP4.5.\nIn Jamaica, the low elevation of the SIA runway (approximately 1.2-1.4 m above MSL) will make it increasingly vulnerable to coastal inundation during extreme events. Modeling results show that, even under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, the 100-year event will cause considerable flooding (Fig. 3) . By 2050, under RCP4.5, similar flooding is projected for the 50-year event (ESL 50 ). NMIA, located in Kingston harbor bay, is less prone to coastal inundation, as its runway has an elevation in excess of 2 m and is also adjacent to mangroves/saltmarshes that can reduce storm impacts. Both the NMIA and SIA airports have experienced shutdowns during extreme events (Online Resource 2), with the disruptions in NMIA being mostly associated with the inundation of the coastal airport access road; this road has been recently raised and armored, but not yet tested under a powerful event.\nUnder the 1.5 SWL, some areas of the KCT seaport are projected to be flooded under the 100-year event, whereas by 2100, extensive areas will be affected (Fig. 4) . Access roads are also projected to be vulnerable to flooding. KCT has been previously vulnerable to extreme events, including strong winds, energetic waves, and terrestrial flash floods which have driven large volumes of debris into the harbor (Online Resource 2). Finally, modeling results suggest that the HFCP cruise port will be very moderately affected until the 2080s, even by events with return periods in excess of 200 years. However, it appears that the low-lying access roads will be increasingly vulnerable to flooding; according to port officials (pers. comm., S. Rhoden), this is already a problem, as is berthing under certain wind and swell waves.\nIn Saint Lucia, the results (Fig. 5) show that several low-lying bay areas are under increased flood risk (ICF GHK 2012), including the areas where the critical assets are located. Under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, GCIA appears vulnerable to the 100-year event mostly at its northern side (Vigie beach), as the western end of the runway is located at an elevated and armored coastline. As the century progresses, its vulnerability will increase (Fig. 5) . Vigie beach, located only 30 m away from the airport fence, has been projected to also face substantial beach erosion (UNCTAD 2017b); this will further increase coastal inundation. Hewanorra International Airport (HIA) appears vulnerable at its eastern (seaward) edge. There, the runway is projected to be inundated at lengths of about 150, 130, and 380 m from the 100-year event under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, the 50-year event in 2050 under RCP4.5, and the 100-year event in 2100 under RCP8.5, respectively (Fig. 5) . Until now, HIA has been mainly impacted by strong rainfall events that, in some cases, forced overflowing of the redirected La Tourney River (Fig. 5 , Online Resource 3) resulting in severe airport flooding.\nPort Castries (CSP) is projected to be severely affected by the 100-year event under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL. Coastal flooding will impact its docks, inundate its berths, cargo sheds, and cruise ship facilities, and cause flooding of the city, the nation's capital Castries. Later in the century, and under both RCP scenarios tested, CSP flooding is projected to deteriorate, in the absence of effective adaptation measures. CSP has already experienced damages during extreme events, involving its breakwater armor, revetment, fencing, and roofing (Online Resource 3). Finally, the Vieux Fort Seaport (VFSP) appears vulnerable to coastal flooding under all tested scenarios, a marked deterioration from the present situation as reported by facility managers (UNCTAD 2017b). Fig. 2 Time evolution of extreme sea levels (ESLs; defined as the sum of the mean sea level, the maximum astronomical tide, and the episodic water level rise due to storm surge and wave set up) in relation to their baseline return periods for the 20-50-and 100-year event, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and for Jamaica (a, c) and Saint Lucia (b, d) . The stippled line represents the projected year when the 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase since the pre-industrial period is projected to be reached"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our projections show that critical transportation assets of the studied Caribbean SIDS will face increasing operational disruptions and coastal inundation under climate change, even under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, which according to projections will regrettably be reached by the early 2030s. With regard to operational disruptions, these are projected to be mostly due to rising temperatures, with rainfall and wind changes (in relation to the baseline) projected to have small impacts. As regards coastal inundation, some of the critical transportation assets in both countries have been projected to face severe coastal flooding under the extreme sea levels forced by the 1.5\u00b0C SWL; this is projected to deteriorate and affect more assets later in the century. Saint Lucian ports and airports appear to be generally more vulnerable to inundation than ports and airports in Jamaica. In this context, it should be noted that the lack of appropriate alternative locations, particularly in Saint Lucia, may have driven asset placement in lowlying areas.\nOur results show that \u03b7 CE is the primary ESL contributor, with its contribution ranging between 62 and 90% of total ESL under the 1.5\u00b0C SWL, depending on the return periods and the RCP scenario. Its contribution is projected to decrease in the course of the century, as SLR will become larger, whereas both future storm surge levels and wave setups are projected to change very little (see Tables S5 and Table S6 , Online Resource 4). Therefore, future increases in the ESLs in Jamaica and Saint Lucia are projected to be dominated by SLR (e.g., Vitousek et al. 2017; Vousdoukas et al. 2018) .\nThe analysis of coastal hazards included dynamic projections of components and inundation simulations using a hydrological model. However, data availability and the long temporal window of the study imposed some inevitable constraints in the employed approach, which are pointed out to the reader. ESL estimation was based on the maximum tide, an approach which omits spring/neap tidal variations and thus tends to overestimate ESLs. The timing of spring tides is rather deterministic, but this is not the case for the timing of the climate extremes obtained from CMIP5 GCMs. For the same RCP, different GCM ensembles can show substantial variability in the sequencing of meteorological conditions. As a result, simulations would have to be repeated, with the tidal timing probably varying in a Monte Carlo fashion, in order to capture the full probability range of coincidence between extreme events and high tides. Such an approach would imply prohibitive computational load, and was not employed.\nWave contributions to \u03b7 CE are considered only in the form of an increase in coastal sea level due to wave setup. However, waves also transfer substantial momentum to the coast that RCP4.5 (c, d) , and the ESL 100 in 2100, under RCP8.5 (e, f). Inundation simulations followed Vousdoukas et al. (2016) , using the Lisflood-ACC (LFP) model. DEM resolution is of about 30 m. DEM was corrected for vertical biases; elevation is expressed relative to MSL = 0 may drive coastal erosion (Vousdoukas et al. 2012b ) and overwashing and/or breaching of coastal dunes and dykes (Roelvink et al. 2009; McCall et al. 2010; Lynett et al. 2010) , and damage structures (e.g., Oumeraci 1994; Takagi et al. 2011; UNECE 2013) . Such processes have not been included in the analysis for the following reasons. Nearshore wave transformation requires both computationally expensive modeling and accurate (nearshore) bathymetric information. Studies that consider climate change impacts involve the analysis of several combinations of scenarios, including amongst others, greenhouse gas emissions, time windows, and return periods; such modeling would be prohibitive in terms of computational loads. In addition, detailed bathymetric information is not available for the study areas, both for the present and certainly for future conditions; nearshore morphology is very dynamic, constantly changing under natural and anthropogenic factors. Wave run-up heights are not included even though they can be important drivers of coastal inundation (Stockdon et al. 2006; Vousdoukas et al. 2012a; Perini et al. 2016; Monioudi et al. 2017) , as they are sensitive to the constantly changing beach-face slope (Vousdoukas 2014) . Therefore, consideration of waves refers only to contributions of wave setup to ESLs and does not include wave run-up and wave impacts on coastal structures, or the spatiotemporal variability of impacts due to interactions with the nearshore bathymetry and structures. In order to address these issues, high-resolution coastal bathymetric/topographic surveys are recommended for the Jamaican and Saint Lucia assets, so that the full impacts of waves on these assets could be assessed under the present conditions.\nOn the basis of the above, the employed approach may underestimate asset vulnerability. However, in climate change studies, missing data can result in additional uncertainty, and thus, wave effects are often omitted (e.g., Garner et al. 2017; Hauer et al. 2016 ). Notwithstanding the above constraints, the present study provides a first assessment of the vulnerability to CV & C of critical transportation assets in Caribbean SIDS. Results could be improved if facility-specific operational thresholds, high-resolution DEMs, and accurate nearshore bathymetric information were available.\nCoastal transportation assets could also be directly and indirectly impacted by additional hazards and their combinations, making multi-hazard assessments (e.g., Forzieri et al. 2016 ) necessary for effective adaptation planning. In Saint Lucia, flash floods and landslides are historical hazards, as most of the roads traverse areas of high or extreme landslide risk. As a result, landslide densities of up to 1.75/km (average density 0.75/km) have been recorded for the main road connecting HIA with the capital Castries and the major tourist resorts located at the northwestern coast of the island (Fig. 1) (UNCTAD 2017b). These landslides can seriously compromise the connectivity of the international tourist gateways with urban centers and tourist resorts, demanding redundancy adaptation options. Finally, since international transportation is a demand-driven industry, indirect impacts may arise from the impacts of CV & C on the capital/product of other economic sectors, such as the tourism industry. \"3S\" island tourism destinations, such as the Caribbean SIDS, are likely to be subjected to deteriorating beach erosion (UNCTAD 2017b) which can have severe implications for the beach carrying capacity for leisure and, ultimately, for tourism-related transportation demand.\nGenerally, coastal inundation is projected to increasingly impact the critical international transportation assets (and their access roads) of both countries and detailed research is required to identify the most effective adaptation options (Giardino et al. 2018 ). Here, it should be noted that coastal flood protection measures under a changing climate can be designed utilizing different approaches, such as integrating safety factors and/or climate change robustness factors (i.e., applying the precautionary principle), exploratory modeling for different future scenarios, robust decision making, and pathway planning (e.g., Klijn et al. 2015a) . However, building fail-safe systems, i.e., setting the climate change robustness at too high a level and, thus, over-engineering coastal defenses could be very costly (e.g., Narayan et al. 2016) . Instead, building systems that would fail in a safe way (\"safe-fail\") and that easily recover and/or can be upgraded after failure might be considered (Klijn et al. 2015b) . Given the physiographic, climatic, and developmental similarity of Jamaica and Saint Lucia to the remainder of the Caribbean SIDS, it is expected that the impacts of CV & C will present large challenges to the international transportation assets and connectivity of most Caribbean (and other) SIDS. This could severely compromise the achievement of several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably, SDG 9, 13, and 1.5, which form an integral part of the international community's agreed 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The study results show high and increasing potential vulnerabilities to climatic changes of the critical international transportation assets (airports and seaports) of Jamaica and Saint Lucia, involving both operational disruptions and coastal inundation from extreme events. Severe impacts are projected, even under the AOSIS advocated temperature increase cap of 1.5\u00b0C (SWL) which will be reached in the early 2030s. These will deteriorate significantly in the course of the century.\nOperational disruptions arising from climatic factor changes are projected to be mostly due to rising temperatures, with rainfall and wind changes having minor impacts; however, projections did not account for tropical storms. In addition, considerable, varied, and increasing coastal inundation of the assets is also projected, with the Sangster International Airport (SIA) in Jamaica and the Saint Lucian airports and seaports being the most vulnerable.\nIn the absence of timely planning and implementation of requisite adaptation measures, the projected impacts of climate variability and change on critical transport infrastructure may have serious implications for the connectivity of SIDS to the international community and global markets, as well as broad economic and trade-related repercussions, which may severely compromise the sustainable development prospects of these vulnerable nations. Against this background, further research, including detailed technical studies, as well as collaborative concerted action at all levels is urgently required."}]
