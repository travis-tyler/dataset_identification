[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and are the largest enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 31 kilobases in genome size (Lauber et al., 2012) . These viruses infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, and are responsible for enteric or respiratory infections (Woo et al., 2009) . Human coronaviruses, viz. severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the year 2002 and 2012, respectively (Zaki et al., 2012) . Both of these viruses have a zoonotic origin and hence emergence of human infections associated with these viruses has emphasized the need of controlling coronaviruses associated with diseases inanimals in close contact with humans (Kin et al., 2016) .\nA cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported from the Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province of China in late December 2019. The cases were found to be linked with Huanan Seafood Market and the pathogen was thought to have a zoonotic origin (Andersen et al., 2020) . The virus that caused the outbreak was identified as a novel, human-infecting coronavirus, which is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV (Han et al., 2020; Perlman et al., 2020) . Subsequently, the virus spread globally causing a pathological condition which was termed as coronavirus disease 2019 , and the pathogen was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 th January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic in 11 th March 2020.\nTill June 2020, approximately 9.7 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported worldwide with more than 491960 deaths."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 14 ORFs encoding 27 proteins. The orf1ab and orf1a genes encode proteins, Pp1ab and Pp1a, respectively. The Pp1ab protein contains 15 nsps (nsp1-nsp10 and nsp12-nsp16). The SARS-CoV-2 genome also contains four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Wu et al., 2020) . The S protein is the key protein that regulates the attachment of the virus receptor to the host target cell (Cavanagh, 1995) , E protein acts as an ion channel and facilitates virion assembly (Ruch and Machamer, 2012) , M and E proteins play a role in virus assembly and are involved in biosynthesis of new virus particles (Neuman et al., 2011) , while N protein forms the nucleoprotein complex with the virus RNA (Risco et al., 1996) . The 9th ORF of SARS-CoV-2 codes for N protein and another unique accessory protein called ORF9b in a different reading frame, whose function is not yet known. The N-protein is a 46 kDa protein composed of 422 amino acids (Rota et al., 2003) . It is a multifunctional protein with distinct functions such as enhancing transcription of the viral genome, association with M protein during virion assembly, and disruption of the various activities of the host cell by inducing toxicity (McBride et al., 2014) . It is also the most conserved and stable protein among the CoV structural proteins;\nwhereas, the S protein undergoes substantial changes during virus infection. The S glycoprotein harbours a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis. Cleavage of S protein activates the protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational changes andthus initiates the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptor and entry to the host system (Walls et al., 2020) .\nCodon usage bias is an important measure of genome evolution. Factors that could influence the bias in codon usage include mutational pressure including natural selection, G+C content, secondary protein structure and selective transcription replication (Butt et al., 2014) . Codon usage is a driving force in the evolution of viruses (Sewatanon et al., 2007) . The codon usage bias frequency of RNA viruses is low, such as in the Zaire ebolavirus (Cristina et al., 2015) , and the N gene of Rabies virus (He et al., 2017) and Equine influenza virus (Kumar et al., 2016) .\nHowever, the overall codon usage bias in case of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is high (Zhang et al., 2011) . Investigation of viral gene structure and its composition at the codon or nucleotide level is essential to understand the mechanism of virus-host relationship and evolution of the virus (Hemert et al., 2016) . Viruses that infect humans, but not those that infect other mammals or aves, show a strong resemblance to most mammalian and avian hosts, in terms of both amino J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f acid and codon preferences. In groups of viruses that infect humans or other mammals, the highest observed level of adaptation of viral proteins to host codon usages is for those proteins that appear abundantly in the virion. In contrast, proteins that are known to participate in hostspecific recognition do not necessarily adapt to their respective hosts (Bahir et al., 2009) .\nThe redundancy of the genetic code provides evolution with the opportunity to adjust the efficiency and accuracy of protein production preserving the same amino acid sequence (Stoletzki et al., 2007) . Similarity in codon usage pattern among viruses and their hosts may influence viral fitness, evasion from host's immune system and evolution (Costafreda et al., 2014) . Synonymous triplet codons are generally not used randomly and the main forces that drive this bias from equal usage are natural selection and mutational biases (Musto et al., 2016) .\nTherefore, the study of codon usage in viruses can reveal important information about virus evolution, regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis (Butt et al., 2014) . In addition, codon composition may also influence robustness of translation and, in turn, robustness of folding, which is critical to the capsid stability of hepatitis A viruses (Andrea et al., 2019) .\nThe aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive analysis of codon usage and composition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome and to ascertain the possible evolutionary determinants of the biases found.\nThe nucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2 was analysed at the third nucleotide position of the codons (A3%, G3%, C3% and U3%) and the overall composition of nucleotides AU%, AU3%, GC%, GC12 and GC3 were determined.\nAnalysis of RSCU values of SARS-CoV-2 and its different hosts uncovered the codon preferences of SARS-CoV-2, human, dog, cat, pig, horse and cattle (Table 1 ). The average RSCU of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to that of its normal (human) and accidental (dog) hosts along with other animal species which revealed that the codon preference of SARS-CoV-2 and its hosts (natural, accidental and other) are not similar (Figure 1 ). Specific preferences in SARS-CoV-2 and its host codon usage suggested that the virus does not compete with the host tRNA array."}, {"section_title": "Sequence data", "text": "Complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the Virus Resource at the National Centre for Biotechnological Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus). and NC045512.2.

Analysis of codon usage by coding sequences of SARS-COV-2 and its respective hosts (human and dog) was performed using the method of Zhou et al. (2013) . The similarity index was calculated using the following formula: Wright (1990) gave the concept of the eff ective number of codons (ENc) to recognize the bias in the identical codon usage. The values of ENc range from 20 to 61 and an ENc value of 20 indicates an extreme codon usage bias of a gene, and this means a specific amino acid is denoted by only one codon, despite the availability of synonymous codons. On the contrary, ENc value of 61 indicates no bias in codon usage which means a uniform use of all the synonymous codons."}, {"section_title": "Effective Number of Codons (ENc) and ENc-plot:", "text": "Generally, for a genome or a gene, an ENc value below 35 is known to have a strongly biased codon usage.\nAn ENc-plot was employed to determine whether the codon usage of SARS-COV-2 (concatenated ORFs) is mainly because of the burden of mutational or selection pressure. The expected ENc plot was generated by plotting the ENc values on x-axis and the GC3 values in yaxis (frequency of either a guanine or cytosine at the third codon position of the synonymous codons) (Wright, 1990) . If the predicted ENc value lies on the expected curve, it indicates that codon usage is constrained only by mutation bias, while ENc values below the expected curve indicate that other factors such as selection pressure have affected the codon usage bias."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Neutrality and Parity plot", "text": "A neutrality plot analysis was done to understand the effect of mutational bias and translation selection on codon usage.

The value of CAI varies from 0.0 to 1.0; a higher value suggests a greater propensity for gene expression. Alternatively, values close to 1 are shown by the codons with higher RSCU values.

The SARS-COV-2 genomes were found have relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and a preference of A/U ending codons over G/C ending codons. Similar results were reported in a previous study on SARS-CoV-2 (Dilucca et al., , Tort et al., 2020 . It was reported that the N gene of Coronavirus has higher AT% than GC% with an effective number of codons ranging from 40.43 to 53.85 indicating a slight codon bias (Sheikha et al., 2019) . The codon usage in RNA viruses is affected by the relative abundance of dinucleotide (Belalov and Lukashev, 2013) . CpG depletion is considered to be a selective force that influences the frequency of codons that contain CpG. Low relative abundance of CpG may be attributed to unmethylated CpG-containing sequences, which are recognized as pathogenic signatures and methylation of cytosine residues by innate hosts' defence systems (Li and Zhang, 2014) . It was found that the RSCU value of six codons containing CpG (CCG, GCG, CGG, UCG, ACG and CGA) were under-represented (RSCU < 0.6). This indicates that the selection pressure influences significantly on the codon usage in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-COV-2. Our observations were in agreement with those of previous studies on equine influenza virus (Kumar et al., 2016) and Nipah virus (Khandia et al., 2019) .\nIt was reported that TpA and UpA containing dinucleotides were also under-represented in the genome of DNA and RNA viruses (Kumar et al., 2016) . Higher cytoplasmic RNase susceptibility to UpA helps to maintain mRNA turnover within the cell (Beutler et al., 1989) . (Kumar et al., 2016) . Our results suggested that dinucleotide compositions play a significant role in determining the codon usage patterns in SARS-COV-2 genome. This also suggests that selection pressure leading to low UpA frequencies is not directly involved in SARS-COV-2 codon usage patterns; rather these patterns are primarily regulated by compositional constraints, since SARS-COV-2 genome is rich in A and U nucleotides. This result is consistent with the earlier findings of Khandia et al.

In the case of codon usage that is influenced only by the genome's GC3 content, the ENc values lie just above the predicted ENc curve indicating mutational pressure (He et al., 2016) . The ENc values were below the predicted ENc curve in the SARS-COV2 genome indicating the dominant role of selection pressure. A neutrality plot analysis was performed to determine the role of selection pressure. The weak positive correlation between GC12 and GC3 and slope of the regression line closing to zero (regression line slope, y = 0.1488x + 38.889, R 2 = 0.3698) observed in the present study indicated that selection pressure J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was the dominant factor in shaping the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. It was also observed that the concatenated CDS of SARS-CoV-2 were away from the slope of the regression line which further suggested that selection pressure was the major force and mutational pressure was the minor force influencing SARS-CoV-2 codon usages. No association between ENc and GRAVY or ENc and AROMO was found, suggesting that hydrophobicity or aromaticity does not affect codon usage bias. In addition, no association between CAI, GRAVY and AROMO was observed to suggest an impact of GRAVY and AROMO on gene expression. Negative correlation between Laa and ENc indicated that the number of amino acids does not have any influence on codon usage bias, which might be due to the effect of natural selection in synonymous codon usage pattern (Wei et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Hosts effect on SARS-COV-2 Codon Usage", "text": "Analysis of similarity index showed that the human genome has more effect on SARS-COV-2 codon usage than that of dog.
