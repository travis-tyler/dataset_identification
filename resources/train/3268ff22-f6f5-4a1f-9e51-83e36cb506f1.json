[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Midwest United States produces around one-quarter of the world's grain supply. The demand for corn ethanol is likely to cause a shift toward greater corn planting. To be prepared for the potential impacts of increased corn production, we need a better understanding of the current state of ecosystem services in this region. In this article, we describe a unique procedure for developing a dataset containing multiple variables useful in modeling ecological responses and tradeoffs. We demonstrate how to construct a detailed land cover classification and link it to yield and agricultural practices. We used the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to spatially constrain the datasets during overlay analysis. With this method, we found that the percent agreement between classifications was frequently greater than 80%, indicating little change to the original base layer accuracies. Using three different land cover datasets, we were able to add 18 classes for agriculture and 155 classes for natural cover. We then linked variables for yield, fertilizer, and pesticide application rates, field residue, irrigation percentages, and tillage practices to the land cover data. The final Midwest dataset contained 15.5 million grid values and 15 variables. Capturing the land cover and land management information at the 30-m grid scale allows for aggregation and modeling of the ecosystem services at a variety of spatial scales. As a final step, we demonstrate a tradeoff evaluation between corn yield and nitrogen loadings using our dataset. The effort required to develop the Midwest dataset was greater than initially anticipated; however, the benefit of being able to calculate derivative variables and add new variables justifies the time expenditure needed to create such a detailed database."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is an urgent need to mature our understanding of the services provided by the ecosystems of the Midwest United States. Ecosystem services have been variously defined as the benefits people obtain from ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) and the aspects of ecosystems utilized to produce human well-being (Fisher et al. 2009 ), and they include, for example, the provision of clean air, clean water, flood control, and nature-based recreation opportunities, as well as the production of food, fuel, and fiber. The Midwest is responsible for a significant proportion of the world's grain production. For example, in 2005, approximately 23% of the world's maize, soybeans, and wheat was harvested from the 12-state area outlined in Figure 1 . However, the Midwest also exports less desirable products in tandem with grain. Nutrient runoff from Midwest farmlands contributes to seasonal hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (Alexander et al. 2008 ) and eutrophication of local streams and lakes, whereas commonly used herbicides are frequently detected in shallow groundwater (Gilliom and Hamilton 2006) . Farming within the rich floodplains of the Midwest has modified the drainage and water-holding capacity of these soils, resulting in increased heights and frequencies of floods in the Upper Mississippi River basin (Pinter et al. 2006) .\nWater quality and quantity problems are expected to be exacerbated because rising grain prices spur a switch to monoculture cropping of corn into lands with competing crops (i.e., cotton and wheat), and potential conversion of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands back to field crops (Westcott 2007) . The pressure to increase corn production is also likely to affect already marginalized wildlife species, reducing populations, thereby decreasing important ecosystem services such as the existence of native biodiversity, wildlife viewing opportunities, and recreational use.\nUnderstanding the tradeoffs in services expected to occur in the Midwest as a result of the increased demand for ethanol could help determine a better way of managing future resources for maximized benefits. Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Mike Johanns, stated in 2005, 'I see a future where credits for clean water, greenhouse gases, or wetlands can be traded as easily as corn or soybeans (USDA 2005) . However, achieving this goal will require the collection and compilation of enough information to create meaningful models and maps for these ecosystem service tradeoffs. ' Currently available map products are targeted to meet interest group or agency-specific needs. For example, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) tracks the production and management of crops at the state and county level. The USDA has also created the annual cropland data layer (CDL) land cover with an eye to monitoring changes in acreage for major crop types (USDA CDL 2008) . Federal agencies including the US Geologic Survey (USGS) and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) generated the 2001 NLCD products, which is a medium resolution geodataset intended to support national and regional assessments of land cover and land use change (Yang 2008) . Other spatial mapping efforts are strongly supported by nonprofit groups such as The Nature Conservancy and NatureServe; for instance, the LANDFIRE program was developed to map vegetation fuel loads for modeling the spread of fire through wildlands (LANDFIRE 2007) , whereas the Gap Analysis Program (GAP) has been focused on habitat for modeling species populations (Jennings 2000) .\nTo begin the process of expanding our understanding of tradeoffs in ecosystem services we needed to construct a spatial dataset for the Midwest. The dataset needed to contain both a detailed classification of agricultural practices and more specific classifications for natural cover. The additional information would be used to model or calculating ecosystem functions and serves as the cornerstone for creation of an alternative future landscape. The future landscape would represent change resulting from the increased corn production expected to satisfy future 2022 ethanol fuel mandates. In this article, our process for integrating data from multiple sources into a new more detailed dataset is described ( Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We delineated a boundary based on the USGS 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) intersecting the 12 most productive Midwest states in the United States ( Figure 1 ). This study area provided a contiguous landscape encompassing large portions of the Midwestern plains and prairie ecoregions (Omernik 1987) . The ecoregions are home to at least 34 threatened and endangered species. The 12 states also include 165 out of 211 operational US bioethanol production facilities as of 14 July 2009, making them the primary location for increased corn planting to meet the demand for ethanol production (Renewable Fuels Association 2009). Data and developed datasets were compiled for this area."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "National land cover database", "text": "We used the 2001 NLCD database as our base layer in preparing our augmented land cover dataset for the Midwest. The 2001 NLCD used an improved classification algorithm to develop 16 land cover classes for the conterminous United States (Homer et al. 2004 ). The NLCD is a 30-m product that was derived from satellite imagery from Landsats 5 and 7. The NLCD provides a consistent coverage that can be used on regional to national scale. The dataset was developed with the idea that many users would like to develop value-added products for specific applications. We downloaded the data corresponding to our study area from the MRLC multizone site (http://www.mrlc.gov\\nlcd_multizone_map.php)."}, {"section_title": "LANDFIRE existing vegetation database", "text": "The NLCD-2001 contains only eight natural vegetation land cover types: three for forest, one for natural grassland, and two each for wetland and water. To expand the number of natural cover classes, we relied on the existing vegetation type (EVT) dataset produced by the interagency LANDFIRE program. Relative to NLCD data, the 30-m resolution EVT grid product offers a much wider variety of vegetative cover classes. The EVT was created primarily from interpretations of 2000-2002 Landsat satellite imagery and an extensive field reference dataset (LANDFIRE 2007) . In the Midwest, there was a total 155 different LANDFIRE classes, which included multiple grassland/prairie, deciduous and evergreen forest, scrub/shrub, and wetlands types."}, {"section_title": "CDL database", "text": "We chose the NASS CDL dataset to expand the number of NLCD's 'cultivated crops' classes determine crop rotation. For the Midwest, there were up to 56 potential classes of crops including major grains, cover crops, and vegetable and fruits. The CDL program utilizes spring and summer seasonal satellite imagery to produce crop-specific, categorized, and georeferenced output products and provides annual acreage estimates for major agricultural commodities (Mueller and Ozga 2002 "}, {"section_title": "SSURGO crop yields", "text": "The detailed land covers did not provide any indication of crop yield, so we turned to look at other types of data for this resource. We determined that the highest resolution of crop yield data available to us was contained within the Natural Resource Conservation Service's (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database soil map unit database (NRCS 1995) . A total of 1142 discrete SSURGO soil survey area databases were procured or downloaded from NRCS to encompass the vast majority of the Midwest study area (Soil Survey Staff, NRCS, http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov). The 'ccrpyd' component crop yield table within each database was compiled from yield estimates generally calculated by NRCS agronomists knowledgeable about the specific soils and yields in the area. To the best of our knowledge, SSURGO crop yield estimates were routinely accuracy-screened by NRCS state agronomists for most if not all survey areas before their inclusion in the SSURGO digital database, which would link the estimates to the late 1990s or later lineage."}, {"section_title": "County and agricultural district annual reports", "text": "At the time we were developing our dataset, SSURGO had not been completed for the whole of the Midwest and we included the county level NASS data to fill in for those locations without yield. For our purposes, annual report data from the 2004 to 2007 time periods were downloaded by state and year from NASS and separated into tables by county and agricultural district entities (USDA NASS 2004 -2007 . One of the ongoing responsibilities of NASS is to prepare and publish, in conjunction with each state's agriculture department, annual county crop production data to support USDA's farm and cooperator programs. The county data within these reports were based on a statistical sampling of farms and ranches, and agricultural districts are defined statistical groupings of counties within each state that are typically lumped according to geography, climate, and cropping practices."}, {"section_title": "Irrigated lands", "text": "The SSURGO and NASS yield values are developed for irrigated and nonirrigated crops. To determine the appropriate yield values, we needed a spatial representation of irrigated lands within the Midwest. After reviewing several available datasets, we selected a 2001 irrigation map developed by the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment at the University of Wisconsin having a moderate spatial resolution of 463 m (Ozdogan and Gutman 2008) . The mapping product was derived from remote sensing radiometric data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument and was augmented by extensive ancillary sources of global climatic and agricultural array data. The map represents the proportion of land within each grid cell that was irrigated. We used a 50% cutoff value for determining which yield value to use from the SSURGO and NASS datasets."}, {"section_title": "State-level tillage operations and fertilizer/pesticide applications", "text": "We determined that internet-downloadable Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data addressing crop production practices would provide the needed information about the current status and trends in management practices for the large-acreage field crops of corn, wheat, and soybeans. Sponsored jointly by NASS and USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), the annual ARMS data are the primary source of information relating to the financial condition, production practices, and resources use of American farm households. The ARMS program annually collects a representative field-level sampling of information on chemical applications, tillage systems, and pest, nutrient, and crop residue management practices."}, {"section_title": "Crop rotation classes", "text": "In Gassman et al.'s (2006) , Upper Midwest basin mapping effort, field crops including corn, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa in conjunction withCRP and pasture lands were digitally linked to the NLCD 2001 data using simple GIS-based raster overlay processes. For our study, we expanded the method described by Gassman et al. (2006) to include additional crop types and rotations.\nTo develop the crop rotation classes, we consolidated 4 years of CDL data for our study area. The 4 years of CDL (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) data spanned the transition period between the uses of TM to AWiFS satellite. We determined that retaining the 56-m resolution of the later AWiFS imagery resulted in more congruent overlays between years and yielded fewer instances of grid cells exhibiting nonfield-crop values.\nWe then created a 'hybrid' reclassification of the 2004-2007 CDL field crop classes so that all available CDL crop cover classes could be matched across the 4-year period. To accomplish this, earlier years' classes were crosswalked and renumbered as necessary to correspond with the 2007 standard CDL class-numbering scheme. Each state's hybridclassed field crop grids were then spatially combined across the four overlay years of 2004-2007. A character attribute was added to the combined attribute table to serve as a unique identifier key indicating the actual 4-year classes contributing to the final crop rotation assignments. The combination of CDL hybrid classes spanning the four overlay years yielded 96,295 distinct crop combinations within the study area.\nNext, we defined a set of crop rotation classes that would adequately encompass and represent the principal crops of the region. Grid cell counts (i.e., total number of 56-m grid cells occupied for each rotation combination) were used to examine general cropping patterns. A crop category variable was enlisted to aid these assignments. Corn, soybean, wheat, alfalfa/hay, and cotton were the key crops, whereas miscellaneous grain and fallow/ idle classes were used to distinguish among other secondary crops. A variety of combinations drawn from these crop types yielded 19 discrete crop rotation classes and a '0' class denoting both nonfield crop and missing data situations (Table 1) .\nFinally, each cell in the Midwest study area was assigned a crop rotation class by iteratively looping through a seven-level subsetting hierarchy ARC macro language (AML). Subset groups included monoculture, two crop rotations, mixed cropping, and other miscellaneous crops. The first iteration selected for monoculture occurrences. That is, where a single crop category occurred in all 4 years or where there was 3 years of single crop with no data for the other year. The second and third iteration searched for and assigned mixed rotation classes where different crop types occurred between the 4 years. The fourth iteration applied a 2006-2007 bias for monoculture or rotational classes (i.e., rotation was assigned based on 2006-2007 crops identified). The fifth and sixth iteration focused on selections and assignment of mixed fallow/idle combinations. The last iteration addressed any leftover rotational combinations that were assigned en masse to the other crop/fallow idle class."}, {"section_title": "The Midwest classification", "text": "The CDL and EVT grid values were added to the dataset using overlay analysis. The grids were linked to the NLCD by locking in their corners. New columns for each classification were then added to the NLCD attribute table. The 56-m CDL values were assigned to the 30-m grid values using center point intersection rules.\nOnce the classifications were joined into a single attribute table, we used Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) code to construct a new classification column. We used if/then rules to assign the classes for the new Midwest classification as follows: (1) where NLCD was urban, water, and barren the values were maintained; (2) where NLCD was natural cover (i.e., forest, shrub, grass/herb, wetland), then the LANDFIRE EVT classification value was added; and (3) where NLCD designated a grid cell as agriculture (i.e., class 81 or 82), we inserted replacement values from the CDL crop rotation classification.\nIn two cases, exceptions were made to the classification rules. The first was where NLCD designated a grid as grassland/herbaceous (class = 71) and CDL designated the grid cell as wheat or wheat-rotation. In this case, we chose to use the CDL class instead of the LANDFIRE. We based this decision on the tendency of NLCD to underestimate wheat crops in the Upper Midwest (Maxwell et al. 2008) . The second exception we made was where NLCD designated a grid cell as barren but EVT identified the grid cell as recently logged. In this case, we retained the EVT-logged value.\nAfter implementing the above SAS-processing steps, the final Midwest land cover classification contained 18 classes for agriculture and 155 classes for natural cover, 3 urban, barren, and water (Figure 3) . The land cover source data information was retained within the then all grids were merged together for the study area. We prepared SSURGO crop yield estimates for corn, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa/hay. Where the spatial SSURGO coverage was present but there was no component crop yield table available (i.e., the states of North Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri), a series of statespecific crop productivity indexing approaches were used to derive aggregate crop yield values for the soil map units. The criteria used in those productivity indices were provided directly to us by the respective NRCS state office staffs. In other places where SSURGO data were unavailable from NRCS (about 4% of study area), the crop yield data were left blank (i.e., zeroed out) with the intention that potential users of the data could fill in values for these areas either from the NASS county-level data or from other specific sources. Records having null yield values (yield = 0) were discarded and the remaining records were averaged across years to derive mean crop yield estimates for the two entities. Data were often reported by NASS separately for irrigated and nonirrigated conditions. However, where this was not the case, a total crop value was given instead. Grids of 30-m resolution were then prepared for the SSURGO and NASS yield data. The attribute tables were populated with the relevant mean annual crop yield estimates for corn, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa/hay.\nCrop production practices data were downloaded and summarized by crop type and year for each state, encompassing the corn, soybean, spring wheat, and winter wheat crop types (ARMS 2002 (ARMS -2005 . Available ARMS tillage operations data were used to estimate tillage parameters for each crop type that included the percentage of crop residue at the time of planting, the number of tillage operations performed over the season, and the percentage of crop area cultivated for weed control. The principal weighting factor in this tillage analysis was a tillage-type variable derived from the mean percentage of five reported tillage types: no-till, ridge-till, mulch-till, reduced-till, and conventional-till. The available ARMS chemical fertilizer and pesticide application data were then used to estimate annual application parameters for each crop type including nitrogen, phosphate, potash, herbicide, pesticide, and total pesticide, all expressed on a mass-per-unit-crop-area basis for each state.\nAfter implementing the above processing steps, the data were added to the expanded Midwest dataset using overlay analysis. The Midwest attribute file now contained three land cover classifications, yield data by crop type from both SSURGO and NASS, and variables for cropping practices, and pesticide use. As a last step, irrigation percentages were added to the attribute table using overlay and center point rules. The final Midwest dataset contained 15.5 million grid values and 15 variables (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cropland evaluation", "text": "At the time of this article, the 2001 NLCD accuracy assessment was in press (Wickham et al. in press) . The overall user accuracy for the 2001 NLCD regions (i.e., Regions IV, V, and VI) of this study ranged between 80% and 84%. However, the NLCD cropped agriculture class had user accuracies closer to 90%. The USDA CDL data publish their accuracy assessment for each state as part of the disks/download information. The accuracy assessment of the CDL differed by state and year, with the lowest agreement occurring in the year 2006 in North and South Dakota (Table 2) . USDA NASS has strived to keep accuracy of the major crops (corn, soybean, wheat) greater than 90%. In our center point overlay method, we did not alter the location of the cropped agriculture from that of the NLCD. Therefore, the accuracy of cropped fields would be the same as those designated for the appropriate NLCD regions.\nTo determine how frequently the two land cover classifications agreed, we compared agriculture classes from the combined 2004-2007 CDL crop rotation to the 2001 NLCD (Table 3) . We reclassed the agriculture classes for both land covers into one combined class called field crops and created 30-m grids to run the comparison. We found that field crop classification in the CDL grid agreed with the NLCD more than 80% of the time. When we use the number of 30-m cells for all land cover types in the study area (i.e., 2.57 \u00b7 10 9 cells), we see that the NLCD-2001 land cover grid identified lands as being agricultural somewhat less frequently than did the CDL crop rotation grid (i.e., 35.3% vs. 40.3%, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Natural cover evaluation", "text": "The LANDFIRE EVT accuracy assessment for the Midwestern states had not yet been published at the time of this study. However, as in the case of agriculture classes we controlled the spatial distribution of the natural areas using NLCD natural cover classes. Therefore, misclassification into classes of human use groups (urban, cropped, agriculture) would be expected to remain at the rate of the error found in the NLCD.\nTo get a measure of agreement between classes, we compared the LANDFIRE natural cover classes incorporated into the Midwest classification to the NLCD. We aggregated the 155 natural cover classes into NLCD-'like' groups (i.e., evergreen and deciduous trees, herbaceous and woody wetland, grasslands, and barren), then compared differences between the two grids. We summed the pixels in each natural class for the two different classifications and then calculated percent agreement (Table 4) . Bareground, grasslands, woody wetland, and deciduous forest classes in the Midwest classification had the highest agreement, around 80% or greater. Herbaceous wetland agreement was slightly lower (56%) because of crossover with woody wetlands. The remaining forest class pixels were distributed across evergreen, mixed, and deciduous forest, resulting in agreement only slightly greater than 25%. The lowest agreement was in shrub/scrub with the majority of the pixel count falling in either NLCD forest or grassland classes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and conclusion", "text": "With the current focus in the scientific community on ecosystem services, environmental data are needed which can be used by multiple groups for a variety of purposes. One way to meet the needs of the various modelers and data users is to combine the disparate data from the many different agencies and organizations into a single comprehensive dataset. In this article, we described a procedure for building a spatially detailed dataset containing both land cover and land use management information.\nWe relied on expert judgment to develop our land cover for the Midwest. In the final dataset, we retained the original classifications from the CDL, LANDFIRE, and NLCD as unique variables along with the newly developed Midwest classification. By retaining the original classifications, scientists have the opportunity to make comparisons between the land cover classifications or to build their own classification. The classification we developed for the Midwest was constrained spatially by the NLCD. We made no changes to water and urban classes so they would retained the level I accuracy of the NLCD. We compared the CDL crop rotation to the NLCD and found there was 84% agreement in identification of agriculture in Midwest landscape. Using multiple years of CDL data in conjunction with the NLCD, we were able to include 18 new categories for crop rotation to our classification. We chose to favor the classes of the LANDFIRE while retaining the total area of natural cover from the NLCD. As a result, there was greater mixing between natural classes in the final Midwest classification. See and Fritz (2006) proposed the use of fuzzy logic to incorporate expert judgment and evaluated disagreement between map products. However, even with only using best professional judgment, we found that agreement between classifications of bareground, grassland, deciduous forest, and woody wetland remained high for the Midwest land cover.\nUsing various processing steps, we were able to successfully add data for yield, fertilizer and pesticide application rates, field residue, irrigation percentages, and tillage practices into the final dataset. The purpose of combining land cover with management data into a 30-m grid was to provide a means to investigate ecosystem response modeling at a finer spatial resolution. Several other studies have used similar overlay, regression or dasymetric disaggregation methods to include larger scale information on agricultural practices into land cover datasets for modeling pollutant and pathogen inputs (Cardille and Clayton 2007 , Comber et al. 2008 , Secchi et al. 2009 ). With the combined Midwest land cover, we can now conduct habitat suitability modeling using the mid-scale ecological units provided by LANDFIRE (Comer et al. 2003 ) rather than the more general categories of the NLCD. The more detailed classification would be particularly beneficial for mapping habitat scarcity, diversity, and rarity as measures of ecosystem services.\nBy including crop rotation, irrigation, and application rates in the final dataset, we can now estimate ecological response functions related to nutrient and pesticide loading and retention rates at a pixel scale. In addition to calculating functional response, the new Midwest dataset allows for comparing tradeoffs between economic goods and ecological exposures. In the Midwest, corn production is a major economic good but as demonstrated by several studies (Gassman et al. 2006 , Alexander et al. 2008 , it is also strongly correlated with increasing water pollution. The expected tradeoff that would occur in the Midwest is demonstrated in Figure 4 . Another way to display this data would be to calculate the ratio of corn production to nitrogen load and display it in a map (i.e., by HUC) so that decision makers could see where the highest cost in terms of nitrogen load is likely to occur in the Midwest. With very little effort, estimates of farmer income for corn production and fertilizer application costs could also be added to the dataset enabling users to conduct a cost/benefit analysis.\nOur final Midwest database contained over 15 million distinct objects resulting from the spatial compilation of the three land cover classifications (NLCD, CDL, LANDFIRE), the MODIS-based irrigated lands, and SSURGO soil map unit crop yields; NASS county-/ district-level crop yields; and ARMS state-level tillage practices and fertilizer/pesticide applications. The effort required to develop the Midwest dataset was greater than initially anticipated. Disparate data sources, gaps in the source data, and software limitations with respect to the number of unique data layer combinations that could be handled, contributed to the time needed to compile the data. However, now that it is finished, analysts are free to add to the variables presented. The benefit of the method we described in this article is that as long as the original grid values are retained, any number of derivative variables can be calculated and new data can added from other sources.\nFuture efforts will examine the accuracy of the small changes to the original classifications that were made for constructing the Midwest land cover. The 2001 Midwest classification will be used to develop a future biofuels-driven 2022 scenario based on changes predicted by a linked set of econometric models, which generate crop production acreages for major crops of the Midwest (i.e., corn, soybean, wheat). We also plan to add variables that will allow evaluating the changes in ecosystem response, tradeoffs, and cost/benefit analysis related to the application of the herbicide Atrazine. The procedure used in this article for combining datasets is being applied at a national scale for use in assessment of water availability and quality, carbon stocks, and nitrogen flux."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The USEPA through its Office of Research and Development funded and collaborated this research under contract number EP-D-05-088 to Lockheed Martin.\nTotal corn yield (Bushed) 25,000,000 20,000,000 15,000,000 10,000,000 5,000,000 0 0 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 4 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 Total nitrogen load (kg) Figure 4 .
