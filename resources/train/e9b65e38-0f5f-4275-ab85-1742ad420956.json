[{"section_title": "DOCTORAL GROWTH RATE CONTINUES TO DECREASE", "text": "The number of doctorate recipients in 1973 was 33,727, a 2.2(j increase over the number receiving the degree in 1972. This is the lowest rate of increase since 1960 the beginning of a decade of rapid growth in doctoral education. What is particularly notable is the difference in the rates for men and women. An additional 800 women received the doctorate in FY 1973, a 15.1ci increase over FY 1972. The rate for men was -0,3(7( with 74 fewer men receiving the degree in FY 1973. The table below shows the rates of change for men vnd women in the various broadly categorized dOctoral fields. To ascertain changes at the subfield level, Table 1 of this report should be compared with last year's report. "}, {"section_title": "RACIAL OR LTIIN1C GROUP", "text": "Two years ago, the Survey of Earned Doctorates questionnaire was revised and for the first time included the item \"racial or ethnic group.\" (A copy of the questionnaire is printed on pp. 16-18. Please refer to it for the question's phrasing and format.) The graduates of 1973 were the first to respond to the revised form. Because the previous version of the questionnaire was still in circulation, some (19%) of the FY 1973 doctorate recipients did not receive the new form. The data presented here are therefore based on questionnaires returned by 27,227 graduates-81% of the 33,727 persons who received the doctorate in FY 1973. A preliminary comparison of those who received the form and those who did not indicates there is no appreciable institutional or geographical bias in the data. The table below shows the number of doctorate recipients in each category and the field in which their degree was received: 100.0 NOTE:: 11% indicates the horirontal percentages which sum to 100% across the doctoral fields for each racial/ethnic group. The vertical percentages (V%) sum to t00% for each doctoral field,\u00b0I ncludes 7 persons \\silo checked this category and one other. bTwenty persons checked only this category; 88 checked American Indian and White, c Includes 45 persons who checked this category and White. (-flight persons in this category also checked White. e. welv e persons checked this category and White. There were 184 persons who checked more than one category. Rather than record these persons in \"other\" or \"no useable response\" (note especially the effect this would have on the American Indian group), we have added the multiple responses to one group, giving a single category to each respondent. Further analysis may warrant another procedure. There were 2.092 persons who did not check one of the specific categories. Some of these persons checked the \"other\" category and reported their nationality or religion; these responses were not used. A few simply did not respond. Ten percent of the doctorate recipients reported themselves as being in a minority category. Because numbers in some of the groups are small, and because complete analysis of these data was not possible before printing this smunary report, the following profile data are presented on the 2.884 doctorate recipients as a single group. PROFILE DATA on FY 1973 Table titles and headings are generally self-explanatory, but if few terms need special definition or explanation. Table 2: There are two 2-page tables; one presents data about all the doctorate recipients of FY 1973 and the other contains data about women only. The fields of the doctorate which head Table  2 are the same as those in the 1972 report but differ from those in the Summary Reports of the previous five years. The fields are grouped into broader categories and only the largest fields are shown in detail. Refer to page 19 for the codes included in each broad field and the Specialties List on page 18 for the codes and names of each subfield."}, {"section_title": "EXPLANATION OF FOUR 13ASICIA13LES", "text": "\"Median Age at Doctorate\"One-half received the doctorate at this age or younger. \"Percent with Master's\"This indicates the percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before taking the doctorate. \"Median Time Lapse\" Total Time refers.to total calendar time elapsed between year of baccalaureate and year of doctorate; Registered Time refers to the total time registered in a university between baccalaureate and doctorate. Postgraduation plans of the doctorate recipients are grouped as: Post doctoral study (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), Employment (educational institution, industry. etc.), or Unknown. The sum of the columns of percentages totals 100% with allowance for rounding. For example, 5.7% of all the engineers accepted postdoctoral fellowships, 7.1% received research associateships, 0.3% held traineeships, and 1.0% had some other form of postdoctoral study support; 81.5% were employed; and 4.4% did not indicate their postdoctoral plans. The percentages listed by type of employer (educational institution, industry, etc.) total to the 81.5% employed. Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by work activity' and by region of employment are based only on thOse who were going into employment. They exclude those planning postdoctoral study as described in the categories above.  Table 3 describe sources of financial support during graduate school. The question was answered by 31,828 (94%) of the FY 1973 doctorate recipients. The data in the table should be interpreted as follows: 544 doctorate recipients in the physical sciences reported financial support from NSF fellowships during graduate school. This number is 10.9% of all the physical science doctorates who answered the question, and it is 32.3% of those in all fields that reported NSF fellowship support. Since students may indicate multiple sources of support, the vertical perCentages sum to more than 100%.
