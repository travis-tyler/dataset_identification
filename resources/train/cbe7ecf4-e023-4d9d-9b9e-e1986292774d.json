[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The southeast Indian Ocean (IO) is a region where extreme climate variability and a unique ocean circulation are observed. During 2010-2011, an extreme marine heat wave associated with ocean warming occurred off the west coast of Australia. This extreme warming event is termed as \"Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o\" (Feng et al., 2013). The 2010-2011 Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o event was associated with anomalous ocean circulations in the southeast IO. For example, there was an unseasonable surge of the Leeuwin Current, which flows southward against prevailing southerly winds along the west coast of Australia, bringing warm waters from the tropics. These extreme oceanic conditions have a substantial impact on marine ecosystem and regional climate variability (Pearce and Feng, 2013;Wernberg et al., 2013;Caputi et al., 2014;Kataoka et al., 2014;Tozuka et al., 2014). In the southeast IO near the west coast of Australia, relatively large annual mean surface heat fluxes (cooling the ocean) with the strong seasonal cycle are observed (Feng et al., 2003(Feng et al., , 2008. For the annual mean, a large amount of heat loss of the ocean occurs at the air-sea interface in a broad area off the west coast of Australia. The majority of the heat loss is caused by a large evaporative cooling due to warm SSTs in the region of the Leeuwin Current. The annual cycle of net surface heat flux is dominated by shortwave radiation and latent heat flux. During the austral winter, shortwave radiation is weak, but the latent heat flux (cooling) is large due to a stronger Leeuwin Current (and thus warm SSTs) and low near-surface specific humidity associated with the cold air temperature. During the austral summer, shortwave radiation is strong, and the latent heat flux is small due to a weaker Leeuwin Current (Feng et al., 2003(Feng et al., , 2008 and higher near-surface specific humidity associated with the warmer air temperature. In addition to the strong seasonal cycle of air-sea heat fluxes, significant interannual variations of surface heat fluxes are found in this region including those associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o. Some of the previous studies suggest that the SST warming during the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o is caused by the heat advection by the strengthening of the Leeuwin Current especially for the 2010-2011 event, whereas air-sea heat fluxes also contribute to the warming (Feng et al., 2013;. However, the relative importance of heat advection by the Leeuwin Current and surface heat fluxes on the development of the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o varies substantially between different studies. For example, Benthuysen et al. (2014) indicated that reduced latent and sensible heat fluxes around the peak phase account for 1/3 of the warming during the 2010/2011 event in addition to the heat advection produced by the strengthening of Leeuwin Current. On the other hand, a composite analysis of multiple Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o events indicated that the initial offshore warming is primarily caused by the anomalous latent heat flux (Marshall et al., 2015). Kataoka et al. (2014) classified the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o to locally and non-locally amplified modes based on the local wind anomalies and suggested that the reduction of latent heat flux enhances offshore warming during the development and coastal warming during the peak in both modes. Recently, Kataoka et al. (2017) calculated the mixed layer temperature balance associated with Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o events and found that shortwave radiation contributes to the coastal warming in both locally and non-locally amplified modes due to the warming produced by the climatological surface heat flux enhanced by the shallow mixed-layer depth (MLD) anomaly during the onset. Moreover, Xu et al. (2018) compared the difference in SST warming patterns between the 2012/2013 event with the 2010/2011 event and found that the difference in the relative importance of surface heat fluxes and heat advection between the two events is mostly responsible for the different spatial distribution of the warming. As described above, a variety of different conclusions on the role of surface heat fluxes in the warming during the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o have been obtained in previous studies. These differences could partly be due to the different source of surface flux datasets, which include various satellite observations, reanalysis products, and model simulations. The systematic analysis of air-sea heat flux variability associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o using multiple datasets is thus necessary to reconcile previous studies and determine the uncertainties on the role of air-sea fluxes. While most of the previous studies focus on processes during the onset and development (warming period) of the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, processes that control the cooling during the recovery phase have received little attention. A recent study by Kataoka et al. (2017) discussed processes during both the development and demise of the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o and suggested that the mixed layer temperature is influenced by not only heat flux anomalies but also MLD anomalies which change the heat capacity. They concluded that the net effect of latent heat flux is not as important as earlier studies suggested during the recovery phase because of the anomalously deep mixed layers and thus a large heat capacity. In addition, the significant role of sensible heat flux for the locally-amplified mode is suggested. However, these conclusions are based on the analysis of a single numerical model simulation and it is possible that different results could be obtained using different datasets. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the processes during the recovery phase using multiple datasets, and such analyses will provide better insights into the role of air-sea fluxes during the recovery phase. In addition to the large influence of surface heat fluxes on SST and upper ocean during the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, air-sea heat fluxes influence the atmospheric conditions and the large-scale atmospheric circulations, and in turn they can feedback on SSTs. Various feedback mechanisms between the atmosphere and ocean associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o have been suggested in recent years. For example, Tozuka and Oettli (2018) showed that during the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, positive SST anomalies increase the formation of cloud and thus decrease the shortwave radiation, which will weaken the initial warming.  found that SST anomalies in the southeast IO associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o lead to the enhancement of western Pacific trade winds and the cooling in the central Pacific. The enhanced trade winds could strengthen the ITF and the cooling anomalies in the central Pacific could induce cyclonic wind anomalies in the southeast IO, both of which will amplify the initial warming of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o. As changes in air-sea fluxes in the southeast IO are essential components of these feedback mechanisms, assessing the uncertainties of surface fluxes using multiple datasets is necessary for further exploring these air-sea interaction processes. The uncertainties of air-sea heat fluxes arise from the errors in bulk atmospheric variables and SST, which are derived from reanalysis products and satellite observations, and use of different bulk flux algorithms (Brunke et al., 2002;Wu et al., 2006;Kubota et al., 2008;Valdivieso et al., 2017). In the area off the west coast of Australia, the uncertainties and thus the difference between the  datasets could be very large because of the large variability of SST and associated atmospheric variables caused by Leeuwin Current variations. Hence thorough description of air-sea fluxes in this region using multiple datasets and their comparisons are crucial for the investigation of climate variability in this region including the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o. The purpose of this study is to investigate the air-sea heat fluxes associated with the development and decay of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o and to identify the major sources of uncertainties in the interannual variability using multiple datasets. In particular, the air-sea heat flux variations during the decay phase of the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o is emphasized. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section \"Materials and Methods\" describes the data and method used in this study. In Section \"Results\", climatological air-sea fluxes from different datasets are compared, and the effect of latent heat flux variability on the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o is studied based on the composite analysis. A discussion and summary are presented in Sections \"Discussion and Summary.\""}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reanalysis", "text": "Daily short and longwave radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes from five major reanalysis products are used in this study. These are the National Center for Environmental Prediction-National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis-1 (NCEP1; Kalnay et al., 1996), the NCEP-Department of Energy (NCEP/DOE) reanalysis (NCEP2; Kanamitsu et al., 2002) "}, {"section_title": "OAFlux", "text": "We also used daily gridded (1 \u2022 \u00d7 1 \u2022 ) bulk flux state variables (i.e., wind speed, air and sea surface temperature, and humidity) from WHOI Objectively Analyzed Ocean-Atmosphere Flux (OAFlux) product (Yu et al., 2008) to calculate the latent heat flux using the state-of-the-art COARE3.5 bulk algorithm (Fairall et al., 2003). The state variables provided by OAFlux blended observational and reanalysis data from various sources based on an objective analysis to obtain an optimal estimate of the atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The daily state variables for the period 1985-2016 are used in the analysis. The latent heat flux estimates calculated here are well correlated with those from the gridded flux provided by OAFlux (r = 0.997) but have a Root Mean Square error (RMSE) of 7.8 W m \u22122 . This difference is primarily caused by the lack of SST correction associated with the cool skin and warm layer in our calculation, and the difference due to the use of different versions of bulk formula (COARE3.5 and COARE3.0) is very small (RMSE:0.6 W m \u22122 ). Note that the RMSE between latent heat flux estimates using COARE3.5 and those provided by OAFlux is much smaller (2.1 W m \u22122 ) during DJF when Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o develops, and thus the effect of the cool skin and warm layer is very small during this season.  (McPhaden et al., 2009) from September 2012 to 2014 are also used for the comparison with gridded flux data products. The surface air-sea fluxes were estimated using COARE3.0b."}, {"section_title": "Satellite and Buoy Observations", "text": "Besides flux datasets, we also use daily high resolution SST products obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations (OISST; Reynolds et al., 2007.;Banzon et al., 2016; "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Climatology", "text": "Before examining the air-sea flux variations associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, climatological air-sea fluxes in this region and their uncertainties are investigated by comparing those from different datasets ( Figure 1A and Table 1). The seasonal cycle of latent heat flux from all products are similar, in which large (small) latent heat release in the austral winter (summer) is found. However, remarkable quantitative differences are found especially in summer ( Figure 1A), during which the maximum difference can be as large as \u223c80 W m \u22122 . To further quantify the uncertainties, mean absolute deviation , where X i is surface heat flux from reanalysis, X is the mean value of all datasets, and n is the number of datasets, is calculated (Table 1, first row). Since MAD measures the magnitude of inter-data spread, the difference in uncertainties between the datasets could be determined quantitatively by calculating MAD. While large uncertainties are found in all seasons, the uncertainty is particularly large during summer with the MAD of 19.4 W m \u22122 when the difference between the highest and lowest latent heat flux exceeds 80 W m \u22122 . Uncertainties of latent heat fluxes could partly be due to the use of different bulk flux algorithms. To evaluate the uncertainties caused by the use of different bulk flux algorithms, we recalculated the daily latent heat flux by using COARE3.5 flux algorithm and the state variables from each reanalysis product (referred to as EX-alg, where \"EX\" and \"alg\" stand for \"experiment\" and \"algorithm\"). Figure 1B show the climatological seasonal cycle of latent heat flux from EX-alg. The difference between the values in Figures 1A,B is a measure of uncertainty caused by the use of different algorithms. Based on the comparison, the algorithms used in reanalysis products tend to produce higher values than COARE3.5. For example, the difference is \u223c60 W m \u22122 for NCEP1 and NCEP2, \u223c30 W m \u22122 for MERRA2, and \u223c10 W m \u22122 for ERA-Interim and CFSR. Higher values of latent heat flux in reanalysis data have been documented in previous studies at various locations (e.g., Kubota et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2016). For example, Kubota et al. (2008) evaluated the latent heat flux from NCEP1 and NCEP2 by comparing with the measurement at the Kuroshio Extension Observatory site. Both datasets overestimated the latent heat flux with a bias of 41 and 62 W m \u22122 . They suggest that this bias is primarily caused by the use of different algorithms. The major difference between bulk flux algorithms is how the transfer coefficients vary with wind speeds, atmospheric stability and other physical processes that influence the transfer of heat and moisture at the sea surface. Yet further details why the algorithms used in reanalysis tends to produce higher values are still unknown. The MAD of algorithm-caused uncertainty is 21.3, 25.0, 26.0, and 22.5 W m \u22122 during DJF, MAM, JJA and SON, respectively, showing a weak seasonal variation. This is because the uncertainty depends on both the magnitude of latent heat flux (larger in winter) and wind speed (smaller in winter). Further details of the seasonal dependence are discussed in the Appendix. The shortwave radiation also reveals a strong seasonal variation ( Figure 2B). Similar to latent heat flux, large uncertainties are found in summer. Assuming the satellite derived estimate (CERES) is more accurate than reanalysis products, the estimate of NCEP1 has the largest bias (\u223c80 W m \u22122 ) in summer, and estimates in other datasets have smaller biases of \u223c20 W m \u22122 . Shortwave radiation and latent heat flux are dominant components of the seasonal variations of net surface heat flux. Considerable net surface heat flux differences between the datasets are found during summer when  the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o develops (Figure 2A). Most of the differences arise from latent heat flux and shortwave radiation as discussed above. The contribution of the difference in longwave radiation and sensible heat flux between the different datasets is minimal. Figure 3 compares the monthly surface heat flux from reanalysis products with the RAMA buoy at 100 \u2022 E, 25 \u2022 S for the 2-year period during which buoy measurements are available. The variations of latent heat flux from OAFlux and shortwave radiation from CERES agree well with those from the RAMA buoy. Large differences in shortwave radiation between the datasets are found during the austral summer. Both NCEP1 and CFSR greatly underestimate the net shortwave radiation. The seasonal variations of latent and sensible heat flux at the buoy site are weaker, and the mean value is smaller than those near the west coast of Australia due to the weaker influence of the Leeuwin Current at this location. An overestimate of 10-50 W m \u22122 in latent heat flux from reanalysis products is found throughout the analysis period, suggesting that these differences are partly due to the use of different bulk flux algorithms. The use of COARE3.5 improves the latent heat flux for most of the datasets (Figure 4A). MAD decreases from 11.5 to 7.5 W m \u22122 for CFSR, 25.3 to 13.7 W m \u22122 for NCEP2, 24.7 to 23.4 W m \u22122 for ERA-Interim and 15.9 to 13.2 W m \u22122 for MERRA2, but it increases from 17.7 to 28.2 W m \u22122 for NCEP1 due to large errors in the specific humidity and wind speed ( Figures 4B,C). While the use of different bulk flux algorithms causes significant difference in estimated fluxes, large differences still exist when using the same algorithm (Figures 1B, 4A), indicating that the difference in bulk variables largely influences the estimates of latent heat flux. To evaluate the uncertainties caused by each bulk variable, we calculated the daily latent heat flux using COARE3.5 for three different cases, in which bulk variables are (1) surface wind speed only from each reanalysis and other variables from OAFlux (EX-wspd), (2) SST only from each reanalysis and other variables from OAFlux (EX-sst), (3) air humidity only from each reanalysis and other variables from OAFlux (EX-qa). The uncertainties caused only by windspeed, SST and air humidity can be estimated from EX-wspd, EX-sst, and EX-qa, respectively. Both surface wind speed and humidity largely contribute to the difference between the datasets, whereas the contribution of SST is much smaller (Figure 5). The MAD of annual mean latent flux is 7.7 and 9.3 W m \u22122 for EX-wspd and EX-qa, and that of EX-sst is 1.5 W m \u22122 ( Table 1). All latent heat fluxes calculated with reanalysis state variables are underestimated in EX-wspd and EX-qa during winter, but not during summer. The MAD during winter is also larger than in summer in EX-wspd and EX-qa."}, {"section_title": "Air-Sea Fluxes Associated With Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o", "text": "In the previous subsection, large uncertainties of air-sea fluxes are identified in the climatological seasonal cycle. In this subsection, surface heat fluxes associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, which is the major interannual variability in this region, are investigated and their uncertainties are determined using the same datasets. Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o events are identified based on the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o Index (NNI) defined as the average of SST anomalies over the region 110 (Marshall et al., 2015). Years when the DJF averaged NNI is above one standard deviation are  defined as the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o years. For the entire period of the analysis, six events are identified: 1988/89, 1996/97, 1999/2000, 2010/11, 2011/12, and 2012/13 (Figure 6). The composite time series of surface heat flux anomalies, which cover the period of onset, development, and recovery of the events, are constructed by averaging all six events. Month 0 in the composite is defined as the month of the maximum positive SST anomaly in the region used for the NNI calculation. Despite the large uncertainties in climatology, anomaly fields show much smaller differences between the datasets. However, these uncertainties are still significant because they are in the same order of the amplitude of the anomaly particularly during the warming period. In addition, the sign of the latent heat flux anomalies varies between the datasets during the developing phase of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, suggesting the opposite role of latent heat flux. Large variations associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o are detected in all datasets (Figure 7). For instance, during the developing phase, a significant increase of net surface heat flux is found from month \u22123 to \u22122 and month \u22121 to 0. Then the anomalous surface heat flux decreases sharply from month 0 to month +1, resulting in substantial cooling during the recovery phase ( Figure 7A). The sharp decrease (cooling) in the recovery phase is seen clearly in all datasets and it is dominated by the latent heat flux anomaly fluctuation (Figures 7B-E). Similar variations are found for the composite using turbulent heat fluxes from OAFlux and shortwave and longwave radiation from CERES (not shown), but only the last three events are used for this composite because of the shorter period the CERES data cover. To further examine how the fluctuation of the latent heat flux associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o event occurs, spatial patterns of surface wind anomalies are compared with those of climatological surface winds (Figure 8). During December-April, climatological southeasterly winds prevail around the west coast of Australia. When the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o is fully developed at month 0, the northerly wind anomalies reach the peak, which largely decrease the climatological southeasterly and thus reduce the wind speed. Such reduction of wind speed is also found in month \u22122 although it is much weaker. The latent heat flux anomalies from some of the datasets are positive during the development and peak phases due to the weakening of surface winds described above, which are consistent with the windspeed-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback mechanism suggested in previous studies (e.g., Nicholls, 1979;Marshall et al., 2015). However, the positive latent heat flux anomalies are not found in some of the datasets during this period. During month +1 soon after the peak, the wind anomaly rapidly changes to weak southerly, resulting in an increase of wind speed by 1 m/s. Since SSTs recover much more slowly and thus they are still anomalously high in month +1 (Figure 9E), the evaporative cooling (negative latent heat flux anomaly) is rapidly enhanced, which contributes to the SST cooling. By month +2, evaporative cooling is reduced because of the decrease of SST although wind speed similar to month +1 is maintained. The variation of latent heat flux anomaly including the rapid increase of negative anomalies in month +1 are found in all datasets. The cooling anomalies in longwave radiation and sensible heat flux, which are associated with high SSTs, are found (Figures 7D,E), but their contributions to SST recovery are much smaller than those of latent heat flux. In contrast to the recovery phase, the variation of latent heat flux and its contribution to SST growth during the developing phase show disagreement between the datasets. NCEP1 shows warming anomalies during month \u22122 to 0, while others reveal cooling anomalies (CFSR,MERRA2) or alternate between cooling and warming (NCEP2, ERA-Interim). It is not clear whether the latent heat flux anomaly significantly contributes to the SST warming during the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o onset. These results are consistent with those of previous studies, which used different surface heat flux products and concluded different roles of surface heat fluxes during the onset and development phases (e.g., Feng et al., 2013;Marshall et al., 2015;Kataoka et al., 2017). The major sources of the uncertainty during the onset period are further investigated based on the additional analysis using EX-wspd, EX-sst and EX-qa described in Section \"Climatology.\" Composites of latent heat flux anomalies from EX-wspd, EX-sst and EX-qa are displayed in Figure 9. The mean of the difference between the maximum and minimum latent heat flux anomaly during the entire period of composite is 4.1, 4.7 and 5.0 W m \u22122 for EX-wspd, EX-sst and EX-qa, respectively. This suggests that air specific humidity errors could cause larger uncertainties of latent heat flux anomalies, which is similar to the results from the analysis of climatological latent heat flux. However, the largest differences between the datasets during the peak phase are found in EX-sst ( Figure 9B), which is 10.9 W m \u22122 , and the sign of latent heat flux anomaly also shows a disagreement between the datasets. While a significant difference (7.4 W m \u22122 ) is also found in EX-qa in month 0, the sign of the latent heat flux anomaly is the same in most datasets. This result indicates that the uncertainties in SST significantly contribute to the errors in latent heat flux during this period. Since the SST is highest at the peak month, the latent heat flux is most sensitive to changes in SSTs during this period. In other words, even small errors in SST could impact the latent heat flux significantly during the onset and peak periods. The SST difference between the datasets is largest in the peak period (month 0) ( Figure 9E). While SSTs used in the flux products are based on similar satellite observations, their spatial resolutions could influence the accuracy since SST in this region is largely affected by Leeuwin Current variability (Huang and Feng, 2015). Such SST differences caused by the resolution are demonstrated for the 2010-2011 Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o case. The monthly latent heat flux and SST anomaly during the event are shown in Figure 10. To exclude the latent heat flux uncertainties caused by algorithm, wind speed, and humidity, we use fluxes from EX-sst instead of the original reanalysis. In addition to SST products used in the original EX-sst, high resolution OISST and MUR are also included in this case study. The peak of this Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o occurred in February 2011. From November 2010 to February 2011, warm SST anomalies were built up near the west coast of Australia ( Figure 10B). During this time, significant positive latent heat flux anomalies (10-30 W m \u22122 , positive value denote heat going into the ocean) are evident in NCEP1, NCEP2, ERA-Interim and MERRA2, suggesting that air-sea fluxes may contribute to the SST warming. In contrast, CFSR, OAFlux, MUR and OISST show very small positive anomalies into the ocean, or even negative anomalies in December 2010 and January 2011 ( Figures 10A, 12). These differences are caused by warmer area average SSTs for the relatively high-resolution SST products (MUR, OISST) ( Figure 10B). Figure 11 shows SST maps from different datasets during the peak period of the 2010-2011 Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o event. The southward extension of warm waters carried by the Leeuwin Current is evident clearly in the high-resolution data (MUR and OISST), while it is not well represented in the low-resolution data. Accordingly, higher area average SSTs and thus higher evaporative cooling are found in the case of high-resolution SSTs (Figure 12). The results demonstrate that it is crucial to resolve SST changes caused by Leeuwin Current variability adequately for the latent heat flux estimates especially during the peak period of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The results in the previous section demonstrate that large negative surface heat flux anomalies are found during the decay periods of the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o in all datasets, and that the latent heat flux anomaly is the dominant component. Such large latent heat fluxes (evaporation) could significantly impact the atmospheric conditions and circulation. In addition to the air-sea flux anomalies, MLD changes associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o could influence the SST evolution (Kataoka et al., 2017). Kataoka et al. (2017) suggested that the cooling due to latent heat flux anomalies during the decay period could be largely reduced by MLD variability, and the sensible heat flux significantly contributes to the SST cooling for some events. To further investigate the relative importance of latent and sensible heat fluxes for the SST variations during the decay phase, these flux terms in the following mixed layer heat budget equation are calculated (Equation 7 in Kataoka et al., 2017): where Q is the surface heat flux, \u03c1 is seawater density, c p is the specific heat of seawater, h is the MLD. An overbar represents monthly climatology and a prime represents anomaly. The first term on the RHS represents the contribution of the surface heat flux anomaly, and the second term represents the contribution of MLD variability through the change of the mixed layer heat capacity. The MLD is derived from the HYCOM reanalysis which is defined as the smaller depth at which the temperature is decreased by 0.2 \u2022 C or the salinity is increased by 0.03 psu from the surface values. The seasonal variation of MLD from the HYCOM reanalysis agrees well with observations (e.g., CARS, Supplementary Figure 1). The composite latent and sensible heat flux anomalies, which include the effect of MLD changes, are shown in Figure 13, and the composites of the first and second term on the RHS of Eq. (1) are shown in Figure 14. Significant contributions of MLD changes are evident (Figures 13, 14). For example, the weak cooling (negative anomaly) is found during the onset and peak phase in the latent heat flux term (Figure 13) in all datasets whereas the weak warming is found in some datasets when the effect of MLD change is not included (Figure 7). The contribution of the MLD change (second term) is relatively large during the onset and peak phase as the first term is small. Yet the latent heat flux term is still dominant and contributes to the cooling during the decay period much more than the sensible heat flux term. The variation of latent heat flux in Figure 13 is similar to that of non-locally amplified Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o in Kataoka et al. (2017). It should be noted that there are no significant differences between locally and non-locally amplified modes in the analysis of this study. Although the reason for the differences between the results of this study and Kataoka et al. (2017) is unknown, it is likely that different sources of the data including air-sea fluxes and MLD are primarily responsible for the differences. In particular, the interannual variation of MLD could be largely model dependent. Thus, further studies which focus on the interannual variability of upper ocean structures including the MLD are necessary. While earlier studies suggest that a reduction of latent heat flux partially contributes to SST anomalies at the peak of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o, an opposite conclusion could be obtained when taking account of MLD variation. Figure 13 shows that the latent heat flux damps SST anomalies in all stages of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o and the cooling reach the maximum during the peak. At the peak phase, large differences in latent heat flux anomaly between the datasets and thus large uncertainties are found. Again, these uncertainties are likely to be related to the resolution of SST.  In addition to the influence of air-sea fluxes on the upper ocean temperature, these heat and moisture fluxes directly affect the atmosphere. In particular, the latent heat fluxes (evaporation) could largely contribute to moisture budget changes in the atmosphere during the period of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o and thus air-sea interaction. A recent modeling study demonstrates that the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o could develop without ENSO, and the intrinsic air-sea interaction alone may induce atmospheric cyclonic circulation anomalies and a stronger Leeuwin Current (Kataoka et al., 2018). As the present study suggests the importance of the resolution of SST for the latent heat flux estimates off the west coast of Australia, coupled model simulations using the high-resolution ocean component would be useful to investigate the feedbacks between the atmosphere and ocean that control the development of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "This study investigates the air-sea flux variability off the west coast of Australia using multiple datasets and satellite observations. We found large uncertainties in climatological net surface heat fluxes. The uncertainties result primarily from latent heat flux and shortwave radiation. The possible causes of the uncertainty for latent heat flux are investigated with additional calculations which isolate the effects of wind speed, SST, humidity, and bulk flux algorithm. The results of these calculations suggest that the use of different bulk flux algorithms largely contributes to the uncertainties. The bulk atmospheric variables also significantly contribute to the uncertainties. The role of air-sea fluxes in the development and decay of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o is investigated based on the composite analyses over the life cycle of Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o. Large differences in air-sea flux anomaly fields associated with the Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o between the datasets are evident although they are smaller than the climatology. Large negative air-sea heat flux anomalies (cooling the ocean) in the recovery phase are found in all datasets, and the anomalous latent heat flux is the dominant component. This suggests that the latent heat flux plays an important role in damping the positive SST anomalies during the recovery stage. The composite evolution of surface winds suggests that WES feedback is responsible for the variations of latent heat flux. Since SSTs recover much more slowly than surface winds after the peak of SST warming, large evaporative cooling is favored under the condition of strong winds and warm SST especially during the early stage of the recovery phase. Then the evaporative cooling is reduced as the SST gradually recovers. During the developing phase, however, the contributions of air-sea heat flux have large uncertainties. Sensitivity calculations show that the differences in SST anomaly between the datasets largely contribute to the uncertainties. Large uncertainties around the period of SST peak are partly due to the warmer SST than other periods, since the small errors in SST could generate large latent heat flux changes. Also, SST anomalies are directly related to the strengthening of the Leeuwin Current, and thus the resolution of SST datasets significantly affects the SST anomalies. A case study of the 2010-2011 Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o event demonstrates a close relationship between the SST anomaly and the resolution of the datasets. Southward extension of warm waters transported by the Leeuwin Current can be adequately resolved only by high-resolution SST datasets. As a result, a relatively cold SST and thus smaller evaporative cooling are estimated using the low-resolution SST datasets."}]
