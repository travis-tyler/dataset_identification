[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As one member of the family coronaviride, coronavirus are enveloped with non-segmented positive sense RNA, which are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals(1). Most of the coronavirus are harmless to human, except the beta coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(2, 3) and\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)(4, 5), which lead to numerous lethal respiratory disease cases in the past two decades. In December 2019, a series of unidentified pneumonia disease outbreaks was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. In a subsequent pathogen identification process, 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus) was identified from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of these pneumonia disease patients(6, 7). This virus was identified as the cause of the deadly pneumonia disease in human (7). As of Feb 11, 2020, China has reported more than 42747 confirmed and more than 21675 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infections across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 1017 fatalities. In addition, since 2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus for human, there is no specifically effective drug for the infected patients.\nRecently, Huang et al. reported that one diarrhea case was found in 38 patients with 2019-nCoV infections(8). In addition, some patients with diarrhea were constantly diagnosed in subsequent newly discovered 2019-nCoV infected cases, which indicate that 2019-nCoV may infect people via digestive systems. Although other groups have shown ACE2 expression profile in digestive system and lung by single-cell transcriptomes bioinformatics analysis from external datasets(9, 10)\uff0c unfortunately, most data of these datasets are not from Asian adults. Therefore, to provide more implications of viral transmission in clinical diagnosis and treatment, it's urgent to explore ACE2 expression in the digestive system of Asian people."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "To investigate the ACE2 expression pattern in the gastrointestinal tract of Asian adult samples, we incorporated two public single cell RNA-seq data of colorectal cancer (CRC) cohorts from GEO (GSE97693 and GSE81861) and one cohort from Renji Hospital. We performed single cell analysis on 504 cells from GSE97693, including 485 cell from CRC (primary tumor) and 19 cells from healthy normal control (NC). We observed that ACE2 is expressed in 38.5%(194/504) of all human colon cells. We also observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in tumors when compared with healthy normal tissues (39.6% vs 10.5%, p <0.05) ( Fig. 1 A-C) .\nConsistently, in GSE81861 dataset, ACE2 is expressed in 10.5%(62/590) of all human colon cells. We also observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in colorectal tumors when compared with healthy normal tissues (12.5% vs 7.0%, p < 0.05) (Fig.1D-F) . Those results intrigue us to investigated whether ACE2 is also enriched in precancerous lesion of colorectal tumor, such as colorectal adenoma(CRA). We performed single cell RNA profiling on the tissues from colorectal cancer, colorectal adenoma and healthy normal control from Renji Hospital hospital.\nTotally, 21,686 cells (4784 from CRC, 7130 from CRA and 9772 from NC samples)\nwere collected after single cell RNA-seq quality control ( Fig.2A) . The ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in CRC samples compared with CRA and NC samples (5.15% vs 2.94% and 1.75%, p<0.05) ( Fig.2 B , C). In consistent with previous studies(9, 10), we also observed that ACE2 cell were mainly expressed in epithelial cells which highly express EPCAM (Fig.2D )."}, {"section_title": "Single cell sequencing", "text": "Single cell libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 library and gel bead kit v3 from 10x Genomics.

The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted to anndata objects (version 0.6.22) using the Scanpy package v1.4.4 (pmid: 29409532). We utilized the following procedure to control for data quality: cells with fewer than 200 genes, and genes that are detected in less than 3 cells. Following the quality control procedure, the dataset consisted of 21,686 cells expressing 22,760 genes. The filtered gene expression matrix was normalized using Scanpy's sc.pp.normalize_total function. A single-cell neighborhood graph was computed on the 50 first principal components that sufficiently explain the variation in the data using 15 nearest neighbors. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was run for visualization. Cell types were annotated based on the expression of known marker genes.\nExternal data sources: GSE97693 and GSE81861 were used for bioinformatics analysis. The reads or fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM or FPKM) or transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM) were retrieved from GEO database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In GSE97693 dataset, only TPM data were used for analysis.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457 doi: medRxiv preprint angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), which was known as cell receptor for SARS-CoV (6). In addition, 2019-nCoV is able to enter lots of mammal cells with ACE2 receptor expression, but not cells without ACE2(6). Interestingly, 2019n-CoV just specifically uses ACE2 to infect mammal cells, but not other coronavirus receptor(6). Therefore ACE2 receptor may be the key component for 2019-nCoV to infect human and transmit in the host body.\nIt is reported that ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung and other digestive tract organs in public external databases (9, 10, 18) . However, Asian adult data is rare in these datasets. Here, we firstly proved that ACE2 is expressed in the colon epithelial cells of Chinese adults. Furthermore, ACE2 expression is gradually increased from normal colon epithelium, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients' tissues. Based on the expression of ACE2, colorectal cancer and adenoma patients are more likely to be infected and injured by 2019-nCoV, than healthy people.\nAs an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue (19, 20) , ACE2 is a zinc metallopeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) and\nangiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin (1-7), respectively (21) .In is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023457 doi: medRxiv preprint CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 15.20023457 doi: medRxiv preprint "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system are usually the infection targets of coronavirus in humans and other mammals(11).
