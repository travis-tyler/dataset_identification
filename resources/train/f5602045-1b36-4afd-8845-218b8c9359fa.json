[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common underlying cause of dementia globally, and the leading cause of years lost to disability in high-income countries as well as the second greatest cause of this worldwide according to the World Health Organization. A defi nite diagnosis of AD can only be established by postmortem studies that demon strate the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofi brillary tangles [1] . Th e measurement of the neuropathologic hallmarks of AD, namely tau and amyloid beta (A\u03b2), in cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) has been shown to be a reliable diagnostic biomarker for AD [2] , but it would be attractive to have less invasive AD biomarkers, such as those that can be measured in plasma. Positron emission tomography (PET) using fl orbetapir-F18 (AV-45) or Pittsburgh Compound-B-C11 (PiB) as radiotracers refl ects fi brillar brain amyloid deposits and is deemed a reliable method to measure brain amyloid plaque burden [3, 4] , but cost and availability of PET biomarker measures are drawbacks associated with this diagnostic strategy. Th erefore, the measurement of A\u03b2 in plasma would be the least invasive and most cost-eff ective biomarker assay. In addition, blood samples could readily be obtained in nonspecialized facilities and sent to specialized laboratories to conduct the measurements. However, published results on the correlation of plasma A\u03b2 with the presence of AD are contradictory and plasma A\u03b2 measurements are subject to more sources of variability than CSF A\u03b2 measurements [5] . Below we will summarize the demographic, biological and technical aspects related to A\u03b2 plasma measures, the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in populations with sporadic AD and AD due to autosomal dominant genetic inheritance, and application of these measurements in clinical trials.\nA\u03b2 distribution in blood, CSF and brain\nA\u03b2 is a byproduct of A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) metabo lism that is generated by nearly all cells, and amyloid plaques are the result of the deposition of mainly A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 1-42 in the brain, although other species of A\u03b2 are also present [6] . Th e mechanism leading to A\u03b2 deposition diff ers in subjects for whom this occurs on a genetic basis, leading to familial AD (FAD), versus those who develop sporadic AD. In autosomal dominantly inherited forms of AD, the main mechanism is an increased production of A\u03b2 species [7] , while the consensus is that there is a decreased A\u03b2 clearance in sporadic forms of\nCerebrospinal fl uid and positron emission tomography biomarkers accurately predict an underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology; however, they represent either invasive or expensive diagnostic tools. Therefore, a blood-based biomarker like plasma amyloid beta (A\u03b2) that could correlate with the underlying AD pathology and serve as a prognostic biomarker or an AD screening strategy is urgently needed as a cost-eff ective and non-invasive diagnostic tool. In this paper we review the demographic, biologic, genetic and technical aspects that aff ect plasma A\u03b2 levels. Findings of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of plasma A\u03b2, including autosomal dominant AD cases, sporadic AD cases, Down syndrome cases and population studies, are also discussed. Finally, we review the association between cerebrovascular disease and A\u03b2 plasma levels and the responses observed in clinical trials. Based on our review of the current literature on plasma A\u03b2, we conclude that further clinical research and assay development are needed before measures of plasma A\u03b2 can be interpreted so they can be applied as trait, risk or state biomarkers for AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "AD, which is modulated by the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype [8, 9] .\nTh e blood-brain barrier and the blood-CSF barrier regulate the passage of solutes between blood and the central nervous system (CNS), including A\u03b2. Although there are a number of receptors that are implicated in the infl ux (for example, receptor of advanced glycation end products) and effl ux (for example, low-density lipoprotein receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and 2, P-glycoprotein, low-density and very low-density lipoprotein receptor) of A\u03b2 through the blood-brain barrier, most of the studies that compared plasma A\u03b2 levels with their CSF counterparts [10] [11] [12] [13] or the binding of PET A\u03b2 radiotracers [10, 14] have found no or low correlations between A\u03b2 plasma measurements and CSF A\u03b2 and PET amyloid plaque measurements. On the other hand, CSF and PET values show a high inverse correlation [10, 15, 16] , although CSF ELISA/Luminex assays measure soluble A\u03b2 and PIB/AV-45 PET measure insoluble fi brillar A\u03b2 deposition. However, one study has described a stronger correlation between plasma A\u03b2 and PET PiB measurements [17] ."}, {"section_title": "Origin, distribution and clearance of A\u03b2 in plasma", "text": "Th ere are several factors that can explain the low correlation between plasma and CSF A\u03b2/PET amyloid plaque measurements. First, A\u03b2 species in the CSF and the CNS interstitial fl uid originate in the CNS. CNS A\u03b2 is then thought to diff use from interstitial fl uid into the CSF, while passage of A\u03b2 through the blood-brain barrier is limited. In addition, A\u03b2 in plasma and blood does not originate only in the brain since it also is the product of APP metabolism in skeletal muscle, pancreas, kidney, liver, vascular walls, lung, intestine, skin and several glands and APP can be found in almost all peripheral cells [18] [19] [20] . In addition, most of the A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 in plasma are bound to several proteins (that is, apolipoprotein A-I, A-IV, E and J, \u03b12-macroglobulin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, transthyretin, apoferri tin and serum amyloid P component) and erythrocytes [19, 21] . Finally, platelets are another important source of A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 in plasma [19] and activated platelets release APP and A\u03b2 [22] . Th erefore, it is not surprising that A\u03b2 plasma values may only partially refl ect altered APP metabolism or A\u03b2 in the CNS since there is no evidence that AD is a systemic A\u03b2 amyloidosis. While correlations between undiluted, diluted and cell bound plasma samples have been reported by some investigators to be high, the diagnostic utility of measuring A\u03b2 at diff erent dilutions or in diff erent fractions remains uncertain [23] . Finally, regarding the elimination of plasma A\u03b2, animal models have implicated the liver as the major organ responsible for the clearance of A\u03b2 from plasma [24] , followed by renal clearance [25] ."}, {"section_title": "Demographic, clinical, genetic and technical issues aff ecting A\u03b2 levels and measurements", "text": "Demographic, genetic diagnostic and assay related factors aff ecting A\u03b2 plasma levels Most studies have described a strong association between older age and higher levels of plasma A\u03b2 [10, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Th is association has not been established in Down syndrome (DS) subjects, and there are confl icting results, with some studies fi nding an association [32, 33] and others not [34, 35] . Two studies have evaluated the heritability of A\u03b2 plasma levels. Th e paper by Ertekin-Taner et al. found a higher heritability (54% for A\u03b2 and 73% for A\u03b2 ) [36] than the one by Ibrahim-Verbaas et al. (23% for A\u03b2 and 30% for A\u03b2 ) [37] . None of the studies found that APOE genotype explained a signifi cant amount of the heritability, but the study by Ibrahim-Verbaas et al. found an association between SNPs located at the presenilin 2 gene (PSEN2) and A\u03b2 1-40 levels. However, some studies have reported an association of lower A\u03b2 in the presence of APOE \u03b54 alleles [10, 28, 38] and at least one study has described a lower A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio in non-APOE \u03b54 subjects in the highest tertile of physical activity [39] . A third study found increased A\u03b2 in young, nondemented fi rst-degree relatives of late onset AD compared to unrelated controls [31] . Other factors associated with A\u03b2 plasma levels are creatinine levels [10, 28, 38, 40] , high density lipoproteins [27] , body mass index [27] , race [38] and sex [38, 41] . One study included age, platelet count, total protein concentration and creatinine levels in a multivariate analysis and found that these variables accounted for 12.9% of plasma levels, underscoring the importance of using multivariable models that adjust for possible confounders [10] .

Storage at -20\u00b0C is not suitable for longterm storage and A\u03b2 levels are not stable through freezethaw cycles following storage at -20\u00b0C, whereas storage at -70\u00b0C shows no reductions in A\u03b2 levels for up to three cycles and A\u03b2 levels are stable for at least 12 months when stored at this temperature [42, 45] . One study has reported that some A\u03b2 peptides increase their concentration once frozen [46] . Repeated samples taken during fasting and in the post-prandial state and repeated samples taken from cognitively normal (CN) subjects within three weeks show coeffi cients of variation (CV) that are within the range of the variability of the assay in both cases, indicating that these pre-analytical factors do not have an important eff ect on A\u03b2 measurements [13] . Although not formally tested in plasma, storage in polypropylene tubes currently is the best way to minimize adherence of A\u03b2 to the wall of storage vials compared to polystyrene for CSF samples [47] , and is current practice for plasma samples. Diff erent types of polypropylene are used in the manufacture of biofl uid storage vials, but the eff ects of these diff erences on A\u03b2 levels following shortand long-term storage are not well documented. Finally, collection parameters like collected blood volume and time to freeze have been associated with levels of plasma A\u03b2 [48] and A\u03b2 levels in serum are also less stable than plasma A\u03b2 levels [43] ."}, {"section_title": "Association of A\u03b2 with AD and cerebrovascular disease", "text": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal results in DS individuals and subjects harboring autosomal dominant FAD mutations Th e initial study by Scheuner et al. described increased plasma levels of A\u03b2 in subjects from FAD kindreds with pathogenic mutations in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes when compared to non-mutation bearing controls [49] and Kosaka et al. found increased plasma levels of A\u03b2 1-42 when comparing AD patients carrying the \u03b2APP717 mutation to sporadic AD patients [50] .

A model based on a hypothetical inhibition of \u03b1-secretase by increases in C99 associated with GSI treatment has been proposed in order to explain these changes, but this remains to be proven [72] . Both studies by Siemers et al.

Levels of plasma A\u03b2 increase with aging and some clinical associations may change depending on the age of the selected sample. Th e selection of capture antibodies and analytical platforms can have an important impact on the measured A\u03b2 levels; a wide range of mean A\u03b2 1-40 (214 [15] to 985 pg/ml [40] ) and A\u03b2 1-42 (36 [15] to 140 pg/ml [19] ) levels in AD patients has been reported in diff erent studies and this also is the case for studies of CN subjects. Moreover, even in studies that use the same analytical platform and capture antibodies, there are important diff erences in the measured A\u03b2 levels, which could be attributed to pre-analytical and analytical factors [10, [42] [43] [44] 48] . A recent study showed that automating multiple pipetting steps in a commercially available immunoassay that measures A\u03b2 1-42 and A\u03b2 1-40 provided better precision, thus leading to standardization of reagent dispensing in this test system [48] . Th erefore, standardization eff orts such as this and similar to the ones undertaken in the fi eld of CSF A\u03b2 measurements are needed [47] . Th us, this variability precludes t he possibility of establishing diagnostic or prognostic cut-off s across diff erent studies and populations until these assays are better standardized. Using the profi le of CSF tau and A\u03b2 levels to defi ne groups that have an underlying AD pathology reveals associations between subjects with and without AD-like CSF irrespective of a clinical diagnosis of CN, MCI or AD. Clinical diagnosis in the absence of a neuropathological validation or a CSF A\u03b2 levels/PET plaque load validation may underestimate and confound the diagnostic/prognostic value of plasma A\u03b2 measurements [2] . Cerebrovascular disease, which is a frequent fi nding in aged populations, is another important factor that can aff ect plasma A\u03b2 levels and the prevalence of vascular risk factor and vascular disease varies considerably in the diff erent samples according to the design of the study. While not useful as a diagnostic biomarker as shown by the cross-sectional studies, repeated A\u03b2 plasma measurements in the same individual over time could become useful as a prognostic biomarker. Longitudinal studies favor the 'peripheral sink' hypothesis with a decrease of plasma levels starting in the dementia stage in contrast to an increase of plasma A\u03b2 during the pre-symptomatic stage so that disease stage-specifi c changes later in the course of AD may explain previously described confl icting results. Although the reported diff erences or changes in A\u03b2 plasma levels might not be large enough to predict the longitudinal outcome, it is potentially possible that this biomarker can serve as a prognostic factor or as an endpoint during follow-up of AD patients. However, prospective studies of cohorts with subsequent neuropathology confi rmation of their diagnosis or in concert with data on CSF tau and A\u03b2 levels as well as other biomarker data are needed to establish how to best interpret data on plasma A\u03b2 levels in CN, MCI and AD subjects with and without other comorbid conditions such as cerebrovascular disease."}, {"section_title": "Abbreviations", "text": "A\u03b2, amyloid beta; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ADNI, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; APOE, apolipoprotein E; APP, A\u03b2 precursor protein; AV-45, fl orbetapir-F18; CN, cognitively normal; cnDS, cognitively normal Down syndrome; CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fl uid; CV, coeffi cient of variation; dDS, demented Down syndrome; DS, Down syndrome; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FAD, familial Alzheimer's disease; GSI, \u03b3-secretase inhibitor; GSM, \u03b3-secretase modulator; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; PET, positron emission tomography; PiB, Pittsburgh Compound-B-C11;"}]
