We showed how prognostic information for an individual MCI patient can be extracted from amyloid PET. Reasoning that amyloid PET will always be made after structural neuroimaging, we also constructed a model including both HCV and amyloid PET. In this combined model, amyloid PET has the strongest contribution to prognosis.\nFormer studies have repeatedly demonstrated on a group level that the predictive value of amyloid PET is largely attributable to a high negative predictive value [10, 24, 35, 36] . These former studies cannot directly be translated to the individuals, however, as the interpretation of amyloid PET should take into account the background of a patient's own characteristics. In particular, age is a well-known risk factor for developing AD and is associated with increased amyloid deposition [9, 11, 37] . In the present study, we extended on these former findings as we showed that positive predictive value of amyloid PET appears somewhat stronger in younger and somewhat less strong in older patients, illustrating the value of our individualized prediction model that allows to interpret the amyloid PET in the context of an individual's own characteristics.\nAnother factor that is closely linked to amyloid positivity is the presence of APOE \u03b54. We therefore reasoned that for amyloid PET to be of use, it should add predictive value over APOE \u03b54 positivity. As a result, the demographic model, which also included APOE \u03b54, had rather high performance to start with. Nonetheless, amyloid PET clearly added prognostic value. Excluding APOE \u03b54 from the models did not decrease the prognostic performances, illustrating that amyloid PET can also be safely interpreted without knowledge of APOE \u03b54. This finding is in agreement with those observed in earlier studies and suggests that the predictive effect of APOE \u03b54 is indirect [38] [39] [40] .\nOnly a few former studies investigated the incremental value of MRI and PET biomarkers on predictive accuracy. While some studies showed an increase in predictive accuracy or faster decline in patients with reduced HCV on MRI and a positive amyloid PET [10, 35, 41, 42] , only one study concluded the opposite [43] . In the present study, combining MRI and amyloid PET biomarkers increased prognostic performance compared to a model with either MRI or amyloid PET alone. In a former study, we constructed individualized prognostic models based on MRI and cerebrospinal fluid. This study also showed that biomarkers should best be combined [44] .\nAlthough amyloid PET has been approved for diagnostic use, it is currently not part of standard diagnostic assessment. Outside specialized centers, amyloid PET is only limitedly available, making its clinical availability less than that of amyloid measured in cerebrospinal fluid. In this light, the current models with PET biomarkers may be valuable outside the clinic, for example, to select patients for trial enrollment.\nBut the fact that amyloid PET did not find its way to clinical practice may also be due to the lack of information on how to implement amyloid PET and what test results mean for an individual patient. As the field is shifting toward a biological definition of Alzheimer's disease, in which evidence of amyloid is the key player, the need for information on how to implement amyloid PET becomes more pressing. To pave the way for effective and efficient implementation of amyloid PET, the present study is of high importance. The recent IDEAS paper showed that amyloid greatly impacts patient management [16] , and we add to this by showing that amyloid PET in MCI patients has prognostic value. Moreover, our models allow a clinician to appreciate how a positive or negative result could contribute to the probability estimation, depending on the specific constellation of other (demographic) variables. Such models have very practical value; they can be used to interpret the results of diagnostic tests already performed.\nIt is also conceivable that a clinician would use the models before actually ordering the diagnostic test. This might be even a more realistic scenario, as amyloid PET is not part of standard diagnostic assessment. Best case/worst case scenarios could be calculated to appreciate the added value of amyloid PET in comparison with MRI only. In this light, the models would serve as a decision modeling tool, which could even promote shared decision making and could help to manage expectations of the outcome of the test. With the new biological definition of AD, it would also be interesting to see how the positive or negative result of an amyloid PET impacts clinical prognosis in cognitively normal individuals, for example, with subjective cognitive decline.\nA recent review shows that only few studies have addressed potential risks of disclosure to nondemented memory clinic patients [45] . The most important argument against the disclosure of results was theoretical of nature and focused on the principle of \"do no harm\" [45, 46] . Nonetheless, based on the few available empirical studies, disclosure of both positive and negative PET results had low risk of psychological harm [8, [46] [47] [48] . On the other hand, important arguments in favor of disclosure are the autonomy of a patient and that it enhances future decision making. Moreover, patients and caregivers become more and more assertive in their need for information. Many, but not all, patients and caregivers who are referred to a memory clinic want information on the likely course of their disease [48, 49] . Therefore, it is of importance that before embarking on testing, realistic expectations are set with regard to how the results of the test can help to determine the patients' need to learn more about the cause of their complaints, how certain the prognosis will become/how uncertain it will remain after testing, and how the results could affect clinical management [50] .\nBy definition, predictions are estimates and as a result, have a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, giving a range in which the prediction falls would be more appropriate than only a point estimate. It is not customary to accompany predictions with CIs, yet intervals allow researchers and clinicians to easily assess the precision of the prediction. For that reason, our model provides CIs as well. Owing to the strong negative predictive value of amyloid PET, the low risks have small CIs which illustrate that these risks can be estimated accurately. On the contrary, higher risks widen the CIs and show less secure estimates of progression, requiring a more cautious interpretation. How to communicate these uncertainties with patients and their caregivers is subject of current research in the Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in daily practiceproject.\nOne of the limitations is that ADNI represents a trial population, including primarily amnestic MCI patients, rather than a clinical heterogeneous sample of MCI patients. Constructing models for amyloid PET in ADNI might result in an overestimating of the effect of amyloid PET. Therefore, we validated the prognostic models in an external cohort. In the ADC, the models containing HCV performed less, whereas models based on PET performed comparably well (i.e., no overestimation). The ADC cohort is rather young, which may have led to a somewhat lower performance of the MRI model, yet again showing the added value of amyloid PET in this younger population. In addition, the validation sample is rather small, resulting in an underrepresentation of amyloid PET positivity in stable MCI patients. Moreover, a variety of different tracers was used in the ADC, and the ADC used visual rating to interpret the PET imaging data. Despite the use of different techniques, the prognostic model still performed reasonably well in the ADC, confirming external generalizability. Nonetheless, the models deserve further validation in larger and different datasets.\nCurrent guidelines and expert opinions report that amyloid PET alone cannot predict the trajectory of progression for an individual patient [7, 50] . Furthermore, these guidelines underline the meaning of an amyloid PET result should be interpreted in the context of a patient's entire clinical assessment, without actually detailing how that should be done. Our present study addresses this ardent clinical need. Of note, we show that even when taking patient characteristics and clinical assessment into account, amyloid PET clearly is the key player in prognostic models helping patients to understand what they can expect of the future. Our models are easy to use, and we provide a calculator upon request. We intend these models to serve as input for a web-based tool to support clinicians in integrating biomarkers in their daily clinical practice. The present study takes the first steps toward precision medicine based on amyloid PET."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank S.
