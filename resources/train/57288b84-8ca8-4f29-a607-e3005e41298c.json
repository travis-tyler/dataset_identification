[{"section_title": "", "text": "To select for SARS-CoV-2 S variants that escape neutralization, we used VSV-SARS-S. Antibody neutralization resistant mutants were recovered by plaque isolation (Fig 1A) , and 114 their resistance was verified by subsequent virus infection in the presence or absence of 115 antibody. Antibody 2B04 failed to inhibit VSV-SARS-CoV-2 resistant variants as judged by 116 plaque number and size (Fig 1B) . Sequence analysis identified the mutations E484A, E484K, 117 and F486S (Fig 1B) , each of which fall within the RBD and map to residues involved in ACE2 118 binding (Lan et al., 2020) (Fig 2) . We extended this neutralization escape approach to nine additional inhibitory mAbs (Fig   120   S1 , S2 and Fig 1C) . Sequence analysis of each isolated plaque identified multiple mutations 121 within the RBD (Table S1) as we isolated this mutation alone, and acquisition of the L517R substitution appeared to 146 enhance infectivity as judged by plaque morphology (Fig S2) . For SARS2-19, S477N was 147 isolated as a single variant suggesting that this substitution arose first, however acquisition of 148 the S514F did not alter plaque morphology (Fig S2) . As the L517R or S514F substitutions were 149 not identified in isolation, it remains unclear whether they cause resistance to 2H04 or SARS2-150 19 respectively. Collectively, these results show that escape mutational profiling can identify key 151 epitopes and dominant antigenic sites. 152 Escape mutants confer cross-resistance to multiple mAbs. We next evaluated whether individual mutants could escape neutralization by the other 154 inhibitory mAbs in the panel. We tested the 29 identified escape mutants for neutralization by 155 ten different mAbs. We defined the degree of resistance as a percentage by expressing the 156 number of plaques formed by each mutant in the presence or absence of antibody. We plotted residues at which multiple alternate amino acids with different side chains were selected, each 162 particular substitution was associated with a unique resistance profile. For  Soluble human ACE2-Fc receptor decoy inhibition of escape mutants. recombinant ACE2 to inhibit infection of each variant. We incubated each VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses expressing the wild-type S protein, the escape mutants were inhibited by 191 hACE2-Fc but not mACE2-Fc. However, the extent of neutralization by hACE2-Fc varied 192 substantially (Fig 3B) , with some mutants more sensitive to receptor inhibition and others 193 exhibiting relative resistance. Substitutions at residues R346, A352, N450, S477, S494 and 194 P499 were more sensitive to inhibition by soluble hACE2 than the wild-type S as evidenced by 195 reduced IC 50 values (Fig 3B) and leftward shifts of the inhibition curves (Fig S4) . This effect was 196 substitution-dependent, as N450K was 6-fold more sensitive to hACE2 than N450Y (P < 0.001).  Escape mutants exhibit resistance to neutralization by polyclonal human immune sera. We previously evaluated the ability of convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected 210 humans to neutralize VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and defined a strong correlation with inhibition of a recovered from COVID-19 against our panel of escape mutants (Fig 4D) . All four sera 214 neutralized infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S displaying the wild-type S protein as we previously highest concentration (1:80 initial dilution) of sera tested. All four of the substitutions at residue 217 E484 were resistant to each of the four sera, suggesting that this is part of a dominant 218 neutralizing epitope. Indeed, change at E484 was the only position that led to escape from sera 219 29 (Fig 4A-B, and S5A ). Four other substitutions (K444E, G446V, L452R and F490S) resulted 220 in resistance to neutralization of sera 13, 35 and 37 (Fig 4A and S5A ). Substitutions N450D 221 and N450Y but not N450K were resistant to sera 13 and 35. Sera 13 and 35 also did not 222 efficiently neutralize S477G, L441R, and T478I. All four sera neutralized the single substitution 223 S477N as well as wild-type virus (Fig 4A-B) . Substitution S477N was sensitive to neutralization 224 by sera 13 and 35 except in the presence of a second S514F substitution (Fig 4A and S5A ). Additional amino acid substitutions that conferred resistance to serum 13 include T345S and 226 G446D. Substitution F486S, which altered sensitivity to soluble ACE2, escaped neutralization 227 by serum 35 but not 13, 29 or 37. We consistently noticed that some sera also led to an 228 increase in infectivity of specific escape mutants (e.g., E484A) at some concentrations (Fig 4B) . The significance of this increase is unclear, but was observed consistently across sera for 230 several mutants (Fig S5A) . To extend these findings, we employed a higher throughput screening assay to test 16 232 additional human sera (11, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 39) for their 233 ability to neutralize the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants N450Y, S477N, E484A, E484D and E484K 234 (Fig 4D) . Although we observed neutralization of the various mutants at the highest 235 concentrations of human sera tested (1:10), VSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants with substitutions at 236 residues 484 were consistently less sensitive to neutralization by all sera (Fig 4C and S5B) . bind neutralizing antibodies is limited in some humans. We again observed the increase in 240 infectivity of substitutions at residue E484 in the presence of multiple human sera (Fig S5B) . Comparison of escape mutants with S sequence variants isolated in humans. To broaden our analysis, we performed a second campaign of escape mutant selection 243 using nine additional neutralizing mAbs generated against the RBD (Fig 5, S6 , S7 and Table   244 S1). This effort generated 19 additional escape mutants, bringing the total to 48. To determine 245 whether any of the 48 escape mutants we isolated represent S protein variants circulating in 246 humans, we compiled all publically available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Using 247 323,183 genomes from GISAID, we calculated the substitution frequencies throughout RBD 248 protein (Fig 6A) and mapped the identified residues onto RBD structure (Fig 6B) .  To examine whether mutations resistant to antibody combinations could be isolated, we 260 undertook a third selection campaign using a combination of 2B04 and 2H04. We were unable 261 to isolate mutants resistant to the two antibodies when added concurrently. However, using the mutant E484K, we isolated R346K, A372T and K444E; and for mutant F486S we selected 266 T345S. Two of the mutants (R346K and A372T) were not seen in our prior selection campaigns 267 with 2H04 alone, although both variants exist in human isolates (Fig 6) . Taken  Among the escape variants we selected, there were several that altered susceptibility to 359 neutralization by soluble ACE2. Substitution F486S was particularly notable, as we were unable 360 to attain 50% neutralization at the highest concentrations of soluble hACE2 tested (>20 \u00b5g/ml). The finding of an antibody escape mutant mapping to a critical residue within the ACE2 binding  Plaque assays. Plaque assays were performed on Vero and Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells. Briefly, cells were seeded into 6 or 12 well plates for overnight. Virus was serially diluted using 546 DMEM and cells were infected at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were cultured with an agarose overlay in 547 the presence of Ab or absence of Ab at 34\u00b0C for 2 days. Plates were scanned on a biomolecular  Images were acquired using an InCell 6500 confocal imager (Cytiva) to visualize nuclei and 589 infected cells (4X objective, 1 field per well). Images were segmented using InCarta (Cytiva). Virally-infected cells were identified by comparing to the uninfected threshold in Spotfire (Tibco). Cells were also quality-controlled (gated) based on nuclear parameters. "}]
