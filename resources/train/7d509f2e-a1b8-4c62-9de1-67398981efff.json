[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Two alleles in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene polymorphisms have been disputably linked to enhanced cognition and decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD): the V and A alleles of I405V and C-629A. This study investigates whether these polymorphisms affect brain structure in 188 elderly controls and 318 AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Nominally signficant associations were dependent on APOE \u03b54 carrier status. In APOE \u03b54 carriers, the V and A alleles, both of which decrease CETP and increase HDL, associated with greater baseline cortical thickness and less 12-month atrophy in the medial temporal lobe. Conversely, in APOE \u03b54 non-carriers, the I allele, which increases CETP and decreases HDL, associated with greater baseline thickness, less atrophy and lower risk of dementia. These results suggest CETP may contribute to the genetic variability of brain structure and dementia susceptibility in an APOE-dependent manner."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The role of genetics in brain development and disease susceptibility has recently gained insight from the field of neuroimaging genetics, in which phenotypes are defined by quantitative measures of brain structure or function rather than clinical characteristics such as disease, symptoms or behavior. Association analyses between genetic data and information obtained from structural and functional neuroimaging provide a more direct assessment of genetic influence at the level of neuronal circuitry than other traditional analyses, which only indirectly assess the impact of genes on complex behaviors or cognitive states (Mattay et al. 2008) . Thus, the use of imaging measures may provide a closer description of underlying pathology (Saykin et al. 2010 ) and therefore render association analyses less susceptible to non-genetic variability. Accordingly, neuroimaging genetics may have the potential to examine the biologic impact of genes with greater precision and accuracy than traditional genetic association analyses by examining atrophy as a possible link between genes and behavioral deficits (Stein et al. 2010 ).\nIn particular, structural neuroimaging has considerable potential to address whether specific genes may affect brain structure during development or pathological processes. One such gene of interest is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene, which is located on chromosome 16q21 and contains 14 exons (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007) . CETP is involved in the transfer of insoluble cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins as part of the reverse cholesterol transport system and is known to be synthesized and secreted in the brain (Albers et al. 1992) . It has been speculated that CETP may play a role in cholesterol transport within the brain (Albers et al. 1992) , perhaps by promoting neuronal uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles via interactions with receptors for apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is the most common genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) . Several studies have shown that cholesterol metabolism is indeed altered in AD (Kivipelto et al. 2001; Pregelj 2008) , providing a biologically plausible role for CETP in AD susceptibility (Barzilai et al. 2003 (Barzilai et al. , 2006 Sanders et al. 2010) .\nCETP has been previously implicated in metabolic syndrome, a conglomeration of metabolic risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension and altered glucose metabolism, which increases in prevalence with age. Variations in the CETP gene lead to altered CETP serum concentration and activity and subsequent changes in HDL levels and lipoprotein particle sizes (Thompson et al. 2003) . Specifically, CETP deficiency is characterized by decreased CETP mass and activity and increased HDL and lipoprotein size (Qureischie et al. 2008) . Two functional CETP polymorphisms associated with CETP deficiency have been controversially implicated as protecting against cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility: the A allele of promoter polymorphism C-629A (rs1800775) and the V allele of the amino acid exchange polymorphism I405V in exon 14 (rs5882). Three studies have reported that I405V VV genotype was associated with increased cognitive function and decreased risk of dementia (Barzilai et al. 2003 (Barzilai et al. , 2006 Sanders et al. 2010) , although these effects have not been replicated in other studies (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2007; Qureischie et al. 2009; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) . Likewise, one study reported a decreased risk of AD associated with C-629A AA genotype (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) , but this has been contradicted by others (Qureischie et al. 2008 (Qureischie et al. , 2009 .\nInconsistent findings involving these two polymorphisms may be due to a variety of factors, including discrepancies in the age and ethnic composition of study samples, or the possibility that these polymorphisms are merely surrogates for another polymorphism that acts as the true causal variant for modulating disease susceptibility. Further, it is possible that the associations found were due to chance alone. However, the inability to replicate findings may also be due to imprecision of the phenotype when defined by neuropsychological measures or clinical disease status. To address this concern, we examined the effect of the CETP C-629A and I405V polymorphisms on structural brain measures in 188 healthy elderly controls and 318 subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To reduce the number of statistical comparisons, the analysis was restricted to the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex, three brain regions in which structural change is considered to be a sensitive indicator of memory impairment and early pathological processes occurring in AD (Braak and Braak 1991; Dickerson et al. 2009; Jack et al. 1997; McEvoy et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Raw data used in this paper were obtained from the ADNI public database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). ADNI is a multi-site, five-year observational study of elderly individuals started in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations. Elderly controls, subjects with MCI and AD subjects underwent longitudinal MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment at specified intervals for 2 to 3 years.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D. at the VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result of the efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. For more information, see www.adni-info.org.\nStandard protocol approvals, enrollment and patient consents ADNI was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, US 21CFR Part 50-Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56-Institutional Review Boards, and pursuant to state and federal HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent for the study was obtained from all subjects and/or authorized representatives and study partners (http://www.ADNI-info.org).\nSubjects ADNI eligibility criteria are described at http://adni-info. org. In general, all enrolled subjects were between 55 and 90 (inclusive) years of age, had a study partner available to provide an independent evaluation of functioning, and spoke either English or Spanish. A total of 188 healthy controls (HC), 327 subjects with MCI, and 149 AD subjects were included in this study based on their availability of genetic data and baseline MRI data that passed local quality control. One-hundred and nine ADNI subjects were excluded on account of missing data or failure of imaging data to pass local quality control.\nTo increase the power of analysis, subjects with MCI and AD were treated as a single diagnostic group after selecting only the 169 MCI subjects who were classified as most at risk for imminent conversion to AD based on their AD-like pattern of regional atrophy, as described in McEvoy et al. (2009) . Briefly, stepwise linear discriminant analysis was used to identify eight cortical and subcortical regions to best aid discrimination of HC and AD subjects. A classifier trained on data from HC and AD subjects was applied to data from all 327 MCI subjects to determine whether they had patterns of regional atrophy characteristic of mild AD. The discrimination analysis correctly classified 92% of HC subjects and 86% of AD subjects, which is comparable to the clinical diagnostic accuracy of AD (Gearing et al. 1995; Mok et al. 2004; Schneider et al. 2007 ). The discriminant model was predictive of the rate of clinical decline and progression of MCI patients to an AD diagnosis. Further, the rates of cognitive decline in these prodromal AD patients were in line with those of AD patients in ADNI (McEvoy et al. 2009 ).\nDemographics of the 188 HC, and 318 MCI and AD subjects are described in Table 1 . Of the 506 total subjects, 420 had 12-month follow-up imaging data that passed local quality control and were thus included in the longitudinal analysis.\nGenotyping DNA was extracted from blood and genotyped with the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. Since the Illumina chip does not include the APOE alleles, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) did a separate DNA extraction from blood samples, and APOE genotyping was done via PCR amplification and HhaI restriction enzyme digestion (Potkin et al. 2009 ). Smartpca was used to identify ADNI subjects who were outliers relative to the genetic cluster of ADNI subjects who self-reported their race as exclusively \"White,\" and one subject who reported \"More than one race\" (Joyner et al. 2009 ). Fifty-three genetic outliers were identified. These and 30 subjects with missing genetic data were excluded from the study and, therefore, are not included in the total subjects enumerated above."}, {"section_title": "MR acquisition and analysis", "text": "Two three-dimensional, T1-weighted volumes per subject per visit were downloaded from the public ADNI database (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). All image processing and analyses occurred at the Multimodal Imaging Laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. Images were corrected for gradient nonlinearities (Jovicich et al. 2006 ) and B1 field inhomogeneity (Sled et al. 1998 ). The two baseline images were rigid-body aligned, averaged to improve signalto-noise ratio and resampled to isotropic 1-mm voxels. An automated segmentation procedure based on FeeSurfer software (Fischl et al. 2002) and customized Matlab code was used to obtain volumetric segmentation. Cortical surface reconstruction yielded a measure of thickness at each vertex, and the surface was parceled into distinct regions of interest (ROIs) (Dale and Sereno 1993; Dale et al. 1999; Fischl et al. 1999 Fischl et al. , 2004 .\nThe methods to obtain 12-month change are described in detail in Holland et al. (2009) . Briefly, follow-up images were fully affine-registered to the baseline images and corrected for intensity nonuniformity. Nonlinear registration was then used to align voxel centers in the baseline with the appropriate location in the follow-up scans, and a volumechange field was calculated. This field was averaged over each ROI to compute the percentage change from baseline. This method has been validated using models where amount of change was known and where noise was added to approximate that seen in human brain imaging of demented patients. In these studies, technical measurement error for the computed change in volume was within 0.2% of the structure volume. That is, for a 6,000 mm 3 hippocampal volume undergoing a change of 1%, the technical measurement error in estimating the 60 mm 3 volumetric change would be \u00b112 mm 3 in an individual subject if voxels were each 1 mm isotropic (Murphy et al. 2010) .\nThe methods to visualize CETP by APOE interactions at each vertex on the cortical surface are described in detail in Joyner et al. (2009) . Briefly, the cortical surface was reconstructed to measure thickness at each vertex. Continuous Data are given as mean\u00b1SD unless otherwise specified as a percent. *The MCI and AD subjects had a significantly lower level of education (p =.005), higher frequency of the APOE \u03b54 allele (p<.001) and significantly more impaired MMSE (p<.001) and ADAS-cog (p<.001) scores at baseline than the healthy controls maps of cortical surface area were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel and mapped onto a standardized spherical atlas space. Association of cortical thickness and CETP by APOE interactions was assessed at each surface vertex after controlling for the effects of age, sex and diagnosis, and the strength of association was mapped as negative log p-values."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "All statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics 18. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies were compared using \u03c7 2 -statistics. Genotype was modeled as minor allele SNP-dosage (homozygote of minor allele=2, heterozygote = 1, homozygote of major allele = 0) and separated into two regressor variables to account for sexspecific effects. Thus, genotype was modeled as dosage of the A allele at C-629A and the V allele at I405V. Sex was additionally included as a covariate in regression analyses to ensure that males and females homozygous for major alleles would not be equivalent in the overall model.\nTo examine the relationship between CETP genotype and diagnosis, binary logistic regression analysis was used with age, sex and APOE \u03b54 carrier status as covariates. Independent-sample t-tests were used to compare the effects of specific genotypes on diagnosis. To study the association between genotype and brain structure, standardized morphometric measures were entered as dependent variables into linear regression models. Morphometric measures were standardized by converting raw values to standardized residuals in a linear regression model built upon data from only the HC subjects. Cortical thickness measures were standardized with respect to age and sex. Subcortical volumes were standardized with respect to age, sex and intracranial volume. Likewise, longitudinal morphometric measures were entered as dependent variables into linear regression models to determine whether genotype influenced atrophy. These analyses were also performed with stratification for APOE \u03b54 carrier status to determine whether the effects were dependent on genotype at this locus. Given the imaging and genetic data currently available, we conducted a restricted exploratory analysis without correction for multiple comparisons. The two-sided significance level was set at \u03b1=.05 for all regression models, each of which was repeated for two CETP polymorphisms and nine subject groups to demonstrate the effect of these polymorphisms on every possible combination of subject diagnosis and APOE \u03b54 carrier status.\nTo determine whether the aging process had different effects on brain structure and atrophy depending upon genotype at the two CETP polymorphisms, a univariate General Linear Model factor by covariate analysis of variance was used. Genotype was a grouping factor and genotype*age, age, sex, diagnosis and APOE \u03b54 carrier status were covariates. In this analysis, cortical thickness measures were standardized with respect to sex, and subcortical volumes with respect to sex and intracranial volume, but no measures were adjusted for age.

This study is the first to detect APOE-specific associations between the I405V and C-629A polymorphisms and brain structure, and to relate these findings to longitudinal change in brain structure with aging. In APOE \u03b54 non-carriers, the I allele of the I405V polymorphism, which leads to increased CETP and decreased HDL, was associated with larger medial temporal lobe structures at baseline, less 12-month atrophy in these structures, and lower risk of MCI and AD. This relationship was reversed in APOE \u03b54 carriers, in whom the V allele of I405V and the A allele of C-629A, both of which lower CETP and raise HDL, were found to be protective. Although the primary ROI analysis was restricted to three medial temporal structures selected a priori, a cortical surface analysis revealed the greatest effects of these polymorphisms were indeed found in the medial temporal lobe, and specifically in the parahippocampal gyrus.\nThe results suggest that these CETP polymorphisms may modify brain structure and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility in a manner dependent upon APOE. I405V genotype influenced the risk of MCI and AD in this study sample only in non-carriers of APOE \u03b54, and the protective allele relationships reversed in carriers and non-carriers of APOE \u03b54. Two prior studies found the effects of these polymorphisms on the risk of AD to be similarly dependent upon APOE. One study of 286 AD subjects found that risk of AD was lower in carriers of APOE \u03b54 with the C-629A Table 4 Proposed model of CETP effects on MCI/AD risk, baseline volumes and one-year atrophy in medial temporal lobe structures Alleles conferring low CETP and high HDL (V at I405V and A at C-629A) appear to be protective in APOE \u03b54 carriers, whereas alleles conferring high CETP and low HDL (I at I405V and C at C-629A) appear protective in non-carriers (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) , and another study of 544 AD subjects reported that risk of AD was higher in non-carriers of APOE \u03b54 with the I405V VV genotype (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007 ), analogous to the present finding that the I allele was protective in non-carriers. The finding of alleles that lower CETP levels being protective in APOE \u03b54 carriers is further supported by a study of 107 AD subjects in which another CETP polymorphism, D442G, was associated with lower levels of CETP and decreased risk of AD in APOE \u03b54 carriers (Chen et al. 2008) . It has been demonstrated that protein-protein interactions occur between CETP and APOE due to their joint participation in cholesterol metabolism (Sorl\u00ed et al. 2006) . CETP-immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in astrocytes from AD brain tissue, a cell known to produce APOE (Yamada et al. 1995) , and a physiological cooperation between CETP and APOE has been established in cholesterol ester transport in plasma (Marcel et al. 1990 ). Thus, it is reasonable that the influence of CETP on brain cholesterol metabolism and structure might be modulated by APOE activity within the brain, and that a dysfunction in cholesterol metabolism involving both proteins may play a central role in the AD pathology (Yamada et al. 1995) .\nThe APOE-dependent reversal of the protective allele relationship observed in this study might be explained by such interactions between CETP and APOE. For example, it has been proposed that CETP may modify the risk of AD by altering HDL concentration in the brain, whereas the amount of HDL generated varies with APOE isoform (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) . CETP is believed to promote neuronal uptake of HDL particles via interactions with APOE receptors (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) . Indeed, gene-gene interactions between APOE and CETP have been shown to influence HDL concentrations (Sorl\u00ed et al. 2006) , and it is known that HDL particles interact with amyloid beta to inhibit its aggregation into fibrils (Olesen and Dago 2000) .\nThe results further suggest that these two polymorphisms have a differential degree of influence on brain structure in males and females. Although both males and females were affected by these polymorphisms in a similar manner, the majority of associations between genotype and brain structure were found in females. This may be due to sexrelated differences in cholesterol metabolism (De Gennes et al. 1983) or due to underlying structural differences in the male and female brains imposed by distinct hormonal or genetic expression environments during the time of development (Negri-Cesi et al. 2004) .\nIn APOE \u03b54 non-carriers, risk of MCI and AD increased with carriage of V at I405V. Since the V allele corresponds to lower levels of CETP and subsequently higher levels of HDL (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007 ), this suggests that low CETP and high HDL may actually increase the risk of AD in non-carriers. One mechanism for this increased risk proposed by Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. (2007) is that low CETP levels lead to a reduction in neuronal repair. Other studies have found that variations in I405V had no effect on cognitive function in 525 subjects who participated in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 (Johnson et al. 2007 ) and did not influence the risk of vascular dementia in 163 subjects (Qureischie et al. 2009 ). Two additional studies reported no difference in distribution of allele and genotype frequencies for I405V between AD subjects and elderly controls (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) ; however, after segregating by APOE \u03b54 status, VV homozygosity was more frequent in AD non-carriers than in elderly control non-carriers (Arias-V\u00e1squez et al. 2007 ), similar to the present findings.\nA recent prospective cohort study by Sanders et al. 2010 , followed 523 mixed-ethnicity subjects aged 70 years or older over a time period during which 40 subjects developed dementia. This group reported that the I405V VV genotype was associated with slower age-associated memory decline and lower risk of incident dementia and AD. Further, the hazard ratio of dementia for IV heterozygotes was between that for II and VV homozygotes, suggesting a possible gene-dose relationship (Sanders et al. 2010 ). This finding supported two previous studies in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that found the VV genotype to be more prevalent in 158 subjects with exceptional longevity (aged\u226595 years) and to be associated with better cognitive function in these subjects (Barzilai et al. 2003 (Barzilai et al. , 2006 , although the specific ethnic composition of these studies limit their generalizability. Further, the fact that these studies adjusted for APOE \u03b54 status rather than stratifying by this allele makes their findings difficult to compare with those of the present study.\nThe effect of variations in C-629A on cognition and disease susceptibility is similarly unclear. One group found that AA homozygotes had a significantly decreased risk of AD associated with carriage of the APOE \u03b54 allele (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) , consistent with the present findings. Another group studying 388 AD subjects found no influence of C-629A on risk of AD in either carriers or non-carriers of APOE \u03b54 (Qureischie et al. 2008 ) but later reported increased risk of vascular dementia in AA homozygotes who were APOE \u03b54 non-carriers (Qureischie et al. 2009 ).\nThe discrepancies between prior research and the present study may be due to myriad factors, including variation in the age and ethnic compositions of study samples. One characteristic to note in this study sample is the high rate of APOE \u03b54 carriers among MCI and AD subjects as compared to rates reported among other study samples (Crean et al. 2011) , which is a difference that may limit the generalizability of these findings. Additionally, the discrepancies between prior research and the present study may reflect the limitation of examining polymorphisms in the CETP gene whose functional consequences are uncertain (Qureischie et al. 2008) . For example, it is possible that the I405V polymorphism is a surrogate for another polymorphism that acts as the true causal variant for modulating brain structure and disease susceptibility; I405V may be a better surrogate for this true variant in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, which would be expected to have wider linkage disequilibrium blocks than in the ADNI study sample. Variable findings in prior research may also reflect the difficulty in trying to evaluate the genetic contribution of a single polymorphism to a heterogenous disorder such as AD, which is likely impacted by the interaction of multiple genes, proteins and non-genetic factors. That the apparent heritability of late-onset AD is seemingly unexplained by the known contributions of APOE and other well-replicated genes (e.g., presenilin-1, presenilin-2, APP) (Seshadri et al. 2010 ) suggests the likelihood that many genes contribute to AD susceptibility to a lesser degree. Additionally, this study suggests the importance of accounting for interactions with APOE, as failure to do so may produce inconsistent findings.\nA limitation of this study is its inability to elucidate whether genetic variation in CETP modulates brain structure at the time of development, during aging, or solely in the context of disease. However, the regional specificity of findings suggests that CETP may influence susceptibility to AD given that these polymorphisms are associated with cortical thickness in the parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex, regions particularly damaged in AD (Braak and Braak 1991) . Further, the significant I405V genotype by age interaction in females, independent of disease status, was also seen in the parahippocampal gyrus. This could suggest that these age-related effects might still be related to AD pathology, including pathology present in healthy controls.\nAlthough a sample size of 188 elderly controls and 318 AD or MCI subjects may seem inadequate to identify a genetic risk factor for atrophy and disease susceptibility, the ADNI dataset is currently the largest dataset with complete genetic and imaging information available for such an analysis. Prior studies found similar effects using comparably sized, and even smaller (Chen et al. 2008) , samples. Given the data currently available, this study was limited to a restricted exploratory analysis for subtle effects using relaxed correction for multiple comparisons. To reduce the need to correct for multiple comparisons across all brain regions and genetic variants, the study examined an a priori selection of targeted brain regions involved in Alzheimer's disease (Braak and Braak 1991; Dickerson et al. 2009; Jack et al. 1997; McEvoy et al. 2009 )and targeted genetic variants based on extant evidence of their involvement in aging and neurodegeneration (Barzilai et al. 2003 (Barzilai et al. , 2006 Sanders et al. 2010; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2006) . No doubt, the future will bring wider access to even larger datasets with complete genetic and imaging information in order to independently replicate our results. These results build on evidence of an interaction between APOE, cholesterol metabolism, and neurodegeneration with aging and AD and indicate the need for future studies examining this interplay."}]
