[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in the general population and has been associated with an increased risk for symptomatic CAD. Although the diagnosis of asymptomatic CAD is currently dependent on exercise testing and coronary angiography, other vascular diagnostic techniques could potentially be of aid in the assessment. Increased intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery as assessed by B-mode ultrasonography is a purported index of atherosclerosis, and is associated with symptomatic CAD. Based on a recent report, this article will focus on the relationship between IMT and asymptomatic CAD as evidenced by exercise ECG, and in combination with exercise thallium scintigraphy. It was found that exercise-induced ST segment depression was associated with increased IMT independent of age, coronary risk factors and manifest CAD. After adjustment for age, IMT progressively increased from healthy subjects to asymptomatic subjects with positive exercise ECG alone, to those with concordant positive ECG and thallium scintigraphic findings who had IMT virtually identical to that in subjects with manifest CAD. Each 0.1 mm increase in IMT was associated with a 1.91-fold (95% CI 1.46-2.50) increased risk for concordant positive exercise tests or manifest CAD, independent of other coronary risk factors. These findings and the review of the literature suggest the potential utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying asymptomatic individuals at higher risk for CAD."}, {"section_title": "Asymptomatic coronary artery disease in the general population", "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of deaths in the USA. In addition to deaths due to symptomatic CAD, about 50 000 of 250 000 sudden death victims per year in the USA have no history of heart disease, yet have evidence of advanced coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial scars at autopsy.\n1 This finding suggests the potential impact of asymptomatic CAD as a cause of sudden death. Efforts have been devoted to detecting asymptomatic CAD in the general population, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] where the prevalence has varied from 0.5% 2 to 10% 3 depending on the age of the population and the diagnostic criteria. The large difference in prevalence would likely reflect the difficulty in detecting CAD in totally asymptomatic subjects.\nAsymptomatic CAD frequently progresses to symptomatic CAD or leads to cardiac death. [7] [8] [9] For example, the Oslo Ischemia Study followed 50 asymptomatic men with angiographically proven CAD for 15 years, among whom 33 subjects developed cardiac events -including 14 cardiac deaths. 9 Thus, early identification and preventive treatment First Department of Medicine, Osaka University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan and a Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Gerontology Research Center, Baltimore, MD, USA could potentially lower the risk for the subsequent development of symptomatic CAD and cardiac death.

Numerous studies have shown that an ischemic ST segment response to exercise is a risk factor for future cardiac events in apparently healthy adults. 7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Giagnoni et al have shown that asymptomatic ST segment depression is associated with more than five times increased risk for developing cardiac events in a 10-year follow-up period, 10 while Josephson et al in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) 16 found it to be associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk over 7.4 years of follow-up.\n14 Furthermore, the Lipid Research Clinics Mortality Follow-up Study has shown that the asymptomatic ST segment depression is associated with a 4.6 times increased risk for cardiac death over 8.1 years. 15 Despite the established utility of exercise ECG in the risk assessment of asymptomatic CAD, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of an ischemic ST segment response are not high in populations with a low prevalence of CAD. In a pooled series of 10 studies comprising over 17 000 subjects, only 21% of asymptomatic individuals with ischemic ECG response subsequently developed cardiac events over an average of 7 years. 17 In the BLSA, Fleg et al found a sensitivity of 0.40 and a positive predictive value of 0.24 for future events in asymptomatic volunteers during 4.6 years of follow-up. 7 Furthermore, Josephson et al found that the conversion from a normal to an abnormal exercise ECG is not a more specific marker for the future events than an initially abnormal ECG. 14 Exercise thallium scintigraphy is another method to detect asymptomatic CAD, and is often used to refine the exercise ECG findings. Predictability for the presence of CAD or for future coronary events is improved when subjects are further stratified by a combined use of this method. [18] [19] [20] Melin et al have shown a high predictive value of concordant positive ECG and thallium tests in detecting coronary stenosis, even in a population with a low prevalence of CAD. 18 Similarly, Fleg et al showed that the combined use of the two tests doubled the predictive value of a positive exercise ECG in totally asymptomatic subjects: i.e. 48% of such individuals with concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium tests developed coronary events over 4.6 years, compared with only 24% of those with a positive exercise ECG alone.

The common carotid artery (CCA) wall thickness is often evaluated by measuring its intimal-medial thickness (IMT).

Recently, Nowak et al have shown that the presence of carotid atheroma is an indicator of coronary stenosis that is equivalent to a positive (i.e. ischemic) exercise ECG in a population with a high prevalence of CAD. 57 In the general population, increased CCA IMT has been shown to be an independent risk factor for developing clinical CAD. 46, 50, 51 In the Rotterdam Study, each 1 SD change in IMT increased the risk for myocardial infarction in community-dwelling volunteers by 25% during 2.7 years of follow-up, independent of other coronary risk factors. 46 "}, {"section_title": "Increased CCA IMT and asymptomatic CAD", "text": "Despite the established association between increased CCA IMT and clinically manifest CAD, it is unclear whether increased IMT also occurs in subjects with subclinical CAD.

The BLSA is comprised of community dwelling, predominantly white, college educated volunteers who are studied at 2-year intervals. Treadmill exercise testing has been employed in the BLSA since 1969. In 1977, exercise thallium scintigraphy was incorporated into the study for subjects older than 40 years of age. Planar scans were employed until 1983, after which time tomographic scans were used.\nCarotid artery ultrasound examinations were added to the BLSA evaluation in 1994. Using a linear array 5-10-MHz transducer, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography was performed as previously described. 23 The far wall IMT of the right CCA was evaluated proximal to the carotid bifurcation as the distance between the luminal-intimal interface and the medial-adventitial interface.\nMaximal treadmill exercise testing was conducted according to a modified Balke protocol 59 in which the treadmill speed was held constant and the elevation raised 3% every 2 min, starting from the horizontal, until exhaustion. The exercise ECG was interpreted according to Minnesota Code criteria. 60 A positive ECG response for ischemia was defined as a horizontal or down-sloping ST segment depression \u04431 mm.\nStress thallium scintigraphy was performed using the identical maximal treadmill exercise protocol. 61 A total of 3 mCi of 201 Tl was injected 1 min before anticipated exercise cessation. After 5-10 min of post-exercise monitoring, tomographic myocardial scanning was begun. Some 3 h later, delayed imaging was performed without thallium reinjection. A positive tomogram was defined by a segmen-tal perfusion defect on the immediate post-exercise images, with definite improvement or normalization on the delayed images. Subjects were classified into three CAD categories based on their medical history, and rest and exercise ECG: 'No CAD', 'Possible CAD' and 'Definite CAD'. The 'No CAD' group comprised subjects with no evidence of CAD. 'Possible CAD' was defined by asymptomatic ischemic ST segment depression but without clinical symptoms or pathologic Q waves. 'Definite CAD' was diagnosed by a history of myocardial infarction, pathologic Q waves, or unequivocal angina pectoris as defined by the Rose questionnaire. 62 The 'Possible CAD' subjects were further stratified by exercise thallium scintigraphic findings: 'Possible CAD-1' with a positive exercise ECG but negative thallium scan, and 'Possible CAD-2' with concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium scan."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": "Association of CCA IMT with symptomatic and asymptomatic CAD Baseline characteristics for the three CAD groups are shown in Table 1 . A progressive increase in CCA IMT was observed from No CAD subjects (0.52 \u03ee 0.14 mm) to Possible CAD (0.64 \u03ee 0.13 mm) and to Definite CAD (0.75 \u03ee 0.16 mm) (Figure 1) , suggesting that the progression of CCA IMT is linked to an increased likelihood of CAD. This observation is consistent with the concept that coronary atherosclerosis is a continuum, with overt CAD manifestations at one end of the spectrum and an asymptomatic ischemic exercise ECG towards the other. The increase in IMT from No CAD to Possible and Definite CAD appeared similar for women and men, though IMT was larger in men across the CAD categories. On further analysis, both Possible and Definite CAD were independently associated with increased IMT (both p \u03fd 0.0001) after adjustment for age, gender and the other coronary risk factors in Table 1 . This finding suggests that not only subjects with clinically manifest CAD, but also those with evidence for asymptomatic CAD have increased IMT.\nTo further stratify the likelihood of asymptomatic CAD in the Possible CAD group, this group was subdivided based on exercise thallium scintigraphic findings. A total of 60% of Possible CAD subjects (43 out of 72) underwent thallium scans, among whom 30 had a negative scan (Possible CAD-1) and 13 had a positive scan (Possible CAD-2). A graded increase in IMT was observed from subjects with No CAD (0.52 \u03ee 0.14 mm) to those classified as Possible CAD-1 (0.61 \u03ee 0.12 mm), to Possible CAD-2 subjects (0.74 \u03ee 0.10 mm) (Figure 2 ). These group differences in IMT remained significant after adjustment for age (p \u03fd 0.05). Thus, CCA IMT appears to increase in parallel with increasing evidence of myocardial ischemia by these non-invasive tests. It is noteworthy that this latter subset with asymptomatic ischemia on both exercise ECG and thallium scan demonstrated a virtually identical IMT to that in the manifest CAD group."}, {"section_title": "Utility of CCA IMT in predicting CAD and in its management", "text": "If CCA IMT increases in parallel with the likelihood of CAD, this association may be useful in identifying asymptomatic subjects with significant CAD. This issue is of particular interest when carotid ultrasonography is performed during the risk assessment for stroke, and for clinical decisions regarding carotid endarterectomy. Because of the frequent co-existence of carotid and coronary artery disease, the ability of carotid ultrasonography to estimate coronary artery status could be of aid in preoperative cardiac evaluation before carotid endarterectomy. The contribution of CCA IMT in predicting CAD was examined by logistic regression analysis. Manifest CAD and asymptomatic CAD, confirmed by the concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium results were considered, as essentially the same clinical entity, and both Definite CAD and Possible CAD-2 were regarded as endpoints. This is based on the prior observation that subjects with concordant positive exercise tests have a very high likelihood of sub- Although the overlap of CCA IMT between non-CAD and CAD subjects (Figure 1 ) precludes the use of IMT alone as a diagnostic marker for CAD, our observation suggests the utility of further screening for CAD in subjects with increased IMT, even if asymptomatic. However, although aggressive medical or surgical treatment of silent myocardial ischemia has proven beneficial in patients with symptomatic CAD, 63, 64 the utility of such therapy in totally asymptomatic subjects is still not established. Nevertheless, given the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in reducing the risk for subsequent stroke, 65 examination of CCA IMT during carotid ultrasonography appears to offer added information in determining the extent of cardiac evaluation prior to surgery. 66 Furthermore, regression or slowed progression of IMT has been reported in subjects on lipid-lowering therapy. [67] [68] [69] If IMT changes in parallel with the progression of CAD, serial measurement of IMT may serve as a noninvasive marker for the efficacy of risk factor modification such as anti-hypertensive 70 and lipid-lowering therapy. [67] [68] [69] This study relied upon exercise ECG and thallium scintigraphy to stratify the likelihood of CAD. Although the ability of these exercise tests to identify asymptomatic individuals at higher risk for future coronary events has been shown in our BLSA population 7, 14 as well as in many others, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] such a non-invasive stratification is imperfect. Concern always exists regarding the accuracy of any non-invasive classification of subclinical CAD. However, the virtually identical IMT in the asymptomatic individuals with concordant positive exercise ECG and thallium scans compared with patients with clinically evident CAD argues that our approach is appropriate."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "With the common occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death as the initial clinical manifestation of asymptomatic CAD, early identification of such individuals in their preclinical phase should be potentially beneficial in their management. We have demonstrated a significant association between asymptomatic exerciseinduced myocardial ischemia and increased CCA IMT, similar to that seen in patients with manifest CAD. Although the primary purpose of carotid ultrasonography is not the detection of CAD, determination of IMT may help to identify asymptomatic individuals with a high likelihood for CAD as well as providing a non-invasive window for monitoring the efficacy of risk-factor modification in these subjects."}, {"section_title": "References", "text": ""}]
