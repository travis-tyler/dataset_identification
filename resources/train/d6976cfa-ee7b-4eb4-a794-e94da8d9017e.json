[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 provided strengthened federal incentives for local hazard mitigation planning. In Rhode Island, this process is currently being carried out by each municipality with guidance from the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA). This analysis of the local hazard mitigation planning process in Rhode Island is based on the author's participation in hazard mitigation planning in North Kingstown, and a review of the scholarly literature. Six points are identified on which Rhode Island's process could be improved: l) more use of specialized expertise, 2) continuous staffing of planning and implementation, 3) greater coordination between jurisdictions, 4) use of measurable evaluation criteria, 5) more public education, and 6) use of computerized analysis techniques. In order to achieve these improvements, it is recommended that RIEMA consider organizing multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation planning, as is done in many other states. This would make it possible for plans to be authored and implemented by permanently employed professional hazard mitigation specialists. The result of this would be plans of higher quality with more effective implementation. With this approach, risks and vulnerabilities from natural hazards could be more effectively reduced for residents and businesses in Rhode Island."}, {"section_title": "Aclrnowledgements", "text": "This project was made possible by the North Kingstown Planning Department, which provided the opportunity for me to work on revising the town's hazard mitigation plan.

The plan had originally been written by an intern in 2002, but had subsequently failed to be approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) due to deficiencies in some of the elements required under the Interim Final Rule ( 44 CFR Parts 201 and 206) which became effective in the same year. The 2004 revision of the plan took approximately two months and involved adding sections and information and reorganizing the document to match the contents required by the Rule, as well as updating information in the document. This report is an analysis of the local hazard mitigation planning process as it is currently carried out in Rhode Island. The analysis is partly based on the experience of revising a town ' s hazard mitigation plan and partly on a review of the scholarly literature about the local role in mitigation planning. Particular attention is paid to the question of whether the procedure followed by towns in Rhode Island effectively generates significant substantive improvements in hazard risk or vulnerability in the towns. Using the hazard mitigation planning process of North Kingstown as a representative example, this report takes a case study approach, reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the process and suggesting changes which could improve its effectiveness."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Natural Hazards in Rhode Island", "text": "A review of the history of Rhode Island is sufficient testimony to the significant impact that natural disasters have had on life in the state. Most notable in the record was the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, a category 3 storm with 121 mile per hour (mph) winds. The hurricane affected the Narragansett Bay area most strongly due to a storm surge 12-15 feet higher than normal maximum high tides (University of Rhode Island, Office of Marine Programs, 2005). Many whole neighborhoods were washed away, including over 100 beach cottages at Quonset Point, where nine people were killed. The death toll across the state was significant. Subsequent strong hurricanes occurred in 1954, 1955, 1985, and most recently in 1991, when hurricane Bob caused $115 million in property damage with its 105 mph winds (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, Coastal Services Center, 1999). Blizzards have also caused substantial damage in Rhode Island. The Blizzard of 1978 made roads impassible for five days and left some areas without electricity for up to a week. The Narragansett Bay is also a regional hot spot for earthquake activity with 15 quakes recorded since 1928. Rhode Island's current vulnerabilities to natural disasters remain considerable. The risk from hurricanes alone has been estimated to include a one percent chance each year of losing $600-800 million in property damage (Institute for Business and Home Safety, 2000). Extensive redevelopment of coastal areas where development was previously destroyed by hurricanes has set the stage for a potential repeat of the destruction the state experienced in 1938 (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, 2005). The probability of a named storm directly striking Rhode Island in any given season is approximately 22% (Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, 2004). Rhode Island's position along a generally southward facing stretch of coastline makes it particularly susceptible to being hit by hurricanes, which generally move up the Atlantic coast from the south. The configuration of Narragansett Bay increases the likelihood of flooding in a hurricane due to funneling of high storm surge tides. Rhode Island is also considered to be at risk for droughts, blizzards, earthquakes, wildfires, and tomados."}, {"section_title": "Hazard Mitigation", "text": "The management of emergencies and natural disasters is generally considered to include four types of activities (O'Connor, 2005): I) mitigation is the reduction or elimination of future risk, 2) preparedness is a practiced state of readiness to respond, 3) response is an immediate action or relief that saves lives, and 4) recovery is the process of repair and restoration. Mitigation planning for natural hazards involves assessing a community's risks and vulnerabilities and enacting programs or policies designed to avoid, reduce, or offset the impacts of natural disasters on people and property. It includes both structural and non-structural activities. Examples of hazard mitigation activities include public education about hazard risks, emergency preparedness planning, implementation of land use and building regulations designed to reduce exposure and vulnerability to hazards, acquisition of properties in hazardous locations, and structure relocation or retrofitting (Randolph, 2004). It has been estimated that for every dollar spent on hazard mitigation, two dollars are saved in disaster losses. Hazard mitigation makes a community more resilient and environmentally sustainable (Monday, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "The Federal Mandate", "text": "The primary role of the federal government in disasters has traditionally been to provide local communities with assistance in emergency response and recovery after a disaster. In many cases, federal assistance has been provided repeatedly to the same properties for the same type of disaster loss, and used to rebuild structures in the same hazardous locations where losses are likely to recur, in effect subsidizing development in hazardous locations. Such experiences during the 1990's, along with advances in scientific abilities to predict risks and impacts of natural hazards, stimulated federal interest in predisaster planning for prevention of hazard impacts. In particular, hazard mitigation includes the concept that the most hazardous locations should be left undeveloped. Local land use planning is an essential component of the mitigation process. In 1998 FEMA established a Hazard Mitigation Planning Division to promote and support the mitigation planning process by providing guidance to state, local, and tribal governments (FEMA, 2005) FEMA guidance (FEMA, 2004;FEMA, 2002)  Description of all natural hazards that can affect the jurisdiction"}, {"section_title": "11.", "text": "Description of the jurisdiction's vulnerability to the hazards "}, {"section_title": "Mitigation goals", "text": "11."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of mitigation actions", "text": "111.

The effectiveness with which this planning process has addressed the goals of hazard mitigation can be assessed by first reviewing the relevant scholarly literature on effective local hazard mitigation planning."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Elements Contributing to Effective Local Hazard Mitigation", "text": "Scholarly writings on the topic of hazard mitigation planning are in agreement that local land use planning is essential and can be a highly effective approach to reducing hazard risks and losses if done well (Burby, 1999;Prater, 1999, Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center, 2005, Natural Hazards Center, 2005. State emergency management agencies are reportedly quite satisfied with the effects of federal grant programs available for local mitigation projects (General Accounting Office, 2002). Research shows that strong state or federal incentives or mandates are necessary in order to induce local jurisdictions to take up hazard mitigation planning and that these policies are effective at reducing hazard losses (May and Burby, 1996;Burby, 2005). Some scholars have called upon the federal government to have restraint in paying for disaster losses so as to break the cycle of subsidizing development in hazard vulnerable locations. The federal government has also been called upon to resolve the legal issues that currently prevent local jurisdictions and states from using strong, non-compensatory land use controls to prevent hazard vulnerable development, due to the fear of \"takings\" litigation (Platt, 1999 and1996;Burby, 1999). Unfortunately, studies conducted in the 1990's found many problems with the state of local hazard mitigation planning during that decade, including lack of planning in many areas or reactive plans of poor quality (Godschalk, 1999). Additionally, one expert source noted that implementation of plans is often poorly carried out (Gordon, 2005), sometimes due to short term staffing of hazard mitigation planning and lack of knowledge of the plan on the part of town officials. This low level of implementation can cause hazard mitigation to be a process lacking in substance. The recipe for highly successful hazard mitigation planning, according to research, is to incorporate it into local comprehensive planning. Evaluation methods should be determined early on in the planning process, so that benchmarks for improvement can be established (Gordon, 2005). Because hazard risks vary according to natural geography, such as coastlines and watersheds, and not jurisdictional boundaries, it is necessary that the process include cooperation between jurisdictions and among all levels of government (May and Burby, 1996;Platt, 2005). A public process is ideal since it increases public awareness of risks (Burby, 1999). However, this is difficult to achieve, since public interest in natural hazards is generally low (Godschalk, Brody, and Burby, 2003). Therefore, an active approach to public education and soliciting participation is necessary. Sophisticated software and quantitative methods are helpful tools for the assessment and quantification of risks and vulnerabilities. They are also helpful in the prioritization of mitigation activities according to their costs and benefits (Flax, Jackson, and Stein, 2002;Odeh, 2002). These methods are currently under development, most notably FEMA's HAZUS software (FEMA, 2005). General GIS software can also be used for conducting vulnerability analysis. The quality of local hazard mitigation plans has been found to increase with increasing investment of resources in the process (Prater, 1999). The availability of professional staff with specialized expertise in hazard mitigation is essential to the success of the process (Gordon, 2005 ;Platt, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Critique of Hazard Mitigation in Rhode Island", "text": "Comparing the characteristics of ideal local hazard mitigation planning as described in the literature to how it is actually being done in Rhode Island reveals both strengths and weaknesses. Most notably, it is impressive that all of the 39 towns and cities in the state have committed to write a hazard mitigation plan. This high rate of participation has been achieved through RIEMA ' s outreach efforts to the municipalities in combination with the strengthened incentives provided in the DMA 2000, and has earned for Rhode Island FEMA' s Outstanding State award. In this way, hazard mitigation has become an accepted part of local comprehensive planning and been added to the agenda of the planning community in the state. The production of the North Kingstown Hazard Mitigation Plan and formation of the town's hazard mitigation committee, for example, has stimulated greater awareness and understanding of hazards and the inclusion of hazard considerations in the town 's comprehensive plan and emergency operations. Public participation in production of the plan included a public workshop, at least two public hearings before the town council, and the inclusion of members of the public on the hazard mitigation committee. Thus, ample opportunity was provided for members of the public to give input. Public education is also included in the town's action plan in the form of information brochures for property owners and renters informing them of their hazard risks. Given the low level of public interest in natural hazards and the importance of mitigation actions taken by individuals and businesses (Godschalk, Brody, and Burby, 2003), the scholarly literature would seem to suggest that towns should also consider promoting hazard and risk awareness more actively through public workshops, school presentations, etc. Training sessions for key town staff should also be undertaken. Intergovernmental cooperation was achieved by sending the plan to neighboring municipalities for their review and through state level review by RIEMA and federal review by FEMA. This element of the planning process could certainly be taken to a higher level through collaborative planning between neighboring municipalities. Given the common geographies and hazard risks of neighboring towns and the specialized knowledge and skills necessary to plan for hazards, common hazard mitigation planning could result in efficiencies for all municipalities involved. The planning of evacuation routes would also benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. The resources that were invested in the planning process primarily consisted of full-time paid interns working on the plan over the course of many months. These interns were graduate students in the planning program at the University of Rhode Island, and the creation of the hazard mitigation plan partly served as an educational experience for them. Limited technical assistance was available from RIEMA and FEMA Region 1, and hazard maps were provided by the URI Environmental Data Center. However the work was, for the most part, an independent effort by the town, making the limitations on resources available a very real concern. This process produced a plan of sufficient quality in time for the applicable deadline using resources readily available to the town. Given the complexity of natural hazards, it can certainly be argued that the quality of a plan and efficiency with which it is produced could be higher if it is authored by a professional hazard mitigation specialist, although this approach would be more expensive and would sacrifice the educational value of the process for student interns. Hazard mitigation planning has excellent educational value for students. However, given its complexity; a student would perhaps be more appropriate in an assisting role rather than authoring a plan. Alternatively, the quality and efficiency of the process could be improved by the provision of more extensive technical assistance from the state. At the very least, staff members should be available, who have detailed familiarity with FEMA's requirements and can advise towns on methods of achieving these. Ongoing implementation of the planning process is overseen by a principal planner of the town, who also supervised the interns in writing and revising the plan. The Police Department also took an active interest in the implementation called for in the plan. It can be argued, however, that implementation might be improved if carried out by the same staff that wrote the plan, and therefore has intimate familiarity with it, and if this were a permanent employee of the town. The challenge of using sophisticated techniques to assess hazard vulnerabilities and generate quantitative estimates of potential losses was not accomplished in the current plan and remains in the town's plans for the future. This is an example of one aspect of hazard mitigation planning in which professional authorship, or more extensive technical assistance is needed, since these calculations require specialized training and software. Quantified estimates of hazard risks help to better inform cost-benefit review and decisions regarding the prioritization of mitigation actions. Unfortunately, the limited resources of a town working independently do not generally make this high level of rigorous analysis a reasonable expectation. Committee meetings to evaluate and update the plan are required twice yearly. This schedule will provide good opportunities for the plan to be continuously improved. The protocol for evaluation could be improved further with the addition of specific methods of evaluation including measurable criteria. These criteria could take the form of reductions to risk or vulnerability ratings relative to benchmarks set by the initial vulnerability analysis. This is another example in which extensive technical assistance or professional staff expertise would be helpful. It is also an example of the importance of substantive content in hazard mitigation plans as opposed to simply following the process and using the required terminology. FEMA reviewers should carefully evaluate plans for such important elements of substantive content. Overall, local hazard mitigation planning is clearly progressing and improving rapidly in Rhode Island and in the town of North Kingstown. However, further improvements could be achieved on the following points: l) More specialized expertise either doing the planning or providing extensive technical assistance to the planner, 2) Long-term, continuous staff for plan writing and implementation, 3) More coordination between towns sharing common geographies, 4) Ongoing public education and staff training, 5) Measurable criteria for evaluation of plans, and 6) More sophisticated methods of risk and vulnerability analysis. The following procedural change is suggested as a way of simultaneously addressing all of these points and achieving more substantive and effective hazard mitigation planning."}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for improvement", "text": "Given the limited resources that municipalities have available to put towards hazard mitigation, the state and its municipalities should consider multijurisdictional hazard mitigation planning, in which groups of towns that share common geographic situations would share a common hazard mitigation plan. The multi-jurisdictional approach is commonly used in hazard mitigation in other states, sometimes including over forty jurisdictions in one plan, and many areas plan at the county level rather then by individual municipalities. Hazard mitigation planning at the town level is in fact rare outside Rhode Island, as it is generally recognized that hazard mitigation is a more specialized activity than can be reasonably be expected of all but the largest municipalities. Multi-jurisdictional planning should be coordinated and partly funded by RIEMA, which would organize the towns into \"hazard mitigation zones\" and provide a hazard mitigation expert to work for each zone. By grouping together into \"hazard mitigation zones\", towns would be better able to afford a full-time hazard mitigation specialist to write their hazard mitigation plans and oversee ongoing implementation. This would be a boon to already overextended town planners, who would have more time available for other planning concerns. It would also improve the quality and consistency of hazard mitigation planning. Each town would be represented on the hazard mitigation committee and the town planners would remain involved in the process. RIEMA ' s role would be merely organizational and supportive, while the towns, acting as a group within each zone would be in control of the planning and implementation process. An example of how the state could be divided into hazard mitigation zones is shown below in Figure 1.  This reorganization of the planning process would give the benefits of professional quality and efficiency to the planning effort while still keeping each town in control of decisions about actions for which it will be responsible. Each of the points where improvement is needed, as highlighted by the preceding critique, could be more easily addressed with this approach. The hazard mitigation officer responsible for each hazard zone would author a multi-jurisdictional plan for the towns in that zone and would carry out ongoing implementation and updates of the plan. This officer would also be responsible for conducting ongoing public education and staff training sessions. This individual would be part of the emergency response command structure. This approach would achieve far better follow-through and institutional memory than interns or consultants can provide by giving responsibility to a full-time permanent staff person. A specialist in hazard mitigation would also have more detailed knowledge about hazards and how to evaluate and prioritize hazard mitigation actions, as well as greater capacity to use sophisticated tools such as HAZUS and GIS software. Figures 2 and 3 show examples of how GIS generated graphics can be highly effective for analyzing and communicating hazard risks. Since the hazard mitigation specialist would be working for a group of towns, cooperative programs and planning between the jurisdictions would happen automatically where appropriate.

Disaster preparation can have enormous benefits in lessened loss of life, economic and social impacts, and post-disaster recovery time. This process is an important part of the effort to develop a sustainable community, which is resilient and continues to thrive over time."}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Hazard Mitigation", "text": "The most immediate benefit of natural hazard mitigation planning is the reduction and elimination of the negative impacts of natural disasters in terms of lost life and property. With adequate preparation the Town can significantly reduce the economic and social disruptions caused by natural disasters and reduce the costs of recovery for the town, local businesses, and residents. It has been estimated that for every dollar spent on hazard mitigation, two dollars are saved in disaster losses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) offers three distinct incentives for the adoption of local hazard mitigation plans. Firstly FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program provide grants for activities designed to mitigate the effects of floods and other disasters in a community. Funds from these grants can go to acquisition, relocation, and retrofitting of structures but are only available if an approved hazard mitigation plan is in place. Secondly, a hazard mitigation plan can expedite the approval process for receiving money after a federally declared disaster through the FEMA Post-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). Finally, a mitigation plan can be counted towards credit points in FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS). Points are awarded for having the plan, as well as for going through the various steps involved in creating the plan, including having community involvement and coordinating with other agencies. The better a community's CRS score, the greater the discounts provided on individual property owner's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) premiums. Currently, North Kingstown has a CRS rating of 9, which entitles property owners to a 5% discount on flood insurance."}, {"section_title": "Goal Statement", "text": "The goal of this hazard mitigation plan is to identify areas at risk from natural hazards and develop policies and plans of action that could be implemented to reduce the impacts of natural hazards on the residents, properties, and natural resources of North Kingstown. A high priority is placed on protecting the safety of residents and visitors alike. The town's many historic buildings and coastal resources are of special concern.   II A-Zor ' =' 1. lCC Y8,r: As a coastal community, North Kingstown is highly susceptible to the effects of hurricanes and nor'easters, especially the coastal flooding associated with these events. Hurricanes are tropical based storms that travel north up the Atlantic coast and feature heavy rain and high velocity winds . Hurricanes occur in the late summer to early fall , as opposed to nor'easters, which are similar to hurricanes in effect but occur in the winter months. Both types of storm can cause large amounts of damage across a wide area. Because hurricanes and coastal storms are the major natural hazards that the town faces on a regular basis, they are the primary focus of this hazard mitigation plan. The probability of a named storm directly hitting Rhode Island in any given hurricane season is currently estimated at approximately 22% (Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, 2004). Map 3 shows the storm tracks of the 24 major coastal storms that have made land fall within 100 miles of North Kingstown in the past 50 years. Rhode Island has had between 1 and 2 presidential disaster declarations due to hurricanes between 1965 and 2000 (FEMA, 2002). The town's history includes several severe storms, including hurricanes and nor'easters, which have caused significant levels of damage to North Kingstown (Table 1 ). Damage in these storm events came primarily from two elements, flooding and wind . Floods are the most common type of natural disaster. Flooding during a hurricane can be caused by heavy rains and storm surge tides that rise from the sea up to 25 ft. higher than the normal high water level. Locations in North Kingstown that are vulnerable to flooding due to heavy rain events are indicated as flood zones on Maps 1 and 2. Those that are vulnerable to inundation from the sea are indicated on Map 2 as \"SLOSH\" hurricane evacuation areas North Kingstown has land area in all three levels of flood zones as designated by FEMA (NFIP). Floodplains in the town include \"A\" zones subject to a 100-year flood, \"V\" zones subject to a 100-year flood characterized by breaking wave action, and \"X\" zones subject to a 500-year flood. A 100-year flood has a one percent chance of occurring in any given year, and a 500-year flood has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. FEMA designated flood zones are determined based on the elevation of the land and indicate areas that would be flooded in the event of heavy rains. Development, including simply paving , can increase the height and extent of flooding due to the loss of ground permeability. The National Hurricane Center's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes model (SLOSH) shows areas subject to inundation from the sea in the event of a hurricane (Map 2) . The SLOSH model depicts the \"worst case scenario\" taking into account wind speed and direction, tides, and the topography of the land. Future sea level rise and coastal erosion will increase the area and extent of damage caused by coastal flooding. "}, {"section_title": "Legend", "text": "Hurricane Track In addition to wind and flooding , erosion is a hazard that can threaten life and property during a coastal storm. The Coastal Resources Management Program has documented shoreline change and average erosion rates. The location with the most severe erosion in North Kingstown is the Narragansett Bay shoreline from Pojac Point to just north of the Mount View neighborhood. This area is considered to be a \"Category A\" critical erosion area (CRMC), and is eroding at an average rate of 2.2 ft. annually. Development in this area must be set back at least 75ft. from a coastal feature, or 150 ft. in the case of a development of more than four units. The rest of the town's shoreline either has an erosion rate of less than 2 ft. per year or is actually accreting. Narrow barrier beaches, such as those at Casey Point, Green Point, and Bissel Cove can also be affected by significant erosion. A single large storm event can drastically change the shoreline depending on coastal soil conditions. Hurricanes are classified by wind speed into five types. Table 2 outlines these five hurricane categories. Rhode Island is considered to be susceptible to a direct landing of storms from categories I through IV. It has been estimated that North Kingstown's peak wind gust in a typical 100 year period is likely to be between 110 and 125 MPH (HAZUS-MH). Hurricanes reaching the New England region experience an increase in forward motion that compensates for decreased wind speeds so that lower class hurricanes can potentially cause considerably more damage than would normally be expected . Rhode Island has an increased susceptibility to hurricanes due to its position, along with Connecticut and Massachusetts, on a landform that juts eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Also, the configuration of the Narragansett Bay can have a funneling effect on the tidal surges accompanying hurricanes causing high levels of coastal flooding in the upper portions of the bay. The most significant storm to hit North Kingstown was the hurricane of 1938, a category three storm. Wind speeds as high as 121 miles per hour were reported and there was severe coastal flooding. The following has been taken from a first-hand account of the 1938 hurricane written by Alice Armington of Poplar Point on September 21, 1938."}, {"section_title": "\" ...

Photograph courtesy of Richard Bowen. Since 1900, 33 hurricanes have directly or indirectly struck Rhode Island, so one can easily expect further hurricane activity in the future (Rhode Island Hurricane Evacuation Study Technical Data Report, 1995). If the predicted effects of global warming are correct, than hurricanes and other severe storms will occur with more frequency and intensity in the future, increasing the chances of a hurricane reaching Rhode Island's shores. The devastating hurricanes that struck Rhode Island during the early and mid 1900s were part of a period of increased hurricane formation in the tropical Atlantic. Between 1970 and 1994 the Atlantic had a period of below normal hurricane formation. In the mid 1990s a new period of increased hurricane activity began due to warmer surface water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic. Therefore, the likelihood of a major hurricane striking Rhode Island is currently greater then it was during most of the past several decades. Because the town's most damaging hurricanes occurred over fifty years ago, many new residents are unaware of the seriousness of the risk. As coastal population has increased, locations where development was previously destroyed by hurricanes have been redeveloped, some with particularly vulnerable structures. Figure 2 shows the increasing population of Washington County along with major hurricane strikes to the county. The Town has registered for the HURREVAC 2000 software program developed jointly by FEMA and the Army Corp of Engineers. This program will alert the Town to approaching hurricanes through live data files from the National Hurricane Center via the Internet at www.hurrevac.com/about_win.htm. As these files are received , the program processes the data and analyzes the threat posed to the community from a particular storm allowing town officials to make informed decisions as to the Town's response .  \nPoplar Point home after a snowstorm event.\nBlizzards in 1906 and 1978, along with an ice storm in 1966 are remembered as some of the town's worst winter storms.

The National Climate Data Center storm events database contains records of 21 severe winter storms that have struck Washington County, Rhode Island between 1994 and 2004. No deaths or injuries are reported . Three of the records include estimates of property damage, which range from $290,000 to $700,000.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Wildfire", "text": "While fire is now known to have an important regenerative role in many ecosystems, many factors, natural and manmade, can combine to create devastating natural disasters far beyond the effects of natural wildfire processes. Drought conditions , coupled with a build-up of dead underbrush and other kindling can lead to a fire, with the presence of a spark. Such a situation is especially dangerous when there are a number of homes present in forested areas, as is the case in parts of North Kingstown . Firefighters use different and often incompatible methods when fighting wildfires as opposed to home fires. In addition, the presence of homes precludes the ability to conduct controlled burns in order to keep the amount of kindling low and mitigate largescale wildfires. Access to both the site and to a water source is another important issue that can affect how intense and potentially damaging a wildfire can be (Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction , 1998). As of 1999 almost 50 percent of North Kingstown's total acreage was forested. While this percentage has fluctuated over time, there have been very few wildfire occurrences in the town and none of these have caused great amounts of damage or burned on a large, uncontrolled scale. The two largest fires in North Kingstown's recent history occurred in 1968 and 197 4 in the Slocum area. Sparks from the adjacent railroad tracks lit both of these fires, which burned in an area exceeding 500 and 300 acres respectively. Currently, North Kingstown is considered to be in a low fire danger class (U .S. Forest Service, 2004), and a recent state wide analysis prepared by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Division of the Forest Environment concluded that, based on land cover, North Kingstown has a low risk of wildfire. Based on population the town has moderate risk."}, {"section_title": "Tornadoes", "text": "According to FEMA publications, North Kingstown is located in wind zone 11 , which has a design wind speed of 160 mph. The area has had an average of less than 1 strong tornado (categories F3-F5) per 3,700 sq. ft. According to FEMA's wind risk matrix, this means that the town has a low risk of tornadoes; however wind shelters are still advisable due to the region's susceptibility to hurricanes. The National Climatic data center reports an average of 0 tornadoes per year in Rhode Island, and the Tornado Project reports that there have been 0 tornadoes in Washington County between 1950 and 1995. Based on this history, it can be concluded that a tornado in North Kingstown would be a very rare event; however it cannot be ruled out because the conditions that generate tornadoes can happen anywhere.\nIn the highly unlikely event of a strong tornado in North Kingstown, the structures that would be most susceptible to damage would be those built before 1990, when the state building code was amended to include requirements for wind load resistance. The four mobile home parks in the northern part of town would also be of special concern .  . . ,,., '\"\"\"'\"'\" "}, {"section_title": "Severe Winter Storms", "text": "Although generally outside of the extreme winter weather areas of the Northeast, Rhode Island is still subject to possible heavy winter weather events including significant snow and ice accumulation. Snow accumulation can cause serious damage to structures, especially those with flat roofs, and possibly cause roof collapse. The combination of ice and wind can bring down utility poles, leading to a variety of problems with communication and electricity loss. Snowmelt can lead to flooding well after the actual snowstorm has past. "}, {"section_title": "Earthquake", "text": "An earthquake is an abrupt release of accumulated strain on the Earth's tectonic plates occurring along a fault line. Damage in an earthquake stems from ground motion, surface faulting , and ground failure in which weak or unstable soils, such as those composed primarily of saturated sand or silts, liquefy. The effects of an earthquake are mitigated by distance and ground materials between the epicenter and a given location (Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction, 1998). An earthquake in New England affects a much wider area than a similar earthquake in California due to New England's solid bedrock geology (NESEC) . According to the US Geological Survey website the seismic hazard for Rhode Island is 2-4%g (peak acceleration). While there is a low probability of an earthquake occurring in Rhode Island, it is not an impossible event. There have, in fact, been 15 earthquakes since 1928 with one in June 1951 registering a 4.6 on the Richter scale centered in Kingston. Narragansett Bay is considered a regional hot spot for earthquake activity, with many of the past quakes occurring in the bay or its immediate vicinity. Map 4 from the New England Seismic Network/MIT displays the past earthquake activity in New England.\nThe buildings most vulnerable to earthquake damage are those built before 1977, when state building codes began requiring greater earthquake resistance. Masonry buildings are especially vulnerable, as well as structures located on deep or unconsolidated soils. Because North Kingstown's peak ground acceleration is approximately 3.6%, with a 10% chance of exceedence in 50 years (U.S. Geological Survey}, an earthquake with enough intensity to cause damage would be unlikely."}, {"section_title": "oz:", "text": ".f>.  . ;: ,. . ,. ,._ ,. : "}, {"section_title": "Drought", "text": "There are no universally accepted definitions of drought, and the conditions that are labeled as drought can vary from region to region . Drought can be generally defined as a period of drier than normal conditions over a large area, which , in some manner, reduces water levels. Droughts are different from other natural hazards in that they do not consist of a short, easily defined event such as a hurricane or an earthquake, but instead they gradually appear, last for a time period, and then gradually return to normal. Drought conditions can last for weeks, months, even years. Droughts can have serious economic, social and environmental effects on an area. Crops and livestock can be lost, industries can lose productivity, and wildlife habitat can be destroyed. Cumulatively these effects can easily equal the cost of a severe hurricane or other natural disaster. As aquifer levels are drawn down, seawater can be drawn into wells located near the coast (RI Drought Management Plan). Precipitation levels vary widely from region to region and from year to year. In Rhode Island, the average yearly precipitation is 39 to 44 inches (Rhode Island Drought Management Plan). A drought becomes apparent after a period of time over which there are lower than normal precipitation levels. Stream and river flow is reduced , lake and reservoir levels fall, and groundwater is found at increasingly lower depths. As water availability becomes increasingly scarce, water use prioritization becomes necessary. Rhode Island is considered at risk to short-term droughts, which often occur in the summer months and long-term droughts, which on average appear once every eleven years. Droughts in Rhode Island most often begin with an abnormally dry winter (RI Drought Management Plan). There have been at least seven major droughts in Rhode Island since 1929 including a long-term drought in the mid sixties and seasonal droughts in the summers of 1999 and 2002 (RI Drought Management Plan). During the 1999 drought many shallow wells in the state dried up. During summer of 2002 Rhode Island experienced increasing levels of drought as water levels dropped and water use restrictions were enacted all over the state Currently, Rhode Island has mid-range hydrological conditions, meaning that it is not significantly drier or more moist than normal. The current town water plan predicts a rise in water use as the town's population increases. Water service connections increased by about 170 per year between 1995 and 2000. This increase in water use may lead to greater problems during drought conditions in the future. While the primary land use in these areas is residential , there are business uses mixed throughout. Together, the more than 3000 homes and businesses in coastal and riverfront areas have a total value of approximately $138,000,000. Wickford Village is particularly vulnerable to flooding . In addition to residences and businesses, many public facilities and utility lines are located in flood and storm surge areas. These include the Town Hall, Town Hall Annex, and Town Emergency Operations Center, as well as water lines that are carried across potentially vulnerable bridges. Flood damage comes from both the presence of the water and its ability to carry large pieces of debris such as boats and houses into other houses and structures. Roads running perpendicular to the coast can act as surge channels, carrying the storm surge further inland at a higher rate and concentration. Coastal erosion during a storm event may also put structures at risk. Wind damage is another significant aspect of coastal storms and has its most direct effect on coastal buildings. Wind speed can drop dramatically as one moves inland, falling 70 to 80 percent one-half mile to one mile inland (Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction, 1998). Windblown debris broken free from buildings and trees can also be dangerous during a storm. Clean up and damage repair from wind can be very expensive. Populations that would be of particular concern during a coastal storm include two daycare facilities in the evacuation 'A' areas, located in Wickford and near Bissel Cove, and one daycare center in the 'B' evacuation area in Quidnessett. There are also two day-care centers that are in close proximity to 'A' flood zones. There is no elderly housing or nursing homes located in either a flood zone or an evacuation area. While there are no mobile home parks in the evacuation areas, these locations can still be vulnerable to damage from high winds.\nA drought in North Kingstown would primarily be felt in the form of lost income to agricultural and tourist industries, damage to wildlife habitat, increased risk of wild fires, and well salinization. Residents would also be affected by water use restrictions. North Kingstown has 29 farms and nearly 1000 acres in agricultural production (Rhode Island Agricultural Digest 2003). As of 2001 132 residents of the town were employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation)."}, {"section_title": "Wildfires", "text": "Because North Kingstown's land cover places it in a low fire danger class, it is unlikely that a fire would burn out of control and cause significant damage; however fires are especially dangerous in locations where many houses are present in a forested area. This is the case in parts of North Kingstown, especially the western and southern parts of town. According to the 2000 Census, census tract 504.01, which includes the southwestern corner of town, has 1,358 housing units. The comprehensive plan currently includes an objective to relocate one of the town's fire stations to better serve this portion of town ."}, {"section_title": "Severe Winter Storm", "text": "All parts of the town can be affected by severe winter weather including significant snow and ice accumulation. Buildings with flat roofs are especially vulnerable to collapse due to snow accumulation; and ice accumulation can bring down utility lines and damage forests. Business functions and activities can be disrupted by temporary loss of electricity and impassable roads. The largest loss of property value caused by a winter storm within the past decade was $700,000 for all of Washington County (National Climate Data Center)."}, {"section_title": "Assets and Potential Losses", "text": "The following sections provide a general description of the community's assets, which would be at risk in the event of a natural disaster. In order to better quantify North Kingstown's potential losses, the action plan also includes plans to conduct a detailed inventory of structures, infrastructure, and critical facilities vulnerable to damage (Action #18) . The outcome of the analysis will be dollar estimates of potential losses due to damage to structures and their contents, and loss of function of structures. This analysis will also reveal in greater detail the structures or neighborhoods of town that are most susceptible to damage in the event of a natural disaster, so that actions can be taken to reduce these vulnerabilities ."}, {"section_title": "Economic and Social", "text": "According to tax assessor's data, the total value of coastal and riverfront residential and commercial buildings in town is approximately $138,079, 100. Therefore, if a hypothetical storm event were to result in an average of 25% damage to these structures, the structural damage would total $34, 519,775. Damage to building contents and functional down time of businesses would cause additional losses. A building can be damaged to 25% of its replacement cost in a flood of less then two feet depth. FEMA indicates a total of 700 properties insured by NFIP and vulnerable to flooding (Table 3). There are four repetitive loss properties in North Kingstown, with a total of nine repetitive loss claims among them. All of the repetitive loss properties are located in Wickford. Since 1978 there have been $179,034 paid for losses. Specific vulnerabilities can be found on the risk matrix (Table 4) and on Maps 1 and 2. There are several different historical and socially significant structures that are located in evacuation and flood zones. The historic district in Wickford and its harbor are particularly vulnerable to hurricane damage. The existing Harbor Management Plan only deals with the hazards produced by chemical or oil spills though, as previously stated; a storm preparedness plan will be added. The residential, commercial, and industrial areas subject to inundation during a flood or hurricane all pose the threat of introducing hazardous chemicals and wastewater into the environment and therefore represent a possible health risk after the event that can inhibit rescue operations. Large inundation areas can be found along the Hunt and Narrow Rivers, at Pojac Point, Quonset Point, Wickford, and around Bissel Cove. "}, {"section_title": "Public Infrastructure", "text": "The Town owns and operates a large number of facilities in coastal areas subject to flooding and storm surge. Most significant of these are the two town hall buildings; both are located in the hurricane surge area while the Main Town Hall is in an 'X' zone and the Town Hall Annex is in an 'A' zone (Map 2). In the event of a serious storm, sensitive equipment and important documents can both be destroyed leading to a variety of problems in town management including the loss of historic records. In addition, the town emergency operations center and the National Guard Stations at Quonset are within the hurricane evacuation areas designated for the most severe hurricane events (Map 2). Three elementary schools, Wickford, Fishing Cove, and Hamilton , face damage as well in the event of a severe storm (Map 2). The North Kingstown Free Library is another vulnerable town structure subject to storm surge and high winds. Flooding can expose or otherwise compromise septic systems leading to contamination and public health concerns. The Town maintains two wastewater pumping facilities, one at Wickford Point and the other on Mark Drive, while the RIEDC has a wastewater facility in Quonset Point. All of these wastewater facilities are subject to flooding and storm surge presenting severe water contamination issues. Flooding can also wash out bridges leading to disruption in water provision at the point where it is carried over bridges. The Hussey and Brown Street Bridges in Wickford both carry water lines, as do bridges over Cocumscussoc Brook on Post Road and the Annaquatucket River on Boston Neck Road . The town has several different recreational facilities in coastal areas subject to flooding and storm surge including Allen Harbor Marina, the Town Dock in Wickford, the various buildings at the end of Beach Street, and Wilson Park. Finally, the highway garage on West Main Street is subject to both flooding and storm surge. Utility lines represent another key vulnerability in the town. High winds and ice/snow storms can bring down phone and electric lines disrupting power and communication to parts of the community and affecting the operations of businesses. The town also has many dams that may be vulnerable to flooding or earthquake damage. An earthquake could also pose a threat to older town buildings such as the Town Hall and Wickford Elementary School."}, {"section_title": "Natural Resources", "text": "The most important natural resource upon which North Kingstown is dependent is its water supply. The town's water comes from three different aquifers, the Hunt, Annaquatucket, and Pettaquamscutt. Current water usage is well below safe yield levels and water is supplied to parts of both Narragansett and Jamestown. Volume II of the North Kingstown Water Supply System Management Plan deals extensively with emergency responses and mitigation actions for droughts, water contamination, supply disruption, and many other situations. Impermeable surfaces above the aquifer can severely restrid the amount of water infiltrating the ground and recharging the aquifer, exacerbating the effects of a drought. With almost 50 percent of the town being forested, wildfire can be a concern, especially during drought conditions . Large areas of forested lands include the town owned parks, Cocumscussoc State Park, and private lands, mostly in the western and southern parts of the town . The town 's aquatic environments are significant not only for their high level of quality but also in their susceptibility to disruption from natural and manmade events. Flooding may also pose a significant risk to the RI Department of Environmental Management fish hatchery on Hatchery Road. In the event of septic failure due to flooding or storm surge, the resulting discharge could severely impact, and even destroy, important aquatic habitats such as eelgrass beds and shellfisheries. Large-scale coastal storms can also cause serious erosion to town beaches, thereby eliminating important coastal buffers and town recreational areas."}, {"section_title": "Shelters and Evacuation Routes", "text": "The number of people seeking emergency shelter in the event of a natural disaster is difficult to determine; it can be affected by the type and severity of the disaster, amount of forewarning, awareness of shelter locations, and the number of alternative destinations for individual residents. Severe storms with little forewarning can cause the most stress on shelter capacity, as people are more likely to seek shelter when they have less time to make alternative arrangements. Residents of nursing homes and mobile home parks are often the most likely groups to seek public shelter in the event of a natural disaster. Tourists visiting the town may also require shelter access, especially during the summer months that coincide with the hurricane season. As with emergency shelter use, it is also difficult to determine how many residents will evacuate coastal areas in the event of a severe storm , except in cases in which evacuation is mandatory. Many people often decide to remain in their homes for the duration of a storm . Evacuation routes for residents leaving the coastal evacuation areas, designated using the SLOSH models, have been created by the North Kingstown Police Department (Map 2) . To facilitate evacuation, traffic control points to be manned by police officers during an evacuation have been created at significant road crossings and bridges (Map 2). Evacuating some areas will be of special concern due to limited access, specifically those places with only a single access road that can potentially be blocked by flooding or downed trees. Loop Drive in Wickford, which can only be exited over the Loop Drive Culvert, is one such place where flooding could keep residents from evacuating."}, {"section_title": "Coordination with Neighboring Municipalities", "text": "North Kingstown borders on six other towns : East Greenwich, Exeter, Jamestown, Narragansett, South Kingstown, and Warwick. Issues concerning hazard mitigation transcend these boundaries requiring that planning for natural hazards coordinate with , and make considerations to, these neighboring municipalities. Water is one of the most important issues concerning North Kingstown and many of its neighbors regarding to both its source and supply. The aquifers from which the town draws its drinking water extend into East Greenwich and Exeter, requiring that mitigation issues concerning drought and water supply contamination be coordinated with these towns . In addition, the Town supplies water to Jamestown and Narragansett such that water use restrictions during a drought must be coordinated with these towns. The North Kingstown Water Supply Management Plan deals with many of these inter municipal issues. Emergency evacuation is another important issue that in some places requires cooperation with neighboring towns. Residents of both Jamestown and Narragansett will be utilizing North Kingstown evacuation routes in the event of a natural disaster. Jamestown, in particular, could have many residents evacuating through North Kingstown on Route 138. Some North Kingstown residents may evacuate through Warwick and East Greenwich across the Forge Road Bridge or Warwick residents may come through North Kingstown over the same bridge. Evacuation routes and emergency shelters are issues that should be coordinated amongst all seven of these neighboring communities for the safety of all area residents. Other areas for cooperation between towns have been identified in the actions portion of the plan. Before the plan can be amended into the comprehensive plan copies, will be provided to the neighboring communities for their review and comment"}, {"section_title": "-Mitigation Actions", "text": "After reviewing the town's existing hazard mitigation activities and capabilities for expansion, the North Kingstown Hazard Mitigation Committee has created a set of actions in order to address the previously identified risks and vulnerabilities and achieve the town's hazard mitigation goals. These actions will serve as an implementation plan as the town attempts to reduce its vulnerability to natural disasters. The actions are intended to reduce risks to public safety and to existing structures as well as to future development in town ."}, {"section_title": "Existing Hazard Mitigation Activities and Town Capabilities", "text": "There are many existing plans, policies, and reports that in some way contribute to or inform the hazard mitigation process in North Kingstown . In order to formalize and greatly expand the town's hazard mitigation program, the town will use the capital improvement program to schedule funding for implementation of the actions in this Hazard Mitigation Plan. The comprehensive plan has several different objectives and actions that can contribute to hazard mitigation. In the Transportation element, the plan calls for the creation of a bridge management program (Action C.1 .9.2), which will ensure the continuous management and upkeep of the town's bridges, in effect making them more hazard resistant. In addition, the plan calls for improving roadway drainage (Action C.1 .9.6) and improved storm water systems (Action C.1.9.7). Both of these actions will decrease the effects of flooding. In the Natural and Cultural Resources Element, Action NC .1.3.14 addresses reducing the amount of impervious surfaces in the town . Reduced impervious surfaces in flood zones can lower flood levels. The Community Services Element has many actions and objectives that can serve hazard mitigation including a new fire station at Quonset Point (Action CS.9.1.2) and providing for the secure storage and protection of vital town records (Action CS.14.2.3). Protection of the town's water supply is a critical component of this element, as reflected in Goal CS.8 Protect and Conserve Town Water Supply. Actions to protect the water supply appear frequently in the comprehensive plan and other Town plans and documents. The Town's Groundwater Protection Plan forms the basis of the groundwater protection overlay zone. This overlay zone regulates the uses and densities that can locate in the aquifer area in an effort to protect the Town's drinking water from contamination . The Water Supply System Management Plan has extensive actions that should take place in the event of natural or man-made disasters to protect the water supply from contamination. As an additional protection measure, the Town is committed to acquiring land and conservation easements in the groundwater protection areas. All of these actions limit the potential for groundwater contamination and ensure sufficient recharge of the aquifer, ultimately mitigating the effects of drought. Other pertinent documents include the North Kingstown Tree Inventory Management Plan. This plan recommends regular tree trimming to reduce the potential for damage to utility lines from fallen limbs. The Emergency Operations Plan also includes a framework to assist Town officials in planning and performing their emergency functions during a disaster. In addition to hazard mitigation, other related issues addressed in the Emergency Operations Plan include preparedness --aimed at saving lives and minimizing damage, response --aimed at preventing the loss of lives, reducing property damage, and providing emergency assistance, and recovery --aimed at returning all systems to normal post-disaster. The town also has a Hazardous Materials Plan, which lists locations in the town where hazardous materials are stored , and covers response and recovery in the event of a hazardous materials spill. In addition, the Harbor Management Plan will be updated to incorporate a Storm Preparedness Plan, which will include many of the actions developed in the Hazard Mitigation Plan."}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Goals", "text": "The town's mitigation goals, which these actions are intended to achieve, are, in order of priority, to : 1) Reduce risks from natural hazards to life and property in North Kingstown , 2) Ensure the safety of children from natural hazards, 3) Ensure that the town's emergency services will be operational during a natural disaster, and plans are in place to expedite recovery after a disaster. 4) Reduce the vulnerability of the town's infrastructure and utilities to natural hazards, 5) Reduce the vulnerability of municipal facilities to natural hazards, 6) Reduce the vulnerability of the town's cultural resources to natural hazards, 7) Reduce risks from natural hazards to the employees and facilities at Quonset Point, and 8) Reduce the vulnerability of the town's recreational resources to natural hazards.

The mitigation actions in this plan are grouped according to the vulnerable area each is intended to protect."}, {"section_title": "Identification of Mitigation Actions", "text": "Mitigation actions are actions that are designed to reduce a town's vulnerability to the effects of natural disasters. Mitigation actions are different from emergency preparedness actions in that emergency actions address a town's response to a hazard event, while mitigation attempts to reduce the amount of damage a natural hazard can possibly cause in the first place. An emergency action in response to flooding would involve decisions about how to build an emergency sandbag levee while a mitigation plan would involve ensuring structures in the flood zone area are flood-proofed or even ensuring that there are no structures in the flood zone area to begin with. Essentially, mitigation is about reducing the dangers, costs, and need for emergency action that is usually associated with natural disaster events. Actions were drawn from the FEMA approved hazard mitigation plans of other Rhode Island towns, the deliberations of the Hazard Mitigation Committee, suggestions from the public, and the research of the planning staff. Actions were chosen for implementation based on their being within the authority and ability of the town to enact, being feasible, and having mitigation benefits sufficient to justify their costs of implementation. An example of an action that was considered but not selected for implementation was the idea of assessing vulnerability of cell phone towers to high winds and retrofitting as necessary. This action was not included because this was seen as the jurisdiction of each individual cell phone service provider. All of the actions included in the following action plan are considered appropriate for implementation given local conditions. Each action includes a brief description of what the action will accomplish, who the responsible parties are, how much it will cost, how the action will be financed, and in what time frame the action will be completed . Some actions include reference to an example of how the action has been implemented elsewhere. The actions identified include modifications to the built environment, changes in town policies, distribution of public information on hazard risks, and the creation of community based organizations. In addition, consideration has been made for actions to be taken both before and after a disaster occurs."}, {"section_title": "Prioritization of Actions", "text": "The vulnerable areas identified on the Risk Assessment Matrix were prioritized according to the town's hazard mitigation goals. The highest priority was assigned to areas where life and property or child safety would be at risk followed by emergency services, infrastructure, utilities, municipal facilities , cultural resources, Quonset Point, and recreational resources . Further prioritization was based on a variety of considerations including historical damage, number of residents potentially impacted, and the value of property, in economic as well as cultural/environmental terms . The priority assignment given to the vulnerable areas on the matrix plays a role in determining money allocation and the timeframe priority given to specific actions addressing those areas. The Hazard Mitigation Committee's prioritization of each action was based partly on the prioritization of the vulnerable area each action is intended to protect and partly on the magnitude of benefit each action is likely to achieve as compared to its costs and overall feasibility. An example of an action that was selected for implementation and assigned high priority is the creation of a volunteer disaster assistance program. This program could be developed quickly without great expense and would be very beneficial for the preservation of life and property in the case of a natural disaster. The Hazard Mitigation Committee created a set of time frames for the completion of each hazard mitigation action: Short term actions will be completed within six months, medium term actions within six to 18 months, and long term actions will be completed within 18 months to five years. In addition, some actions have been identified as ongoing, indicating that such an action requires continual implementation over time. In general, the time frame assigned to each action also corresponds to its priority. High priority actions were assigned a short term time frame and low priority actions were assigned a long term time frame."}, {"section_title": "Life and Property", "text": "Vulnerable Area #1 : Coastal Neighborhoods The Town will continue to take steps to protect land in flood zones and coastal areas. As a priority list of properties targeted for open space protection is developed, hazard mitigation, primarily targeting flood prone areas, will be an important part of the prioritization process. Attention will also be given to providing public coastal access and habitat protection. Volunteers working at the community level can be tremendous asset to hazard mitigation efforts before, during, and after a natural hazard event. A community member acting as a Volunteer Disaster Assistance officer could coordinate community mitigation activities, act as a local hazard information source, and offer assistance to residents not able to help themselves. In preparation for an impending disaster, volunteers could help residents prepare their homes and facilitate evacuations if necessary. After a disaster, qualified volunteers could provide an initial damage report to town agencies, perhaps help the building department in providing emergency building permits, and aid resident clean-up efforts. These volunteers could be associated with community homeowners associations or neighborhood watch groups. The Town will provide the framework under which these organizations would be created , limited funding , and a weekend long training session. The training session would include discussion of liability issues, hazard mitigation techniques that homeowners can perform, a description of how the town would operate during and after an emergency, and any other information deemed necessary. Lead: Other responsible parties: Property owners will be informed of their natural hazard vulnerabilities ; this information will be passed on to renters as well. In addition, these brochures will encourage residents and businesses in vulnerable areas to form emergency plans and to assess the ability of their structures to withstand flooding, high winds, and earthquakes. Instructions for self-assessment of structure vulnerabilities will be included . Techniques homeowners can utilize on their properties for long-term hazard mitigation and for protection from impending storms will be compiled and distributed to properties located in vulnerable areas. Accompanying these brochures will be a description of town evacuation routes and shelters. The brochures will also be distributed to area builders and contractors.

This leads to higher levels of flooding and erosion. The Town will encourage the use of permeable paving materials and other creative means for controlling storm water by residential , commercial , and industrial landowners. A packet will be developed containing a selection of best management practices for storm water management. The Town is in the process of developing a storm water management plan. As this plan is developed, priority will be given to those storm water management improvements that coincide with evacuation routes and roads that offer a single point of access to flood vulnerable neighborhoods. Lead: Other responsible parties: Develop a list of properties in flood prone areas, especially coastal 'V' zones, for potential acquisition after a severe storm event in which the structure has been seriously damaged or destroyed. Repetitive loss properties should be prioritized on this list. NFIP requires that if a property is damaged or renovated totaling more than 50 percent of the property's market value it must be rebuilt to meet flood zone regulations. Coastal properties in the same situation would also have to meet CRMC requirements. Lead: Other responsible parties: The Chamber of Commerce will develop strategies to help local businesses in flood prone and coastal areas recover from the effects of a natural disaster. These strategies will include organizing business owners for collective clean-up of their properties after a disaster and the creation of a list of businesses and the people connected with those businesses that are authorized to enter the business in the period of time immediately after a disaster. This list would be for the use of the police department in their role of guarding properties after a disaster. The police department will develop criteria for determining when safety considerations outweigh the right of a given business owner to access their property. The Scalabrini Villa Nursing Home is the only elderly housing facility in North Kingstown vulnerable to the effects of a severe storm. The facility is located in a SLOSH evacuation area indicating that it is susceptible to damage from the storm surge and wind associated with a hurricane. The building official will notify the facility of its vulnerability and an evacuation plan will be developed by the facility with the support of the police department. In the event of destruction , or damage equaling more than 50 percent of the structure, consideration should be given to moving the facility to a new location. The police and fire departments will maintain their list of elderly and handicapped residents living independently in the Town. The list will be divided by evacuation area and susceptibility to flooding or storm surge. The Wickford Village Housing complex is in the Five Hundred Year Flood Zone and the SLOSH (B) evacuation area. The planning department will inform the facility of its vulnerabilities and provide assistance towards self-assessment of the building as to its structural vulnerability to flood, high winds, earthquake, extreme winter weather, and power loss. Retrofitting will be conducted as necessary. The building's wastewater system is connected to the town police station as well. In addition, an evacuation plan coordinated with the town plans should be developed by the facility for senior and disabled residents. There are many apartment and mill buildings in the town built before the 1977 state building codes regarding earthquake resistance were adopted. The building official's office will provide assistance to property owners conducting self-evaluations of their property's structural vulnerability to earthquakes. A collection of retrofit techniques will be compiled and made available to property owners. In order to better inform the town's hazard mitigation efforts, an inventory of vulnerable assets will be conducted. The top priority for this analysis will be the natural hazard of greatest concern to the town , hurricanes, following which , other hazards will be analyzed. The inventory will make use of FEMA's HASUZ-MH software and will include structures, infrastructure, and critical facilities including any anticipated future developments. As a result of this analysis, dollar estimates will be generated of potential losses due to damage to structures, their contents, or loss of function. The information generated will be made available to the public and included in the next update of this Hazard Mitigation Plan.

Three of those schools are coastal and therefore susceptible to storm surge as well. The schools will be inspected to determine their vulnerability to damage and steps will be taken to make these schools more flood and storm resistant. Important school records should be stored in a manner to protect them from flood damage. Lead: Other responsible parties: In the event of one of the schools in the flood zone being destroyed or severely damaged such that repair would cost at least 50 percent of the value of the property, consideration will be made of moving the school's location to an area outside the flood zone. If the school is not moved, than it will be rebuilt according to FEMA standards for structures in flood zones.

The building official will inform these facilities of their vulnerabilities and provide them with information on steps they can take to reduce their structural vulnerability to flooding and storm surge. In addition, post disaster relocation will be considered . Each facility will be responsible for developing an evacuation plan, with the assistance of the police department and coordinated with the town-wide plan for schoolchildren.\nOther responsible parties: By Red Cross estimations, shelter capacity in North Kingstown needs to accommodate 1,897 more people than it currently does. The Town will work with the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Red Cross to designate more shelters in the town and on a regional basis, to accommodate all town residents who might be seeking shelter in the event of a natural disaster. The Town will continue to maintain the current shelters based on the standard requirements for emergency shelters as determined by the Red Cross. As the town population increases in the future, the Town will ensure that adequate emergency shelter capacity exists. The Emergency Operations Center is located in a SLOSH (8) area indicating that it may be susceptible to damage during a category 3 or stronger hurricane. The police and fire departments will take steps to ensure that the operational ability of the center will not be impaired during such a storm event. One critical role this facility plays is as a communication center. The Town will look at the feasibility of a disaster emergency help line based at this center that town residents can call for information and help in preparing their homes for an approaching storm. The Air and Army National Guard Units stationed at Quonset Point would be an important asset to the town and state in the event of a natural hazard event. The base is located in a flood zone (A) and in a SLOSH (8) area. To ensure that National Guard units will be able to respond during a natural hazard, steps will be taken to protect the base structures and equipment. Structures will be inspected for their flood and earthquake vulnerability and structural renovations will be made as necessary. Procedures for shifting the operational base during a severe storm if necessary will be developed. The Town will develop a plan for collecting and disposing of debris after a storm event. Locations where debris can be collected will be determined , with different locations for potentially hazardous debris, such as propane tanks, made separate. A list of hazardous material handlers regulated by the EPA can be found at http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/em/index.html. As hazardous waste handlers and treatment facilities will be in high demand during a natural hazard event, the Town should actively seek an agreement with one or more such vendors in order to ensure a timely response at a reasonable price. Even with this precaution , the site for hazardous material containment should be able to hold that material for an extended duration. All dams will be inspected to determine their vulnerability to failure during a flood . Each dam will be classified by town or private ownership and by the level of risk associated with dam failure. As dams in need of repair, replacement, or removal are identified, these actions will be carried out by the town for town-owned dams. A plan for remediation of privately owned dams should be developed by the state. A schedule for dam inspection will be set so that there will be continued monitoring of the dams in town. All town bridges will be inspected for structural integrity to determine their individual vulnerability to damage in the event of flood or earthquake. Bridges will be retrofitted as needed. A schedule of inspection will be developed to ensure that all bridges are maintained at a high level of safety. The North Kingstown Water Department already has emergency plans in place to respond to broken water lines. These plans deal with shutting down the water and protecting the water from contamination . The Water Department will review these plans and determine if they adequately cover the possibility of a bridge being washed out by flooding and the possibility of water supply contamination that could result from floodwaters entering the system . Isolation block valves will be identified on either side of these bridges in order to separate a breached area from the rest of the water system. In addition, the water department will analyze the water service maps in order to ensure that water can be adequately supplied to all customers even after a bridge has been washed out. The RIEDC wastewater treatment facility is in a 'V' flood zone indicating that it is susceptible to breaking wave action during a serious storm . In addition it is in a SLOSH (A) area such that any hurricane will potentially impact the facility. The facility is elevated and designed for operation in the flood zone. The Town will work with the RIEDC to ensure that the facility is inspected for its ability to withstand these impacts and retrofitted as necessary. If the facility is determined to be vulnerable to damage a plan for protecting the facility, perhaps using a portable dike and pumping equipment, will be developed by the RIEDC in conjunction with the Town . The Town and the Narragansett Electric Company will continue to maintain street trees and other trees close to utility lines in a manner that will protect those lines in the event of a storm. This action will serve the additional benefit of reducing the amount of debris generated during the storm thereby reducing clean-up costs. The town Tree Inventory Management Plan calls for the removal of many different trees across town. Those trees from this list that pose a threat to utility service or other property in the event of a natural hazard will be prioritized for removal. If electric lines are put underground, than the phone lines should be considered for this treatment as well . Lead: Other responsible parties: Property owners will be contacted and these businesses will be requested to develop plans that ensure the containment of hazardous materials in the event of a severe storm or hurricane. Special attention will be paid to underground storage tanks that could float or rupture in the event of flooding . The property owners will be given information on how to assess the structural integrity of the two service stations in terms of resistance to flood and winds. The Town Hall is located in the 500-year flood zone and in a SLOSH (A) area. The building will be inspected to determine its need for flood proofing and earthquake retrofit. Renovations will be made as necessary. Records will be stored in such a way that they are protected from flooding in the building . Lead: Other responsible parties: The Town Hall Annex is located in an (A) flood zone and in a hurricane surge area that has experienced repeated flooding during past storms. The town will take steps to protect the records and documents currently stored in the basement of that building. Past flooding has damaged some of those records. The annex building will also be inspected and opportunities for flood, wind, and earthquake proofing identified. Retrofitting will be done as necessary with attention to maintaining the building 's historical character. Lead: Other responsible parties: The Beach Street facilities are in a Flood (A) zone and a hurricane surge area. All three buildings will be investigated for their structural vulnerabilities and retrofitted as needed. Attention will be given towards maintaining their historical character. In the event of destruction, the town will consider rebuilding these structures in another location. The library is located in the storm surge area. The Town will ensure that the library building will be able to resist the high winds and flooding associated with a severe storm or hurricane. The trees surrounding the building , with special attention to those on the waterside, will be well maintained with the removal of dead limbs and trees to prevent their being blown into the building during a storm . Trees removed will be replaced such that a natural wind-block is maintained . "}, {"section_title": "-Implementation", "text": "In any plan, the implementation section is one of the most important. Without a clear sense of who is responsible for a given action and in what timeframe it should be completed , many important goals can be lost. A plan must include a clear course for action. Each action description in the previous section includes a brief statement of responsible parties, funding sources, and expected timeframe for completion. These descriptions form the basis for implementation . From this basis, actions will be incorporated into departmental work plans. Individuals, organizations, and other groups outside of town departments with responsibility for plan actions will work with the appropriate town department to form a schedule for implementation and coordination with town activities. The Capital Improvement Program will be used to schedule the funding of actions from the town budget."}, {"section_title": "Plan Adoption and Incorporation into Existing Plans", "text": "Upon receiving approval from FEMA and RIEMA the plan was submitted to the North Kingstown Town Council and Planning Commission for final approval and adoption into the town 's comprehensive plan. The adoption of the North Kingstown Hazard Mitigation Plan into the North Kingstown Comprehensive Plan will ultimately have an affect on all nine elements of the comprehensive plan. In the land use section, further development will be directed away from hazard areas, such as the flood zones, as well as away from groundwater recharge areas. The evacuation routes and bridge maintenance make up the additions to the circulation element. Economic development is affected in many ways , from placing development away from hazard areas to forming cooperative agreements with businesses to ensure that adequate supplies are available to the town in the event of an emergency. The hazard mitigation plan will have some of its greatest influence in the community services and facilities element as outreach programs are developed to inform and prepare residents for natural hazards; as important building and site plan review processes incorporate hazard mitigation into their reviews; and as town facilities are retrofitted to protect them and the important records they contain from damage or destruction during a natural hazard. Natural and cultural resources will also be protected as plans are developed for park clean-up after a storm and methods of protecting historic buildings are researched and distributed. The open space, conservation, and recreation element will benefit from both the preserved open space in hazard vulnerable areas and the storm hazard plans that will be developed for the town's harbors. The Post Road corridor element will be influenced in the storm water management techniques and underground utility lines that will be encouraged for the purpose of hazard mitigation. Finally, the hazard mitigation plan will strongly affect the Quonset Point element in that, much of Quonset Point is located in flood zones and storm surge areas therefore requiring that new construction respect that fact and build to avoid and resist storm damage."}, {"section_title": "Monitoring, Evaluation, and Updates", "text": "The North Kingstown Hazard Mitigation Committee will meet at the end of the first and second six-month time period to assess progress on action completion and the effectiveness of actions already completed . Changes in timeframe or other aspects of implementation will be made as necessary. The North Kingstown Hazard Mitigation Committee will continue to meet twice yearly to assess the effectiveness of the plan, and make revisions as necessary to improve its effectiveness. The yearly updated plan will be submitted to and reviewed by RIEMA following local approval. In addition, the committee will meet following a natural hazard event to discuss the effectiveness of plan elements and to review community input based on their experiences during and after the event. Evaluation of the plan will consider whether there have been any changes to the nature, magnitude, or type of risks and whether the goals and objectives of the plan are still current and appropriate. Any need for new actions will be considered. Outcomes of implementation, thus far, will also be considered, including participation and coordination of all involved agencies, resources available for plan implementation, and any problems that have arisen in implementation . Future sea level rise will have a tremendous impact on the extent of damage caused by flooding and storms. At a minimum of 10-year intervals, the Hazard Mitigation Committee will assess the need for changes in the flood and storm surge maps and implement those changes as available technology permits. Actions and policies pertaining to properties in the current flood zones and storm surge areas will be extended to any properties falling within these new areas. In addition, hazard mitigation should be an integral part of any considerations for protecting coastal properties from sea level rise, whether by structural or non-structural methods."}, {"section_title": "Continued Public Involvement \u2022", "text": "The public will continue to be involved in the hazard mitigation planning process through our regular meetings of the Local Hazard Mitigation Committee to be held twice a year.

It represents an additional 15 percent of all the infrastructure and individual assistance funds that are provided to states to repair damages and recover from losses, and is administered by the state in partnership with FEMA. Having a plan or completed mitigation action matrix prior to a disaster event is extremely helpful in meeting the state's deadlines for applications and ensuring the project is eligible and technically feasible. It provides 75/25 matching grants on a competitive basis to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations that can be matched by either cash or in-kind services. The grants are specifically directed toward reducing future hazard losses, and can be used for projects protecting property and resources against the damaging effects of floods, earthquakes, wind, and other hazards. Specific activities encouraged under the HMGP include acquiring damaged structures to turn the land over to the community for open space or recreational use, relocating damaged or damage-prone structures out of the hazard area, and retrofitting properties to resist the damaging effects of disasters.
