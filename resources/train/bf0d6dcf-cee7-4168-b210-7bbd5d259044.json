[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Brain aging is a multifaceted process that remains poorly understood. Despite significant advances in technology, progress toward identifying reliable risk factors for suboptimal brain health requires realistically complex analytic methods to explain relationships between genetics, biology, and environment. Here we show the utility of a novel unsupervised machine learning technique -Correlation Explanation (CorEx) -to discover how individual measures from structural brain imaging, genetics, plasma, and CSF markers can jointly provide information on risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined 829 participants (M age : 75.3 \u00b1 6.9 years; 350 women and 479 men) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database to identify multivariate predictors of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over a 1-year period. Our sample included 231 cognitively normal individuals, 397 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 201 with AD as their baseline diagnosis. Analyses revealed latent factors based on data-driven combinations of plasma markers and brain metrics, that were aligned with established biological pathways in AD. These factors were able to improve disease prediction along the trajectory from normal cognition and MCI to AD, with an area under the receiver operating curve of up to 99%, and prediction accuracy of up to 89.9% on independent \"held out\" testing data. Further, the most important latent factors that predicted AD consisted of a novel set of variables that are essential for cardiovascular, immune, and bioenergetic functions. Collectively, these results demonstrate the strength of unsupervised network measures in the detection and prediction of AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects approximately 10% of the American population over age 65, and several lines of evidence suggest that there is an extended preclinical phase during which treatments are most likely to be effective (Brookmeyer et al., 2011; Alzheimer's Association, 2018) . The growing list of potential biomarkers (from neuroimaging, genetics, proteomics, and cognition) offers increasing potential for early diagnosis of AD and better prognosis of age-associated diseases.\nThe most widely accepted etiological model for AD suggests there is a temporal order in brain changes that are characteristic of AD pathology, and map onto the phenotypic profile of amnestic cognitive decline (Braak and Braak, 1991; Jack et al., 2016) .\nAccumulation of beta-amyloid \"plaques\" in the brain has been traditionally identified as a hallmark of AD that typically begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Amyloid accumulation can be measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid tracers, or through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b21-42 (Hardy and Allsop, 1991; McKhann et al., 2011; Jack et al., 2016) . The relationship between amyloid aggregation and clinical symptoms is believed to result from amyloid-induced neuronal injury and subsequent degeneration through disruption of the tau protein -the key component of neurofibrillary tangles (Mudher and Lovestone, 2002; Hampel et al., 2010; McKhann et al., 2011) . Neuronal and synaptic loss trigger an atrophic state in the brain that is mirrored by decline in glucose metabolism in the temporal and parietal cortices, and increased accumulation of CSF tau and phosphorylated-tau (Brookmeyer et al., 2007; Mosconi et al., 2008; Mapstone et al., 2014) . These neurologic changes have a detrimental impact on cognition and daily living and are often exacerbated among individuals at genetic risk for AD (e.g., positive for at least one APOE-\u03b54 allele) (Corder et al., 1993) . Unfortunately, decades of research focusing on tau and amyloid as prodromal biomarkers for AD have not yet yielded measures that correlate well with patient health, suggesting that these classical disease hallmarks may not be ideal biomarkers of AD.\nMachine learning offers a promising alternative to traditional research methods for improving prediction of disease and identifying clinically relevant signatures of risk (Jensen and Bateman, 2011) . For example, Ray et al. (2007) used a set of 18 plasma signaling proteins to discriminate cognitively normal controls from people with AD and other forms of dementia with 89% classification accuracy. Similarly, Doecke et al. (2012) classified AD patients from healthy controls with 85% accuracy using a combination of plasma inflammatory markers, participant demographics, and clinical information (Doecke et al., 2012) . Although a thorough review is beyond the scope of this paper, most work using machine learning algorithms in AD research has focused on cross-sectional measures, despite increasing motivation to investigate biomarkers that predict conversion to AD in cognitively normal individuals or those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Pertinent to the present study, Westman et al. (2012) reported classification accuracy of only 58.6-66.4% for distinguishing people with stable MCI from those who progressed to AD over a 12-36-month period using a combination of structural MRI and CSF measures. That study used supervised methods, did not explore contributions of plasma to classification, and sought to classify MCI groups using an AD vs. control model.\nTo improve these results and better understand AD pathogenesis, it is important to determine the best set of variables (features) for predicting clinical progression, and how these features interact during specific stages of disease progression. Machine learning methods can identify predictors of diagnosis and prognosis, but most methods ('supervised' algorithms) require diagnostic categories to be defined a priori and this is contrary to what is known about the AD continuum. Systems biology approaches aim to address this by moving beyond discrete biomarkers of disease to biological networks that may better reflect disease complexity (Padmanabhan et al., 2017) . Here, we introduce a novel method -Correlation Explanation (CorEx) -to overcome several limitations of traditional machine learning techniques. CorEx uses information theory and unsupervised learning to identify combinations of biomarkers across a range of diverse data types that maximize predictive power for disease progression in AD. Using this approach, we aim to better understand predictors of decline in AD in a tractable and principled way. Here we used CorEx to study the discriminative value of over 400 genetic, plasma proteomic, CSF, imaging, and demographic measures from 829 participants from phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1). We hypothesized that CorEx would discover latent factors across various data types to enhance predictive accuracy for individuals at high risk for disease progression. We used longitudinal information on the diagnosis of each individual to test models that distinguished (1) stable cognitively normal (CN) individuals from CN and MCI individuals who progress to AD, (2) stable MCI, from CN and MCI individuals who progress to AD, (3) any diagnosis of AD from individuals who do not have or progress to AD over the time frame of the study. For each of these prediction problems, we determined the feature relevance. We hypothesized that using CorEx to boost predictive power, a latent factor representing the classical hallmarks of AD -namely APOE4 and CSF A\u03b21-42 and tau levels -would be among the most consistent factors for predicting clinical progression across analyses. We further hypothesized that predictive latent factors would correspond to brain atrophy and cognitive decline over time."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were collected from 829 individuals (350 women, 479 men) participating in ADNI-1 -a longitudinal study of biomarkers of AD.

This technique is based on the principle that combined learners (decision trees) can outperform single learners, and thus is aligned with the combinatoric network approach of CorEx. We used GBM for predicting diagnosis as it can be more robust to collinearity issues than other common machine learning models, and therefore suited for prediction with both CorEx factors and the corresponding original features. In GBM, trees are grown sequentially to reduce the errors of the previous trees, but the residuals are resampled, and a fraction of the data is available at each iteration to reduce overfitting. Learning is regularized through shrinkage on the learning rate. For our prediction tasks, data was randomly stratified by diagnosis with 70% used for training and 30% used for hold-out testing. Parameters were optimized using a grid-search under a 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validation framework on the training data only. Results on hold-out test data were used to determine the average accuracies across the repeated cross-validations. Given the disproportionate number of individuals between diagnostic groups, we applied model weights to balance the groups for disease predictions.

Many features that formed a CorEx latent factor are consistent with mechanisms known to be involved in the etiology and pathological expression of AD. Specifically, CorEx discovered plasma factors of apolipoproteins involved in established biological pathways (factor 15), and two latent factors of white blood cell count measures that were connected within the CorEx network (factors 12 and 18). Importantly, these three factors were among the strongest predictors of disease progression and brain atrophy indexed through TBM.\nMost CorEx latent factors of the brain depicted regions with functions that are known to overlap -such as bilateral measures for a particular region (e.g., factors 22 and 24; bilateral cerebellar cortex and pallidum, respectively), or distributed bilateral measures across the limbic lobe, encompassing both thickness and volumetric measurements (e.g., factor 6; amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus). Most other factors contained only one measurement type (surface area, volume, or thickness), or a combination of surface area and volume. Thickness measures were less likely to be combined with surface area or volume measures within a factor, in line with prior studies showing that cortical thickness exhibits roughly linear decreases with age in most brain regions, whereas cortical volume and surface area show overlapping curvilinear trajectories (Sanabria-Diaz et al., 2010; Rimol et al., 2012; Storsve et al., 2014) .\nAlthough the brain measures grouped within a factor were generally as expected from systems biology, certain plasma measures were not. For instance, we would not have expected that apolipoprotein H or clusterin would be grouped in a separate factor from other apolipoproteins, given their shared role in lipid transport, or that the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1 would be separate either, and that this ratio would be within a factor consisting primarily of immune markers such as monocytes and immunoglobulin E. However, in line with this, prior studies have shown that regulatory T cells promote the clearance of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins via increasing the expression of sortilin-1 and lipidmodifying enzymes by the liver, pointing to the interplay between the immune system, lipid metabolism, and the liver, which may synergistically mediate risk for AD (Getz and Reardon, 2014) . Here we found apolipoprotein B to be predictive of expansion of the ventricles, while Factor VII in the same CorEx factor was predictive of the longitudinal cognitive composite measure.\nAs shown in Figure 6 , the most important features in predicting progression to AD varied depending on the comparison group (i.e., stable cognitively normal, stable MCI, or more generally individuals who do not progress to AD). Volume of the left hippocampus -and the latent factor containing medial temporal and amygdala structures (factor 6) were highly important for predicting clinical progression from cognitively normal status (CN-s vs. CN-p/MCI-p), and those with MCI (MCI-s vs. CN-p/MCI-p). Conversely, latent factors of plasma markers were generally the strongest predictors of progression to AD in CN/MCI participants (CN-s vs. CN-p/MCI-p), suggesting that they may be sensitive markers of early disease progression. This supports the utility of plasma measures as an early biomarker tool, and corroborates the crosstalk between the peripheral and central nervous system in mediating risk for disease. Although previously associated with AD, certain plasma markers were not retained as latent factors following feature selection for any of our analyses (e.g., latent plasma factor 6 and 9), which includes measures of bilirubin and blood pressure related measures respectively, and factor 11 which includes very-low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and adiponectin. These findings may suggest that these particular markers are only nominally associated with AD, and that compared to other measures included here, they may not provide additional predictive power.\nThe most important CorEx factor predicting our cognitive composite were volume and thickness measures of the medial temporal lobe (factor 6), which are among the earliest regions to exhibit neuronal degeneration, neurofibrillary tangle deposition, and accumulation of amyloid in AD (Braak and Braak, 1991; Scheff and Price, 2003) . The most important plasma measures for our cognitive composite were the latent factor representing the hallmarks of AD, and CD5L, a soluble immune effector expressed primarily by mature macrophages that is involved in fatty acid metabolism and lipid biosynthesis (Sanjurjo et al., 2015) . Importantly, CD5L is involved in regulating the inflammatory response to pathogens and in developing and maintening the lymphoid compartment and may have additional relevance to AD through its regulatory roles of apoptosis and autophagy (Miyazaki et al., 1999; Nixon and Yang, 2011) . Additionally, although identified in a small sample of 78 subjects, plasma levels of this protein have been associated with neocortical amyloid burden (Ashton et al., 2015) . Given the established association between Th17 cells and CD5L, and the interaction between Th17 cells and neurodegeneration, these results suggest follow-up studies elucidating the specific role for CD5L in AD is warranted (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015) .\nCorEx discovered latent factors that showed greater predictive accuracy for AD progression than the individual hallmarks of AD, but no individual plasma marker showed greater importance than the latent factor representing the established AD hallmarks. This points to the importance of considering plasma markers jointly. Other factors were consistently important for predicting clinical progression across all of our analyses, such as chemokines and white blood cell markers of the innate and adaptive immune system (factors 12 and 13). An impaired immune response to toxic amyloidogenic substances may make it easier for amyloid to accumulate in the brain (Richartz-Salzburger et al., 2007) . Likewise, amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA expression is increased in peripheral lymphocytes in AD, and alterations in APP expression leading to amyloid deposition may also cause changes in peripheral immune cells, creating a feedback loop that ultimately may lead to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration (Jiang et al., 2003) . A subsequent decline in lymphocyte levels and lymphocyte percentages may indicate immune dysregulation or immunosenescence in AD. Similarly, neutrophils defend tissue against invading pathogens during sterile inflammation and increases in neutrophil levels are also associated with blood brain barrier disruptions and chronic inflammation in AD (Phillipson and Kubes, 2011; Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013; Zenaro et al., 2015) . Moreover, a set of dietary, immune, and inflammatory markers (factors 16 and 24) were more important predictors of early diagnosis than the hallmarks of AD (CN-s vs. CN-p/MCI-p). These factors included variables known to be modifiable by dietary and lifestyle changes, such as vitamin B12 levels and C-reactive protein (CRP). Factor 16 also included amyloid P component (AP), an important component of all amyloid deposits including those typically found in the brains of patients with AD (Yasojima et al., 2000) . These relationships are also supported by prior literature. For instance, one Finnish-community dwelling longitudinal study found that serum levels of B12 were protective against AD in cognitively normal individuals, and that there were potential interactions with homocysteine serum levels, another modifiable marker (Hooshmand et al., 2010) . Likewise, CRP is predictive of later cognitive decline in mid-life (Laurin et al., 2009) . Moreover, CRP and AP are both acute phase proteins of the innate immune response and colocalize in neurons in individuals with AD (Steel and Whitehead, 1994) . As part of the innate immune response, CRP and AP activate the classical complement pathway in an antibody independent fashion, and indeed factor 16 includes complement C3, further supporting the network approach achieved with CorEx. Activation of complement is important for opsonizing targets for phagocytosis and the subsequent destruction of pathogens, such as amyloid beta plaques (Hicks et al., 1992; Wolbink et al., 1996) . The autodestructive association of CRP and AP with activated complement fragments attached to host tissue has been seen in degenerative conditions, such as atherosclerosis and AD (Lagrand et al., 1997; Torzewski et al., 1998; McGeer et al., 2001) .\nA few aspects of the data on individual predictors deserve comment. Firstly, our data are based on a variable length of follow-up (roughly 1-5 years), which optimizes the available study information. A homogeneous follow-up interval would not have been ideal as it would have reduced the number of available participants progressing to AD and predictions based on a smaller sample size may generalize poorly. Secondly, the cross-sectional design of the plasma markers is an important limitation and we could not follow up on the potential cyclical or prandial changes of some of these measures, so we are unable to make conclusions about the specific trajectory of these measures. It will also be important to replicate these findings in future cohorts. We did not specifically evaluate other diseases of old age which may be associated with altered plasma markers. However, all individuals were neurologically normal aside from Alzheimer's disease, and conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are typically defined using measures included in our analysis. Additionally, sex was used as a demographic variable included in the plasma measures when constructing the CorEx plasma latent factors. As sex mediates multiple pathways involved in AD risk, such as APOE, some of these factors may have been grouped differently if we had constructed the factors separately for women and men (Riedel et al., 2016; Fisher et al., 2018) . Indeed, the CorEx factor 0 -which includes sex -was among the most important features for predicting longitudinal diagnosis of AD (non-AD vs. AD), though body weight and hormone levels also contained in this factor may be driving this association. Finally, although there is a disparate number of women and men with MCI within ADNI, we did not find CorEx factor 0 to be predictive of progression within this group. Future work will seek to address potential confounds and determine sex-specific risk profiles."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "We tested CorEx, a novel model-free data-driven approach to combine relevant groups of >400 potential biomarkers from brain imaging, genetics, plasma, and demographic information. We discovered a small set of tractable relationships in 829 participants across the trajectory from normal cognition to MCI and AD. While the relationships between some of the measures have been previously documented and several measures were known to be associated with AD, the clustering achieved with CorEx provides more direct evidence for a network of related measures and how these measures jointly predict disease progression, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. These results also demonstrate the power of CorEx to identify clusters of variables that involve synergistic and coherent sets of the original features, revealing stronger combinations of variables that may be only weakly predictive when examined as individual predictors. Our results point to the consistent importance of amyloid and tau across the disease trajectory, but also to the timepoint specific contributions of the immune and inflammatory systems, and to the role of cardiovascular health, hormone levels and lipid and glucose metabolism."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "BR conceived and designed the analysis, analyzed and interpreted the results, and drafted the manuscript.
