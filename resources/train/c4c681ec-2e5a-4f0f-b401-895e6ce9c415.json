[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "China Sea (SCS). Although the storms remain above a warm open sea, the majority of them weaken due to atmospheric and oceanic environments unfavorable for typhoon intensification in SCS, which therefore serves as a natural buffer that shields the surrounding coasts from potentially more powerful storms. This study examines how this buffer has changed over inter-decadal and longer time scales. We show that the buffer weakens (i.e. greater potential for more powerful typhoons) in negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) years, as well as with sea-level-rise and surface warming, caused primarily by the deepening of the ocean's 26 \u00b0C isotherm Z 26 . A new Intensity Change Index is proposed to describe the typhoon intensity change as a function of Z 26 and other environmental variables. In SCS, the new index accounts for as high as 75% of the total variance of typhoon intensity change.\nAccording to the data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), approximately half of the total number of tropical cyclones (Category 1 and above, hereinafter TCs or typhoons) that enter the South China Sea (SCS) from western North Pacific pass through a narrow gap between Luzon and Taiwan: the Luzon Strait ( Fig. 1a ) 1 . These Luzon Strait TCs (LSTCs) remain above the ocean throughout their lives, minimally affected by terrain 1 , and nearly all of them make landfall along southern China and Vietnam, causing considerable property losses and human sufferings 2, 3 . The coasts of southern China and Vietnam have in fact been identified to be amongst the world's most vulnerable to floods from TCs in future projected sea-level rise under climate change scenarios 4, 5 . The majority of LSTCs reached their maximum intensities in the warm waters east of Luzon and in the Kuroshio, and then weakened in the SCS 1 . The fact that the majority of LSTCs weaken after passing through the Luzon Strait suggests the existence of some common environmental factors in the ocean and/or atmosphere which are unfavorable to TC-intensity in SCS, thus making SCS a natural \"buffer\" which shields southern China and Vietnam from otherwise stronger typhoons from the open western Pacific. This study seeks to describe and understand what factors contribute to the buffer and how the buffer has changed over inter-decadal periods based on observations and reanalysis data. It should be noted that the same environmental factors exist, and our results would apply also to TCs that enter the SCS south (north) of the Luzon Strait; however, the intensities of these TCs may also be strongly affected by the mountainous terrain of Luzon (Taiwan). The LSTCs represent an ideal limiting group of TCs with the maximum potential of reaching their lifetime maximum intensities (LMIs) inside SCS. Besides satisfying our scientific curiosity, knowledge about the behaviors and variability of LSTCs and their dependence on the buffer can help improve storm risk assessments, which are required to formulate plans for long-term adaptation and storm preparedness. We will show that the buffer has weakened since the mid-1980s and early 1990s -coincident with the beginning of rapid rise in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level 6, 7 .\nPublished: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 SciEnTific RepoRtS | 7: 7418 |"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "(dark brown color along each track) shows the location where the TC is near its LMI, and Fig. 1b the number of LMIs per 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid. The majority of LSTCs (70%) reach their peak intensities in the western Pacific (WP), and weaken as they enter the SCS 1 . The remaining 30% continue to intensify and reach peak intensities inside the SCS, mostly over the warm waters of the northern SCS shelves prior to landfalls (Fig. 1b) . The SCS therefore serves as a natural buffer to dampen TCs. What are the dominant oceanic and/or atmospheric environmental factors that control the SCS buffer, and how do they vary over inter-decadal and longer time scales?\nPDO and SCS buffer. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation 8 (PDO) and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation 9 (ENSO) can potentially affect the SCS buffer. TC activity depends on the phases of ENSO and PDO 3, 10-13 . We focus on inter-decadal changes and begin with an examination of how the SCS buffer varies with PDO. As a measure of the buffer's strength, we define the ratio:\nty SCS S CS WP SCS TOT where N SCS (N WP ) is the number of LSTCs per typhoon season from June through November that intensify (i.e. have LMIs) in SCS (WP), and N TOT = N SCS + N WP is the total number of LSTCs per season. The R ty \u2264 1, and a smaller (larger) ratio indicates a stronger (weaker) buffer when less (more) LSTCs intensify in SCS. For the analysis period from 1951 to 2013, the R ty is larger (mean = 0.34) during negative PDO (denoted by \u2212PDO) years, and smaller (mean = 0.16) during positive PDO (denoted by + PDO) years ( Fig. 2a ). The R ty and PDO appear to be anti-correlated, Corr(R ty , PDO) = \u22120.45 (Fig. 2b) ; however, the sample is too short for their connection to be statistically meaningful, and another measure is described below. Nonetheless, it appears that a larger percentage of typhoons would gain strength and reach maximum intensity in SCS during the \u2212PDO than the +PDO years after passing through the Luzon Strait. A number of studies 3, 14 have shown that during \u2212PDO (+PDO) years, typhoons tend to form farther west (east) in the tropical North Pacific (see Supporting Information Fig. S1 ), resulting in more (less) typhoons entering the South China Sea (Fig. S2 ). Between 1951 and 2013, the average number of LSTCs per season is 2.6 during the \u2212PDO years, and 1.2 during the +PDO years. However, since R ty is a ratio, a larger supply of LSTCs (i.e. N TOT ) during \u2212PDO years does not necessarily lead to a higher percentage of typhoons that intensify in SCS, i.e. to a larger R ty . The probability distribution of intensification rates (\u0394V) of LSTCs in SCS in fact shows that the mean intensification rates between +PDO and \u2212PDO years are well separated. For a wide range \u221210 \u2264 \u0394V \u2264 15 kt per 6 hours, the intensification rates are positive during \u2212PDO and negative during +PDO (Fig. 2c ). The result is consistent with the apparent anti-correlation between R ty and PDO, noted above. Changes in R ty are therefore more likely caused by changes in the oceanic and atmospheric environments, which will be examined next.\nEnvironmental conditions. TC internal dynamics play an important role in intensity changes 15 . To study inter-decadal variation of LSTCs, we examine instead how large-scale environmental conditions have evolved, and seek some quantifiable metric(s) to describe the change. Environmental factors known to affect storm intensity are: (i) relative humidity (RH) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , (ii) environmental vertical wind shear V s of the horizontal wind 16, 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , (iii) large-scale vorticity (VOR) 16, 24 , (iv) SST 16, 20, 24, [29] [30] [31] [32] , (v) maximum potential intensity (MPI) 20, 28, 32 , and (vi) the depth of upper-ocean warm layer, measured for example by the depth Z 26 of the 26 \u00b0C isotherm 1, 15, 18, 32, 33 . For a shallow Z 26 , typhoon winds can more easily mix and entrain cold subsurface water to the surface, lowering the SST and reducing the storm intensity or even killing it. On the other hand, for thick Z 26 , the SST may remain above 26 \u00b0C despite the strong wind mixing, allowing the storm to maintain its strength or even to intensify. We calculate TC maximum potential intensity, MPI(SST) (m s \u22121 ), which depends on SST and the structure of the overlying atmosphere 34, 35 . Price 36 suggested that, due to mixing by the strong TC wind, a temperature (denoted here by T mix ) depth-averaged over some depth h mix would more realistically approximate the SST under the TC; the idea has been applied in various TC-genesis and intensity-change studies [37] [38] [39] . Here we calculate T mix by assuming a linear temperature profile between the surface and Z 26 below the surface, which is then averaged over h mix :\nwhere H v is the Heaviside function. A value of h mix = 80 m is used 37 . Equation (2) shows that, as the Z 26 deepens, T mix increases to approach the temperature of the warmed ocean surface where the SST is warmer than 26 \u00b0C, thus modeling the sheltering characteristic of a deep and warm upper-ocean layer. On the other hand, when Z 26 decreases, T mix becomes increasingly cooler than SST, thus modeling the cooling due to the more ready entrainment of cold water from beneath the shallower warm surface layer. As SST \u2264 26 \u00b0C, T mix is set to SST. The Z 26 is calculated using the monthly WOA data plus an anomaly Z 26 ' . The ocean is divided into 2 layers separated by the 26 \u00b0C isotherm. Monthly Z 26 and density difference \u0394\u03c1/\u03c1 o between the 2 layers are calculated using WOA 40, 41 (Fig. S3 ); then the sea-level anomaly (SLA = \u03b7') 42, 43 from AVISO is used to obtain Z\u2032 26 \u2248 \u03b7\u2032\u03c1 o /\u0394\u03c1. The MPI based on T mix is denoted as MPI(T mix ).\nIntensity Change Index (ICI). We develop an index to describe the above environmental effects on TC intensity change (see Methods):\nThe ICI is similar in form to the Genesis Potential Index (GPI) 44, 45 . However, while GPI is useful for studying preferred locations of TC genesis as a function of environmental conditions, we show below that ICI is a preferred index for studying TC intensity change.\nComposites for +PDO and \u2212PDO phases. We composite the above variables according to +PDO and \u2212PDO during the satellite altimetry period from October 1992 to 2013 ( Fig. 3) . We focus in the northern SCS (15-24N & 110-121E where all LSTCs pass) and use the notation \u0394 \u2212+ (\u03b1) to denote the difference in the variable \u03b1: \u2212PDO composite minus +PDO composite. Since +PDO is from 1992~2005 and \u2212PDO from 2005~2013 (see Fig. 2 ), \u0394 \u2212+ also represents the recent decadal change between the two epochs. We find that \u0394 \u2212+ (MPI) based on MPI(SST) is very weak, and therefore show only MPI(T mix ) and the corresponding ICI in Fig. 3e ,f. The \u0394 \u2212+ (WSH) decreases while \u0394 \u2212+ (VOR), \u0394 \u2212+ (Z 26 ) and \u0394 \u2212+ (MPI) increase. According to the above cited works, these changes favor TC-intensification and contribute to increased \u0394 \u2212+ (ICI) (Fig. 3f) , consistent with Fig. 2c that the intensification rates are positive during \u2212PDO and negative during +PDO.\nWe evaluate the contributions of the individual variables to TC intensity changes. We first compare with the literature the magnitude of the contribution; we then quantitatively assess the contribution. The \u0394 \u2212+ (RH) \u2248 +5% (Fig. 3a) is similar to the values previously reported as TC changes intensity 16, 19, 21, 22 ; however, the magnitude is smaller than the values of \u00b110% that distinguish active and inactive TC periods 46 , and in SCS the climatological RH is high, \u224870% or more at 600 hPa, which is generally favorable for TCs irrespective of the phases of PDO. A sufficiently strong WSH > 10 m s \u22121 can rip a TC apart, weakening or even destroying it [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, the \u0394 \u2212+ (WSH)\u2248\u22120.8 m s \u22121 (Fig. 3b) is small in magnitude relative to the climatological WSH of ~8 m s \u22121 over SCS 1, 47, 48 , and is weak compared to changes of 3~5 m s \u22121 found previously for significant changes in TC intensity 49 . The \u0394 \u2212+ (VOR) \u2248 \u22122 \u00d7 10 -6 s \u22121 (Fig. 3c ) is similar to the values previously found in studies of TC intensity change 16, 50 , but the composite is insignificant in northern SCS. The increased \u0394 \u2212+ (Z 26 )\u2248 + 16 m (Fig. 3d ) is a significant fraction (~25%) of the climatological mean Z 26 = 50~60 m in northern SCS (Fig. S3) . A shallow Z 26 allows cold subsurface water to be more easily mixed and entrained to the surface by typhoon winds 41 lowering the SST which in turn weakens the storm 1, 19, 29-33 .\nWe extend the above composite analysis for a longer period before the satellite altimetry era i.e. before Oct/1992. To estimate \u03b7' (hence Z\u2032 26 ), we note that SLAs in SCS and warm pool are correlated (Fig. 4a) 51 . In turn, both are closely related to the fluctuations of the North Equatorial Current bifurcation (NECBF) point near 12~13N east of the Philippines, such that sea level in SCS drops (rises) as the NECBF shifts poleward (equatorward) [51] [52] [53] , as shown in Fig. 4b . We therefore use a proxy of NECBF 54 to project it to AVISO SLA and reconstruct \u03b7' from 1982 to 2013. We limit our analysis to the period after 1980, since prior to that date the use of the NCEP data for TC parameters may be unreliable 55, 56 . We repeat the PDO-composite analysis. The results (Fig. S4 ) are similar to Fig. 3 , showing that during \u2212PDO (+PDO) years ICI is positive (negative) and the conditions are more (less) favorable for TC to intensify in SCS."}, {"section_title": "Intensity changes. To quantitatively assess the influence of various environmental factors on TC intensity", "text": "changes in SCS, we use the 6-hourly IBTrACS data to calculate the annual (typhoon season) mean intensification rates. We regress \u0394V against the variables (Fig. 5a ). We find that T mix and MPI(T mix ) are significant predictors of typhoon intensity changes in SCS. The SST, RH, WSH and VOR are poor predictors with large p-values. Except for VOR, their combined contribution to ICI is non-negligible however, and results in significant high correlation (r = 0.87, Fig. 5a ); thus ICI accounts for 75% of the total variance of TC intensity change in SCS. These findings support the results of the composite analyses. Indeed, the probability distribution of intensification rates sampled by ICI (Fig. 5b) shows that the mean intensification rates between positive and negative ICIs are separated over a wide range up to |\u0394V| \u2264 15 kt per 6 hours, and the mean intensification rates are positive for positive ICI and negative for negative ICI."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "We have demonstrated that a greater percentage of typhoons entering the SCS (i.e. greater R ty ) intensify during years of \u2212PDO than +PDO. The dominant cause is a substantial (25%) deepening of the Z 26 that tends to shelter the warm surface ocean from cool subsurface waters, which increases T mix . We noted before that T mix increases with both Z 26 and SST and Eq. (2) expresses the 'sheltering' property as described previously. Mechanistically, the deepened Z 26 makes it more difficult for TC winds to mix and entrain cooler subsurface waters to the warm surface, increasing the MPI and allowing a greater percentage of TCs to intensify in SCS. Thus we develop ICI based on MPI(T mix ) to describe the TC intensity changes. To assess ICI for regions other than SCS, we calculate the correlation between ICI and \u0394V (Fig. 6 ) over the western North Pacific. It shows a highly significant band of correlation with r \u2248 0.6~0.8 from the Philippines Sea to northern SCS. Such a good predictability is clearly desirable for storm preparedness and risk analysis. As altimetry observations are now routinely available, the ICI can be used to formulate a more accurate TC-intensity prediction scheme.\nWhy does Z 26 in SCS deepen for \u2212PDO? Local changes may contribute. The Z 26 can deepen due to a negative wind stress curl over SCS which depresses isotherms by Ekman downwelling. However, the surface wind stress curl (not shown) is positive during \u2212PDO years in SCS and cannot contribute to the deepened Z 26 . The Z 26 can also deepen due to heat transport into SCS from the western Pacific warm pool through the Luzon Strait. However, the Luzon Strait transport is positively correlated with PDO 52 , so that the heat transport deficit (surplus) during -POD (+PDO) years cannot cause Z 26 to deepen (shoal). Instead, we argue that the deepening of Z 26 in SCS is remotely driven (Fig. 4) , closely tied to the deepening of the warm pool waters as PDO turns negative.\nSea level in the western tropical Pacific including the SCS has undergone a rapid rise in recent decades since the early 1990s 57 ; the trend remains significant in SCS during the typhoon season (Fig.S5) . The rise is dynamically caused by the strengthening of the easterly trade wind as part of the response to the recent global warming trend 6, 58 . Independent analysis 59 also supports the idea that the strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation since the mid-1970s can be explained by rising SST. Therefore, since as sea level rises Z 26 deepens, both it and the rising SST lead to increased T mix , hence also a corresponding increase in ICI. Evidence that the Z 26 has indeed increased more rapidly in recent decades compared to earlier decades can be seen by comparing the two Z 26 -composites (Figs 3d and S4d), suggesting a modulation in recent decades by the rapid sea-level rise previously identified 57 . Should negative PDO continue, and sea level and SST continue to rise, our study suggests that the SCS buffer may further weaken. In that case, one may expect potentially greater number of stronger landfalling typhoons along the SCS coastlines in the coming decades."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Six-hourly typhoon locations and corresponding maximum wind speeds from 1951 to 2013 were obtained from the IBTrACS dataset 60 . Monthly atmospheric variables (for RH, WSH and VOR) were from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.

The SST from GHRSST (1982-2013, 1/4 o \u00d7 1/4 o ) is used in the calculations of various metrics related to TC-intensity. Monthly PDO time series 8 is used to compute positive and negative PDO composites (i.e. arithmetic averages) of various quantities. We focus on long-term variability and, except for the IBTrACS data, monthly climatology is removed from each time series. All quoted trends and correlations are given at the 95% confidence level i.e. the probability that the trend or correlation is due to randomness of the time series is p < 0.05.\nWe develop an index to describe the environmental effects on TC intensity change:"}, {"section_title": "RH MPI WSH", "text": "where F and the G's are some functions of the subscripted variables, \u03d6 = absolute vorticity at 850 hPa (s \u22121 ), RH = relative humidity at 600 hPa, MPI = MPI(T mix ), and WSH = |V s |. The functional F is a product of G's, and the G's some fractional power functions, i.e. ratio of polynomials of the variables raised to some power. Using the 6-hourly IBTrACS data, the exponents are calculated using an iterative Newton algorithm to maximize the percentage variance of \u0394V described by ICI, yielding Eq. (3). The effect of \u03d6 G is very weak and is omitted in (3). We also considered including the effect of the TC translation speed on TC intensity change 28 ; it too has only minor effects. We compare ICI with GPI. In northern SCS, ICI accounts for 75% of the total variance of \u0394V, compared to 30% for GPI."}]
