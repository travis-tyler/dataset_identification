[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is now recognized as an independent risk factor for accelerated cognitive decline and neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Less is known about the neurocognitive function of T2D patients with comorbid metabolic syndrome, despite their elevated risk for impairment. Computerized testing in 47 adults with T2D that met criteria for NCEP metabolic syndrome revealed that cognitive impairment was prevalent, including 13% in tests of memory, 50% in attention, and 35% in executive function. Partial correlations showed that longer duration of diabetes was associated with poorer performance on tests of basic attention ( = \u22120.43), working memory ( = 0.43), and executive function ( = 0.42). Strong associations between very low density lipoprotein and poor cognitive function also emerged, including tests of set shifting ( = 0.47) and cognitive inhibition ( = \u22120.51). Findings suggest that patients with T2D that meet criteria for metabolic syndrome are at high risk for cognitive impairment. Prospective studies should look to replicate these findings and examine the possible neuroprotective effects of lipidlowering medication in this population."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and reduced insulin production. The resulting hyperglycemia can lead to both microvascular complications, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, and macrovascular complications, such as cardiovascular disease and stroke [1] . In addition to these complications, a growing number of studies demonstrate that T2D also has adverse effects on the brain, including elevated risk for conditions such as stroke and dementia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . More recent work shows that cognitive impairment is found in people with T2D long prior to the onset of these conditions, with impairments on tasks of memory and executive function being likely [8] [9] [10] . A better understanding of these cognitive impairments has important clinical implications, as they have recently been linked to poorer disease self-management [11] .\nThe mechanisms contributing to cognitive changes in T2D remain poorly understood. Several parameters, particularly hyperglycemia [12, 13] , have been proposed as potential risk factors for cognitive decline in type 2 diabetics. In the Memory in Diabetes (MIND) substudy of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, for example, Launer et al. [14] found an association between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of chronic hyperglycemia, and lower cognitive function in patients with T2D. Despite this association, intensive glucose-lowering therapy had no significant effect on cognitive function in these patients. These results suggest that other factors besides hyperglycemia contribute to the cognitive decline observed in T2D.\nOne likely contributor to adverse neurocognitive outcomes in T2D is metabolic syndrome. T2D is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome [15] , a multifactorial disorder characterized by abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein levels, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Metabolic syndrome [16, 17] , as well as several individual components of the syndrome [18, 19] , has been linked to increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Given the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with T2D, it appears likely that components of metabolic syndrome may also contribute to the cognitive decline observed in T2D. Specifically, recent work [20, 21] suggests that lipid levels may be especially important contributors to cognitive function in persons with T2D, but no study has examined this possibility in persons with T2D and metabolic syndrome."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants.", "text": "A cohort study of English-speaking patients ( = 47, aged 18 to 75) with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome was recruited from the Cleveland Clinic Diabetes Center between June 2012 and December 2012.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The current findings show that cognitive impairment is common in patients with T2D and comorbid metabolic syndrome, particularly on tests of attention, executive function, and memory. Duration of T2D and VLDL levels showed strong associations with cognitive impairment. Several aspects of these findings warrant brief discussion. Finding a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in people with T2D is consistent with past work in both elderly and middle-aged samples [2, 6] . Such findings reiterate that cognitive impairment is not a complication of T2D that is limited only to older adult patients and that both T2D [4] and metabolic syndrome [27] are known to accelerate cognitive decline. This pattern is concerning, as cognitive impairment is associated with greater mortality [28] and disability [29] in people with cardiovascular disease and raises the possibility that a similar pattern exists in people with T2D. For example, cognitive impairment is known to adversely impact ability to adhere to medical guidelines, as found in patients with cardiovascular disease and obesity [30, 31] . It is highly likely that a similar pattern exists in people with T2D and metabolic syndrome and future work should examine this possibility A primary finding of the current study is the association between duration of diabetes and cognitive impairment. This pattern is consistent with the results from the Maastricht Aging Study where it appeared that disease-exposure time played an important role in the development of cognitive decline [10] . There are multiple central nervous system effects of diabetes. Advanced glycation end products are elevated in patients with T2D and linked with microvascular complications [32, 33] , Alzheimer's disease-related pathology, as well as impaired neuronal function, oxidative stress, and glucose hypometabolism [34, 34] . Chronic hyperglycemia in obese people with T2D may also accelerate cognitive decline via cerebral hypoperfusion [35] . These recurrent insults to the brain contribute to the progression of cognitive decline over the course of the disease and suggest that older people with insulin resistance are at highest risk for adverse neurocognitive outcomes.\nSimilarly, serum VLDL levels were closely related to cognitive impairment in the current study. Past work in other samples has shown inconsistent effects of lipid levels on neurological outcomes. For example, a recent study by RuiHua et al. [36] found no relationship between hyperlipidemia and cognitive function in a cohort of patients with diabetes. In contrast, smaller LDL size is found in people with mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease had small LDL size compared to control subjects (73% versus 66%) [37] . A recent examination of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging data showed a nonlinear relationship between total cholesterol and cognitive functioning [20] . Such findings suggest that the association between lipid levels and neurocognitive outcomes may be more complicated than typically conceptualized. For example, a growing literature demonstrates that apolipoprotein e genotype, a known risk factor for adverse neurological outcomes like Alzheimer's disease, is also linked to lipid profiles in people with T2D [38] including elevated levels of VLDL. Such findings highlight the need for prospective studies of cognitive function in people with T2D, particularly those studies that examine the possible neuroprotective effects of statin medications [39, 40] . If confirmed in larger studies, the strong relationship between VLDL levels and cognitive function in the current study suggests that it may be a modifiable risk factor in this population.\nThe current findings are limited in several ways and may not generalize to all samples. Although duration of diabetes and VLDL levels showed strong associations with cognitive function, the current sample is modest in size and replication in larger samples is needed. Similarly, lipid markers available for the current study were limited by those obtained through standard clinical procedures in a convenience sample and other markers (e.g., chylomicron and triglycerides) may provide greater insight into these phenomena. Prospective studies in larger samples are also needed to both clarify the direction of the above relationship and better clarify the independent relationship between VLDL and neurocognitive outcomes. Although it appears most likely that these medical changes would precede cognitive impairment, it is also possible that cognitive impairment leads to difficulties adhering to medical guidelines and ultimately poorer disease status. Similarly, the current study was able to statistically control for a number of demographic and medical factors that might influence the relationship between VLDL levels and cognitive function; there are many other factors that may also be important. For example, factors such as physical activity level and extent of cerebrovascular disease are related to VLDL levels and have the potential to impact cognitive function.\nIn brief summary, the current study shows that cognitive dysfunction is common in people with T2D and metabolic syndrome. Though replication in other samples is needed, elevated VLDL levels appear to be a modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in this population and a randomized trial may be warranted."}]
