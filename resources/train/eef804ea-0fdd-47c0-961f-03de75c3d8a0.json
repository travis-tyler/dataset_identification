This relatively recent field of geology offers a glimpse at tropical cyclone activity extending back into geologic time. Historic documentation of tropical storms extends only about 150 years into the past and is not necessarily representative of the geologic record. The historic record can be used to assess decadal and multi-decadal cycles and provide some insight into the near future climate. In order to understand the true return period and risk of major storms to coastal regions, a longer record, revealing low-frequency changes, is necessary. Such a record is available in coastal sediments, and in particular in the bottom sediments of coastal lakes. This dissertation comprises three manuscripts on the topic of the geologic and climatic history of northwest Florida during the last 5,000 years. It focuses on long-lived coastal lakes and their sediments. The coastal dune lakes of northwest Florida are unique features found in only a few other places in the world. These lakes provided a natural laboratory for this investigation. The coastal dune lakes were formed during the mid-to late Holocene when postglacial sea-level rise slowed. They developed in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and are hydrologically connected to Gulf waters. An improved method for identifying storm signatures and establishing the geologic record of storm occurrence for coastal regions through analysis of coastal lake core sediments was developed as a product of this investigation. The resulting storm model is a probability analysis of the isotopic and sedimentologic characteristics of storm-associated sediment layers. Through use of a statistical model with fixed covariates, the result is a more objective indicator of storm occurrence, and therefore of hazard risk, than previous methods of paleostorm analysis. This model provides a valuable tool for understanding and quantifying long-term storm history, and better assessing storm hazard risk for coastal regions. The long-term geologic record of storm occurrence was determined for northwest Florida over the past five millennia by applying the storm model. The storm model identified storm events and storm clusters in the sediment record. The modeled storm events separate into 4 periods of increased storminess during the late Holocene. This study has quantified the longterm storm history for the northwest Florida coast and provides a tool to enhance the assessment of storm hazard risk for coastal regions."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION Research Justification", "text": "Paleotempestology, the study of long-term regional storm history from geological proxy evidence, offers a glimpse at tropical cyclone activity extending back into geologic time (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Boose et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007). It is clear that the historic documentation of tropical storms is not necessarily representative of the geologic record, as it only extends about 150 years into the past. However, the historic record can be used to assess decadal and multidecadal cycles and provides some insight into near future climate (Landsea et al., 1999;Goldenberg et al., 2001;Klotzbach and Gray, 2008). Knowledge regarding the low-frequency changes in climate, extracted from the long-term record found in coastal lake sediments, is of considerable benefit in understanding the true return period risk of major storms to coastal regions. The possibility of more intense storms in a warmer future only enhances this benefit. Coastal lakes and wetlands are the focus of paleostorm research, providing a continuous history of coastal sedimentologic events. Coastal lakes and wetlands are periodically subjected to storm surge and overwash processes during catastrophic hurricane strikes when coastal dune systems are overtopped or breached. The environmental effects of major storms include significant damage to coastal systems, such as coastal retreat, loss of low-lying coastal infrastructure, increased storm surge damage, degradation of coastal wetlands, and saltwater incursion into coastal aquifers. Many studies have quantified prehistoric storms by counting sand layers in coastal sediment cores and employing other standard methods of sediment analysis (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007;Horton et al., 2008). In more recent studies, micropaleontology and stable isotope geochemistry have also been employed to identify marine inundation events in sediment core records (Hassan et al., 1997;Meyers, 1997;Lambert, 2003;Lucke et al., 2003;Lamb et al., 2005;Parker et al., 2006;Page et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Research Design and Objectives", "text": "This project has focused on the coastal geology, stratigraphy, and geomorphology of northwest Florida.

These lakes have been stable and in close proximity to the shoreline since their formation approximately, approximately 5,000 to 8,000 yr BP. There is a tidal signal evident in these lakes, and due to the lack of presence of a confining layer, is further evidence that they are the surface manifestation of a freshwater lens sitting on a coastal salt water wedge at the marine boundary of the surficial aquifer.

Their mode of formation and effect on the underlying stratigraphy are the subject of this investigation. The primary hypothesis of this study was that the coastal dune lakes of the northwest Florida coast were formed during the mid-to late Holocene when sea-level rise slowed, and have remained in close proximity to the dunes at elevations at or near sea-level since formation. The secondary hypothesis is that the coastal dune lakes represent wind-formed depressions filled by runoff and rainfall, and are perched on a regional humate horizon, separating them from the surficial aquifer."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise in the Northern Gulf of Mexico", "text": "It has been well documented that changes in sea level over the near-to moderate term (i.e, time scales of decades to centuries) are both connected with and sensitive to changes in climate (IPCC, 2007;Grinsted et al., 2009). Sea level has been rising steadily, with few exceptions, since the last glacial maximum, when sea level was approximately 130 meters lower than present (Fairbanks, 1989;Bard et al., 1990;Clark et al., 2009). By 7800 yr BP the Laurentide ice sheet had nearly completely disappeared (Dyke and Prest, 1987;Smith et al., 2011). Sea-level rise in the Gulf of Mexico began to stabilize approximately 6,000 to 8,000 yr BP (Blum et al., 2001;Balsillie and Donoghue, 2004). It was during this time that a period of much slower sea-level rise began in the Gulf of Mexico (Smith et al., 2011). Rates of rise decreased from 8000 yr BP by approximately 10 mm/yr to approximately 4 mm/yr by mid-Holocene time (Blum et al., 2001). As a result of slower sea-level rise after approximately 8000 yr BP, the modern shoreline and barrier island systems began to form, including those of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Taylor and Stone, 1996;Blum, et al., 2001;Donoghue, 2011). Pollen data from Camel Lake, FL, located approximately 100 km to the northeast of the study area, lends additional support that this region has experienced a stable and relatively wet climate over the last approximately 8,000 years (Watts, et al., 1992). Grimm, et al. (1993) studied a longer pollen record from Lake Tulane in central Florida and concluded similarly that the climate has been stable and relatively wet for at least the past 6,000 years."}, {"section_title": "Humates", "text": "Under certain conditions in coastal regions, surficial aquifers which are enriched in dissolved humic compounds can precipitate an organic cement within the coastal freshwatersaltwater mixing zone. The resulting deposit, known as humate, represents a cemented sandstone, which may possess sufficiently low permeability to serve as an aquiclude (Swanson and Palacas, 1965). Such conditions have existed on the northwest Florida coast for the past several millennia, with the stabilization of postglacial sea-level rise and the development of extensive coastal wetlands as a supply of humic compounds (Figure 2.1). On the northwest Florida coast humates are commonly found in subsurface soil layers, in and beneath marsh deposits, and in shore and beach sands of bayous and bays near groundwater seeps and teacolored streams (Swanson and Palacas, 1965). Humic substances in sediments (typically sands), have a dark brown to black coal-like composition and appearance, and have commonly been called \"hardpan\" or \"asphalt\" (Swanson and Palacas, 1965;Schnitzer and Kahn, 1972). The humic substances which make up the cementing agent for humates are widely distributed throughout nearly all natural waters on earth, and are most commonly found in soils, lakes, rivers, and the ocean (Schnitzer and Kahn, 1972). The first step in forming humates occurs when humus (formed during decomposition of organic matter) is leached and dissolved in water (Swanson and Palacas, 1965). When humic substances enter different geochemical environments (such as when transitioning from freshwater to brackish or salt water, the pH change causes flocculation and precipitation (Swanson and Palacas, 1965). Finally, after the humic substances are removed from solution, they act as cement for sand particles, creating deposits commonly 0.1 to one meter thick (Swanson and Palacas, 1965)."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The study area is located on the northwest Florida coast, approximately 110 km (70 miles) east of the Alabama-Florida state border (Figure 2.2). While there are few inlets along the coastline a number of seasonal freshwater coastal dune lakes create temporary outlets through the dunes in several areas (Foster, 2000). While the shoreline is eroding in some places, mostly due to storms produced by cold fronts and hurricanes, it is relatively stable, maintaining its position with respect to sea-level rise (Stone and Penland, 1992). Sedimentation in the region is dominated by a net longshore transport toward the west, supported by sediment from the inner continental shelf and older Pleistocene shoreline deposits on the mainland (Stone and Stapor, 1996). The beach sediments in this region are nearly pure quartz with very little organic content (Randazzo and Jones, 1997).\nThe study area is on the northwest Florida shoreline (Figure 4.2). Sea-level change has strongly influenced the geological history of the area. The region has alternately been either flooded by marine incursions or exposed as dry land and sandy coastlines throughout much of its geologic history (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). The northeastern Gulf of Mexico region is tectonically stable, overlying a carbonate platform formed during late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic marine highstands. This region is also underlain by a subsurface structural feature, the Apalachicola Embayment, a northeast-trending complex graben system that extends from the Florida panhandle to eastern Georgia (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). The near-surface sediments in this region, as described by Scott et al. (2001), are primarily marine deposits from late Cenozoic interglacial periods, overlain by Quaternary undifferentiated sediments, beach and dune sediments, and alluvium. This study focused on the western Florida panhandle coast, a representative segment of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The Quaternary deposits of the region are primarily undifferentiated sediments overlain by alluvium, dunes, and beach ridges. This regional coastal morphology consists of a Pleistocene core of coastal and nearshore sediments, overlain by Holocene sediments comprising the modern dunes and beach (Otvos, 1982). Surficial deposits of this region of Florida are composed primarily of late Quaternary aeolian deposits (Otvos, 2004). The regional beach sediments in this region are nearly pure quartz, with very little organic content (Randazzo and Jones, 1997;Davis, 1997). Dune lakes are common on the northwest Florida coast. Coastal dune lakes are typically shallow, non-tidal, irregularly shaped basins located directly behind beach foredunes (CBA, 2012;QWP, 2012). The lakes are permanent, and most are moderate in size. There are seventeen named coastal dune lakes in the study region, most of which are shown in Figure 4.2. Other locales where such lakes are found are the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast, Australia, New Zealand and Madagascar (CBA, 2012). Sand dunes, ranging in height from 1 to 10 meters, separate the northwest Florida coastal lakes from the Gulf of Mexico (Stone and Penland, 1992). When the dunes are breached and the lakes open to the Gulf of Mexico, a temporary brackish transition zone is created between the ocean and the uplands, in which the saltwater and freshwater mix (Florida Lakewatch, 2008). The coastal dune lake selected for the project was Western Lake (Figure 4.2). Western Lake is located in Grayton Beach State Park, a relatively undeveloped area, and has a maximum depth of approximately 3.75 meters (12 ft). Water quality data has been collected regularly in Western Lake since 2001. The salinity in Western Lake ranges from near fresh (approximately 1 ppt) to nearly 25 ppt after storm events, with a mean value (2002 to present) of approximately 7 ppt. Additionally, the lake receives, on average, approximately 125 cm of precipitation per year (CBA, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Regional Geology", "text": "The northeastern Gulf of Mexico region is tectonically stable, enabling sea-level change to strongly influence the geological history of the study area. The Florida panhandle has alternately been either flooded by marine incursions or exposed as dry land and sandy coastlines throughout much of its geologic history (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). Clastic sediments overlie a carbonate platform formed during late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic marine highstands. A thick regional wedge of clastics, the Apalachicola Embayment, developed in a northeast-trending complex graben system extends from the Florida panhandle to eastern Georgia (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). The embayment dates from the mid-Mesozoic and is the result of regional extensional tectonics (Schmidt, 1984). The embayment is located between the Chattahoochee Anticline to the west and the Ocala Platform to the east. The northern end of the Apalachicola Embayment narrows and extends into the Gulf Trough in southern Georgia. The embayment then widens and deepens as it extends into the modern Gulf of Mexico. This region became a depression as the graben filled in the Early Cretaceous, and was a regional low until the Late Miocene to Pleistocene until the prograding coastal plain migrated over the area, and was then became the Apalachicola River delta in the Holocene (Schmidt, 1984). The southernmost extent of the embayment is not well established due to insufficient offshore well data (Rupert, 1997;Schmidt, 1984). The near-surface sediments in this region are primarily marine deposits from late Cenozoic interglacial periods, overlain by undifferentiated Quaternary sediments, beach and dune deposits, and alluvium. The regional coastal deposits consist of a Pleistocene core of coastal and nearshore sediments, overlain by Holocene sediments comprising the modern dunes and beaches (Scott et al., 2001;Otvos, 1982;Otvos, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Dune Lakes", "text": "Coastal dune lakes are typically shallow, irregularly shaped basins located within two miles of the coast (CBA, 2012;QWP, 2012). The lakes are permanent, and most are moderate in size (up to 200 ha). There are seventeen named coastal dune lakes in the study region on the northwest Florida coast. The lakes which were the subject of this study are shown in Figure 2.2. Sand dunes, ranging in height from 1 to 10 meters, separate the northwest Florida coastal lakes from the Gulf of Mexico (Stone and Penland, 1992). The lake water is generally dark in color due to watershed contributions of dissolved organic matter. While these lakes are exposed to normal weather conditions, Florida coastal dune lakes are significantly affected by the infrequent tropical storms which impact the area. The coastal dune lakes are of interest in part due to their intermittent connection to the Gulf of Mexico. When lake elevation reaches a critical level, breaching water forms an outlet through the frontal dune system and empties some of the lake water into the Gulf of Mexico. The temporary inlet, or slough, which is created, may enable salt water and marine biota to enter the lake. The slough remains open until equilibrium is reached and then is closed through natural movement of coastal sediment alongshore. When there is an exchange with the Gulf of Mexico, the lake becomes a brackish water-body and a temporary estuarine ecosystem may be created. Each of the coastal dune lakes has individual outlet characteristics, with outlet openings varying in length, frequency and duration (Hoyer and Canfield, 2008). These openings occur based on each lake's critical water level, which is driven by climatic conditions, such as precipitation. As a result, some of the dune lakes can be nearly completely freshwater, brackish, or saline (CBA, 2012). The substrate beneath the coastal dune lakes is composed primarily of muddy sands with organic material. These types of lakes commonly have slightly acidic, hard water with high mineral content (Hoyer and Canfield, 2008). Salinity levels can vary greatly, depending on local rainfall and storms. The lakes are generally oligotrophic with low nutrient levels (CBA, 2012). This study investigated six of the northwest Florida coastal dune lakes. From west to east they are: Campbell Lake, Oyster Lake, Draper Lake, Western Lake, Eastern Lake, and Camp Creek Lake (Figure 2.2). Oyster Lake has a maximum depth of approximately 2.4 meters (8 ft) and is located in a developed area, Western Lake is located in Grayton Beach State Park, a relatively undeveloped area, and has a maximum depth of approximately 3.8 meters (12 ft), Eastern Lake is located in a developed area and has a maximum depth of approximately 1.8 meters (6 ft). Campbell Lake is located in Topsail Hill Preserve State Park, and has a maximum depth of approximately 4 meters (13 ft), Draper Lake and Camp Creek Lake are both in developed areas and have maximum depths of 2.1 meters (7 ft) and 2.4 meters (8 ft), respectively (CBA, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing", "text": "Topographic data, based on LIDAR (LIight Detection And Ranging), was used to examine lake morphology and to determine dune elevations separating the six coastal dune lakes from the Gulf of Mexico. Recent LIDAR imagery was accessed from the NOAA Coastal Services Center Digital Coast (NOAA, 2012c).\nLidar data was collected for each of the selected lakes and verified by field surveys. Each of the coastal dune lakes has a natural slough, which opens up to the Gulf of Mexico when either lake levels become too high due to periods of intense rainfall, or hurricanes and related surge inundate the lake. The data show that Campbell Lake is 0.27 km north of the Gulf of Mexico, and is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by foredunes and natural forest (Figure 2.4a). This lake has an elevation of 1.33 meters and does not have a prominent natural slough. The minimum dune height is approximately 2.5 meters, and the mean dune height is approximately 6 meters. Oyster Lake is located 0.14 km north of the Gulf of Mexico, and is located landward of both the foredunes and Florida Highway 30A (Figure 2.4b). The lake elevation is 0.75 meters, and the lake has a natural slough to the southeast of the lake, though it has been anthropogenically altered through the installation of Florida Highway 30A. The minimum dune height at Oyster Lake is approximately 0.75 meters, located to the southeast of the lake, and the mean dune height is approximately 3.2 meters. Draper Lake is located approximately 0.1 km from the Gulf of Mexico, and is located behind a region of beach almost devoid of foredunes (Figure 2.4c). The lake has an elevation of 0.9 meters. The minimum dune height occurs where the natural slough formed by this lake is located, just south of the lake, having an elevation of approximately 1.25 meters. There are no foredunes directly in front of this lake. The mean dune height at this lake is approximately 5 meters. Western Lake is approximately 0.2 km north of the Gulf of Mexico shoreline, located just landward of the foredunes (Figure 2.4d). Western Lake has a lake elevation of 0.4 meters and is divided into two parts, arranged east to west. The eastern portion of the lake has a minimum dune height to the south of the lake of approximately 2.3 meters. The west side includes a natural slough, which is the dune minimum for the western portion of the lake, with an elevation of approximately 0.6 meters. The mean dune height for Western Lake is approximately 3.5 meters. Eastern Lake is located approximately 0.2 km north of the Gulf of Mexico, and is located behind the foredunes, with a natural slough occasionally present (Figure 2.4e). Eastern Lake has an elevation of 0.9 meters, and the dune minimum for the lake occurs at the outlet for the natural slough, having an elevation of approximately 1.0 meters. The mean dune height at Eastern Lake is approximately 4 meters.\nOyster Pond is approximately 0.35 km from the Gulf of Mexico and has an elevation of approximately 0.25 meters above sea level. The pond is located in a swale within the beach ridge set labeled \"I,\" as shown in Figure 3.3. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by younger beach ridges within the same set to the south and west, in addition to ridges in a younger ridge set, labeled \"J,\" further to the south. The beach ridge set of which Oyster Pond is a part, Set I, has a minimum ridge height of approximately + 1.25 \u00b1 0.09 meters separating the pond from the Gulf of Mexico (NOAA, 2012e). A small slough exits Oyster Pond and passes through the ridges to the south. Historically, the slough has been opened only by major storms. During recent time, the slough has been dammed. In beach ridge set J, the minimum ridge height is approximately +1.50 \u00b1 0.09 meters (NOAA, 2012e). Therefore the minimum height of storm surge necessary to inundate the pond is + 1.25 \u00b1 0.09 meters (NOAA, 2012e).\nWestern Lake is approximately 0.2 km north of the Gulf of Mexico shoreline, located just landward of the foredunes. The lake surface has an elevation of approximately 0.75 m ( Figure   4.3). Western Lake is divided into two parts, arranged east to west. The east side includes a natural slough, which opens up to the Gulf of Mexico when either lake levels become too high due to periods of intense rainfall, or hurricanes and related surge inundate the lake. The eastern portion of the lake, which is the most exposed to storm surge, has two possible areas which are subject to dune breach and inundation by storm surge: one to the south at approximately 2.3 m and one to the southeast at approximately 3 meters. The storm surge associated with Hurricane Dennis, in 2005, caused a minor breach in the dunes south of the eastern portion of Western Lake, creating a small overwash fan (CBA, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Stratigraphy", "text": "The stratigraphy of the coastal dune lake region was investigated in several ways. Borehole logs were obtained from the Florida Geological Survey (FGS) and Northwest Florida Water Management District (NWFWMD) in order to determine the occurrence and depth of humate deposits (Figure 2.3). In addition, several long sediment cores were obtained using a Geoprobe 54LT and a vibrocoring system. Cores collected with the Geoprobe were measured, photographed, split length-wise, and described in the field (Figure 2.3). Vibracores were extruded and described in the field.\nThe near-surface stratigraphy of the region was studied by collecting data from a series of Florida Geological Survey well logs, and collecting cores using a Geoprobe and vibracore system (Figure 2.3). The Geoprobe cores penetrated to a depth of approximately 10 meters. The vibracore penetrated to a depth of approximately 6 meters. Cores collected by both methods consisted nearly entirely of sand, with occasion pieces of wood or small pockets of muddy sediment. Humate-cemented sand and clay-rich layers that could act as a confining layer were not found. A study of lithologic logs of wells collected by the Florida Geological Survey in the coastal region of northwest Florida resulted in 14 lithologic well log descriptions (Figure 2.3). Three wells (labeled 8865, 8591, and 8873) showed the presence of humate-cemented horizons, at depths ranging from six to 15 meters below the ground surface. Well 8865, located near Campbell Lake, showed a layer described as hardpan from approximately 12.3 meters to 13 meters depth below surface. Well 8591, located closest to Western Lake, showed a layer described as hardpan in fine sand at a depth of 3 meters subsurface. Well 8873, located on the Intracoastal Waterway to the northeast of Camp Creek Lake, showed hardpan from approximately 1.5 meters to 1.8 meters subsurface, and also at approximately 7.6 meters subsurface."}, {"section_title": "Geochronology", "text": "Radiocarbon dates on humate horizons were obtained from previous studies (Lawrence, 1974;Otvos, 1982, Lewis, et al., 2003Koch, unpublished data). Radiocarbon dates were also collected from the bottom of cores collected for this investigation from Western Lake and Eastern Lake in order to determine a minimum age for the lakes. Subsamples of organic sediment from the cores were sent to the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute for radiocarbon analysis.\nSediments from the bottom of a core collected from Western Lake, having a sediment depth 1.3 meters, have an age of approximately 4,500 yr BP (Coor et al., submitted). Sediments from the bottom of a core collected from Eastern Lake, having a sediment depth 1.0 meters, have an age of approximately 3,500 yr BP (Coor, unpublished data). Radiocarbon dating has been carried out in previous investigations on selected humate samples throughout the study region, primarily focused along the shoreline (Table 2.1, Figure   2.5). Humate has been found in other locations, but dating was not carried out at these locations ( Figure 2.3). As previous studies have used the terms peat and humate/humus interchangeably, and erroneously, in the literature, samples with both labels have been included. Humatecemented sand outcrops closest to the study area showed ages ranging from 23,000 yr BP to 45,000 yr BP (Koch, unpublished data). Nearby samples on Santa Rosa Island yielded ages from the present to 1,900 yr BP (Stone and Morgan, 1993;Lewis et al., 2003).\nPb-210 and Cs-137 are short-lived isotopes commonly used to date sediment accumulations from the past approximately 100 years, in order to determine recent rates of sedimentation in lakes (Krishnaswamy et al., 1971;Robbins and Edgington, 1975;Stiller and Imboden, 1986;Robbins and Jasinski, 1995;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998). Pb-210, with a 22.3 year half-life, bonds to clay minerals, fine silts, and humic materials (Olsen et al., 1982;Chanton et al., 1983;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998) and is used for dating lake sediments, under the assumption that the atmospheric flux of 210 Pb, produced by the decay of 222 Rn, has been relatively constant (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998;Walker, 2005). Cs-137 has a half life of approximately 30 years, and is an artificial fission product that occurs in the atmosphere primarily as a result of nuclear weapons testing in the 1950's and 1960's. First entering the atmosphere in 1954, atmospheric concentrations of Cs-137 peaked at the time of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 (Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998;Walker, 2005), and rapidly declined in the following decades (Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998). Cesium, like lead, adsorbs to clay minerals, silts, and humic materials (Stanners and Aston, 1981;Milan et al., 1995;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998). The earliest occurrence of this isotope in a sediment core profile is generally taken to represent 1954, the year when it became commonly present in the atmosphere. A subsurface peak indicates 1963, a time-stratigraphic horizon for the peak year of atmospheric testing (Olsson, 1986;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998;Walker, 2005). By utilizing these methods, sedimentation rates for the historic period, in the upper portions of lake cores, can be determined with reasonably good accuracy. Pb-210 analysis results are shown in Figure 3 and have been so for at least several centuries, based on the OSL dating (Forrest, 2007). Occasional storm surge brings marine water and possibly sediment into the pond in a single event. The instantaneous input of external sediment appears as a deficit in Pb-210 profiles of the lake floor sediments. The Pb-210 activity data were analyzed using the constant rate of supply (CRS) model, which assumes that the Pb-210 input is constant from year to year, though the annual amount of sediment can vary (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978). The CRS method allows detection of episodes of high sediment accumulation, which in the case of Oyster Pond is indicative of storm events. Because the CRS age model requires the input of positive values of excess Pb-210 and a complete Pb-210 inventory, the upper limit of excess activity for each Pb-210 sample was used in constructing the model. Therefore, a storm year, with an above-average input of annual sediment, would show up as a negative excursion in a Pb-210 core profile. This effect is visible in sample numbers 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 14. These samples correspond with values lower than the expected exponential decay profile in the Pb-210 results, shown in Figure 3.4. The uncertainty associated with each sample, as determined through the gamma counting error, is also shown in Figure 3.4. The results from the CRS model are shown in Figure 3.5, where the age uncertainty has been calculated from the analytical uncertainty (shown in Figure 3.4), and is represented by horizontal bars. The Cs-137 results are also shown in Figure 3.4. The gradual decrease in the amount of detectable Cs-137 in the upper portion of the profile does provide evidence that no mixing has occurred in the core, either post-sedimentation, or during collection and handling. Using the CRS model to match subsurface horizons with calendar years, the sediment horizon that represents 1954, the approximate year that bomb testing began releasing Cs-137 into the atmosphere, should be at 35 cm. A subsurface peak, which would be indicative of the maximum concentration of Cs-137 in the atmosphere in 1963, should be observed at 33 cm (Chanton et al., 1983;Lynch et al., 1989;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998). Detectable Cs-137 was observed down to 45 cm, however. The explanation appears to be the fact that cesium becomes more soluble, and mobile, in sediments of nearshore (brackish or marine) environments (Tamura and Jacobs, 1960;Rogoski and Tamura, 1970;Aston and Duursma, 1973;Hetherington and Jefferies, 1974;Patel et al., 1978;Stanners and Aston, 1981;Olsen, et al., 1982;Kirchner and Ehlers, 1998;Walker, 2005). The absence of the 1963 peak is further evidence of the mobility of Cs-137 down the core. The groundwater of St. Vincent Island is both brackish and tidally influenced, and when combined with the mobility of the cesium isotope and tidal pumping, the downward movement of cesium in the sediment column might be an expected result. Other studies in this region have also shown a lack of agreement between Pb-210 and Cs-137 profiles (Hart, 2003;Mertz, 2007).\nA skim sample was collected from the sediment/water interface to determine the reservoir age of the lake. Additional samples were collected from 9 cm, 36 cm, 75 cm, 88 cm, and 127 cm depths in the core. The radiocarbon dates were converted using the CALIB 6.0 calibration scheme (Stuvier et al., 2012). The raw radiocarbon date for the surface sample, 230 +/-15 yr BP, was taken as the reservoir age, which was used in calibrating the samples. The raw and calibrated dates are shown in Table 4.2.

These lakes are at least 4,500 years old, based on the sea-level history of the northern Gulf of Mexico and radiocarbon ages of lake bottom sediment cores collected from Eastern Lake and Western Lake (Blum et al., 2001;Balsillie and Donoghue, 2004;Coor et al., submitted;Coor, unpublished data). Coastal dune lakes have been thought to develop from coastal processes such as excavation of the region behind the dunes by wind (aeolian processes) or by a confining layer perching surficial freshwater (hydrologic processes) as is common in Australia (LIA, 2012; QWP, 2012). However, in northwest Florida the coastal dune lakes appear to begin as a tidally influenced basin or lagoon that becomes enclosed due to sand filling its inlet (Hoyer and Canfield, 2008). Once the lake becomes isolated from the direct effects of the Gulf of Mexico, the water gradually becomes less saline, though levels may vary depending on evapotranspiration and precipitation. These unique ecosystems are largely fed from lateral ground water seepage through the surrounding well-drained coastal sands and runoff from the lake watersheds (Badha and Jawitz, 2008;Hoyer and Canfield, 2008). The coastal dune lakes have been shown through this investigation to have a tidal signal, visible at both a diurnal and semi-diurnal period. This microtidal signal is visible in both the time series and the Fourier transform ( \n\n"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Several significant findings have resulted from this investigation. First, the lake water level monitoring shows that there is a tidal signal present within five of the six coastal dune lakes studied, as evidenced from time series and Fourier transform analysis of long-term lake level data and correlation with tide gauge data from Valpriaso, FL. Second, the humate investigation shows that there is no evidence of a confining layer in the subsurface beneath Western Lake, which was investigated as a typical example of a coastal dune lake. The result of these two findings is the conclusion that the coastal dune lakes are not perched on a confining layer, as was originally hypothesized. Rather, they are the surface manifestation of a freshwater lens sitting on a coastal salt water wedge at the marine boundary of the surficial aquifer. Lastly, based on the data from Koch (unpublished) and Swanson and Palacas (1965) (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007;Horton et al., 2008). In more recent studies, micropaleontology and stable isotope geochemistry have also been employed to identify marine inundation events in sediment core records (Hassan et al., 1997;Meyers, 1997;Lambert, 2003;Lucke et al., 2003;Lamb et al., 2005;Parker et al., 2006;Page et al., 2009). Paleotempestology, the study of long-term regional storm history from geological proxy evidence, offers a glimpse at tropical cyclone activity extending back into geologic time (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Boose et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007). The question as to whether global warming may bring stronger and/or more frequent hurricanes has been debated among climate modelers in recent years (Emanuel 2005;Elsner et al., 2008;Knutson et al., 2010;Bender et al., 2010;Elsner et al., 2011;Grossman and Morgan, 2011). It is clear that the historic documentation of tropical storms is not necessarily a good representative of the geologic record, as it only extends about 150 years into the past. However, the historic record can be used to assess decadal and multi-decadal cycles and provides some insight into what might occur near future (Landsea et al., 1999;Goldenberg et al., 2001;Klotzbach and Gray, 2008). Knowledge regarding the lowfrequency changes in climate, extracted from the long-term record found in coastal lake sediments, is of much benefit in understanding the true return period risk of major storms to coastal regions. The possibility of more intense storms in a warmer future only enhances this benefit. Recent research suggests that an increase in intensity and possibly frequency of storms over the past 30 years is related to climate change and increasing sea surface temperatures (Elsner et al., 2008;McCarthy, 2009). Because hurricanes draw energy from warm ocean waters, warmer oceans have more thermal energy that can be converted to wind energy (Elsner, 2006;Elsner et al., 2008). Modeling studies indicate that an increase in sea surface temperature may result in an increase in storm intensity (Emanuel, 1995;Knutson et al., 2010). Wind shear, another important component of formation, may impact both cyclogenesis and storm intensity (Vecchi and Soden, 2007), due to the fact that vertical wind shear can inhibit the development (Goldenberg et al., 2001;Vecchi and Soden, 2007) and intensity of tropical cyclones (DeMaria, 1996;Frank and Ritchie, 2001;Vecchi and Soden, 2007). Observational and modeling studies to date may not accurately predict what may happen in the future, because they do not take into account wind shear (Vecchi and Soden, 2007). Observational studies have also shown that the strongest storms (Category 3 through 5) are becoming more frequent by approximately 30%, in addition to becoming more intense (Elsner et al., 2008). Thus the impacts of storms in hurricane-prone regions in the coming century may intensify, including increases in both surge and wind damage (Emanuel, 2005;Webster et al., 2005;Elsner, 2006;Elsner et al., 2008). Therefore, it is possible that with a longer storm record, determined through the geologic record, this important and heavily debated topic may be better understood. The primary hypothesis driving this investigation was that the long-term geologic record can provide a significantly longer baseline against which more recent changes in climate and storm frequency (on a century scale) can be measured. An additional hypothesis was that major flooding events leave an isotopic signature in coastal lake sediments, which may be discernible even in the absence of physical indicators of storm occurrence, such as coarse sediment layers deposited by overwash. The goal was to define a storm \"signature\" that is discernible in coastal lake sediments and which could be applied to other coastal lakes, in order to determine long-term storm frequencies.\nThe results from this prototype study demonstrate that an accurate storm history can be obtained from coastal sediment cores, based on a combination of isotopic and sedimentologic data, and calibration with the known historic record of storms. The new technique, and the model that has been developed, can be employed to identify storms in the sedimentary record that predate the historic storm database. A thorough investigation of the sedimentologic and isotopic properties of coastal lake sediments, and the creation of a model that can predict storms from that data, has shown that no single proxy is sufficient for identifying storm signatures. However, a combination of isotopic and sedimentologic data is sufficiently sensitive to discern storm surge events that have impacted lake sediment cores. The new methodology is more objective, and potentially more sensitive, than the standard methods of counting overwash sand layers or identifying marine microfossils in the sediments. By using the standard method of counting sand layers through x-radiography, only six layers can be counted in the core that was analyzed for this study. Similarly, by counting peaks in the grain size profile, seven peaks can be discerned, most of which correspond to sand layers visible in the x-radiograph. The isotope model employed in the study identified ten events verified by tide gauge. Additionally, the model identified several known historic storm events dating further back into the sediment record. Lesser storm events, which carry only marine/estuarine waters into the lake, without sediment overwash, can be detected by their isotopic and sedimentologic signature. The model that has been developed appears capable of detecting storm events regardless of the presence of an overwash deposit. The methodology developed during this investigation is capable of generating a storm history for any region in which long-lived coastal lakes are present.    Table 3.4.

The left vertical axis depicts depth in core, in cm, and the right vertical axis represents time, as derived from the CRS model of the Pb-210 geochronology. Thirteen events were identified, as shown in Table 3.4. Eight were temporally correlated with historic storms and five were false positives.  (Box and Jenkins, 1976). The autocorrelation function values drop below the 95% confidence interval (dashed line) at lags of three and higher (at least out through lag 12), indicating that successive sediment samples are not independent.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that a reliable storm history can be extracted from coastal sediment cores, based on a combination of isotopic and sedimentologic data, and using a statistical model which has been calibrated with the historic storm record. This new paleostorm identification method, and the model that has been developed, can be employed to identify storms in the sedimentary record that predate the historic storm database. A thorough investigation of the sedimentologic and isotopic properties of coastal lake sediments has shown that no single proxy is sufficient for identifying storm signatures. However, a combination of isotopic and sedimentologic data is sufficiently sensitive to detect major flooding events that have impacted coastal lake sediments. This new methodology is more objective, and more robust, than the standard methods of counting overwash sand layers or identifying marine microfossils in the sediments. By using the standard method of counting sand layers through x-radiography, 14 sand laminae can be discerned in the core that was analyzed for this study. Similarly, by counting peaks in the percent sand profile, twenty-four peaks can be discerned, most of which correspond to sand layers visible in the x-radiograph (Figure 4.3). The isotope model employed in this study identified 53 anomalous segments in the core, representing a minimum of 229 separate storm events spread through four periods of increased storminess during the nearly 5000-year lake history represented by the core. The paleostorm record extracted from the sediments of Western Lake provides several significant findings. First, the northern Gulf of Mexico has experienced millennia-long cycles of increased storm activity, separated by visual observation by quiescent periods of shorter duration. Second, the level of major storm and flooding event activity during the historic period of the past 150 years (6.2 storms per century) is significantly greater than the long-term mean storm frequency over the past five millennia (5.0 storms per century). Third, major storm frequency during the historic period is a continuation of a trend of increased storminess that began about 1300 years ago. Fourth, the current \"active\" period is the longest in the observed record. Fifth, the mean frequency of major storms during the historic period is not notably different from the mean level of storm frequency during the \"active\" periods\" of the past five millennia (6.9 storms per century). Sixth, there is little evidence of an increasing or decreasing trend in major storm frequency in the northern Gulf of Mexico during \"active\" periods of the past five millennia. This study has demonstrated that storm events which carry only marine storm surge into a coastal lake, without sediment overwash, can be detected through their isotopic and sedimentologic signature. The method is robust and the results are comparable to those of other studies using different storm proxies. The methodology employed during this investigation is capable of generating a storm history for any similar coastal region, and represents a quantitative basis for modeling storm risk in a warming future.

Each of these tools has its advantages and disadvantages."}, {"section_title": "Micropaleontological methods of paleostorm analysis", "text": "Microfossil identification is important in paleostorm studies, given that microbiota, such as foraminifera, can be used as indicators of paleo-environmental conditions. Foraminifera, diatoms and other microorganism may be carried with sediments into freshwater coastal lakes or lagoons as overwash during storm events. They may be found preserved in sediment profiles even when there is no visible presence of overwash sediment. Therefore, when remains of marine organisms, such as forams, are found in coastal lake sediments, it can be inferred that they entered the lake during a period of marine inundation (Collins et al., 1999;Scott et al., 2003;Sabatier et al., 2008). This would typically occur as a result of hurricane storm surge. The presence and identity of diatoms can be determined under a microscope after making a smear slide of fine-grained sediments. Foraminifers are visible under a microscope and are commonly found in sandy sediments. Although diatoms are commonly well-preserved in sediments, foraminifera are commonly dissolved in water having a low pH. Analysis of diatoms and foraminifera can identify changes in salinity (fresh, brackish, or marine). High salinity conditions in coastal freshwater lakes can result from saltwater inundation (such as during a storm event), and then may be preserved in the microfossil record (Valero-Garces et al., 1997). The most significant limitation of this method for determining prehistoric storm events is the potentially poor preservation of microfossils due to pH levels, erosion, and/or significant changes in the environmental setting, such as periods of transgression and regression."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentological methods of paleostorm analysis", "text": "Overwash sand layers preserved in the sediments of coastal lakes have been used to provide a proxy record of catastrophic hurricane strikes during the late Holocene (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004). Each overwash event may result in the deposition of a sand layer. The sand layer's size and shape may vary, but is said to be generally proportional to the intensity of the hurricane and the overwash event (Liu and Fearn, 2000). The frequency, extent, thickness, and chronology of the sand layers can then be used as a proxy for reconstructing a history of prehistoric storm events, provided that the sedimentological \"fingerprint\" of a historic hurricane with a known intensity and geomorphic impact are available to be used as a control (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Liu et al., 2009). Thus, the larger the overwash fan and thicker the resulting sand layer, the larger the storm. The expected outcome of this method is that only the strongest storms are preserved in the geologic record (Liu and Fearn, 2000), and that the frequency of overwash sand layers in lake and wetland sediment cores provides an estimate of the return period of major storms."}, {"section_title": "Geochemical methods of paleostorm analysis", "text": "The use of stable isotopes as a proxy to study climate change has been pursued for decades. However the analysis of paleostorm events using stable isotopes is a new technique (Lambert, 2003;Lambert et al., 2008). This method of determining prehistoric storm impacts has been shown to closely mirror sedimentologic paleostorm analyses, but has the ability to detect storm impacts that did not deposit overwash sediment in coastal environments (Lambert, 2003). The technique of using organic geochemical proxies (OGP) for studying storms has advanced the field of paleotempestology, as it no longer requires an overwash sand layer to record the occurrence of a storm event. OGPs are important indicators in paleoenvironmental studies, as they record environmental conditions at the time of deposition (Castenada and Schouten, 2011). Although this technique has a potentially higher sensitivity and better resolution than other methods, it is time-consuming and costly. Using the OGP method, organic-rich sediments are analyzed in order to create stable light isotope profiles of the core. Siliceous (diatoms) and carbonaceous (mollusk, ostracodes, and foraminifera) sediments may also be used to create isotopic core profiles. Marine environments are typically more enriched in the heavier 13 C isotope than terrestrial environments, versus the lighter and more common 12 C isotope. In coastal freshwater or brackish environments, marine incursions can be detected in core profiles as shifts from more negative (terrestrial C3 vegetation) \u03b4 13 C values (in the range of -22 to -35 \u2030) (O'Leary, 1988;Cerling et al., 1997) to higher (marine) \u03b4 13 C values (typically greater than -25 \u2030) (Sackett, 1964;Shultz and Calder, 1976;Meyers, 1994;Thornton and McManus, 1994;Corbett et al., 2007;Lambert et al., 2008). An example of this behavior was observed in Chesapeake Bay sediments dating from the mid-to early Holocene, when the modern estuary was developing on the site of the former Susequehanna River mouth (Bratton et al., 2003). Similarly, \u03b4 15 N values are more positive in marine settings, because they are also more enriched in the heavy 15 N isotope than in freshwater settings, as observed in coastal sediments dating from the time of formation of the modern Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in North Carolina (Thornton and McManus, 1994;Middleburg and Nieuwenhuize, 1998;Corbett et al., 2007). Therefore, lacustrine plants and plankton have more negative \u03b4 C values than their marine equivalents (Valero-Garces et al., 1997). Coastal lake biota develop in equilibrium with the water in which they exist. As a consequence, there is no significant lag time between a given event (e.g., a marine storm surge into a coastal freshwater lake) and the imparting of a unique isotopic signature into the sedimentary record. The OGP technique uses \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values in coastal organic freshwater lake sediments to identify storm events (Lambert, 2003). Significant shifts in \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values in sediment core profiles, followed by rapid returns to base values, are indicative of storm events, are caused when ocean waters which are more enriched in heavy isotopes, ( 13 C and 15 N) than fresh or brackish lacustrine waters, inundate the freshwater body during a storm event (Lambert et al., 2008). Some studies (Lambert, 2003;Lambert, 2008) have provided evidence of storm signals corresponding to a shift in \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values both in the positive and negative directions, instead of only shifting in the positive direction. A negative shift from normal lake values might be expected in the case of a storm event that was dominated by precipitation (excessive coastal flooding) rather than by wind and high storm surge. In recent years, this method has been employed in several investigations (Meyers, 1997;Lambert, 2003;Parker et al., 2006;Lambert et al., 2008;Page et al., 2009). Previous paleostorm studies have shown that the frequency and magnitude of storms are highly variable. Storm occurrence may have a periodicity of several decades to centuries, and may be correlated to changes in climate, especially rapid changes in climate (Page et al., 2009). Although OGPs may be used independently, we suggest they are most effective when used in conjunction with one another and with other proxies."}, {"section_title": "Historic Storm Record", "text": "Since 1851, 30 named storms (Category 1-5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale) have passed within 140 km of the study area, Oyster Pond on St. Vincent Island, FL (Figure 3.1).

Of the 30 Category 1-5 storms passing within 140 km of Oyster Pond, 8 were major storms (Cat. 3-5), resulting in a return period of approximately 5 years for Category 1-5 storms, and 20 years for Category 3-5 storms.

Sea-level change has strongly influenced the geological history of the area. The region has alternately been either flooded by marine incursions or exposed as dry land and beaches throughout much of its geologic history (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). The northeastern Gulf of Mexico region is tectonically stable, overlying a carbonate platform formed during late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic marine highstands. This region is also underlain by the Apalachicola Embayment subsurface structural feature, a northeast-trending complex graben system that extends from the Florida panhandle to eastern Georgia (Randazzo and Jones, 1997). The near-surface sediments in this region, as shown in the geologic map of Florida (Scott et al., 2001), are primarily marine deposits from late Cenozoic interglacial periods, overlain by undifferentiated Quaternary sediments, beach and dune sediments, and alluvium. The average rate of global sea-level rise during the twentieth century, determined by tide gauge measurements since the mid-1800's, has been approximately + 1.7 mm/yr (Miller and Douglas, 2004;IPCC, 2007). Regional rates of sea level increase in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as measured by satellite altimetry, have been shown to average + 3.0 mm/yr since 1993, indicating that the rate of rise during the past two decades has been significantly higher than during the preceding century and a half (NOAA, 2012b). It has been widely suggested that the IPCC (2007) range of projections for future sea-level rise, + 0.18 to + 0.59 meters by the year 2100, may be significantly underestimated. Some models predict that the rate of sea-level rise may increase to more than + 20 mm/yr by the end of the century (Grinsted et al., 2009). Some recent projections of sea-level rise, based on temperature increase or changes in radiative forcing, range between + 0.5 and + 2 meters by 2100, depending on the rates of loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Rahmstorf, 2007;Rahmstorf et al., 2007;Pfeffer, 2008;Grinsted et al., 2009;McCarthy, 2009), with + 0.8 meters most likely within the next century (McCarthy, 2009). It has been well documented that changes in sea level over the near-to moderate term (i.e, time scales of decades to centuries) are both connected with and sensitive to changes in climate (IPCC, 2007;Grinsted et al., 2009). The climate of the Holocene (11.8 ka to present) has been relatively stable compared to that of the most recent ice age (Alley et al., 1997). Sea level has been rising steadily, with few exceptions, since the last glacial maximum, approximately 20,000 years before present, when sea level was approximately 130 meters lower than present (Fairbanks, 1989;Bard et al., 1990;Clark et al., 2009). Sea-level rise in the Gulf of Mexico began to stabilize approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years ago (Blum et al., 2001). By 7800 yr BP the Laurentide ice sheet had nearly completely disappeared (Dyke and Prest, 1987;Smith et al., 2011), and a period of much slower sea-level rise began in the Gulf of Mexico (Smith et al., 2011), decreasing from rates of sea-level rise of approximately + 9 to + 11 mm/yr from 7800 to 6800 yr BP to approximately + 3 to + 4 mm/yr during the mid-Holocene (Blum et al., 2001). It was during the time of slower sea-level rise after about 8000 yr BP that the modern shoreline and barrier island systems began to form, including those of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Tanner, 1988;Stapor, et al., 1991;Liu and Fearn, 1993;Donoghue and White, 1995;Taylor and Stone, 1996;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Blum et al., 2001; Donoghue, 2011). (Figure 3.2) is the westernmost barrier island in the island chain at the mouth at the Apalachicola River. The Apalachicola, Florida's largest river, has a watershed that includes parts of the southern Appalachians, the Piedmont region in Georgia and eastern Alabama, and the Gulf Coastal Plain. The river has played a major role in shaping the coast of Northwest Florida, by developing a series of deltas and by supplying sediment to build the modern barrier island system (Figure 3.2) (Stewart and Gorsline, 1962;Schnable and Goodell, 1968;Donoghue, 1993;Donoghue and White, 1995;Forrest, 2007). It has been well documented that the Apalachicola River was the major sand source for the northwest Florida shoreline during the Quaternary, providing quartz sands that have been reworked and distributed through processes of longshore drift and wave action (Johnson and Barbour, 1990;Donoghue, 1993). Long-term accumulation of the river's sediment load, combined with low to moderate wave energy, has resulted in the development of the present-day barrier islands and spits that surround the mouth of the Apalachicola River (Tanner, 1964). (Figure 3.2) is marked by an extensive series of beach ridges and several freshwater ponds, with each ridge representing a former shoreline position (Forrest, 2007).

Optical luminescence dating of the beach ridge set immediately landward of the pond in set I (Figure 3.3, inset image) produced an age of 800 +/-100 years BP (Forrest, 2007), providing an upper age limit for the lake origin.

They are opened to the sea through small, natural inlets following the impact of strong storms.

These five peaks in accumulation coincide with core depths of 4.5 cm, 10.5 cm, 18.5 cm, 22.5 cm, and 29.5 cm. These core depths represent the approximate CRS model years 2002, and 1972.1). Depths and years are presented using the midpoint of each range. Due to the analytical error associated with determining the Pb-210 ages through gamma counting, and shown in relation to the ages derived from the CRS model in Figure 3.5, some ages/depths could correspond with more than one historic storm or high water event. The most likely storm or event was chosen to represent each peak based on intensity, known surge, and the time of occurrence. A statistical model for identifying storm signatures using known storm events was developed using a combination of the sedimentologic and isotopic data from the upper 40 cm of the Oyster Pond core. Based on the Pb-210 data, that portion of the core represents the historic period, i.e., the past century, during which there is a detailed record of storm and surge events in the region. The model was calibrated using the Pb-210 chronology and the dates of the known storm and high water events. The data used to calibrate the model was obtained from long-term tide gauge records and other regional storm records, as described below. The storm model was created using R, a freeware data analysis program (http://www.r-project.org/). The procedure for creating the model, diagrammed in Figure 3.8, was as follows: (1) A database of known storm history for the region was assembled. All storms in the NOAA Historical Tracks database (NOAA, 2012d) that had passed within 140 km of the coring site were included. This distance represents the mean radius to hurricane force winds for category 3 storms, i.e., wind speeds of approximately 50 m/s (Keim et al., 2007). Storm parameters for all of the included storms were tabulated. (2) Tide gauge data were collected from the nearest NOAA tide gauge, at Apalachicola, Florida, in order to refine the storm record to events capable of breaching the beach ridges and inundating the pond (NOAA, 2012a). The tide gauge is located approximately 18 km from St. Vincent Island, at the mouth of the Apalachicola River, and is shown by a yellow dot on Figure   3.1. Monthly mean and monthly maximum tide data were obtained for the period January 1967 (when the tide gauge was installed) to present. The maximum water level for each month was recorded and examined to determine the maximum water level for each year, noting the month and date of the maximum. Given the elevation of the ridges fronting the pond, the tide gauge data were filtered to remove all events below the monthly maximum data for each year plus one half of a standard deviation, or + 1.1 meters. As the tide gauge at Apalachicola, FL is protected from storm wave run-up and surge in the Apalachicola River, the high tide values corresponding to storm and high water events are likely significantly less than water levels experienced on St. Vincent Island, FL, as shown by surge data collected from the surrounding coastal region. Needham (2011) showed that Hurricane Kate (1985) caused a + 3.35 meter surge in Cape San Blas, FL, where the Apalachicola tide gauge recorded a + 1.99 meter maximum tide (NOAA, 2012a). Similarly, Hurricane Agnes (1972) caused a + 2.13 meter surge in Port St. Joe, FL (Needham, 2011), where the Apalachicola tide gauge recorded a + 1.63 meter maximum tide (NOAA, 2012a). Lastly, Hurricane Earl (1998) caused a + 2.44 meter surge in Green Point, FL, (located between Carabelle, FL, and East Point, FL), and the Apalachicola tide gauge recorded a + 1.57 meter maximum tide (NOAA, 2012a). This cutoff yielded ten high-water events, as (Hurricanes Elena and Kate in 1985 were counted as a single event in the model due to their close temporal proximity (Table 3.2). Among the resulting ten events, five were correlated with the sediment accumulation peaks previously discussed from the CRS model of the Pb-210 data (Figure 3.7). The other five events included one known storm event (Hurricane Eloise, 1975) and four extreme high tides that do not correspond to dates of known storms. The five known storms matching accumulation peaks from the CRS model correspond to: Hurricane Dennis (Category 4, 2005), Hurricane Earl (Category 1, 1998), Hurricane Opal (Category 3, 1995) Hurricanes Elena and Kate (Category 3, 1985), and Hurricane Agnes (Category 3, 1972), as shown in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.7. The other five events recorded at the Apalachicola tide gage occurred in 2009, 2004, 2002, 1994, and 1975 (Hurricane Eloise), as shown in Table 3.2. (3) The known storm events with a storm surge and other events having a sea level elevation greater than +1.1 m were then used as the basis for a \"storm signature.\" A series of multiple regressions was carried out on the data set in order to determine which of the sedimentologic and isotopic data variables are statistically significant and most influenced the data. The parameters examined through regression were: \u03b4 13 C, \u03b4 15 N, % C, % N, \u03b4 13 C \u2032, \u03b4 15 N\u2032, % C\u2032, % N\u2032, % combustible, % sand, mean grain size, and standard deviation of grain size. The primed (\u2032) variables were determined by determining the first derivative of each respective parameter (i.e., % N to % N\u2032) in order to smooth trends in the data. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that \u03b4 13 C, percent sand, and percent nitrogen derivative were the most statistically significant variables, and therefore changes in these variables during a storm would be the most identifiable (Table 3.3). These variables were then used as inputs to a generalized linear model, where the resulting coefficients were employed in the logistic regression equation (Hilbe, 2009): = \u221227.679 \u2212 1.511 \u2212 0.095 % \u2212 57.151 % \u2032 In the above equation, is a function that describes the log of the odds ratio of storm to non-storm events, as seen in the data. The results of the equation must then be transformed, such that: !\" # # $ % \"& = ' ()*+, -. / 1 + ' ()*+, -. / in order to generate a probability distribution from 0 to 1 of the logit expression (Hilbe, 2009), where 0 indicates no probability of a storm having occurred, and 1 indicates a 100% probability of a storm. A cutoff storm probability of 0.50 was chosen for the purposes of the model. This value maximized the number of events identified by the model, and minimized the number of false positives, based on the known history of storms. The results from applying the model to the data from the upper 40 cm of Core 092710-01 are shown in Figure 3.9. (4) The modeling process resulted in thirteen peaks above the probability cutoff ( Figure   3.8), although some peaks contain more than one event. A chronology of these events was established, based on the CRS model, as shown in Table 3.4. The uppermost twelve peaks of the storm model temporally correspond to the period of record for the Apalachicola tide gauge, which began continuous operation in 1967. The model was able to be trained and calibrated through comparison with the known storm and surge events. Not all peaks in the sediment record correspond to real events, and are false positives. The five accumulation peaks from the CRS model (Hurricanes Dennis, Earl, Opal, Elena/Kate, and Agnes), and five of the other extreme high-water events from the tide gage record (events from 2009, 2004, 2002, and 1994, and 1975 Hurricane Eloise) were likewise positively identified. Note that Hurricane Dennis and the surge events from 2009, 2004, and 2002 are all included in the uppermost peak produced by the model, as identified by events 1a-1g. Five false positives were also identified. The thirteenth peak, 13a and 13b, represents storm event(s) occurring in the early part of the 20th century, before the installation of the tide gauge. The false positives, peaks 2, 4, 5, 6, and 12, (Figure 3.9) have isotopic and sedimentologic properties similar enough to an event for the model to identify them as a storm or high water event. During the years represented by those peaks, the Apalachicola tide gauge data do not include any high water events above the + 1.1 meter minimum. Because the minimum dune/beach ridge height separating the pond from the Gulf of Mexico is + 1.25 \u00b1 0.09 meters (NOAA, 2012e), we assume that whenever the gauge record exceeds + 1.1 meter the water height in the Gulf of Mexico is elevated enough to allow for seawater inundation of the pond due to the significant difference between the water levels of the Gulf of Mexico (Needham, 2011) and those recorded by the Apalachicola tide gauge (NOAA, 2012a) during storm events, causing an elevated water level greater than + 1.25 \u00b1 0.09 meters (NOAA, 2012e). It is possible, nonetheless, that some high water events of lesser magnitude in the tide gauge record, combined with wind-driven waves, could have inundated the lake, causing the isotopic and sedimentologic signature observed in the model, and generating the false positives. The ten known storm or high-water events used to create the model, spread over seven model peaks, have percent sand and \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, and a neutral % N\u2032 value. Lambert (2003) and Lambert et al. (2008) showed that storm signals correspond to \u03b4 13 C values significantly above the mean (i.e., indicating periods of marine isotopic values), although storm signals can also correspond to peaks significantly below the mean, as has also been observed (i.e., indicating periods of freshwater flooding). Some of the storms predicted by our model are shown to have either percent sand or \u03b4 13 C values below the mean, as is most commonly seen in the five storm surge events that did not correspond to accumulation peaks from the CRS model and the broad Event 1, which was largely influenced isotopically and sedimentologically by anthropogenic alteration, as noted in Section 4.5 above. The five storms associated with accumulation peaks from the CRS model show a trend, having percent sand and \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, and a neutral % N\u2032 value, thus creating a storm signature. Nonetheless, the combined effect of the three parameters on the model output is sufficient to identify ten high water events since 1967. These events, which affected the pond, are identified by seven peaks in the model. Therefore, a \"typical\" storm signature, as shown by the model, has \u03b4 13 C and percent sand values above the mean, and a neutral (close to zero) % N\u2032 value. A reasonable explanation for the false positives is that they were produced by an influx of sand and terrestrial (more negative) \u03b4 13 C from freshwater flooding events. (5) Storm probabilities estimated at adjacent samples or groups of samples are not likely to be independent. To test this possibility, we computed the autocorrelation function of the predicted probabilities at sample lags (out to lag 18). A lag corresponds to one sample. A series of lags was created by shifting the data down one sample per lag and cross-correlating the storm probabilities as a function of the lag (Box and Jenkins, 1976). Results are shown in Figure 3.10. The autocorrelation function values drop below the 95% confidence interval at lags of three and higher (at least out through lag 12). This indicates that successive sediment samples are not independent. The relatively high autocorrelation at lags 1 and 2 argues that it is best to consider every third or fourth sample as statistically independent, and that statistical independence is achieved by considering groups of three or four samples together as a single event. This finding has an impact on Events 1 and 13 ( Figure 3.9). Events 1 and 13 are the only two peaks that are made up of more than 3 or 4 samples. Event 1, spanning 0 to 7.5 cm and 26 samples, may represent as many as seven separate storm occurrences, as determined by the autocorrelation function, and as a result is divided into 7 sub-events. Of these potential seven  1926, 1915, 1906, 1903, and 1899 (Table 3.4)."}, {"section_title": "Storm Identification and Storm Frequency", "text": "The storm model identifies thirteen events (and multiple sub-events) during which storm surge impacted Oyster Pond between the year 1900 and the present (Table 3.4; Figure 3.9), carrying marine/estuarine waters into the fresh to brackish lake. The result after each inundation was a period of enhanced productivity in the lake, and a marine/estuarine geochemical signature in the lake sediments for a brief period. The events will be described from top to bottom (youngest to oldest). The uppermost peak, Event 1, spans the upper 7.5 centimeters, and is subdivided into sub-events 1a through 1g: (1a) a + 1.11 meter high tide event in November 2009; (1d) the + 2.22 meter surge event associated with Hurricane Dennis in July 2005 (the first accumulation peak from the CRS model in Figure 3.7); (1e) a + 1.36 meter high tide event in September 2004 and (1f) a + 1.15 meter high tide event in September 2002. It is likely that so many inundations to the pond within such a relatively short period of time, including Hurricane Dennis which impacted the majority of the Florida panhandle coast (FDEP, 2005), changed the geochemical conditions of the lake. In addition, the alteration of the island's surficial drainage system during the past decade (Davis and Mokray, 2000) has also impacted input from the drainage system and therefore the pond's geochemistry and the uppermost portion of the isotopic profiles. These changes could readily result in the a wide peak and the false positives shown in sub-events 1b, 1c, and 1g. The number of events (7) within the peak is the result of the autocorrelation function. This broad peak contains percent sand and \u03b4 13 C values both above and below the mean, though the % N\u2032 remains neutral (at or nearly zero) at depths where storm or surge events occur. Event 2 is a false positive, the possible origin of which is described above in section 5.1. Event 3 has been identified as Hurricane Earl (1998) which caused a + 1.57 meter storm surge at Apalachicola, FL. This event corresponds to the second accumulation peak in the CRS model (Figure 3.7), and has a percent sand and \u03b4 13 C value above the mean, and a neutral % N\u2032. Events 4 through 6 are false positives, unexplained events during which conditions in the lake briefly resembled storm events. Event 7 (Figure 3.9) is identified as an extreme tide event of + 1.26 meter in October, 1994, and has a neutral percent sand value, \u03b4 13 C value above the mean, and neutral % N\u2032 value. Event 8 is Hurricane Opal, a major storm in October 1995 that resulted in a + 1.74 meter storm surge, and which has a signature resulting in \u03b4 13 C values and percent sand above the mean and a neutral % N\u2032 value. Due to the analytical error associated with determining the Pb-210 ages through gamma counting, and shown in relation to the ages derived from the CRS model in Figure 3.5, some ages/depths could correspond with more than one storm/event. The 1994 elevated tide event and the 1995 Hurricane Opal event are essentially coincident, and are located at approximately the same point on the CRS model timescale. However, because Hurricane Opal had a larger surge than the 1994 surge event, it is more likely to be the event associated with the sediment accumulation peak observed at 18.5 cm depth in the CRS model (Figure 3.7). Event 9 is Hurricanes Elena (9/1/85), with a + 1.26 meter surge, and also Hurricane Kate (11/21/85) with a + 1.99 meter surge. The sediment record shows percent sand and \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, as well as a neutral % N\u2032 associated with this event. These storms, which were coincident in the sedimentary record, correspond to the fourth accumulation peak in the CRS model (Figure 3.7). Event 10 is Hurricane Eloise (1975), which caused a +1.27 m storm surge, and had percent sand \u03b4 13 C values above the mean and a neutral % N\u2032. Event 11 is Hurricane Agnes (1972), causing a + 1.63 meter storm surge at the Apalachicola, FL, tide gauge, and corresponding to the fifth accumulation peak in the CRS model (Figure 3.7). The sediment record shows percent sand \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, as well as a neutral % N\u2032 associated with this event. Event 12 is a false positive, an event during which conditions in the lake briefly resembled those of a storm event, having percent sand \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, and a % N\u2032 above the mean. The model (Figure 3.9) identified one event in the historic record prior to the 1967 start of data collection at the Apalachicola tide gauge. Event 13 corresponds to a CRS model age range of 1907-1920, which is subdivided into two smaller events, 13a and 13b, as a result of the autocorrelation analysis. The sediment record shows percent sand below the mean, \u03b4 13 C values above the mean, and a neutral % N\u2032 associated with this event. During this time period, multiple strong storms are known to have made landfall or passed near Apalachicola, FL, as determined from storm and surge records (NOAA, 2012d;NOAA, 2012a;Needham, 2011). Possible storms that could have contributed to this extended peak are the following unnamed storms: 1926 (Category 3); 1915 (Category 1), which caused a + 2.13 meter surge in Carrabelle, FL, 50 km east of Oyster Pond, FL (Needham, 2011) or 1906 (Category 3), which caused a + 4.27 meter surge on Santa Rosa Island, approximately 200 km to the west, (Needham, 2011) for sub-event 13a. For sub-event 13b, the likely candidates are un-named storms in 1903 (Category 1), which caused a + 3.05 meter surge in Apalachicola, FL, and 1899 (Category 2), which caused + 1.22 meter surge in Carabelle, FL (Needham, 2011). Within the limits of uncertainty in the CRS model one or all of these events could correlate with Event 13 in the model."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Paleotempestology, the study of long-term regional storm history from geological proxy evidence, offers a glimpse at tropical cyclone activity extending back into geologic time (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Boose et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007). It is clear that the historic record of tropical storms, extending about 150 years into the past, can be used to assess decadal and multi-decadal cycles (Landsea et al., 1999;Goldenberg et al., 2001;Klotzbach and Gray, 2008). However, the historic record is relatively brief and inadequate for evaluating low-frequency changes in climate. Therefore, there is a need for longer-term records in assessing century-scale variability and risk from storms by utilizing paleotempestology to study the longer-term storm record. Major storms have significant impacts on both natural and human environments at the coast. Many studies have quantified prehistoric storm occurrence by counting sand layers in coastal sediment cores and employing other standard methods of sediment analysis (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004;Nott, 2004;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007;Horton et al., 2008). In more recent studies, micropaleontology and stable isotope geochemistry have also been employed to identify inundation events in sediment core records (Hassan et al., 1997;Meyers, 1997;Lambert, 2003;Lucke et al., 2003;Lamb et al., 2005;Parker et al., 2006;Lambert et al., 2008;Page et al., 2009). A better understanding of the true storm risk for a given coastal region is essential for preparing for and mitigating the effects of potentially greater storminess in a warmer future. The primary hypothesis driving this investigation was that the long-term geologic record can provide a longer and more reliable baseline against which more recent changes in climate and storm frequency (on a century scale) can be compared. A second hypothesis was that major flooding events leave a marine isotopic signature in coastal lake sediments, which may be discernible even in the absence of physical indicators of storm occurrence, such as sediment layers from overwash. The goal was to apply a statistical model which defined a storm \"signature\" discernible in coastal lake sediments in order to identify prehistoric storm events and determine long-term storm frequencies."}, {"section_title": "Methods of Detecting Evidence of Major Flooding Event Occurrence", "text": "Several techniques have been developed in recent decades for identifying the signatures of storms in coastal sedimentary records. The common tools of paleostorm analysis include: identification of storm-deposited overwash sand layers through grain-size analysis, micropaleontology (e.g., foraminifera, diatoms), and stable isotope analysis of \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N in organic-rich sediments. Each of these tools has its advantages and disadvantages."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentologic Approach to Paleostorm Study", "text": "Overwash sand layers preserved in the sediments of coastal lakes can act as a proxy record of catastrophic hurricane strikes during the late Holocene (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001;Donnelly et al., 2004). The frequency, extent, thickness, and chronology of the sand layers may be used as a proxy for reconstructing the history of hurricane strikes, provided that the sedimentological \"fingerprints\" of an historic hurricane of known intensity and geomorphic impact are available to be used as a control for comparison (Liu and Fearn, 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Liu et al., 2009). Thus, the assumption is the larger the overwash fan and thicker the resulting sand layer, the larger the storm. The expected outcome is that only the strongest storms are preserved in the geologic record (Liu and Fearn, 2000), and that the frequency of overwash sand layers in lake and wetland cores provides an estimate of the return period of major storms and flooding events."}, {"section_title": "Micropaleontologic Approach to Paleostorm Study", "text": "In addition to overwash sediments, marine diatoms and foraminifera may also be carried into coastal lakes or lagoons during storm events, and may be preserved even if overwash sediments are not present. While diatoms are commonly well preserved in sediments, foraminifera can undergo dissolution in water with a low pH. Analysis of diatoms and foraminifera can identify changes in salinity (fresh, brackish, or marine). High salinity conditions in lakes can result from saltwater inundation (such as during a storm event), and are then preserved in the microfossil record (Valero-Garces et al., 1997). The most significant limitation on this method for determining prehistoric storm events is the potentially poor preservation of microfossils due to pH levels, erosion, and/or significant changes in the environmental setting."}, {"section_title": "Geochemical Approach to Paleostorm Study", "text": "Organic geochemical proxies (OGPs) are important indicators in paleoenvironmental studies, as they record environmental conditions at the time of deposition (Castenada and Schouten, 2011). Using stable isotopes to identify prehistoric storm events has been shown to correlate with sediment-based paleostorm analyses, but has the additional ability to detect storm events that did not leave an overwash layer of sand in coastal sediments (Lambert, 2003). Using the OGP method, organic-rich sediments are analyzed in order to create \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N core profiles. Marine environments are typically more enriched than terrestrial environments in the heavier 13 C isotope, versus the lighter and more common 12 C isotope. As a result, lacustrine plants and plankton typically have more negative \u03b4 13 C values than their marine counterparts (Valero-Garces et al., 1997). In coastal freshwater or brackish environments, marine incursions can be detected in core profiles as shifts from more negative \u03b4 13 C values, indicating terrestrial C3 vegetation, (O'Leary, 1988;Cerling et al., 1997) to more positive \u03b4 13 C values, indicating a marine environment (Sackett, 1964;Shultz and Calder, 1976;Meyers, 1994;Thornton and McManus, 1994;Corbett et al., 2007;Lambert et al., 2008). Similarly, \u03b4 15 N values are generally more positive in marine settings, as they are also more enriched in the \"heavy\" 15 N isotope than in more terrestrial settings, as observed in coastal sediments dating from the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in North Carolina (Thornton and McManus, 1994;Middleburg and Nieuwenhuize, 1998;Corbett et al., 2007). The technique of using organic geochemical proxies for studying storms has advanced the field of paleotempestology, as it no longer requires an overwash sand layer to record the occurrence of a storm event. The technique employs \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values in organic sediments in coastal lakes (Lambert, 2003). Significant shifts in \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values in sediment core profiles, followed by rapid returns to base values, are indicative of storm events, as ocean waters are more enriched in heavy isotopes, both 13 C and 15 N, than fresh or brackish lacustrine waters (Lambert et al., 2008). However some studies (Lambert, 2003;Lambert et al., 2008) have provided evidence of storm signals corresponding to a shift in \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 15 N values both in the positive and negative directions. A negative shift from normal lake values might be expected in the case of a coastal storm event dominated by precipitation (excessive coastal flooding) rather than by wind (high storm surge). In recent years, this method has been employed in several investigations (Meyers, 1997;Lambert, 2003;Parker et al., 2006;Lambert et al., 2008;Page et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Paleostorm Detection Model", "text": "A model was developed for identifying the signature of inundation events in the sedimentary record of coastal lakes (Coor et al., submitted). The model employed a sediment core from a coastal pond with a high sedimentation rate, enabling individual storm events to be discerned in the sedimentary record. Pb-210 dating provided the chronology for identifying the horizons representing major flooding events of the past century. Storm magnitude and surge data were obtained from archival records. Stable isotope and sedimentologic analyses were carried out at high resolution throughout the core. A series of multiple regressions was completed on the core data set in order to determine which of the sedimentologic and isotopic data variables were statistically significant and most influenced the data. The parameters examined through regression were: \u03b4 13 C, \u03b4 15 N, % C, % N, \u03b4 13 C \u2032, \u03b4 15 N\u2032, % C\u2032, % N\u2032, % combustible, % sand, mean grain size, and standard deviation of grain size. The primed (\u2032) variables represent a data smoothing process, employing the depth derivative of the variable (i.e., % N to % N\u2032). Results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that \u03b4 13 C, percent sand, and percent nitrogen\u2032 were the most statistically significant variables (Table 3.3), i.e., changes in these variables during a storm would be the most readily identifiable indicators of inundation events affecting the coast, and of these \u03b4 13 C and percent sand were the most significant. These variables were then used as inputs to a generalized linear model, resulting in the logistic regression equation (Hilbe, 2009): = \u221227.67971 \u2212 1.51101 \u2212 0.09596 % \u2212 57.15150 % \u2032 In the above equation, is a function that describes the log of the odds ratio of storm to non-storm events, as observed in the data. The results of the equation were then transformed, such that: !\" # # $ % \"& = ' ()*+, -. / 1 + ' ()*+, -. / in order to generate a probability distribution from 0 to 1 of the logit expression (Hilbe, 2009). In the above equation, P(0) would indicate minimal probability of a storm having occurred and P 1would indicate maximal probability of a storm. A storm event cutoff probability of 0.50 was chosen for the purposes of the model. This value maximized the number of events identified by the model, and minimized the number of false positives, based on the known history of storms."}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise", "text": "The average rate of global sea-level rise during the twentieth century, averaged from tide gauge measurements since the mid-1800s, has been approximately + 1.7 mm/yr (Miller and Douglas, 2004;IPCC, 2007). Long-term tide gauge records from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico generally reflect the global trend. Pensacola, Florida, approximately 105 km west of the study area, has recorded an average 2.10 \u00b1 0.26 mm/yr sea-level rise over the period 1923-2006. The Cedar Key, Florida, tide gauge, approximately 325 km southeast of the study area, has recorded an average 1.80 \u00b1 0.19 mm/yr sea-level rise over the period 1914-2006(NOAA, 2012a). Rates of global sea level increase since 1993, as measured by satellite altimetry, have been shown to average 2.7 mm/yr, indicating that the rate of rise during the past two decades has been significantly higher than during the preceding century and a half (NOAA, 2012b). In the Gulf of Mexico, the satellite data show an average rate of rise of 2.2 mm/yr from 1993 to present (NOAA, 2012b) It has been well documented that changes in sea level over the near-to moderate term (i.e., time scales of decades to centuries) are both connected with and sensitive to changes in climate (IPCC, 2007;Grinsted et al., 2009). The climate of the Holocene (10,000 yr BP to present) has been relatively stable compared to that of the most recent ice age (Alley et al., 1997). Sea level has been rising steadily, with few exceptions, since the last glacial maximum, approximately 20,000 years before present when sea level was approximately 130 meters lower than today (Fairbanks, 1989;Bard et al., 1990;Clark et al., 2009). Sea-level rise began to stabilize approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years ago (Donoghue and White, 1995;Blum et al., 2001;Smith et al., 2011). By 7800 yr BP the Laurentide ice sheet had nearly completely disappeared (Dyke and Prest, 1987), and a period of much slower sea-level rise began in the world's oceans (Smith et al., 2011). It was during the time of slower sea-level rise after about 8000 yr BP that the modern shoreline and barrier island systems began to form, including those of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Tanner, 1988;Stapor, et al., 1991;Donoghue and White, 1995;Taylor and Stone, 1996;Blum et al., 2001;Donoghue, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing and Surveying", "text": "Topographic data, based on LIDAR (LIight Detection And Ranging), was used to determine dune elevations separating Western lake from the Gulf of Mexico.

SLOSH, developed by the National Weather Service, is one of the most commonly used tools for estimating storm surge and wind resulting from historical or predicted storms (Jelesnianki et al., 1992). Comparisons of SLOSH model calculations with observed storm surge heights have shown that 79% of the predictions are within 1 standard deviation of the mean error, 97% are within two standard devations, and 99% are within three standard deviations (Jarvinen and Lawrence, 1985), though SLOSH is known to commonly underestimate observed storm surge heights (Houston et al., 1999). SLOSH's design allows for storm surge computations to be made with incomplete knowledge of the storm's structure and intensity (Houston et al., 1999), which makes it ideal for forecasting, as well as for back-calculating storm surges, of storms early in the historic and prehistoric record. Direct measurements of storm surge heights were not available for most of the storms which impacted the study area during historic time. As a result, surge heights were calculated using the SLOSH model. The model's input parameters include the storm's track, the radius to maximum winds (RMW), and the pressure deficit ( P), or the deviation from one standard atmosphere noted every 6 hours during the track of the storm (Table 4.1) (Houston, et al., 1999;Lane et al., 2011, NOAA-NHC, 2012."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentologic and Isotopic Data", "text": "The primary isotopic and sedimentologic variables of interest are those which compose the storm identification model (Figure 4.3): percent sand, %N\u2032, and \u03b4 13 C.

It is most commonly found in areas with salinities from 5-15 ppt (Swingle and Bland, 1974).

It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the model has identified a minimum of 229 storm events over the approximately 5000-year lake history represented by the core."}, {"section_title": "Paleostorm return periods and cycles", "text": "The return period, and therefore the number of storm events per century, was determined for the 53 storm-influenced segments identified from the storm model (Coor, et al., submitted), as shown in Figure 4.6. Samples which exceeded the 50% cutoff interval, resulting in one of the 53 storm-influenced segments, was assigned a value of 1, given that the model predicts a high probability that at least 1 storm occurred during the approximately 11 years represented by the sampling resolution. Samples which did not exceed the 50% cutoff interval were assigned a value of 0, given that the model predicts a low probability of a storm having occurred during the period represented by the sample. The resulting minimum number of storms was summed and normalized per century. Of the 53 segments that did exceed the cutoff frequency, four distinct periods are visible, demonstrating cyclicity in relative storminess over time. The first active period observed, from approximately 4800 to 4400 cal yr BP, exhibiting a mean of 6.6 storms per century, ranging from 4 to 10 storms per century. The second period, lasting from approximately 4100 to 3200 cal yr BP, averaged 5.8 storms per century, ranging from 4 to 8 storms per century. The third period, from approximately 2500 to 1800 cal yr BP, shows a slightly shorter return period with mean of 7.6 storms per century, ranging from 4 to 9 storms per century. The fourth period, ranging from approximately 1300 cal yr BP to the present, exhibits a mean of 7.4 storms per century, ranging from 3 to 10 storms per century. The overall mean for active storm periods is 6.9 storm events per century, while the overall mean over the 5 millennia is 5.0 storm events per century. Three inactive periods of several centuries duration separate the four periods of higher storm activity. The model results can be viewed in the larger context of the northern Gulf of Mexico during the latter half of the Holocene. Hodell et al. (1991) noted that orbital changes have resulted in solar insolation for 10 degrees north latitude reaching a modern peak at about 7 ka and decreasing up to the present. Poore et al. (2003) analyzed high-resolution faunal and isotope data for two cores from the northern and western Gulf of Mexico. They concluded that, based on proxy evidence, sea surface temperature (SST) in the Gulf has decreased since the mid-Holocene. This would result in a southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a decrease in the influence of easterly winds, and less incursion of warm surface waters into the Gulf of Mexico (Poore et al., 2003). Poore et al. (2003) also found evidence of century-scale variability in climate proxy date for the Gulf of Mexico, especially for the period from 7 to 2.5 yr BP. The modeled data also exhibit century-scale variability in storminess. The model results (Figure 4.7) reflect stability in the level of storminess over the past 5000 years, which is reflected in the similarity between the historic mean number of storms per century, 6.2, and the long-term mean of storms per century during the \"active\" periods, 6.9, both of which are significantly higher than the overall long-term mean of 5.0 storms per century. The results, therefore, appear to be consistent with Wallace and Anderson's (2010) finding of relative stability of climate in the Gulf of Mexico during the late Holocene."}, {"section_title": "Reconstruction of Storm Surge", "text": "The results from the SLOSH model, shown in Table 4.1, show that Hurricane Opal (1995) had the largest surge of 2.7 m. While Opal was a category 4 storm at its most intense, it was a category 3 storm when it passed closest to Western Lake. None of the lesser storms produced enough surge to overtop the dunes that front the lake. The LIDAR topographic data show that the lowest point on the barrier dunes seaward of the lake is 2.3 meters (Figure 4.3). The historic storm data, indicate that a major (cat. 3 or greater) storm would be necessary to breach the dunes and inundate the lake. The paleostorm model results, therefore, may be taken to represent the impact of major storms on the lake."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with Other Studies", "text": "Several recent paleostorm studies have shown that the frequency and magnitude of storms are highly variable over time and space. Moreover, it has been observed that major storm histories exhibit a cyclicity of several decades to centuries, which may be correlated to climate cycles (Liu and Fearn 1993;Liu and Fearn, 2000;Donnelly et al., 2001a, b;Scott et al., 2003;Donnelly et al., 2004;Donnelly and Woodruff, 2007;Scileppi and Donnelly, 2007;Woodruff et al., 2008;Mann et al., 2009;Page et al., 2009;Wallace and Anderson, 2010;Lane et al., 2011). The northeastern Gulf of Mexico coast, specifically Western Lake, was found by Liu and Fearn (1993) to have experienced intense periods of storminess from 3500 to 940 cal yr BP. (All dates have been converted to cal yr BP, using CALIB 6.0.). Lane et al. (2011) reported seven periods of storm activity during the past 4000 years at Mullet Pond, FL, 180 km to the east of Western Lake. Lake Shelby, in coastal Alabama, 145 km to the west of Western Lake, was found to have had an increase in hurricane activity from 3500 to 700 cal yr BP (Liu and Fearn, 2000). Laguna Madre, located approximately 1200 km to the west of Western Lake on the Gulf Coast of Texas, showed a period of increased storminess from 5300 to 900 cal yr BP (Wallace and Anderson, 2010). Donnelly and Woodruff (2007) found that intervals of more intense hurricane activity occurred in the Caribbean between 4400 to 3600 cal yr BP, 2500 to 1000 cal yr BP, and 250 cal yr BP to present, corresponding to periods of fewer El Nino events and increased precipitation in Africa. A compilation study by Mann et al. (2009) showed that the U.S. Northeast coast had a nearly continuous active period of storminess from 1950 to 450 cal yr BP. The U.S. central eastern coast exhibited an active period of storminess from 950 to 650 cal yr BP, with considerably less activity before or after (Mann, et al., 2009). The current investigation's paleostorm history includes four periods of active storminess. The results are in good agreement with the other study from the northeastern Gulf coast which was similar in scope, as reported by Lane et al. (2011) (Figure 4.8)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This dissertation was designed to serve as a tool for future researchers and decision makers in a warmer and potentially stormier world. This dissertation has helped to describe the origin, hydrology, sedimentology, and water chemistry of a set of coastal dune lakes, found only in 5 other places worldwide. Analysis of sediments from several lakes in northwest Florida has produced a new method for identifying paleostorm events in the sediment record, and a longterm storm and climate record for the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. These findings will be critical in better understanding climate and storm trends within the Holocene and making predictions for the future. The following summarizes the major findings per chapter of this research."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Coastal Dune Lakes", "text": "The coastal dune lakes are unique features created by coastal processes, found in only a few other places in the world. A stratigraphic and hydrologic analysis of the lake region has shown that the coastal dune lakes formed during the mid-to late Holocene when postglacial sealevel rise slowed, and developed in close proximity to the shoreline. There is evidence that the coastal dune lakes are hydraulically connected to the Gulf of Mexico. A tidal signal present within five of the six coastal dune lakes studied, indicating that the lake system is based on a freshwater lens sitting on a coastal salt water wedge at the marine boundary of the surficial aquifer. The humate formation horizon has migrated landward in response to sea-level rise throughout the Holocene. Radiocarbon dates collected from the coastal dune lakes provide a minimum age of approximately 5,000 yr BP for the coastal dune lakes. Sea-level rise and climate stability confirms the hypothesis that these lakes have been stable and in close proximity to the shoreline since their formation approximately, approximately 5,000 to 8,000 yr BP."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3: Detecting a Paleostorm History", "text": "The third chapter details the creation of an improved method for identifying storm signatures and establishing the geologic record of storm occurrence for coastal regions through analysis of coastal lake core sediments. A sediment core representing the historic period (~1900 A.D. to present) was subjected to high resolution sedimentologic and stable isotope analysis, complemented by geochronology and micropaleontology. The data were combined with historic storm records and tide-gauge storm surge history to develop a storm model. The storm model resulted in a probability equation based on the isotopic and sedimentologic characteristics of storm signatures. This model, built from two geochemical sediment variables (\u03b4 13 C and % N\u2032) and one physical sediment variable (% sand), accurately predicts known historic storm and surge events at Oyster Pond, a coastal lake in northwest Florida. The model represents a new method for identifying and quantifying paleostorm events. Through use of a statistical model with fixed covariates, the result is a more objective indicator of storm occurrence, and therefore of hazard risk, than previous methods of paleostorm analysis. This model provides a valuable tool for understanding and quantifying long-term storm history, and better assessing storm hazard risk for coastal regions."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4: Paleostorm Record for Northwest Florida", "text": "The fourth chapter discusses the application of the new technique for identifying storm signatures in coastal lake sediments and establishing the geologic record of storm occurrence for northwest Florida. The results of this study demonstrate that a reliable storm history can be extracted from coastal sediment cores, based on a combination of isotopic and sedimentologic data, and using a statistical model which has been calibrated with the historic storm record. This new paleostorm identification method, and the model that has been developed, can be employed to identify storms in the sedimentary record that predate the historic storm database. A sediment core from a northwest Florida coastal pond, representing the past five millennia, was subjected to high resolution sedimentologic and stable isotope analysis, complemented by geochronology and micropaleontology. The data were input to a statistical storm model, based on two geochemical sediment variables (\u03b4 13 C and % N\u2032) and one physical sediment variable (% sand). The storm model identified storm events and storm clusters in the sediment record. The modeled storm events separate into 4 periods of increased storminess, ranging from as few as 4 storms per century to as a many as 10 storms per century. This study quantifies the long-term storm history for the northwest Florida coast and represents a tool to enhance the assessment of storm hazard risk for coastal regions. The paleostorm record extracted from the sediments of Western Lake provides several significant findings. First, the northern Gulf of Mexico has experienced millennia-long cycles of increased storm activity, separated by quiescent periods of shorter duration. Second, the level of major storm and flooding activity during the historic period of the past 150 years (6.2 storms per century) is significantly greater than the long-term mean storm frequency over the past five millennia (5.0 storms per century). Third, major storm frequency during the historic period is a continuation of a trend of increased storminess that began about 1300 years ago. Fourth, the current \"active\" period is the longest in the observed record. Fifth, the mean frequency of major storms during the historic period is similar to the mean level of storm frequency during the \"active\" periods\" of the past five millennia (6.9 storms per century). Sixth, there is little evidence of an increasing or decreasing trend in major storm frequency in the northern Gulf of Mexico during \"active\" periods of the past five millennia. This study has demonstrated that storm events which carry only marine storm surge into a coastal lake, without sediment overwash, can be detected through their isotopic and sedimentologic signature. The method is robust and the results are comparable to those of other studies using different storm proxies. The methodology employed during this investigation is capable of generating a storm history for any similar coastal region, and represents a quantitative basis for modeling storm risk in a warming future."}, {"section_title": "Overall Conclusions", "text": "This project succeeded in achieving its goals. The groundwork has been laid for future paleostorm studies in other coastal regions.
