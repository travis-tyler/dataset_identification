[{"section_title": "Find this book", "text": "In March this year the UK government announced the launch of a network of six \"What Works\" centres aimed at providing robust evidence to inf orm policy making. T he rationale was given as \"It is a f undamental principle of good public services that decisions are made on the basis of strong evidence and what we know works. Yet all too of ten evidence is not presented in a simple, relevant f ormat that enables it to be used to its maximum potential by service providers, commissioners and policymakers.\" T his f ascinating book was published a f ew months earlier, although it was unmentioned in the government announcement. It is a tough read, but it should be the standard text f or these centres and on the reading list of all nineteen British university courses in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) -i.e. the breeding ground of politicians: but too late f or David Cameron and Ed Miliband who both read PPE at Oxf ord. In the authors' own words this is why it deserves attention: \"You are told: use policies that work. And you are told: RCTs -randomized controlled trials -will show you what these are. T hat's not so. RCTs are great, but they do not do that f or you. T hey cannot alone support the expectation that a policy will work f or you. What they tell you is true -that this policy produced that result there. But they do not tell you why that is relevant to what you need to bet on getting the result you want here. For that, you will need to know a lot more. T hat's what this book is about. We are going to show what else you have to have and how you set about f inding it.\"\nIn essence, Nancy Cartwright and Jeremy Hardie discuss how to get f rom \"it worked there\" to \"it will work here\". T his they describe as the \"ef f ectiveness\" of a policy and is the sole f ocus of the book. T hey recognise that it is just one of the many f actors, albeit a vital one, that determine policy decisions. Others include costs and benef its, available resources, alternative choices, ideology, and political expediency.\nIn examining whether it will work \"here\", Cartwright and Hardie argue that one needs f irst to f ind the causal principles that link \"there\" with \"here\". T hen search f or the support f actors that played a positive causal role in making \"it\" happen \"there\". T he authors call this the \"horizontal search\", which leads to asking whether these f actors are present \"here\". Next is the \"vertical search\" f or the level of abstraction that will link \"there\" and \"here\" and so identif y what will genuinely play a positive causal role \"here\". Yes, as stated earlier, this book is a tough read and while I f ear that my pr\u00e9cis does thin justice to the process described in the book, my judgement is that it is exactly the kind of critical and analytical process that policymakers should engage in bef ore rolling out social changes.\nTo help their argument Cartwright and Hardie use some powerf ul examples. Starting in 1985 the STAR project in Tennessee showed, as demonstrated by a randomized controlled trial, that students in the experiment's smaller classes perf ormed better at K-3 grade levels than did students in the larger classes. It also showed that minority and inner-city children gained two or three times as much f rom reduced class sizes as did their white and non-urban peers. Ten years later the state of Calif ornia had problems with its early school grades f inding itself at the bottom of the 39 states in the 1994 National Assessment of Education Progress. Reducing class sizes f itted with popular opinion, with common sense and the Tennessee RCT gave crucial evidence that it worked. In hindsight, of course, it worked \"there\". Calif ornia spent $1 billion, rising to $1.6 billion, on establishing half -size classes throughout the state within a year. But the positive results that were expected did not f ollow. Rigorous evaluation by 2002 f ound no conclusive link between reducing class size and the achievement of students. Moreover there was no improvement f or disadvantaged children.\nT he Calif ornian policymakers had not done an ef f ective horizontal search. In Tennessee only schools that had available space to increase the number of classes were involved. In Calif ornia, with so many schools involved, there was of ten insuf f icient spare space and so it was taken f rom other school activitiesspecial needs, music and arts, athletics and child care programs. In Tennessee there was no shortage of qualif ied teachers to staf f the reduced size classes, but in Calif ornia an additional 12,000 teachers were hired quickly and many of these were unqualif ied. Moreover by limiting other school activities the policy had some negative ef f ects on the school population.\nHere is another example of unintended consequences. It may seem obvious that an isolated study space at home will improve a young person's homework. But this presumes high motivation f or homework. As Cartwright and Hardie point out, it may also be just what is needed to enable a badly motivated child to spend time texting her f riends which she could not do if she were working in the same room as her f amily.\nT he UK Coalition government is introducing changes in the NHS, probation service, school education and elsewhere at breakneck speed and with little sign of evidence-based policy. Its \"What Works\" centres are being established too late. It's a tragedy that this book wasn't available when our current ministers were undergraduates. I recommend it to all who want to see policy improve social practice."}, {"section_title": "-------------------------", "text": "Michael Bassey is an emeritus prof essor of Nottingham Trent University and an academician of the Academy of Social Sciences.
