This study also includes an assessment of the vulnerability of coastal highways and bridges during hurricane event. Recent development in storm surge modeling was briefly reviewed followed by a detailed discussion of the high-resolution, curvilinear-grid coastal storm surge modeling system CH3D-SSMS. By dynamically coupling with a local wave model SWAN and a regional surge model ADCIRC, CH3D-SSMS is able to simulate wave, storm surge, and inundation during tropical storms driven by wind, atmospheric pressure, radiation stress, and freshwater discharge. For application to Hurricane Ivan (2004) and Hurricane Dennis (2005), a curvilinear grid with grid spacing of 100 m to 1,000 m was generated for the northeast Gulf of Mexico to resolve the level at open boundary from shelf wave may contribute up to half of total storm surge at some coastal stations for Hurricane Dennis simulation. Other factors are found to be not very sensitive. The coastal highways risk analysis during storm event, aimed to improve highway and bridge safety and security, is conducted for Hurricane Ivan in Florida and nearby states. The methodology of wave load calculation is described and then applied to the I-10 Bridge over Escambia Bay during Hurricane Ivan. The results confirmed that the big waves on top of the high surge during Ivan were sufficient to cause the breakdown of bolted connection, overcome of span weight and total damage of the bridge deck. With slightly decreased surge levels, the total wave force would be significantly reduced and result in no threat to the bridge. The risk analysis tests are conducted by varying hurricane parameters of intensity, size, landfall location, speed, and direction of approach for Hurricane Ivan. All these parameters are found to be important. A ranking system for assessing the vulnerability of coastal highways and bridges along the northeast Gulf coasts to storm surge and wave damages in extreme storm events are presented. INTRODUCTION Hurricanes are storms with strong winds rotating counter-clockwise around a moving center of low atmospheric pressure. The strong wind can not only cause severe damage to structures, but also induce storm surges and cause devastating flooding over miles inland. According to Bureau of Meteorology Research Center, Australia (BMRC, 2006), a storm surge is a long gravity wave with a length scale similar to the size of the generating tropical cyclone and can lasts from several hours to days depending on the cyclone size and speed of movement. It is of a similar scale to an astronomical tide and should not be confused with short gravity wind waves which have wave-lengths of meters and periods of seconds. The surge usually consists of a single passing wave that elevates or depresses the still water height. In some special situations, especially for cyclones moving parallel to the coast, secondary waves or resurgences can form behind the tropical cyclone. The ocean response to tropical cyclones is quite different in deep water and in shallow water. In deep water, far from a coast, the surface wind stress from a tropical cyclone creates a rotating mound of water by diffusing momentum downward. The ocean elevation is increased by approximately the hydrostatic uplift in response to the low central pressure and some minor long term Coriolis effects. Dynamic effects become pronounced as the tropical cyclone approaches a coast. On entering the shallow waters of a continental shelf, conservation of the potential vorticity of the mound requires development of marked divergence. Channeling by local bathymetry and reflections from the coast also contribute to substantially amplify the surge height (BMRC, 2006). Because of strong wind and high rising water, hurricanes are a huge threat to coastal areas. Billions of dollars and many lives can be lost.  . Because of the devastating effect, government agencies are spending more money on hurricane-related studies and trying to prevent or reduce future loss. As most of the damage comes from flooding and flooding-related structure damage, more and more research, especially on storm surge modeling, has been conducted to determine the physical process and changes of sea level and the extent of coastal flooding. Storm surge simulation is a complex task and involves multiple interacting science and engineering fields. It requires atmospheric scientists to provide accurate hurricane track and wind fields over a large domain. It requires a good set of topography and bathymetry in high resolution. Most of all, it requires an efficient, and robust model to incorporate all major physical processes affecting storm surge. Some storm surge models contain rather simple physics and only consider a few hurricane parameters (e.g., atmospheric pressure deficit, size of the storm, translation speed, and direction) and coarse grid resolution. Some models, however, include ok physical processes, such as wave, tide and their interaction with surge, and use higher grid resolution. The next section contains a brief review of the development of storm surge models over the past thirty years."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge modeling began in the 1970's with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric", "text": "Administration's (NOAA) Special Program to List Amplitudes of Surges from Hurricane (SPLASH) (Jelesnianski, 1972), which was adopted by the National Weather Service (NWS). This early stage model was a 2D storm surge model without nonlinear terms and a fixed boundary on water-land interface. It does not work well in shallow water domains with complex shoreline and bathymetry and is only suitable for open water. Next, a popular model of Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) was developed by NOAA (Jelesnianski, et al, 1984 andJelesnianski, et al, 1992) and was widely used along Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the U.S. to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. As the primary use of the SLOSH model is to define flood-prone areas for evacuation planning, the forecasting of storm surge and inundation is designed for a large domain to capture the main feature and is not suitable for a specific hurricane. The grid resolution is relatively coarse (0.5-7 km), therefore it can not resolve complex shoreline and bathymetry. In addition, the advection terms are not explicitly incorporated in SLOSH (Jelesnianski, et al, 1992), which may underestimate storm surge and inundation in shallow water regions. The Arbiter of Storms (TAOS) model is a 2-D integrated hazards model (Watson, 1995;Watson and Johnson, 1999) that simulates storm surge, wave height, maximum winds, inland flooding, debris, and structural damage. Since tide and wave effect is not included in TAOS, it is similar to SLOSH. The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) is a sigma coordinate, free surface, 3-D ocean model developed by Blumberg and Mellor (1987). It has been used for modeling of estuaries, coastal regions and global oceans. An explicit finite difference scheme is used in POM to calculate horizontal differential terms and an implicit scheme is implemented for vertical differentiation. A flooding & drying scheme was recently incorporated in POM  and then applied to simulate storm surge and inundation in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina for Hurricane Hugo and some hypothetical hurricane events , as well as in Chesapeake Bay for Hurricane Isabel . Moon (2000Moon ( , 2005 coupled a third-generation wave model WAVEWATCH-II with POM to study wave-current interaction in open water during Typhoon Winnie (1997) in the Yellow and East China Seas. The ADvanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC) for oceanic, coastal, and estuarine waters Luettich, 1991, 1992;Luettich and Westerink, 2000) is a finite element model for simulating astronomical tide and storm surge. ADCIRC solves the time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions using flexible unstructured grids. Typical ADCIRC applications use the 2D instead of the 3D simulations. MIKE 21 is an engineering software package for 2D free-surface flows developed by Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) (DHI, 2002). MIKE 21 is applicable to the simulation of hydraulic and related phenomena in lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas, and seas where stratification can be neglected. The contained hydrodynamic module for floodplain modeling in MIKE21 can be used for storm surge simulation in coastal regions when coupled with a storm cyclone wind model. Recently, tropical cyclones have shown strong activities and caused much more damage, especially in North America. Much more attention has been paid by researchers to study storm surges for disaster planning, prevention, and management using numerical models. Along with the rapid advance of computing capacities, the modeling of storm surge has been under development for both real-time forecasting and hindcasting. Newer models and techniques have been developed and applied to improve storm surge simulation accuracy and efficiency. Advances in storm surge modeling come in four different areas: model physics, model grid system, wind models used, and inclusion of wave and other (e.g., tide) influences."}, {"section_title": "Structured Grid Model", "text": "There are two kinds of numerical models being used for storm surge simulation. The first group models are developed based on circulation models, such as POM, ADCIRC and MIKE21, etc. By implementing new features; including flooding & drying capability, deficit air pressure term, hurricane wind stress term, these models are reconstructed, updated, and are more suitable for storm surge and inundation simulation. The most recent applications of these models include the 1939 storm simulation along Australia Coast using GEMS (Hubbert & McInnes,1999);1953 North Sea storm simulation using GEMS (Wolf & Flather, 2005); Hurricane Floyd (1999) simulation in the Chesapeake Bay using ADCIRC (Shen, 2006); Hurricane Hugo (1989) simulation in Charleston, SC using ADCIRC (Dietsche, et al., 2007); Wave effect on storm surge in Hurricane George (1994) using ADCIRC and SWAN (Weaver, 2004); 1991 cyclone simulation in the Bay of Bengal using MIKE21 (Madsen, H. & F. Jakobsen, 2004); Hurricane Winnie (1997) simulation along west coast of Korea using POM (Moon, I., et al., 2003); Hurricane Emily (1993) in the Croatan-Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine, NC using POM and Hurricane Isabel (2003) in the Chesapeake Bay using POM . As summarized in Table 1-1, most of these models use structured grid, either rectangular or curvilinear for discretization of mathematical equations. Three models in Table 1-1 use unstructured grid: UnTRIM, FVCON and ELCIRC are finite volume model while ADCIRC is a finite element model. Although 2D model cannot accurately represent the bottom friction and represent the vertical flow structure, they can simulate the storm surge reasonably well. Hence, 2D models are generally used for storm surge simulation."}, {"section_title": "Unstructured Grid Model", "text": "The UnTRIM model is a semi-implicit finite difference (-volume) model based on the three-dimensional shallow water equations. UnTRIM (Casulli and Walters, 2000) is the unstructured-grid version of the tidal, residual, intertidal mudflat model (TRIM) developed by Casulli and Cheng (1992). Compared to the other traditional models discussed above, UnTRIM is capable of representing a modeling domain with a very high resolution unstructured grid while maintaining numerical stability and computation efficiency. UnTRIM was used to simulate Hurricane Andrew (1992) in Biscayne Bay, FL (Shen, et al., 2005) andHurricane Isabel (2003) in the Chesapeake Bay (Shen, et al., 2006). The MOG2D model is a two-dimensional depth-integrated hydrodynamic model for ocean and coastal water (Carrere and Lyard, 2003). It is a barotropic model based on the classical shallow water equations formulated in spherical coordinates with inclusion of nonlinear terms. The spatial variations are discretized by the continuous Galerkin finite element method which allows freely varying resolution and facilitates a smoothly resolved coastline. Because the drying and flooding is implemented using an explicit time scheme, it requires relatively smaller time step to keep stability. The MOG2D model has been applied to simulate the 1953 North Sea storm (Kleim, et al., 2006). The ELCIRC model is another representative efficient and stable unstructured-grid model that is designed for the effective simulation of 3D baroclinic circulation across river-to-ocean scales (Zhang, et al., 2004;Baptista, et al., 2005). It uses a finite-volume/finite-difference Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm to solve the shallow water equations with incorporation of wetting and drying schemes. While originally developed to meet specific modeling challenges for the Columbia River, ELCIRC has been tested against the Columbia River data and other standard ocean/coastal benchmarks. ELCIRC has been applied to simulate Hurricane Floyd (1999) with success (NOAA, 2004f). The validation of these case studies has shown the success of these unstructured models. However, they are still in their early stage of development. Many processes, e.g., waves are not incorporated into unstructured grid surge models."}, {"section_title": "Grid Resolution", "text": "In order to accurately simulate storm surge and inundation in shallow coastal region, coastal morphological features such as bathymetry, barrier islands, inlets, and shoreline configurations must be resolved reasonably well because of their important roles in affecting nonlinear transport, bottom friction, and flood water flux. To incorporate detailed morphological features, a high resolution grid system has to be used for storm surge models in the horizontal plane. This can be achieved by implementing refined structured curvilinear grid or unstructured grid. For a structured grid, high resolution in one particular domain requires similar resolution along both horizontal axes, which leads to a rapid increase of the total number of cells. Among the reviewed studies, the very fine grid goes from 150 m for Australia Coast (Hubbert, 1999) to around 50 m for storm simulation by Sheng et al. (2005). With fast advances in compute technology, finer structured grids could be used with faster computer with more memory that becomes available every year. The unstructured grid is able to resolve complex shorelines with much finer elements/cells and open waters with coarser elements/cells simultaneously to keep the overall number of cells relatively low. The minimum grid resolution is as small as 50 m for the Hurricane Isabel (2003) simulation using UnTRIM (Shen, et al., 2006). The finite element model ADCIRC uses unstructured grids to represent the irregular shoreline. However, its computation speed is limited by a stringent stability condition associated with the propagation of surface gravity wave and the nonlinear advection terms. Sometimes small time steps in the order of seconds have to be used for very fine grid, resulting in significantly increased simulation time. On the other hand, the UnTRIM model uses semiimplicit time integration and an Eulerian-Lagrangian for advection calculation, which allows larger time steps to be used without severely reducing accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Wind Model", "text": "Wind forcing is another important aspect in storm surge simulations. The review on recent storm surge applications shows that most models rely on Parametric Wind Models to provide hurricane wind to simulate storm surge (Table 1-1). The simplified parametric wind model by MYERs and MALmuN' (1961) has been adopted by the SLOSH model and some other researchers in their storm surge simulations (Shen, et al., 2005;Shen, et al., 2006). The wind and atmospheric pressure fields are generated with the parameters of atmospheric pressure drop and radius of maximum wind speed. The pressure, wind speed, and wind direction are computed for a stationary, circularly symmetric storm with a balance of forces along and perpendicular to a surface wind trajectory. Another popular parametric wind model is the Holland wind model (Holland, 1980), which is the most widely used model and needs only several input parameters such as deficit atmospheric pressure, radius of maximum wind, and maximum wind to reconstruct tropical cyclone wind speed (Moon, et al., 2003;Peng, et al., 2004;Xie, etc., 2004;Weisberg & Zheng, 2006). There are more sophisticated wind models that have been applied to simulate and provide wind for storm surge and wave simulation, such as the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) model and models by Ocean Weather and Numerical Weather Prediction systems (NWP, 2004). In general, these sophisticated wind models generate better wind fields than parametric wind models. However, additional parameters, such as sea surface temperature, horizontal temperature gradient, etc., are necessary to provide boundary conditions and drive the wind model. In many cases, these parameters are not available and have to be estimated. As the result, uncertainty is introduced which may lead to errors in the simulated wind field. For hypothetical storm events in coastal hazard studies, storm surge forecasting, or real storms where detailed wind is not available, the parametric wind models are very useful as they require very limited cyclone input and at the same time rebuild the entire wind field with fairly good accuracy. Recent publications have not considered the land reduction effect on wind when hurricane wind blew over coastal land. Its effect has been recognized by US Army Corps of Engineers in their evaluation of the New Orleans and southeast Louisiana hurricane protection system for Hurricane Katrina (2005) (IPET, 2005. This is a factor that should be included in the future storm surge simulations.\nThe surface wind field associated with tropical cyclone is the key factor and the primary requirement for modeling storm surges. It not only generates a strong shear stress and atmospheric pressure gradient at air-sea interface to drive the surge, but also generates big waves that lead to further water setup near the coastline and inside the bay due to radiation stress. Therefore, it deserves a separate section on wind field and wind models Considering the large domain and difficulty of open sea wind measurement, measured winds are always sparse. Modeled winds are often used for storm surge simulation. One of the best simulated winds is the Hurricane Research Division wind (HRD) of NOAA (HRD, 2006). HRD is formed to advance the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather. Its wind is based on a combination of computer models, theories, and observations, with particular emphasis on data obtained with research aircraft. With spatial resolution of 6 km over hurricane affect domain, the detailed wind structure can be accurately represented by HRD wind.  (Chow, 1971;Cardone et al., 1992). The interaction between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere is expressed in terms of the geotropic wind field (velocity at the top of the boundary layer) and the surface stress (frictional dissipation of the kinetic energy in the boundary layer). Further parameterization of the model includes vertical fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture. This parameterization is based on the matching of mean profiles of wind, temperature, and moisture by surface and outer layer similarity theories. The PBL model is a sophisticated wind model and has the potential to generate accurate wind field. However, in most real cases, the available storm parameters are limited to central pressure deficit, translation speed, direction, and radius to maximum winds. As the result, the PBL model is difficult to use because of the uncertainty in choosing the right parameters that are unknown. The Holland wind model (Holland, 1980) is the most widely used \"parametric\" analytic wind model that requires fewer input parameters. The radial wind structure of the symmetric vortex is a function of the radius of maximum wind, maximum wind, and a measure of the width of the profile. The Holland model is used to provide wind input to the SLOSH storm surge model by FEMA to guide real-world financial and emergency response decisions. According to Holland (1980), the atmospheric pressure is assumed exponentially varying from the storm center: where P 0 is the central atmospheric pressure, P\u221e is the atmospheric pressure far away from the center, r is the distance from the center of the storm, and A and B are scaling parameters. Following Wilson (1957), Davis (2001) further simplified the derivation by setting A is equal to the radius of maximum wind speed, R, and B is equal to 1 in his Hurricane Floyd and Hurricane Irene (1999) simulations: where P a is the relative atmospheric pressure and \u2206P 0 = P 0 -P\u221e is the central pressure drop of the storm. The cyclostrophic wind velocity, U c , is The geotropic wind velocity, U g , is The gradient wind velocity, U G , is -44) and the resolved part, V , of the translational velocity of the storm, where \u03b8 is the angle from the direction of bearing of the storm, \u03b2, to any point inside the storm. The surface wind velocity, U s , in the x-and y-directions is then written as where \u03c6 is an inward rotation angle of 18 o and K is the ratio of surface wind velocity to gradient wind velocity."}, {"section_title": "Inclusion of Wave Effect", "text": "Most storm surge simulations do not include simulation of storm waves or the interaction between surges and waves. Storm wind and deficit atmospheric pressure are the only two major driving forces in these storm surge simulations. Among the limited studies with wave simulation, Choi (2003) established a coupled wave-tide-surge model in investigating the effect of tides, storm surges, and wind waves interactions during a winter monsoon in November 1983 in Yellow Sea. The coupled model is based on the synchronous dynamic coupling of a thirdgeneration wave model, WAM-Cycle 4 (WAMDI group, 1988), and the two-dimensional tidesurge model developed at the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) (Choi, 1980). The surface stress generated by interactions between wind and waves is calculated using the WAM-Cycle 4 directly based on an analytical approximation of the results obtained from the quasilinear theory of wave generation. The changes of the bottom friction factor generated by waves and current interactions are calculated by using simplified bottom boundary layer model of Grand and Madsen (1986). Their results showed that bottom velocity and bottom drag coefficient were affected by wave-current interaction in shallow waters during strong storm conditions. Moon (2003) used a two-way-coupled ocean wave-circulation model to study the unusual coastal flooding by Typhoon Winnie on the west coast of Korea. The coupled model consists of a third-generation ocean wave model WAVEWATCH-II (Tolman, 1992) and a threedimensional circulation model POM. In the coupling scheme of the two models, WAVEWATCH-II uses the new currents and elevations fed back from POM to consider wavecurrent interactions; POM uses a wave-dependent drag coefficient calculated from WAVEWATCH-II to consider the dependency of sea state (wave age) on the wind stress. The coupling process between the storm surge model and the wave model is important for both water level and wave simulation. Within shallow coastal regions, the elevated water level increases the flow field and total depth which may significantly change wave development and transport. At the same time, wave-induced radiation stress and its effect on surface and bottom friction will change circulation and ultimately the storm surge and inundation. Thus, the surge-wave coupling process should be considered for a complete storm surge simulation."}, {"section_title": "CH3D-SSMS Storm Surge Modeling System", "text": "The Curvilinear-grid Hydrodynamics 3D model (CH3D) was developed by Peter Sheng (1986, 1989). The CH3D model uses a horizontal boundary-fitted curvilinear grid and a vertically sigma grid and is therefore suitable for application to coastal and nearshore waters with complex shorelines and bathymetry. The non-orthogonal grid enables CH3D to more accurately represent the complex geometry than the orthogonal grid, which is used by many other ocean circulation models, e.g. POM and ROMS. CH3D was first used for storm surge simulation of Hurricanes Marco (1990) and Floyd (1999). Sheng et al. (2002Sheng et al.

At the river boundary, water is introduced into the system by given fresh water discharge. At the open boundary, there are three kinds of conditions that can be applied: clamped boundary condition (water level specified), specified water mass flux specification and radiation condition. As water domain along the open boundary is very large, continuous measurement or estimation of water mass is normally very difficult to obtain, especially during a storm event, therefore the second boundary condition of specified water mass is not generally used. The most common open boundary condition for CH3D is the clamped boundary. This is mainly because of the fact that water levels are relatively easier to prescribe. For tidal simulation case, tidal constituents, predicted tide or tide from circulation models can all be applied depends on data availability. Deficit atmospheric pressure induced water level at the open boundary can be estimated from analytical Holland model based on hurricane intensity and track. Surge induced water level is normally available from regional circulation model ADCIRC. Thus, the total water level at open boundary can be written as: where \u03b6 is water level along open boundary; \u03b6 T is the component from tide; \u03b6 S is surge provided by regional circulation model; and \u03b6 D is water level adjustment if different vertical datum is considered. The Flather radiation boundary condition (Flather, 1976) is also available in CH3D-SSMS. Comparing to clamped boundary condition, the Flather radiation boundary condition allow the disturbed water level inside domain to be transported outside. However, it requires both water level and current to be specified at the open boundary, which may not be easy to obtain and may introduce more uncertainties.

A further constraint is that the parameterizations of physical processes included in the model do not address conditions where the waves are strongly depth-limited.

At the same time, the rising water from the storm surge may also change the wave transport process by altering total water depth. Therefore, the circulation and waves interact with each other, and these coupling processes should not be neglected for storm surge simulations. Developed at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, SWAN is a very well-validated third-generation wave model which computes random, short-crested wind-generated waves in coastal regions and inland waters (Holthuijsen et al., 2003). The model is based on the wave action balance equation (or energy balance in the absence of currents) with sources and sinks. The model predicts a 2D wave field on already specified grid points. SWAN accounts for the following physics: 1) wave propagation in time and space, shoaling, refraction due to current and depth, frequency shifting due to currents and nonstationary depth; 2) wave generation by wind; 3) three-and four-wave interactions; 4) whitecapping, bottom friction and depth-induced breaking; 5) wave induced setup; 6) propagation from laboratory up to global scales; and 7) transmission through and reflection from obstacles. In CH3D-SSMS, SWAN is dynamically coupled with CH3D to provide wave height, period, and directions at each CH3D grid cells. These wave parameters are used to estimate radiation stress in the water momentum transport equation to drive the flow."}, {"section_title": "Simple Storm Surge Test", "text": "When hurricanes strike the continental shelf, one question is how the bathymetry and topography and their slopes affect the surge and wave along the coast? The relationship between the bathymetry, topography and their slopes and storm surge can be represented by simplified momentum equation. For steady state, the wind and bottom stress on the water and a hydrostatic force is balance by the water surface slope (Dean and Dalrymple, 1984): Where \u03c2 is water level in x-coordinate directions; \u03c4 w and \u03c4 B are shear stress on water surface and bottom, respectively; \u03c1 is water density; g is the acceleration of gravity; and h is water depth. By assuming zero water levels at deep water l with h 0 water depth, the solution for above equation for linearly increased bathymetry can be written as: 1 \u03c4 \u03c4 . Thus for a given wind stress, the shallower the water depth, the smaller the slope, the higher storm surge can be obtained. Numerical experiments are designed to further evaluate the relationship of bathymetry and storm surge using CH3D-SSMS. The test slopes are selected based on Florida coast bathymetry. As shown in Figure ( The maximum surge obtained from the mild slope case is much bigger than that from the steep slope bathymetry case (Table 2-1) and is associated with severe flooding. In addition, the simulation results also imply the wind-driven surges vary approximately inversely with the bathymetry slope. In other words, a n-time milder slope would cause roughly n times higher surges. During the transient state in real storms, the water level may not be fully developed but the conclusion should still be valid as the rate of water level change is determined by surface stress and total water depth. When waves break in surf zone, it will cause water level to increase due to wave setup. The tests are extended by including wave effect on storm surge. The same grid systems are used with zero water levels and waves with a 6 meter significant wave height and 10 second peak period at the open boundary. The net water level difference between simulations with wave effects and without wave effects are attributed to surge due to wave setup. The maximum wave setup is obtained from the steepest slope case (1:100) with magnitude of about 50 cm ( obtained from the 2D model, which implies that the bottom friction is zero. Therefore, wind stress on the surface is the sole force that caused the setup. While for 3D model, the velocity at each layer is not zero even though the vertically-averaged velocity is. Near water bottom, the flow velocity from the stratified flow field is in the opposite direction of wind field. Therefore, this bottom stress provides addition force that caused higher setup together with wind stress. It has to be kept in mind that this is extreme case. In reality, the bottom flow is rarely in the exact opposite direction of wind field, thus the magnitude of bottom friction effect will be reduced.     Figure A-1) three times. Ivan caused significant damage and loss of many lives as it passed through the Caribbean Sea and the southeastern United States (NHC, 2004).

Using calculated storm surge and wave data, the I-10 Bridge (Escambia Bay, Florida) collapse event was analyzed by calculating the wave force on the bridge deck. Afterwards, extensive sensitivity tests were made to evaluate the key factors affecting storm surge simulation. The final part is the risk analysis for hurricane impacts based on different kinds of simulation scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Synoptic History", "text": "Hurricane Ivan developed from a large tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on 31 August, 2004. It continued to develop to Tropical Storm Ivan at 0600 UTC 3 September and steadily strengthened to a hurricane at 0600 UTC 5 September. Ivan reached Category 5 strength three times in the Caribbean Sea before it entered the Gulf of Mexico on 14 September as a Category 4 hurricane. As Ivan moved to the northern Gulf of Mexico, it weakened slightly and made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane with 121 mph wind at 0650 UTC 16 September, just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama (SSEC, 2004) (Figure 3-1). By this time, the eye diameter had increased to 40-50 n mi, which resulted in some of the strongest winds occurring over a narrow area near the southern Alabama-western Florida Panhandle border. After Ivan moved across the barrier islands of Alabama, the hurricane turned north-northeastward across eastern Mobile Bay and weakened into a tropical storm 12 h later over central Alabama (NHC, 2004). The best track of hurricane is a subjectively-smoothed representation of a tropical cyclone's location and intensity over its lifetime. The best track contains the cyclone's latitude, longitude, maximum sustained surface winds, and minimum sea-level pressure at 6-hourly intervals (NOAA, 2004e). The best track central barometric pressure and wind speed history for Hurricane Ivan is depicted in Figure 3 -2 (NHC, 2004). The details of best track for Hurricane Ivan are included in Appendix A. As Ivan grows to Category 5 hurricane, the maximum wind speed increased to 160 mile/hour. When Ivan moves closer to the continent it started to weaken. After landfall, central barometric pressure rose and wind speed dropped dramatically. The forces of Ivan were directly responsible for 92 deaths, 25 of them were americans. Ivan also caused extensive damage to coastal and inland areas of the United States. Portions of the Interstate 10 bridge system across Pensacola Bay, Florida were severely damaged and as much as a quarter-mile of the bridge collapsed into the Bay. The U.S Highway 90 Causeway across the northern part of the bay was also heavily damaged. Thousands of homes and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed. In addition, Ivan also destroyed millions of acres of woodlands and forests. The total estimated U.S. loss is approximately $14.2 billion.\nDennis formed from a tropical wave that moved westward from the coast of Africa on 29 June, 2005. The system became a tropical storm on 5 July as it turned west-northwestward. Dennis reached hurricane strength early on 7 July, then rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 120 kt before making landfall near Punta del Ingles in southeastern Cuba near 0245 UTC 8 July. Dennis weakened significantly over Cuba, with the maximum sustained winds decreasing to 75 kt by the time the center left the island. Dennis gradually intensified for the next 6-12 h over the Gulf of Mexico before beginning another cycle of rapid intensification near 1800 UTC 9 July accompanied by a turn toward the north-northwest. During this intensification, the central pressure fell 37 mb in 24 h, including 20 mb in 6 h and 11 mb in 1 h 35 min. Maximum sustained winds reached a third peak of 125 kt near 1200 UTC 10 July. Thereafter, weakening occurred and the maximum sustained winds decreased to 105 kt and the central pressure rose to 946 mb before Dennis made landfall on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, about 1930 UTC 10 July, which is approximately 30 miles to the east of where Hurricane Ivan had made landfall 10 months before   (Figure 4-1). Dennis continued north-northwestward after landfall, with the center moving across the western Florida Panhandle into southwestern Alabama before it weakened into a tropical storm. It became a depression as it moved into east-central Mississippi on 11 July. Dennis did not cause as much damage as Ivan. Dennis moved about 7 mph faster than Ivan at landfall and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40 miles from its center, compared to Ivan's 105 miles. During the height of the storm, Dennis produced storm surges as high as 9 ft in the Apalachee region and as high as 7 ft on the Florida Panhandle leaving 680,000 customers without electricity in four southern states. Hurricane Dennis directly caused 3 deaths in the United States and an estimated total U. S. damage of $2.23 billion. The best track central barometric pressure and wind speed history for Hurricane Dennis is shown in Figure 4-2 (NHC, 2005). Dennis once strengthened to Category 4 hurricane with the maximum wind speed increasing to 130 kt/s in the Caribbean, but weakening dramatically after making landfall in Cuba. After leaving Cuba, Dennis gained strength again and moved northwest to the Florida Panhandle at about 15 miles/h.

It not only generates a strong shear stress and atmospheric pressure deficit at air-sea interface to drive the surge, but also generates big waves that lead to further water setup at the coast by radiation stress. Therefore, the accuracy of wind field fed into the surge model directly affects the accuracy of surge simulation. During a strong storm event, continuously measured wind is normally only available at limited stations. However, storm surge model requires complete wind information to cover the entire simulation domain before and after the hurricane makes landfall. As a result, simulated or data-assimilated wind field are normally used for storm surge simulation. The following are several representative wind data sets that are available to public and are used in this study.\nThe wind fields considered for the Hurricane Dennis simulation include WNA wind and HRD wind. The procedures to download and process wind for Hurricane Ivan are implemented again for Dennis. For the extended grid, additional land cover data are used to provide bottom roughness when land reduction effect is considered for hurricane wind (Figure 4-6). As land cover is not available between Tamp Bay and Cedar Kay, FL, an estimated averaged bottom roughness of 0.5 m is used. Since that region is far away from the Dennis track, the estimation should not significantly affect the overall wind field. When the hurricane is long time before and right after landfall, only WNA wind is used to generate wind field for storm surge simulation as HRD wind is not available. During the time in between, both WNA wind and HRD wind are used because the grid system for Hurricane Dennis is so large that HRD wind alone can not cover the west coast of Florida. Linear interpolation is used at the wind interfering domain to keep smooth transition in the wind combination process. An example is shown in Figure 4-7 on the combination of HRD and WNA wind at west coast of Florida at 16:30, July 10 th , 2005, UTC. At domains where HRD does not have coverage, extrapolation was used to generate wind field, which introduced error. In this case, wind was underestimated. By combining with WNA wind, it is able to reconstruct wind field to keep both accurate HRD wind near hurricane center and good WNA wind far away from the hurricane center. The transit zone is determined at locations where both HRD and WNA have approximately the same wind amplitude."}, {"section_title": "HRD wind", "text": "The Hurricane Research Division (HRD) of NOAA was formed to advance the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather.

In general, HRD Ivan wind has snapshots every three hours until the hurricane made land fall. A representative HRD wind snapshot before Hurricane Ivan made landfall (0600 UTC 16 September, 2004) is depicted in Figure 3 -7 (HRD, 2006).The wind is one-minute maximum sustained surface wind, valid for marine exposure over water and open terrain exposure over land."}, {"section_title": "WNA wind", "text": "WNA wind is simulated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP/NOAA) for wave modeling.

However, the wind over land is overestimated as it does not include any land reduction effect.

As discussed above, numerous wind models are used to produce hurricane wind for storm surge simulation. Driven by wind stress, wave setup, and shallow water effect, the highest surges are normally observed at shallow water zones, such as estuarine, lagoon, or coastal bays. Winds at these domains are very important for accurate storm surge simulation. Unfortunately, none of the wind models discussed above completely consider the land reduction effect when wind blows over land. WNA and WINDGEN do not have land reduction at all. HRD wind does add this effect by assuming land to be open terrain but it is not accurate enough to represent the true land. In order to incorporate the land roughness effect, the methods used by IPET (2006) for the Hurricane Katrina study are considered here. As an example, the following list the procedures to add land reduction effect to adjust HRD wind for use by CH3D-SSMS: 1. Remove open exposure effect in HRD wind. 2. Make continuous snapshots between three-hour snapshots using Lagrangian interpolation. 3. Convert one-minute wind to 10-minute wind.

As discussed before, when Ivan moved close to the coast, the high resolution HRD wind is used in the model. Other times, WNA is applied as HRD wind cannot cover the computational domain. For both winds, land reduction effect by land use is considered to adjust the wind when the wind is blowing over land. As shown in Figure 3-12, the simulated wind compares well with the measurement at all stations. At FCMP station Tower 1 and Tower 2, the measurement was not made during the entire storm but long enough to capture the maximum wind as Ivan went by. Station Dauphin Island, Pensacola and T1 are located within the maximum wind radius range and the winds peak up to 35-40 m/s. T2 is also within the range, however the maximum wind speed is only about 30 m/s. The reason is that the station is located deep inland and wind is weakened by the surrounding rough land. Stations Panama City Beach and Waveland are located further away from hurricane center and have relatively weaker wind. It should be noticed that, even though Panama City Beach is located further from hurricane center than Waveland, it has much higher wind (25 m/s .vs . 15 m/s). Two reasons made the difference. First, it is on east side of the hurricane which has stronger wind; secondly, wind at Panama City Beach always blow from water to land thus there is no land reduction effect, while Waveland is just the opposite. The time series of wind at these stations show that both magnitude and direction are also in good agreement of the measurement except at stations Waveland and Pensacola, but the differences of wind direction are simply caused by instrument error. The atmospheric pressure for Ivan is calculated from the analytical Holland Model solution based on hurricane track, minimum deficit atmospheric pressure, and maximum wind radius. The time series comparisons at a few stations are shown in Figure 3-13. Since the Holland model assumes uniform atmospheric pressure structure, the spatial variation can not be fully resolved and sometimes may not give perfect results. As a result, the simulated pressure at stations close to the hurricane center shows better comparison than those from stations further away. For example, simulated atmospheric pressure at station Dauphin Island was much better than station Waveland and station Panama City Beach. The atmospheric pressure measurement at Station Pensacola is not complete because of instrument failure.\nThe wind used in the Dennis simulation includes WNA wind and HRD wind. In general, the simulated wind compared well with measured data for both amplitude and direction at most stations (Figure 4-8). Since Dennis is a relatively compact hurricane, the maximum wind does not extend to a large domain and only blows with maximum speed of approximately 25 m/s. The relative error for wind magnitude is on the order of 10%. The direction is also in good agreement of measurement. The atmospheric pressure for Dennis is calculated from the analytical Holland Model solution based on hurricane track, minimum deficit atmospheric pressure, and maximum wind radius. The comparison of atmospheric pressure time series for Hurricane Dennis between simulation and observation at a few stations are shown in Figure 4-9. Since the Holland model assumes uniform atmospheric pressure structure, the spatial variation can not be fully resolved and sometimes may not give perfect results. Therefore, the simulated pressure at stations close to the hurricane center shows better comparison than stations that far away from the hurricane center. For example, simulated atmospheric pressure at station Waveland is not quite good. However, this should have much less effect on simulated water level as the deficit atmospheric pressure error is approximately equal to only a few centimeters difference in water level."}, {"section_title": "Water level and High Water Mark comparison", "text": "Hurricane Ivan is a very strong Category 3 storm that hit the northeast Gulf coast in 2004. The along shore current caused by the cyclonic wind generated a big storm surge up to 4 meters along the coast of Florida, Mississippi, and Alabaman. Continuous water levels were collected at a few NOAA stations along the Gulf coast during Hurricane Ivan. Located right next to Ivan's landfall location, large amounts of water were pushed into Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay and causing significant storm surge. Unfortunately, the highest water level was unable to be measured at the Pensacola station because of instrument failure. At other stations, complete measurement was recorded. The time series of simulated water levels at these locations were compared with observation (Figure 3-14). Overall, the comparisons are satisfactory. The storm surges were accurately simulated in both amplitude and phase. Besides the water level collected from NOAA stations, the High Water Marks (HWMs) are the primary source of post hurricane high-water level data for the evaluation of storm surge models by individual site comparison. There are two kinds of high water marks, \"inside high water marks\", which generally reflect the storm tide elevation without the effect of waves, and \"outside high water marks\", which usually reflect the combined effect of storm tide and wave set up and run up, such as marks on buildings or other fixed structures (USACE, 2006). As a storm surge model does not include wind-generated surface gravity waves and wave run-up, only \"inside high water marks\" could be compared directly with model results. The US Army Corps of Engineers has collected some HWMs along the coast region during Hurricane Ivan. The comparison with simulation results are shown in Table 3-3.

It is important to identify the roles of these parameters in storm surge simulation and how are model is considered, all four wind sets produce similar surge response for Hurricane Ivan except station Dauphin Island for WNA wind. This comes from two factors, first the low resolution WNA wind does not have wind over land; secondly Dauphin Island is located very close to the hurricane center, so accurate wind field can not be obtained from limited wind over ocean before hurricane made landfall. Overall, the best simulation result is the base case simulation using Limited Land Exposure HRD wind. When ADCIRC constituents are used along the open boundary, the highest storm surge is reduced slightly at all stations (a few cms) in Case 8 (Figure 3-21). This is simply because predicted tide is more accurate during this simulation period. If Hurricane Ivan made landfall during some other time, the predicted tide is not necessarily as good as ADCIRC constituents. In Case 9, a constant Manning's coefficient is applied in the model. Since the spatially-varying coefficient has modest variation, the constant one does not change the results much. The overall comparison is still relatively good. The atmospheric pressure effect is tested in Case 10. As the atmospheric pressure deficit decreases exponentially from the hurricane center, its effect on water level is limited to areas that are close to the hurricane eye. Therefore, station Dauphin Island and Pensacola experience bigger water level drops (approximate 20 cm) than other stations (several cms) because of their closeness to the hurricane track and the hurricane center. Case 11 implies that wave effect has a significant effect on storm surge (Figure 3-21). As big as approximately 70 cm water level drop is simulated at station Dauphin Island and Pensacola, where stronger wind and wave setup are prominent at other stations. In order to determine what roles estuaries play in affecting the storm surge and inundation in coastal zones, the Pensacola Bay is removed from the grid system with cut off line starting from barrier islands (Figure 3-22). Then Hurricane Ivan is simulated once again with the test grid. Output stations for storm surge are selected both along coast and in open water within 50 km radius from Pensacola Inlet. The time series of storm surge at all stations are compared with those from simulations with Pensacola Bay (Figure 3-23). Station 3, which locates right at the Pensacola Inlet, is the only one that shows obvious water level difference. The simulated storm surge for the grid without Pensacola is about 5 cm higher than the simulations with Pensacola Bay. This implies that the existence of estuaries do not have significant effect on the storm surge and inundation in continental shelf coastal zones. While within coastal bay or lagoon area, the effect from estuarine is much bigger. The shallow water induces larger surge and delayed the peak of the surge. For example, the maximum simulated storm surge at the north rim of Pensacola Bay is about 4.8 m during Hurricane Ivan, which is about 1.7 m higher than simulated surge at mouth of Pensacola Bay with 1.5 hour delay (Figure 3-18). As the storm surge advanced within the bay, water level gradually increased and maximized at the north end. The abnormally elevated water caused extensive flooding at the low-land areas along the bay coast zone. The inundation within Pensacola Bay is even worse than coastal barrier islands (Figure 3-19)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Ivan 3D simulation", "text": "The above simulations have shown that the two dimensional CH3D-SSMS is a computationally efficient model which produces reasonable good water levels during the Hurricane Ivan. This is important for both storm surge forecast and hindcast when simulation time is a key factor and many calibration simulations have to be conducted. However, in a 2D model, as the vertical flow structure can not be obtained while the bottom friction, nonlinear, diffusion and Coriolis terms have to be calculated from vertical averaged velocity. In a 3D model, all these terms can be more accurately simulated and vertical flow structure can be obtained. In CH3D-SSMS, there are three major differences between 3D mode and 2D mode for storm surge simulation. First, the equilibrium closure turbulence model is applied in 3D to calculate eddy viscosity, which is then used to solve for velocities at each vertical layer. Secondly, a quadratic bottom friction formulation based on log law is used in 3D mode, which is the function of bottom flow velocity and bed roughness. This is superior to the Chezy formulation in 2D mode using vertically averaged velocity. The third difference is that the nonlinear, diffusion and Coriolis terms in 3D mode are calculated based on velocities at each vertical layer, which is more accurate than the 2D mode that uses the vertical averaged velocities. As storm surge becomes more significant in shallow coastal waters, a modest number of vertical layers are needed. In this study, a total of four layers are used for Hurricane Ivan simulation. At bottom, a constant roughness of 0.4 cm is considered for bottom friction calculation. When coupling with local wave model SWAN, the wave-current induced bottom friction is included. In CH3D-SSMS, two methodologies for wave enhanced bottom stress are implemented. The first one applies the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory described in a simplified form by Signell et al. (1990). The second methodology makes use of a one-dimensional wavecurrent bottom boundary layer model (Sheng and Villaret, 1989) to generate a lookup table for wave enhanced bottom stress calculation. The detailed formulations are described by Alymov (2005). All the other model coefficients and the grid system are the same as those used in previous 2D simulation. The time series of water levels from the first set of 3D simulations are shown in Figure 3-24. Overall, the simulated storm surges from 3D models are similar to those from 2D models. There is no obvious difference of maximum surge between two models for stations located further away from hurricane center, such as Panama City and Panama City Beach. While for station Dauphin Island and station Pensacola, which are close to hurricane track, the 3D model simulated slightly higher surge than 2D model. The wave enhanced bottom friction has little effect on storm surge simulation for either method. In general, the maximum surge is reduced by several centimeters when wave-current interaction effect on friction is considered. Because of higher simulated storm surge, the inundation area near Pensacola Bay is extended slightly (Figure 3-25 Even though 3D model has better estimation of bottom friction and vertical turbulence, its expensive simulation time prohibits it from extensive application. Because the mode splitting technique used in 3D mode, the bottom friction has to be calculated in explicit mode, which requires significantly reduced time step to maintain numerical stability. In Hurricane Ivan simulation, as small as 10 second is used in 3D model compared to 60 second in 2D model. In addition, solving for velocities in each vertical layers also need addition computing time. Therefore, the selection of 2D or 3D simulation mode is dependent on the interests of the user. When accuracy of the storm surge estimation is the primary concern and there is enough computer resource, the 3D model is the choice. On the contrary, when both simulation time and accuracy are equally important, the 2D model should be used as it can produce reasonably good water level simulations within a short period of time. 2D model have been widely used for storm surge forecast simulation for its efficiency and accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Risk Analysis Tests", "text": "Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage by wind, waves, and flooding along the coasts of Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama. Successful field and model studies would help to recognize how storm surges evolve and to enable analysis of flooding risk potentials. However, for a particular coastal domain, one single storm is never enough to identify the vulnerability to storm surge because of its uniqueness. Storm surge is sensitive to hurricane intensity, direction, size (maximum of wind radius), speed of approach, and location of landfall. In this study, twelve hurricane scenarios are designed to assess the extensive water level and flooding response along northeast coast of Gulf of Mexico by varying each of those parameters (Table 3- Figure 3-30. Cases 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 share the same track with the base case and each of the other cases has its own track. The first group of risk analysis is designed to test storm surge response to hurricane intensity. Keeping other parameters unchanged, the strength of the test hurricane is set to Category 2, 3 (base case), 4, and 5, respectively. The time series at four stations are selected to compare water level along the west coast to the east coast of northeast GOM, which are Waveland, Dauphin Island, Pensacola, and Panama City Beach. As shown in Figure 3-31, a similar pattern of surge development was observed at all stations. More intensive wind results in higher water level as the hurricane translate closer to coastline. Located about 30 miles east of landfall location, Pensacola experiences the maximum wind and storm surge. Highest water level almost tripled when hurricane intensity increases from Category 2 to Category 5, jumping from 1.5 m to 3.9 m. With the additional effect from waves, the maximum surge would be even higher, especially in the upper Escambia Bay. If this should happen in reality, the damage from wind, wave, and flooding would be catastrophic. Many houses will be blown down, large area will be under water and many coastal structures, including highway bridges, may be totally destroyed. To describe the flooding problem clearly, the inundation around Pensacola is made for the Category 5 hurricane case (Figure 3-36). In this worst case scenario, most of the barrier islands outside of Pensacola Bay were submerged pushing more water into the bay. The high surge caused significant flooding to the east of Escambia Bay and Blackwater Bay. Considering the additional effect from wave, the flooding potential will be even greater. The effect of the hurricane approach direction is tested by varying \u00b145 degrees from original track as Case 4 and Case 5. The effect is quite obvious. When the hurricane track is turned 45 degrees clockwise, wind is blowing from inland to offshore for west coastal domain before the hurricane makes landfall (Figure 3-32). As a result, only a small storm surge is generated along the coast. After landfall, the wind continuously blows offshore on the west of the track and pushes water away causing set down at both Waveland and Dauphin Island. On the east of the hurricane track, the stronger wind swifts from east to southeast when the hurricane moves close to landfall, pushing water onshore and generating significant storm surge over the Florida Panhandle. The highest water level at Panama City Beach is much larger than the base case simulation. Because of its closeness to hurricane eye, the wind field at station Pensacola does not change much, neither does the highest water level. For Case 5 when the hurricane direction of approach is turned 45 degrees counterclockwise, the wind field is just the opposite. The long-term continuous southeastly offshore wind keeps pushing water into the bays between Louisianan and Alabama causing high storm surge and serious flooding. The storm water goes up to 2.5 m at station Waveland. The water level is comparable to the base simulation at Dauphin Island and gradually decreased from Pensacola to Panama City Beach. The storm surge sensitivity to hurricane size is studied in group 3 by doubling maximum wind radius (Case 6) and reducing maximum wind radius to half size (Case 7). Similar to test of hurricane intensity, higher surge is generated for larger scale storm and lower surge for smaller scale storm at selected stations (Figure 3-33). This qualitatively agrees with the distribution of wind field. By extending maximum wind radius, the average magnitude of wind is increased while maximum wind is kept the same, resulting in an overall rising of high water along the northeast Gulf coast. The increased wind magnitude is bigger for domains far away from Maximum Wind Radius (MWR) and those near MWR comparing to the base case, as a result the higher surges are predicted at stations further away from the hurricane track, such as Waveland and Panama City Beach (about 50 cm). Station Dauphin Island is located within the range of MWR so the change of wind field is very small leaving almost no change of the highest water level compared to the base case. Similar analysis applies to test Case 7 for the half-sized hurricane. The reduced size weakens the wind field extensively over the whole domain. The highest surges at all stations are much lower than the base case. Even though it is still a Category 3 hurricane, the compact size limits its influence of wind to a substantially reduced area. The intensity of the hurricane is mitigated by its size. The effect of the hurricane's speed of approach is studied in group 4 (Case 8 and Case 9). The one-time slower speed allows a longer time to redistribute water mass. Due to the slow moving speed, the wind change is small. A relatively more static balance is obtained between wind-induced shear stress and water level slope. At station Waveland, the wind magnitude is relatively greater than the base case at a particular time before landfall and the wind direction is favorable to storm surge, thus water level rises earlier with bigger height. At other stations, water levels also rise earlier, but the maximum water level is comparable to what in the base case (Figure 3-34). When the hurricane speed of approach is increased by two times in Case 9, the faster moving hurricane does not fully respond to wind stress. The water level is more controlled by local wind. Similar high water levels are generated at Dauphin Island and Pensacola, but with much shorter developing period. At Waveland, the highest surge is much lower than base case as there is not enough time for water to be transported to the station. Storm surge is also sensitive to point of landfall. In Case 10, the landfall location is shifted by 50 km to the west from the base case, redistributing hurricane strength to the west with the same hurricane structure. The shift results in higher wind on the west and lower wind on the east, generating higher surge at Waveland and Dauphin Island and lower surge at Pensacola and Panama City Beach, respectively (Figure 3-35). Exactly the opposite results are obtained for case 11 when the landfall location is shifted by 50 km to the east. For both cases, the change of surge magnitude is significant."}, {"section_title": "Wave Loadings On Highway Bridges", "text": "During a storm event, wind waves are a big threat to coastal structures such as jetties, pipelines, piers, and coastal highway bridges. They may cause severe property damage, interruption of transportation, and seriously deteriorate the economy. As the waves impact a structure, the flow properties become more complex and cannot be completely solved by principle of fluid mechanics. Field measurement of flow kinematics and forces are very difficult to obtain. Researchers have to rely on both theoretical and laboratory analysis to develop simplified methods to calculate wave force for engineering applications. Wang (1970) performed physical model tests to investigate wave loads on horizontal decks subject to wave attacks. A simple formula was proposed to estimate uplift pressure on horizontal decks. He found out that the slowly-varying pressure was about one to two times that of the hydrostatic pressure at the plate bottom. Similar relationships were also obtained by French (1970) on an experimental wave uplift study on flat horizontal platforms, Overbeek and Klabeers (2001) Denson (1978Denson ( , 1980 to measure wave loads. Dimensionless charts were provided to calculate wave force from highway bridge decks. However, as pointed out by Douglass, et al. (2006), the unrealistic wave parameters and poor lab conditions made the results unreliable. Cuoto et al. (2003Cuoto et al. ( , 2007 proposed new guidelines for dynamic wave loads on jetties and platforms by analyzing impulsive wave loads. The more complex quasi-static force is obtained from best regression fit of data based on basic wave force. Because of different scales and shapes, these formulas may not be appropriate for bridge decks. Based on hydrostatic pressure assumption, Douglass et al. (2006) proposed a simplified formula to estimate wave load based on wave height. When waves are not able to fully attack the bridge deck, the wave force could be overestimated. In studying wave forces on offshore platforms, Kaplan et al. (1995) and Bea et al. (1999) proposed the method of total wave forces calculation by dividing into vertical buoyancy, velocity dependent drag and lift, acceleration dependent inertial force, and dynamic slamming force. The slamming force is the momentum transferred from water to structure when wave crest encounters the bridge deck. Its magnitude depends on the characteristic of the deck. The review discussed above is summarized in Table 3-6. In this study, the wave load model by Bea et al. (1999) is adopted for the I-10 Bridge wave load calculation during Hurricane Ivan for the following reasons. First, both static and dynamic loads are considered in the individual forms. Second, the total force is derived from the flow field based on wave conditions, thus it can be applied to various coastal structures including bridge decks. The empirical coefficients are directly applied in this study without modification. According to Bea et al. (1999), the total force imposed on the bridge deck can be formulated as slamming force and inundation force. As waves inundate the deck, buoyancy, drag, lift, and inertial force are developed together with slamming force. The common method is to split the forces in inline (horizontal) and vertical forces then calculate them separately. Following Kerenyi (2005), the detailed formulations of wave force on bridge decks are discussed next. A diagram of wave force on bridge decks is shown in Figure 3-37."}, {"section_title": "In-line Forces", "text": "The forces in line with oscillating flow are generally derived from the Morison (1950) approach, which is the sum of inertial force, drag force and slamming force. The inertial force acts in phase with the water particle accelerations: where \u03c1 is density of water V is volume of the bridge deck. a x is horizontal particle acceleration \u03b1 = 2.23 for b h /b l <0.1 (Kerenyi, 2005) b h is depth or height of the bridge deck b w is width of the bridge deck b l is length of the bridge deck The drag force on a stationary structure acts in phase with the water particle velocity: where C D is drag coefficient C D = 2.0 (Kerenyi, 2005) and u is horizontal particle velocity. As the wave crest encounters the bridge deck, there is a transfer of momentum to the structure that is reflected as the initial slamming force: where C S is slamming coefficient 1.5\u03c0, which varies from C S = \u03c0 to 2\u03c0. When the bridge deck is tied down, a dynamic loading factor should be considered to reflect the deck response characteristics. In summary, the total in-line force can be written as:"}, {"section_title": "Vertical Forces", "text": "The vertical forces on the bridge deck include inertial force, which act in phase with the vertical water particle accelerations, drag force, buoyancy and slamming force, which act in phase with the vertical water velocity. The formulations for each force are listed next. The vertical inertial force on a stationary structure is: where a z is vertical water particle acceleration \u03b1 = 1.0 for b h /b w <0.1 (Kerenyi, 2005) The vertical drag force component on a stationary structure is: where C L is lift coefficient C L = 2.0 (Kerenyi, 2005) w is vertical water particle velocity The vertical slamming force is also a function of vertical water particle velocity: where C S is slamming coefficient C S = 1.5 \u03c0, which varies from C S = \u03c0 to 2\u03c0. The buoyancy force can be formulated as: Adding each component together leads to the total vertical force on bridge deck: The above total wave loading calculation does not include phase difference. However, as the only out of phase force, inertial force, is normally small compared to other components, the method presented here is only slightly conservative."}, {"section_title": "Wave Loading On I-10 Bridge During Hurricane Ivan", "text": "During Hurricane Ivan, the I-10 Bridge over Escambia Bay was significantly damaged. On both east and west bounds of the bridge, many bridge spans were lifted and pushed into water by big storm waves ( Figure 3-38 and Figure 3-39) (OEA, 2005). The middle bound of the bridge survived because the surge was not high enough to reach the elevated bridge deck. As for the mechanism, the storm surge raised the water level to an elevation that allowed individual waves to hit the bridge spans. The spans were progressively \"bumped\" off the pile caps by larger waves during the peak of the storm. Inspection indicates that the surge and wave forces were just barely sufficient to damage the spans (Douglass et al., 2006). The movement and damage was more severe on the southern lanes. This was likely because the high surge/wave event was relatively short and the southern lanes provided breakwater sheltering effect before the bridge decks were pushed into water. After the storm, debits were observed on some of the remaining bridge decks, indicating that the highest water reached the bridge surface about 16 feet above still water level. The I-10 Bridge deck dimensions and wave parameters during Hurricane Ivan are summarized in Table 3-7 (FDOT, 1998). The wave height H 1% is used in wave loading calculation, which approximately corresponds to the maximum wave height during the several hours high surge period. The length and width of the bridge deck is about 18 m and 10.5 m, respectively. The estimation of the deck's natural frequency is about 0.2 s (Narendra, 1998), which is far away from the peak wave period. As a result, the dynamic resonance effect is not considered in this study. The span weight is about 105 tons and a reasonable estimation of the resistance of the bolted connections is about 90 to 180 tons. Thus, a total of 195 to 285 tons force is needed to overcome the bridge weight and connection and push it into water. Based on simulated surge and waves, the wave force on the I-10 Bridge deck is calculated following previous wave force discussions . The maximum total vertical force is 334 tons, which is slightly larger than the threshold limit to break the connection force and drive the bridge deck into the water. Considering the uncertainty in surge/wave estimation and coefficients used in wave force calculation, the total force may vary around 20%. Without the dynamic slamming force, the maximum wave force in this study is about 160 tons, which is similar to the estimation of static loading of 120 tons by Douglass et al. (2006). Sensitivity tests were made by reducing simulated surge 0.3 m and 0.6 m to determine how wave forces react (Table 3- 8). It is found that slightly lower surges may significantly reduce total wave force as the mean water level is not high enough to allow wave fully attack bridge deck. A reduction of 0.6 m of the high surge would allow only limited wave force acting on the bridge and keep the bridge safe.  (Figure 3-40). As there are no detailed bridge dimensions in this study, similar bridge characteristics to I-10 Bridge are assumed for this study.

Dennis made landfall east of Pensacola as a Category three hurricane and generated surge around 5-6 feet along the Florida panhandle. However, the highest water level was observed at 8-9 feet inside Apalachee Bay, about 180 miles away from the landfall location. The time series of simulated water levels at multiple NOAA stations from fully-coupled CH3D-SSMS were shown in Figure  4-10. These representative stations cover a very large domain, from Waveland, 140 miles west of landfall, to Cedar Key, 240 miles east of land fall. Station Pensacola in Pensacola Bay is only a few thousands meters away from landfall. As Hurricane Dennis approached the Gulf Coast, the cyclonic wind induced an along shore current and produced storm surge along the coast. When Dennis made landfall, the raised water receded with weakened wind. The physical process was successfully simulated with very good comparison with observation. Apalachicola, which is located west of Apalachee Bay, has the complete time series of water levels with maximum observed surge among those NOAA stations. The rise of water at that station was accurately simulated by CH3D-SSMS, both in amplitude and phase. The model slightly overestimated highest water level but in good agreement of trend. At station Pensacola, the closeness to the hurricane center made it undergo significant wind direction change within short period of time. The water level change inside semi-closed Pensacola Bay is largely affected by local wind. When Dennis was moving from south to north in Gulf of Mexico, the generated long shore current pushed water into Pensacola Bay and caused the water level rise. When Dennis got close to shoreline and made landfall, the wind in the bay started to blow offshore and pushed water out of the bay. After the landfall, the wind direction kept changing from south to west to northwest. Again water was pushed back into the bay and then receded after Dennis weakened and moved further inland. This rise-drop-rise-drop process was simulated very well (Figure 4-10 (b)). At other stations, the comparisons are also fairly well. The simulated high surge is within 10% error compared to measurement."}, {"section_title": "Snapshot, EOHW and inundation map", "text": "In order to capture the whole picture of storm surge generated by Hurricane Dennis over the entire northeast Gulf of Mexico coast, several water level snapshots were provided before/after landfall every three hours to describe the surge evolution during the storm event (Figure 4-12). Hurricane Dennis generates a similar flow pattern to Hurricane Ivan, but with a smaller scale because of hurricane intensity and scale. Another big difference is high surge was generated inside Apalachee Bay as Dennis moves along west coast of Florida and induced shelf wave transported along the hurricane (Morey et al., 2005). The high surge is further displayed in the plot of Envelope Of High Water (EOHW) for Hurricane Dennis in Figure 4-13. Due to a relatively weak storm, the inundation caused by Hurricane Dennis is not as significant as Ivan at point of landfall (Figure 4-14). However, large domain of Northwest Florida is flooded because of the big shelf wave (Figure 4-15). For a complete storm surge simulation, coupling with wave model SWAN is the most time-consuming process to include wave effect. The total simulation time is totally determined by SWAN simulation time. Theoretically, SWAN should have the same time step as surge model. However, it is not practical to do so. First, the significantly long simulation time makes it unrealistic to simulate waves at every surge model time step, which is about 1 minute. Secondly, the wave boundary conditions for SWAN are obtained from the WW3 model with three hour frequency. The wave conditions interpolated from WW3 may not be very accurate if a small time step used. Therefore, longer time step has to be considered for SWAN during storm surge simulation. In order to evaluate how often it is necessary to run SWAN to get the correct surgewave interaction and how sensitive the surge result is to frequency of running SWAN relative to CH3D, multiple runs were made on Hurricane Dennis. As the development of wave is relatively a slow process, the change of wave parameters is normally not big within one hour. The sensitivity tests imply that storm surge are very close for SWAN simulations every 30 min and 1 hour. In the mean time, the total simulation time is approximately 10 times more if a one hour time step is used for SWAN and 20 times more if a 30 time step used. Considering both accuracy and efficiency, it is reasonable to use big time step for SWAN simulation, which is 1 hour as used for the Hurricane Ivan and Dennis simulations. At the open boundary, clamped condition is used in the model using water level from tidal constituents and simulated surge from ADCIRC. In order to check the open boundary effect on simulated surge along coast, a Flather radiation boundary condition is introduced in CH3D-SSMS (Flather, 1976(Flather, , 1993. The simulated water levels at NOAA stations during Hurricane Hurricane Dennis is further investigated by two more sensitivity tests by removing wave effect (case 1) and removing large scale wind field (WNA) during landfall (case 2). Because the weakness of the hurricane and its compact size, the waves are overall not strong and only cause moderate wave setup on top of wind stress generated surge. The averaged simulated surge reduced by up to 20 cm at NOAA stations (Figure 4-16). If large scale wind of WNA is removed at the west coast of Florida, the simulated surges there are obviously reduced at stations Apalachicola and Cedar Key (Figure 4-16). But its effect on other stations, where HRD wind in control, is very limited. The inundation at the Pensacola area from simulation without wave effect (case 1) is shown in Figure 4-17. Due to slightly smaller surge, the flooded area is reduced accordingly. However the total extension of the flooding zone is kept almost the same."}, {"section_title": "High surge in Apalachee Bay", "text": "The damage by Hurricane Dennis is not limited to the Pensacola region where it made landfall. At about 275 km east of the landfall location, Shell Point and other coastal communities of Apalachee Bay experienced a devastating storm surge locally to 2 to 3 m above normal tide levels. The high surge caused extensive local property damage and isolated several communities. However, only 4 to 6 feet surge was predicted from the last Public Advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center before Dennis made landfall. The approximately 1 m surge difference cannot be explained by the weak hurricane wind far east from hurricane center. The additional sea level rise of approximately one meter is explained by a remotely forced shelf wave, according to Morey et al. (2006). Hurricane Dennis traveled from Cuba to the western Florida Panhandle over the course of 34 hours, during which along-shore winds forced Ekman transport towards the Florida Peninsula coast building a high sea level anomaly that propagated northward as a topographic Rossby wave. The storm traveled nearly parallel to the shelf in the same direction of the waves, resulting in amplification of the sea level signal along the coast. This high sea level anomaly reached its maximum amplitude at the northernmost bounds within Apalachee Bay and combined with the surge to form the high water rise during the storm. In this study, a numerical experiment is set up to further discuss Morey's theory.  Figure 4-19, the water level generated solely by surge signal from shelf wave is about 1 m at these stations as Hurricane Dennis moves closer to the Gulf coast. The other driving components produce another 1.2 to 1.3 m water level rise at station Apalachicola and Shell Point and 0.6 m at Cedar Key. The linearly combined water level at Apalachicola is about 2.1 m, which is very close to previous modeled highest surge from large-domain model result. This implies that simplifying the storm surge model using separate forcing has small effect on the final total surge in this case. Similar analysis is made by Morey et al. (2006) using the Naval Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) (Martin, 2000). The maximum surge in Apalachee Bay is about 1.4 m from both local wind forcing and remote forcing. The above analysis further demonstrates Morey' s theory (2006) that when storm traveled nearly parallel to the shelf, it could generate surge signal from shelf wave which could significantly add additional water level rise on top of surge from local wind and deficit atmospheric pressure. The current domain for storm surge prediction by NOAA using SLOSH on the northwest coast of Florida is not enough to consider this shelf wave effect which may result in serous underestimation of storm surge and property loss. To fully incorporate this component, either the local storm surge model has to be coupled with a larger regional storm model, as was done in this study, or a larger domain has be to used directly to include enough computational area by single model simulation.                 CHAPTER 5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "In this dissertation, two major hurricanes, Ivan and Dennis, were simulated using CH3D Storm Surge Modeling System -CH3D-SSMS. The simulated wind, wave, water level and High Water Marks were validated against observed data. The wave forces on the I-10 Bridge over Escambia Bay were calculated to analyze the mechanism that caused the collapse of the bridge. The inundation maps for both hurricanes were presented to assess the extent of flooding in the coastal zone. A set of sensitivity tests were made on a few major parameters for the Hurricane Ivan simulation to determine the relative importance in storm surge simulation. Risk analysis simulations were conducted by varying hurricane intensity, size, speed, and direction of approach and landfall locations to study the various surge responses in strong storm events like Hurricane Ivan. A ranking system was then developed for assessing the vulnerability of coastal highways and bridges to storm surge and wave damages in extreme hurricanes like Ivan. The first chapter gave a brief review of current development in storm surge modeling. Various wind, wave, and surge models were discussed with their merits and disadvantages. With recent increases in the loss of money and lives, more effort has been made to develop robust storm surge forecasting and hind-casting systems to accurately predict and assess hurricanecaused surges and provide useful information to reduce coastal flooding and human loss. CH3D-SSMS is one of these models that have been validated for several hurricanes and is under further development. Chapter Two provides the detailed description of physical processes in CH3D-SSMS for storm surge simulation. The main mechanisms in the model include astronomical tide, wind stress, barometric pressure, and wave setup. The interactive coupling system dynamically couples regional surge model -ADCIRC, local wave model SWAN, and local surge model CH3D to simulate coastal surge using high resolution bathymetry and topography data. CH3D-SSMS was validated by analytical solutions and has been successfully used to simulate Hurricanes Isabel 2003, Charley (2004), Francis (2004) and Wilma (2005) (Alymov, 2005;Sheng et al., 2005) and Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005) in this study. The CH3D-SSMS integrated modeling system is applied to simulate storm surge and waves during Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis to study hurricane storm surge reaction and potential for the Northeast Gulf coasts, including the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, and Mississippi. A detailed curvilinear, boundary-fitted grid system focusing on the Escambia Bay, FL, was developed using high resolution bathymetry and topography data from GEODAS and SEAMLESS, USGS. The CH3D-SSMS, with the capability of flooding and drying, is able to simulate both surges and waves by dynamically coupling with a local wave model SWAN (Holthuijsen et al., 2000). The coupled modeling system receives water level information along open boundaries of the model domain from a basin-scale storm surge model ADCIRC (Luettich et al., 1992) and a basin scale wave model WAVEWATCH-III (Tolman, 1999). The HRD wind of NOAA and the WNA wind from NCEP/NOAA are applied in the model with consideration of land reduction effect. The Lagrangian interpolation technique is used to improve interpolation accuracy between wind snapshots, especially around hurricane centers. The analytical Holland model is used to generate atmospheric pressure field for the model based on NHC best hurricane track. In chapter three, the CH3D-SSMS is successfully calibrated and validated for Hurricane Ivan (2004) by comparing the results of the simulation to observed data. Ivan is a large scale, high intensity hurricane that caused significant flooding and damage at the coastal region. The highest surge of over 4 m was observed at the north end of Escambia Bay and is captured by CH3D-SSMS. The time series of wind, atmospheric pressure, and storm surge at multiple NOAA stations were successfully compared with simulated water level, both in magnitude and trend of surge development. The maximum surge errors are around 10% at most stations. In addition, the simulated highest surges also agree well with several measured HWMs from USGS near the Pensacola Bay area. The simulated time series of significant wave height, peak wave period, and mean wave direction by SWAN agreed well with available observed data at the offshore station Mobile South. The extent of flooding during Hurricane Ivan was described in an inundation map. The most flooded domains were found to the east of Pensacola Bay and to the east of Blackwater Bay. The comparisons of simulated storm surge are similar between 3D model and 2D model. However, the 3D model produces much more accurate flow field, especially when pressure gradient is in the opposite direction with wind stress which causes stratified flow in the vertical direction. The surges of the Hurricane Ivan simulation illustrate that CH3D-SSMS is able to accurately simulate storm surge with a good set of bathymetry/topography, accurate wind data, and water level at open boundary with minimal calibration. With validated surge and wave in Escambia Bay, the wave loads were calculated on the I-10 Bridge deck in both horizontal and vertical direction during Hurricane Ivan. The component of wave force includes buoyancy, drag force, inertial force, and slamming force. The analysis revealed that, on top of high surge, the wave crest is able to attack the bridge with enough strength to break the connection force and deck weight and push bridge deck into water. The slamming force is the major component of the total vertical force. The sensitivity test implied that the wave force on bridge deck is very sensitive to surge height. With slightly decreased surge levels, the wave force could be significantly reduced to keep the bridge undamaged. Over ten sensitivity tests were made for Hurricane Ivan to determine the roles various important parameters play in storm surge simulation. These parameters include wind, land reduction effect on wind, deficit atmospheric pressure, tidal open boundary conditions, bottom friction, and wave setup effect. Four kinds of wind were considered including HRD wind, WNA wind, WINDGEN wind, and analytical Holland wind. The results showed that simulated storm surge is very sensitive to wind field used in the model. Different simulated water levels were obtained from each of the four wind fields. At some individual stations the difference is even bigger than 50% of total surge. Land reduction effect on wind is important for domains where wind blow from inland. The selection of tide level at open boundary has small effect on simulated surge as tidal amplitude is relatively small during Hurricane Ivan. Predicted tide produced slightly better surge than that from using ADCIRC tidal constituents. However, tidal boundary could be an important factor when hurricanes arrive together with high tide. The consideration of deficit atmospheric pressure added about additional seventy centimeters along the hurricane track and reduced exponentially to a few centimeters at remote domain away from the track. The wave effect on surge is also important. The wave setup contributed up to seventy centimeters inside Escambia Bay where the highest surge was observed. Risk analysis tests were made for Hurricane Ivan by varying hurricane landfall location, intensity, size, speed, and direction of approach. The analytical Holland wind model is used as the driving force. It was found that all factors are able to cause very significant local surge changes within Pensacola Bay, Escambia Bay, and Mobile Bay. In chapter four, CH3D-SSMS was applied to simulate storm surges and waves during Hurricane Dennis (2005). Compared to Hurricane Ivan, Dennis had similar track and landfall location but with weaker intensity slightly to the east, faster moving speed, and a more compact size. As a result the storm surged generated is lower and the damage caused by Dennis is not as severe as Ivan, the maximum observed surge is about 2-3 m. In order to simulate Hurricane Dennis, the grid system for Hurricane Ivan was extended extensively to the northwest Florida coast to include more storm-effected domain. Extra bathymetry, topography, and land use data were downloaded and incorporated into the grid. Similar procedures for the preparation of wind, deficit atmosphere atmospheric pressure, water level, and wave at open boundaries described in Hurricane Ivan were repeated for Dennis. The simulation of the storm surge was quite successful for Hurricane Dennis. The simulated water level at multiple NOAA stations over 300 miles of northeast Gulf coast, from Cedar Key, FL to Waveland, MS, agreed well with observations. The difference of highest surge between simulation and observation is around 10%. In addition, both simulated wind and atmospheric pressure at most stations compared reasonably well with measurement. The waves simulated by SWAN were successfully validated at a couple of offshore stations during Hurricane Dennis. The inundation maps showed that serious flooding occurred at northwest Florida Apalachicola Bay and inside Pensacola Bay. The high storm surge in Apalachee Bay is caused by both the shelf waves and local wind setup during Hurricane Dennis, each of them contributes about 50% of the total surge. The current grid used in CH3D-SSMS is a structured curvilinear grid system. It could resolve reasonably well of interested inlets, shoreline, and other detailed morphological features for particular interested area. However, the nature of structured grid requires similar resolution along both the X and Y coordinate directions, which leads to quick increase of the total number to represent the irregular shoreline. However, its computation speed is limited by a stringent stability condition associated with the \"explicit\" numerical scheme for wave propagation and nonlinear advection. Very small time steps have to be used for very fine grid, resulting in significantly increased simulation time. The UnTRIM model uses semi-implicit time integration and an Eulerian-Lagrangian method for to allow larger time step to be used without badly reducing accuracy. Compared to structured models, the unstructured model requires much more effort to generate orthogonal unstructured grids. For storm surge simulation in this study (Ivan and Dennis), the most sensitive factor is the wind field used in the model as wind shear stress is proportional to square of wind speed. Various winds could produce quite different surges. Wind drag coefficients have a similar effect on wind stress but with a linear relationship. The bottom friction coefficient (Manning's n for 2D and bottom roughness for 3D) is also an important factor. This is especially true for shallow water. For the Hurricane Ivan simulation, both spatially-vary Manning's coefficients between 0.015-0.025 based on bottom sand characteristics and a constant Manning's coefficient of 0.02 were used. The simulated storm surge used was improved for spatial-varying case but the improvement is not very big. The effect of using a different method of wind field interpolation is limited to domains close to the hurricane center. Therefore, if the study location is close to a hurricane track, it is important to use Lagrangian interpolation to obtain more accurate wind fields. The storm surge is directly related to the accuracy of tide simulation. The same error from tide simulation would be transferred to total surge simulation. For Hurricane Ivan, the amount of error is about 10 cm. Storm surge simulation is also sensitive to grid resolution, especially in a shallow bay or lagoon. When an important shoreline feature, such as an inlet, can not be represented well, large error can be found in storm surge simulation. The water level is not sensitive to river flow. For the Ivan simulation, the surge barely changed if the Mississippi River discharge is included in the simulation. The model time step is mainly determined by advection stability criteria. The simulated surge varied slightly for different time steps used. For Hurricane Ivan/Dennis simulation, 60 second time step and 10 second time step were used for CH3D-SSMS 2D and 3D simulation, respectively. CH3D treats the propagation of surface gravity wave with a \"semi-implicit\" scheme as opposed to the \"explicit\" scheme of ADCIRC, hence a much less stringent time step limit is required compared to ADCIRC. To accurately simulate storm surge, three major things have to be prepared well: a large scale high resolution grid with a good set of bathymetry/topography data, a robust storm surge Consequently, these two factors are compromised to consider the grid system with large domain but acceptable computing efficiency. From the Hurricane Ivan simulation, it is found that estuaries play an important role in affecting the storm surge and inundation in coastal bays or lagoons. The shallow water induced larger surge and delayed the peak of the surge. The maximum simulated storm surge at the north rim of Pensacola Bay is about 1.7 m higher than the simulated surge at mouth of Pensacola Bay with 1.5 hour delay. As the storm surge advanced within the bay, water levels gradually increased and were maximized at the north end. The abnormally elevated water caused extensive flooding at the low-land areas along the bay coast zone. The effect on the storm surge and inundation from estuaries is normally small for open water, coastal shores, and barriers islands. The affected zone is limited to locations around the inlet between the bay and open water. As for model efficiency, the computational time step for 2D simulation is around 1-2s/time step without coupling with the SWAN wave model for the Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis simulation. As a result, a 6-day storm surge simulation takes about 3-6 hours to finish. This is fast enough for both forecasting and hind casting simulations. However, much longer time is needed if the SWAN wave model is added. If the SWAN simulation is made every one hour, which is sufficient to keep accuracy and efficiency, then the total simulation time is at least a few times more. For other grid systems with different grid resolution and total number of grid cells, this time would change accordingly. tide is better. ADCIRC tidal base may perform well for one particular period but may also behave badly at some other time. For one particular time, preliminary simulation is necessary to select from interpolated measured water levels and ADCIRC tidal constituents based on performance. For the same reason, wind is selected from different models by comparing measured data at stations. For storm surge simulation, the advantages of 3D mode over 2D mode include resolved current structure in the vertical direction, more correct bottom friction and more accurate nonlinear, diffusion and Coriolis terms. The 3D model results have shown improved simulated storm surge for the Hurricane Ivan using CH3D-SSMS. However, because of the mode splitting technique used in 3D mode, the bottom friction has to be calculated in explicit mode, which requires reduced time step to keep numerical stability. For Hurricane Ivan simulation, as small as 10 second is used in 3D model compared to 60 second in 2D model. In addition, solving for velocities in each vertical layers also require addition computing time. Therefore, implementation of 3D mode in storm surge simulation is somehow traded off by the significantly increased simulation time. Under some circumstances, the 2D model might be a better choice because of its reasonably good water level simulation and efficiency, such as storm surge forecast simulation. There are two methodologies implemented in CH3D-SSMS to calculate wave enhanced bottom stress. The first one is the Grant and Madsen (1979) theory described in a simplified form by Signell et al. (1990) and second one is the lookup table produced from a one-dimensional wave-current bottom boundary layer model (Sheng and Villaret, 1989). When applied to the Hurricane Ivan, both methods showed similar but very limited effects on simulated storm surge. Inclusion of wave enhanced bottom stress normally reduced the simulated water level by a few centimeters."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The main conclusions drawn from this study are summarized as followings: 1. CH3D-SSMS was successfully calibrated and validated for Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis. The simulated highest surge is around 10% error at most stations. 2. The consideration of land reduction on hurricane wind could significantly improve surge simulation at local stations with wind coming from inland. 3. Wind forcing is the primary factor in storm surge modeling. Wind is a key factor in storm surge simulation. Ideally, the wind should be a continuous set of accurate, high resolution, large scale wind that covers both over water and land. However, this is very difficult to achieve in reality. The best hind cast wind so far is the HRD wind by NOAA, which are normally 3-hour snapshots with coverage of 4 degrees from hurricane center. The bottom friction is also an important term in storm surge simulation. However, there is little knowledge about the drag coefficients over land and vegetated shallow water area. In this study, those areas are treated the same as other domains. This may lead to locally overestimated storm surge. Incorporation of scientific advancement of the friction calculation over land and vegetated area will improve the accuracy of storm surge modeling at those domains. cyclone's latitude, longitude, maximum sustained surface winds, and minimum sea-level pressure at 6-hourly intervals. Best track positions and intensities, which are based on a post-storm assessment of all available data, may differ from values contained in storm advisories. They also generally will not reflect the erratic motion implied by connecting individual center fix positions (NOAA, 2004e). The detailed best track for Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis are listed in Table A-3 and Table A-4, respectively. In order to quantify a model's performance on tidal simulation, several statistics on tidal time series and extrema analysis are used by comparison with observed data (Hess, et al., 1993). Given time series of observed and simulated tidal elevation, the root mean square (rms) difference can be calculated as: Where y i and are observed and simulated tidal elevation at the same time, n is the number of available data. Since observed tidal ranges can vary widely from station to station, a more meaningful statistics is the ratio of the rms difference to the mean observed range, or relative difference: where R is observed range which can be calculated as: Where Y j is either maximum water level at high tides or minimum water level at low tides with total of number of N occurrence. A weighted gain (G w ) characterized the modeled range relative to the observed range: with j representing simulated high tide and low tide."}, {"section_title": "$ Y", "text": "Following above all time rms difference calculation, similar analysis procedures can be applied to determine times and amplitudes rms error for tidal extrema.

As for bottom friction coefficient, three constant Manning's coefficients were tested. In open channel hydraulics study, Chow (1959) suggested Manning's coefficient range from 0.016 for clean channel and 0.033 for channels with short grass. An recent summary by Hess and Bosley (1993) from USGS also gave similar range of Manning's for stable channels and flood plain. The minimum Manning's n is 0.012 for concrete channel, 0.017-0.020 for medium sand and 0.025-0.035 for firm soil and coarse sand. A sedimentary study of the Mississippi Sound and adjacent coastal waters (Upshow, et al, 1966;Sheng, 1983) has shown that southwest of Mobile Bay the open water bottom is covered by sand, while to east sediment size gradually reduces from sand to sandy silt to silt.

The Flather boundary condition is further applied for the Hurricane Dennis simulation in this study. The prescribed velocity and water level come from the combination of tide and surge.
