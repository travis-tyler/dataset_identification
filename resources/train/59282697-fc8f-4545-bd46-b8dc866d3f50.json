Random effects regressions were used to examine the relationship among CSF abnormalities, cognitive impairment (assessed with the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale [ADAS-Cog]), and functional decline (assessed with the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire) and to determine whether the impact of CSF abnormalities on functional decline is mediated by cognitive impairment.\nSetting: Fifty-eight sites in the United States and Canada. Participants: One hundred fourteen cognitively intact adults, 195 patients with MCI, and 100 patients with mild AD.\nMain Outcome Measure: Decline in the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire score.\nResults: Abnormalities in all CSF analytes were associated with functional decline in MCI, and all but the t-tau: A\u2424 42 ratio were associated with functional decline in controls. No abnormal CSF analyte was associated with functional decline in AD. Among controls, p-tau 181 concentration was the most sensitive to functional decline, whereas in MCI it was A\u2424 42 concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were uniformly more sensitive to functional decline than the ADAS-Cog score among controls and variably so in MCI, whereas the ADAS-Cog score was unequivocally more sensitive than CSF biomarkers in AD. The impact of CSF abnormalities on functional decline in MCI was partially mediated by their effect on cognitive status. Across all diagnostic groups, persons with both tau and A\u2424 42 abnormalities exhibited the steepest rate of functional decline.\nAbnormalities in CSF are associated with functional decline and thus with future development of AD in controls and patients with MCI.

[1] [2] [3] [4] In contrast with the demonstrations of associations between CSF abnormalities and some indices of disease severity and progression such as cognitive decline, 5 plaque density, 6 and cerebral alterations, 7, 8 the relationship between CSF abnormalities and decline in everyday function has received limited attention. 5, 9, 10 This constitutes a significant knowledge gap for several reasons.\nFirst, functional restriction is a hallmark of AD and other dementias. 11, 12 Indeed, widely used dementia staging instruments (eg, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) lean heavily on reports of an individual's daily functioning in ascertaining dementia severity. Thus, decline in everyday function likely signals disease onset or progression among cognitively normal older adults and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. Second, everyday function is an important outcome in AD clinical trials. 13 Therefore, it is useful to understand how it is related to biomarkers of AD. Third, unraveling associations between CSF abnormalities and functional decline, especially in preclinical AD, might be valuable information for patients and their care providers because they often wish to know what the future holds.\nIn this article, we investigate (1) whether CSF abnormalities are associated with decline in everyday function; (2) whether such associations, if existent, are comparable or differential across CSF analytes; (3) whether CSF analytes are more sensitive to functional decline than cognitive measures; (4) whether the impact of CSF abnormalities on functional decline is mediated by their effect on cognition; (5) whether the combination of abnormally high t-tau or p-tau 181 and abnormally low A\u2424 42 concentrations confers increased risk of functional decline; and (6) whether these effects are similarly present throughout the continuum from healthy cognitive aging to AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PARTICIPANTS", "text": "The analyses presented herein were based on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://www .loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/).

"}, {"section_title": "DATA ANALYSES", "text": "Group differences on the CSF measures were tested using single degrees of freedom contrast tests, corrected for inequality of variance. To examine the association among CSF abnormalities, cognitive impairment, and functional decline within each diagnostic group, we fitted a series of random coefficient regressions 19, 20 that modeled change in FAQ scores as a function of baseline values on CSF biomarkers and the ADAS-Cog score. Abnormality on CSF biomarkers was defined using previously established ADNI thresholds (t-tau, 93 pg/mL; A\u2424 42 , 192 pg/mL; p-tau 181 , 23 pg/mL; t-tau:A\u2424 42 ratio, 0.39; and p-tau 181 :A\u2424 42 ratio, 0.10). 1 For the ADAS-Cog, we modeled the effect of performance that is 1 SD above (ie, worse than) group-specific means. 21 The biomarker\u03ebtime terms were the primary effects of interest because they would reveal the impact of CSF abnormality or cognitive impairment on the rate of change in FAQ.\nTo quantify and compare the variation in functional decline accounted for by each CSF biomarker or the ADAS-Cog score, we calculated the proportional reduction-a pseudo-R 2 statistic-in the FAQ score's rate of change residual variation that was attained when each biomarker and its interaction with time was introduced into a model that only contained age, baseline FAQ score, and their interactions with time. 20 Higher R 2 values indicated that the variable being modeled accounted for a larger proportion of the unexplained variation in-and, thus, is more sensitive to-rate of change in FAQ.\nTo examine whether the effect of CSF biomarkers on functional decline is mediated by their effect on cognition, we tested a series of random coefficient regressions that added terms for ADAS-Cog and ADAS-Cog\u03ebtime to each CSF biomarker model. Full mediation was assumed when a previously significant biomarker\u03ebtime interaction became nonsignificant. Partial mediation was indicated when the biomarker\u03ebtime effect was at-tenuated but remained significant. The percentage of the relationship between the CSF biomarker and functional decline that was mediated by cognition was computed as (original estimate \u2212 ADAS-Cog-adjusted estimate)/original estimate. Because mediation requires that the substantive and mediator variables be associated with the outcome, these analyses were performed only within diagnostic groups in which CSF biomarkers and ADAS-Cog were both significantly related to functional decline.\nFinally, we examined whether individuals with a combination of abnormal tau and A\u2424 42 findings experience a faster rate of functional decline relative to those with no or 1 CSF abnormality by fitting a series of random coefficient regressions in which the rate of functional decline among persons in the normal tau/normal A\u2424 42 group was contrasted with the rate of decline in the abnormal tau/normal A\u2424 42 , normal tau/abnormal A\u2424 42 , and abnormal tau/abnormal A\u2424 42 groups.\nAs a precondition for examining the effects of CSF abnormalities and ADAS-Cog scores on functional decline, we first examined the temporal course and rate of functional decline within each group by fitting group-specific random effects regressions that modeled change in FAQ scores as a function of time. 20 To determine the temporal course of functional decline, we compared the relative fit of linear (time) and curvilinear (time\u03ebtime) polynomials for time using the Bayesian information criterion. 22 On the Bayesian information criterion, lower values indicate better fit. The polynomial specification for time (ie, linear or quadratic) that emerged as optimal was used in all subsequent analyses.\nAll random coefficient regressions outlined included random intercept and random slope terms to account or test for potential interindividual variability in baseline scores and rate of change, respectively. 20 In addition, they all included age, baseline FAQ scores, and their interactions with time as covariates; to further adjust for variations in baseline FAQ scores, analyses were begun at the 6-month assessment.

Abbreviations: FAQ, Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. For other abbreviations, see Table 2 .\na Models adjusted for age, baseline FAQ, and their interactions with time. In addition, analyses were begun at month 6 to further correct for potential group differences in FAQ at baseline. Time indicates the estimated semiannual rate of change in FAQ for those who have normal tau (t-tau or p-tau, depending on the model being tested) and normal A\u2424 42 concentrations. The other terms indicate the estimated difference in semiannual rate of change in FAQ between the normal tau/normal A\u2424 42 Progressive diminution in, and eventual loss of, the ability to perform daily activities is a hallmark feature of AD. 11 Consequently, decline in everyday function is a veritable measure of disease progression in AD. 13 The findings from this study therefore suggest that p-tau 181 level is the strongest predictor of possible disease progression among controls, whereas A\u2424 42 level is most potent in MCI. This conclusion is consistent with histopathological studies that suggest a temporal sequence in the manifestation of AD-related brain lesions wherein intraneuronal alterations precede the deposition of amyloid plaques. [23] [24] [25] Even so, we acknowledge that the temporal ordering of AD lesions and their presumed downstream effects on CSF analytes remain controversial issues deserving continued investigation. 6, 7, 26, 27 For instance, it may be that t-tau and p-tau 181 levels were stronger correlates of FAQ score decline (compared with A\u2424 42 concentration) among controls because A\u2424 42 levels were already reduced in the earliest phase of AD. 7, 28, 29 Nonetheless, because levels of p-tau 181 reflect hyperphosphorylation of tau (a putatively AD-specific process), 3, 30, 31 our control findings suggest that, among cognitively intact elderly individuals, functional decline and eventual progression to AD may be most probable for individuals who already demonstrate pathognomonic features of AD.\nWithin the MCI and control groups, we found that ratio of tau protein to A\u2424 42 was strongly correlated with functional decline. Previous reports have suggested that biomarker ratios may be more promising AD biomarkers compared with absolute biomarker levels. 5, [32] [33] [34] [35] However, a potential drawback to their application is that, by virtue of being ratios, they mask a likely nontrivial distinction between individuals who have normal tau/ abnormal A\u2424 42 findings and those who have abnormal tau/normal A\u2424 42 findings. For instance, in the present study we found that patients with MCI who had normal tau/abnormal A\u2424 42 findings experienced a more rapid functional decline compared with those with normal tau/ normal A\u2424 42 findings, whereas those with abnormal tau/ normal A\u2424 42 findings did not. This observation buttresses the earlier-noted finding that, among patients with MCI, abnormal A\u2424 42 levels were a better prognostic indicator of functional degradation and disease progression than tau alterations. [36] [37] [38] We were surprised to find that no CSF biomarker was predictive of functional decline among patients with AD. The reason for this is not immediately clear, although it might be due to reduced variability in the CSF biomarkers. This would be consistent with previous studies that have shown that, on becoming abnormal, CSF biomarkers subsequently tend to remain stable for several years even as dementia progresses. 7, 9, [39] [40] [41] In addition, other studies have also failed to find associations between CSF biomarkers and indices of disease risk and burden in AD. 42 Cerebrospinal fluid analytes hold great promise as biomarkers of AD 30 and, therefore, have potentially pivotal clinical utility. [43] [44] [45] However, their routine implementation in clinical practice is hampered by several factors, including lumbar puncture's relative invasiveness and potential for iatrogenesis, although the latter may not be as inexorable as originally believed. [45] [46] [47] Thus, clinical measures and peripheral fluid biomarkers are increasingly explored as viable alternatives. 31, 32, 48 In this study, we examined the comparative sensitivity of CSF biomarkers and scores on the ADAS-Cog, a brief measure of global cognition, to the rate of functional decline within each diagnostic group. Overall, our findings suggest that a cognitive screen that is brief, noninvasive, and easy to administer competes favorably with CSF biomarkers with regard to sensitivity to functional decline and hence disease progression, especially among patients with AD. 49 Our mediation analyses showed that the greatest reduction in the variance accounted for by CSF biomarkers occurred for p-tau 181 . There is evidence that p-tau 181 levels reflect neurofibrillary tangle formation 3, 31 and that the density of tangles correlates better with cognitive decline and dementia than plaque load. 50, 51 Therefore, it stands to reason that adjusting for cognition most attenuated the original relationship between p-tau 181 level and rate of functional decline. Finally, consistent with reports from previous investigations, 5, 33, 35 we found that, within each diagnostic group, individuals who had pathological concentrations of tau and A\u2424 42 experienced the steepest functional decline. This was most pronounced in the MCI group, in which those with abnormal tau/ abnormal A\u2424 42 levels declined at about 2.5 times the rate of those with normal tau/normal A\u2424 42 levels (eg, abnormal t-tau/abnormal A\u2424 42 vs normal t-tau/normal A\u2424 42 = [0.90 \u03e9 1.40]/0.90). Because concurrent disturbances in tau and A\u2424 42 concentrations are considered diagnostic for AD, the accelerated decline in everyday function manifested by controls and patients with MCI who have these defining CSF alterations might represent a harbinger of their eventual progression to AD. 52 Potential limitations of this study include the use of relatively gross measures of everyday function (FAQ) and cognition (ADAS-Cog) and the low ethnic diversity of the sample. In addition, the participants studied were enrolled in a clinical study, not an epidemiological study. It is unclear how these factors may have influenced our findings. Despite these limitations, this study is unique in being the first, to our knowledge, to examine several interrelated questions concerning the relationship between CSF biomarkers and rate of functional decline across the AD spectrum."}]
