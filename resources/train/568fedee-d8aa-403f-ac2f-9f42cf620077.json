As new interventions become available, it will become important to identify the disease as early as possible. A piecewise regression analysis of a measure of episodic memory identified an inflection point 5 years before diagnosis in the Bronx Aging Study. 1 A flat trajectory followed by decline beginning 7 years before diagnosis of dementia was reported for the same measure in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 2 which also found decline in executive function that increased in rate 2 to 3 years before diagnosis. Episodic memory is not the only aspect of cognition that can be affected in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). 3 Indeed, mild cognitive impairment, often thought to represent a transitional state between healthy cognitive aging and AD, is defined on the basis of deficits in cognitive domains in addition to memory. 4 In this article we examine cognitive domains beyond episodic memory and executive function to test hypotheses about the existence of inflection points before clinical diagnosis of dementia. Based on the identification of common factor structures in cognitively healthy individuals and those with AD, 5 we examined global mental ability and 3 specific cognitive domains (verbal memory, working memory, and visuospatial ability) through a long preclinical period as people developed dementia and compared them with those who remained cognitively healthy. Results from longitudinal studies [6] [7] [8] [9] support an early observation 10 that the overall course of healthy aging is relatively stable compared with the cognitive decline, often precipitous, experienced by those who develop dementia. We sought to model that change to determine when the inflection occurs before dementia detection and the rate of change afterward for different cognitive domains and to validate these clinical observations in an autopsy-confirmed sample."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PARTICIPANTS", "text": "Longitudinal archival data were examined from 444 volunteers initially aged 60 to 101 years enrolled in the Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, between October 1, 1979, and December 31, 2006 ( Table 1 ). All the participants were clinically evaluated to be cognitively healthy (Clinical Dementia Rating 11 [CDR]=0) at the time of their first psychometric assessment and had at least 1 additional annual clinical evaluation through November 29, 2007.

The diagnosis of dementia was based on a history of gradual onset and progressive cognitive decline that interfered with the person's ability to perform accustomed activities. The CDR has high interrater reliability, 12 is sensitive to clinical progression, and is highly predictive (93%) of autopsyconfirmed AD. 13 Participants were seen by different physicians from year to year, and physicians did not have access to previous clinical evaluations or to previous or current psychometric test results."}, {"section_title": "PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENT", "text": "The psychometric battery was administered to all the participants by trained psychometricians usually 1 to 2 weeks after the annual clinical assessment.

Initial values for the group that progressed are included solely for descriptive purposes; recall that they were initially older, on average, than the stable group.\nBased on confirmatory factor analyses of these measures cross-validated across demented and nondemented samples, 5 we formed 4 factor scores for each person at each assessment. The Global factor included all 12 measures; it was uncorrelated with 3 specific factors, which each included 4 measures. The measures on the Verbal Memory factor were Logical Memory, Associate Learning, Information, and Boston Naming. The 4 measures on the Working Memory and Executive Function factor were Mental Control, Digit Span Forward and Backward, and Letter Fluency. The Visuospatial factor included Block Design, Digit Symbol, Trailmaking A, and Benton (copy). A prorated factor score was computed if 1 or 2 values were missing for the Global factor and if 1 value was missing for the specific factors; otherwise, the factor value for that assessment for that person was excluded from the analyses."}, {"section_title": "NEUROPATHOLOGIC ASSESSMENT", "text": "All the brains were examined according to a standard protocol. 20 After fixation in neutral-buffered 10% formalin, tissue blocks were obtained from 30 brain regions.

A multistep longitudinal modeling procedure was used for each of the 4 factors. All longitudinal analyses were conducted using random coefficient models (SAS v9.1.3, PROC MIXED; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and included the covariates of age and education.\nTo determine the best form of a factor score's trajectory through time for each group (stable and progressed), we used 2 tests for \u22122 log likelihood ratios (\u22122LLs) for nested models of increasing complexity of the slope across time (linear, quadratic, linear piecewise, linear piecewise optimized, and quadratic piecewise); simpler models are nested in more complex models. Model comparisons used 2 tests of deviance scores beginning with the simple linear model. Deviance scores equal the difference between the \u22122LL of a simpler model and a more complex one (\u232c 2 ).\nThe linear piecewise change model specified a point of inflection and tested whether rates of cognitive decline differed before and after that point. 22 To determine the optimum placement of the change point in the piecewise model, we tested inflection points from 1 to 6 years before the last assessment for the stable group. For those who progressed, we tested for an inflection point at the time of diagnosis of dementia and from 4 years before diagnosis to 2 years after diagnosis (\u03fe50 observations at each selected time point). The quadratic piecewise model added a quadratic term for the postinflection time variable using the optimal inflection point.\nWe conducted additional analyses to determine whether instead of a quadratic function after inflection there was acceleration in the rate of progression (ie, a change in the slope of the slopes across time). Technically, this was not a test of a nested model. First, we used the optimal piecewise model to predict the factor scores at each time of assessment for each person (best linear unbiased predictor). Using these latent values from each time of assessment rather than observed values, we calculated latent difference scores (LDSs) for each person. The LDS equals the difference between the predicted values at 2 adjacent times of assessment (\u0176 T1 \u2212\u0176 T2 , \u0176 T2 \u2212\u0176 T3 , \u0176 T3 \u2212\u0176 T4 , and so forth) beginning with the difference of the predicted value at the optimized inflection point (\u0176 T1 ) and the next assessment thereafter (\u0176 T2 ).\nThen we tested a linear mixed model using the LDS as the dependent variable to determine whether the slope of the LDS values (ie, the slope of the slopes) changed across time. The acceleration coefficient tested herein is a 2-stage regression analogue to other acceleration models derived from structural equation modeling 23 and the functional equivalent of acceleration in kinematics (ie, the second derivative of position/intercept). Although this method of measurement may slightly attenuate true acceleration values because of the tendency for latent values to \"shrink\" in the presence of missing data, 24 its computation is robust, is straightforward, and can be estimated without multiple imputation of missing data. It yields results consistent with simultaneous models. 25 A simultaneous model that approximates slopes and acceleration was not attempted because we did not know the functional form of the data (the primary aim of this investigation).\nAfter determining the optimal models within each group, slope estimates were based on a mixed model for each factor that included covariates, effects for group (stable vs progressed), time (before and after inflection), and group\u03ebtime interactions. Acceleration coefficients for the group that progressed were estimated from the second stage of the LDS model and were added to slope coefficients after the point of inflection. All analyses were repeated for the subset of the group that progressed that had autopsy confirmation of AD."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "All the participants were not demented (CDR=0) at entry and either remained CDR=0 (stable) throughout follow-up (n = 310, 37% men) or progressed to CDR \u03fe 0 (n = 134, 34% men) with a clinical diagnosis of uncertain dementia (CDR=0.5) or dementia of the Alzheimer type (CDR\u05460.5) by the time of their last evaluation (Table 1) .

There was a significant downward linear trend in global cognitive abilities and in verbal and working memory (P \u03fd.01); however, no longitudinal decline was detected in the Visuospatial factor (P=.29) (Figure) . Results were similar when data from the group that progressed were limited to individuals with autopsy-confirmed AD.\nA different pattern of longitudinal cognitive performance was seen in the group that progressed to dementia. Compared with preinflection slopes, they had steeper downward slopes after inflection (P\u03fd.001), and the rate of decline accelerated with time (Table 4 and Figure) .

Postinflection slopes and accelerations were similar for the Verbal Memory and Visuospatial factors. Slopes were steeper when the sample that progressed was restricted to those with autopsy-confirmed AD, but rates of acceleration were comparable with those for the total group that progressed."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "We demonstrate models of preclinical decline in a wellcharacterized longitudinal sample with inflection points in cognitive performance occurring several years before clinical diagnosis of dementia. It is apparent from these models that there is a clear turning point in the transition from normal aging to preclinical AD. A novel finding was that visuospatial abilities demonstrated an inflection point 3 years before clinical diagnosis. This decline on tests that were primarily speeded represented a sharp departure from the previous longitudinal pattern of these initially nondemented individuals, which was similar to that of those who did not become demented. Global cognitive abilities followed decline in visuospatial ability during the next year. Inflection points in the Verbal and Working Memory factors were not seen until 1 year before clinical diagnosis. The delayed inflection point for Verbal Memory probably results from the combination of episodic and semantic memory measures on one factor. If sufficient measures of each type of memory were available to form separate factors, an earlier inflection point for episodic memory would probably emerge based on the results obtained for the 2 individual measures of episodic memory.\nThe rate of decline accelerated after the downward course began. This was true for all 4 factors but was most apparent for Working Memory. Of course, the estimated rates of decline and acceleration depend on the tests administered, their level of difficulty, and floor and ceiling effects. For example, 3 tests in the battery (the Boston Naming Test, the copy version of the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the WMS Mental Control) have ceiling effects in the preinflection period in nondemented older adults. We were limited to these archival data from a battery that was originally constructed in 1979 for a study of mild dementia, and it does not contain more modern measurements of working memory.\nThe number of years before diagnosis of dementia that the inflection point occurs in the longitudinal course depends on the method of diagnosis and on the characteristics of the cognitive tests. The period will be longer if one relies on test norms, particularly if the sample is at a high level of function initially, than if one relies on collateral source reports of change from previous levels of function, captured by the CDR. Furthermore, inclusion of people in the preclinical stage in nondemented samples overestimates decline in cognitive ability traditionally attributed solely to age. 26 This makes it more difficult to detect beginning dementia using conventional norms based on these contaminated samples.\nA great strength of this study is the replication of the pattern of the longitudinal results observed in the larger sample that progressed in the subset with autopsyconfirmed AD. Although the rates of decline were somewhat steeper in the autopsied subset, the rates of acceleration were the same. The rate of progression in AD is Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer disease; NA, not applicable. a Data are given as estimate (SE). Slope coefficients were estimated using the piecewise change model of raw data. Acceleration coefficients were estimated using latent difference score regression, in which intercepts were equivalent to piecewise change slope estimates (\u00b10.02 U).\nb The optimal inflection point was 2 years before diagnosis for the Global factor, 1 year before diagnosis for the Verbal and Working Memory factors, and 3 years before diagnosis for the Visuospatial factor."}]
