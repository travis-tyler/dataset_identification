Structural MR imaging is a well established, widely available, non-invasive tool for investigating the inevitable downstream consequence of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease-atrophy. In the correct clinical context the presence of medial temporal lobe atrophy on cross-sectional MR imaging has positive predictive value for a diagnosis of AD and this is now incorporated in diagnostic criteria (Dubois et al., 2007; McKhann et al., 2011) . Quantification of the rate of global and regional brain volume loss from serially acquired MRI is increasingly used both to understand the progression of the disease and as an outcome measure for clinical trials, with the premise that a disease-modifying therapy would be expected to slow the rate of atrophy towards that seen in normal ageing . Numerous methods for quantifying change between serial scans have been proposed and are used both in observational and therapeutic studies. In the absence of a \"gold standard\" validating new methods and comparing the performance of different algorithms are not straightforward.\nWe announce here the public release of a longitudinal database of structural (T1 contrast) MRI scans from the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) study. Whilst there are a number of other open imaging databases, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, Jack et al., 2010) , the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, Ellis et al., 2010) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS, Marcus et al., 2010) the MIRIAD dataset has a number of features making it ideal for methods development and validation. These include:\n1. all scans on the same scanner over the same time period; 2. multiple serial scans (up to nine over two years) for both AD and controls; 3. a scanning schedule designed to give a wide range of inter-scan intervals from 2 weeks to 2 years; and 4. back-to-back scanning at three time points.\nThese features allow for formal assessments of the symmetry, transitivity and reproducibility of measures of atrophy, and assessment of bias . By making this dataset widely available, the performance of different image analyses methodologies can be compared directly; and novel tools can be validated before being applied to other datasets."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "The MIRIAD study was principally motivated to establish the minimal interval over which it would be feasible to undertake clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease using atrophy measured from serial MRI as an outcome measure. Supplementary aims were:\n1. To assess whether combining more than two scanning time points would increase statistical power and, if so, the optimal combination and timing of scans for trials of varying lengths.\n2. To provide a means of assessing the reproducibility of techniques within a single day and over short intervals where changes in individual's hydration and scanner fluctuations, but not pathological atrophy, might be expected.\nDetails of subject demographics have been previously described and are summarised here in Table 1 . In brief the dataset includes 46 patients with a diagnosis of mild-moderate probable AD (NINCDS-ADRDA, McKhann et al., 1984) all seen at the Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL, and 23 nondemented control subjects, typically the patient's spouse or carer. Inclusion criteria included age over 55 years and a mini-mental state examination (MMSE, Folstein et al., 1975) score between 12 and 26/ 30. Controls had MMSE scores >26/30, and no history of cognitive impairment, head injury, major psychiatric disease or stroke. Exclusion criteria included any neurodegenerative disease (apart from AD for the patients), or inability to tolerate MRI. At baseline and one year all subjects underwent a detailed neuropsychometric and clinical evaluation. MMSE score was recorded at baseline and 6-monthly intervals. All subjects were requested to attend seven imaging visits at 0, 2, 6, 14, 26, 38 and 52 weeks from baseline. 39 subjects who completed all these visits during the study attended a further scan at 18 months, 22 of these had a further scan at 24 months. At 0, 6 and 38 weeks two back-to-back scans were conducted. Study attendance figures are shown in Table 2 . Ethical approval for the study (and subsequently its release) was received from the local research ethics committee, and written consent obtained from all participants.\nAll scans were conducted on the same 1.5 T Signa MRI scanner (GE Medical systems, Milwaukee, WI) and acquired by the same radiographer. Three-dimensional T1-weighted images were acquired with an IR-FSPGR (inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled) sequence, field of view 24 cm, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, 124 1.5 mm coronal partitions, TR 15 ms, TE 5.4 ms, flip angle 15\u00b0, TI 650 ms. A total of 708 volumetric scans were acquired with up to 12 scans per individual, 25 different interscan intervals, allowing for a total of 2199 scan-pairs for patients with AD and 1182 scan-pairs for controls."}, {"section_title": "Results to date", "text": "A list of published articles which have used (in full or in part) this dataset is shown in Table 3 . Amongst others, these have included a number of methodological papers describing techniques for estimating hippocampal atrophy using a hippocampal template and the boundary shift integral (Barnes et al., 2007a) , fluid registration (Barnes et al., 2007b) , an automated medial temporal lobe scale (Ridha and Barnes, 2007) and label fusion methods (Leung et al., 2010) . Clinical papers have included assessments of hippocampal asymmetry in AD (Barnes et al., 2005) ; the effect of APOE status on cortical thickness (Guti\u00e9rrez-Galve et al., 2009); the correlation between rate of atrophy and change in certain neuropsychological test scores (Schott et al., 2008) ; and the demonstration that the use of affine image registration (nine degrees of freedom) can correct for longitudinal changes in voxel size (Whitwell et al., 2004) . These data have been used to compare methods for automated calculation of volumes and atrophy in the hippocampus (Barnes et al., 2008a) , and atrophy measured using the boundary shift integral with both Jacobian integration , and with both SIENA and SIENAX (Smith et al., 2007) . For clinical trials, the MIRIAD dataset has been used to estimate required sample sizes for six-month AD clinical trials using ventricular expansion and hippocampal atrophy (Barnes et al., 2008a) as outcome measures; and using grey matter atrophy (Anderson et al., 2012 ). Using a multi-level model specifically designed to analyse this data-set (Frost et al., 2004; Schott et al., 2006) provided a detailed assessment of the mean whole brain rate of atrophy (2.23%/year, 95% CI: 1.90-2.56%/year using the boundary shift integral implementation at that time) and between-and within-subject sources of variance in atrophy in AD trials (total variance 0.99 2 + (0.82/t) 2 , from 2 scans 't' years apart). Using these results they estimated sample sizes required to power AD studies over intervals of 6, 12, and 24 months (with and without drop-outs) using between 2 and 5 scanning time points spaced either evenly or optimally. This model was subsequently extended to estimate whether estimating brain atrophy from a run-in period could increase efficiency for clinical trials . Table 3 Publications featuring MIRIAD data.
