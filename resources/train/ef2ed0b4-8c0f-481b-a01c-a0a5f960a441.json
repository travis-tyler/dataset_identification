[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The prevalence of hypogonadism has been found to be increased in certain chronic illnesses, especially diabetes, hypertension and obesity. Recently, the prevalence of hypogonadism in primary care practices mirrored that in our population of men with erectile dysfunction (ED). In this study, the prevalence of hypogonadism in nearly 1000 men with ED was tabulated, using a retrospective chart review, and analyzed for association with the various contributing medical and psychological factors. The prevalence of hypogonadism was determined in men with a variety of chronic illnesses, and was further characterized by decade. We observed an association between hypertension (P \u00bc 0.025), tobacco abuse (P \u00bc 0.0059), sleep apnea (P \u00bc 0.0001), work stress (P \u00bc 0.041) and hypogonadism. These data were further analyzed for the odds ratio and confidence interval (Forest plot), which showed strong association for sleep apnea and work stress. We did not observe any significant association between diabetes, atherosclerosis, alcohol abuse, multiple medications, asthma, seizure disorder, anxiety/depression and hypogonadism (P values for Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel general association were 0. 48, 0.97, 0.25, 0.69, 0.22, 0.76 and 0.98, respectively). We suggest that a host of chronic illnesses have a high prevalence of secondary hypogonadism. Men who have chronic medical or psychological illnesses should have their testosterone level checked, especially when sexual dysfunction symptoms or signs are present."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Although debated for many years, current data strongly suggest that testosterone levels decrease in men as they age. 1, 2 This is true of both total, and the more accurate, free testosterone level. 3 This age-related decrease in androgen levels may not be universally accompanied by an age-related symptom complex. Indeed, there is no good correlation between aging male 'symptoms' and hormone levels. 4 Nevertheless, a diagnosis of testosterone deficiency in the aging male should be accompanied by one or more symptoms that have been associated with hypogonadism. The most commonly accepted marker of testosterone deficiency is a total testosterone value o300 ng per 100 ml (o10.4 nmol l \u00c01 ). 5 The symptom complex ascribed to low serum testosterone includes decreased energy, increasing fatigue, decreased libido, moodiness and irritability, decreased motivation, depression, decreased cognition and mental clarity, and erectile dysfunction (ED).\nThe prevalence of hypogonadism in aging men is variable. Longitudinal studies have shed light on this topic. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging noted a higher prevalence of hypogonadism when using bioavailable testosterone as the serum marker. 6 The Massachusetts Male Aging Study, using both total testosterone and calculated free testosterone, gave crude prevalence estimates for hypogonadism in men from age 40 to 69 years, ranging at baseline from 6.0 to 12.3%. 7 They estimated that 2.4 million men in the United States have androgen deficiency. In a subsequent epidemiological survey by the Boston Area Community Health Survey, using more strict criteria for symptomatic androgen deficiency, the crude prevalence of hypogonadism was 5.6%, with ranges from 3.1 to 18.4% varying with age. 8 They projected the number of American men with symptomatic androgen deficiency at 6.5 million. Mulligan et al. 9 conducted an office-based (internal medicine and family medicine) survey of hypogonadal men. They noted a prevalence of 38.7%. Importantly, men in this study had documented comorbidities, in which these data were not fully delineated in the larger population surveys. Makhlouf et al. 10 also noted a 36% prevalence of hypogonadism in a small urological office-based survey.\nEvidence has been mounting that lower testosterone levels and symptomatic hypogonadism are related to chronic illnesses, 3, 11 which may explain the disparities in the prevalence values described above. To date, the most studied chronic illness has been diabetes mellitus. Ding et al. 12 have reviewed the subject in a meta-analysis. In general, 30-40% of men with diabetes are expected to have lower testosterone levels, the relationship being so strong as to even predict the onset of diabetes. A prevalence of hypogonadism between 33 and 58% has been shown recently in younger diabetic men (ages [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , when age-related reference ranges for testosterone were used. 13 Although diabetes is the most reported condition related to a high incidence of hypogonadism, many chronic illnesses are reported to be accompanied by a substantial incidence of low testosterone levels. 3, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Guay et al. 19 have reported a prevalence of hypogonadism of 36.0% in men with ED seen in an endocrinology specialty center for sexual function and dysfunction. The majority of the men, 62.0%, had a pure organic cause for their ED, whereas 28.2% had mixed organic-psychological causes and 9.8% had pure psychological causes. Of particular interest is the fact that a significant cardiovascular risk profile was documented in these hypogonadal men. Subsequent studies have confirmed this association. [20] [21] [22] On the basis of the association between hypogonadism and the cardiovascular disease noted above, the hypothesis was developed that hypogonadism might be related to other chronic diseases as well. A subsequent survey of the patient population was undertaken to examine the prevalence of hypogonadism in men with other chronic illnesses, including those that may not be related to cardiac risks. A secondary goal was to verify the relationship between aging and hypogonadism."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "This evaluation was a retrospective observational study. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the retrospective chart review on the patients involved. Data were collected over a 2-year period from men who had been seen as consultations in the Center for Sexual Function. Over 90% of the men were Caucasian, engaged in long-term heterosexual relationships (over 6 months). Of the 1050 new consultations during a 2-year period, from July 1995 through July 1997, complete data were available for 990 men who became the subjects in the study group. The medical conditions of each patient were carefully tabulated during the complete history and physical examination.\nA clinical evaluation of all patients in the study, including a detailed evaluation, was made by a single physician (endocrinologist) in the same clinical setting. The chronic medical conditions listed were defined clinically, such as diabetes mellitus, anxiety/depression, hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Excessive use of alcohol was defined as more than two drinks per day, using the standard definition of 'a drink,' characterized as either 12 ounces of beer, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof hard alcohol or 5 ounces of wine. The category of work-related stress comprised men who worked long hours (defined as 450 h per week), many holding multiple jobs (defined as 41 job), exhibited travel stress from long daily commutes (defined as greater than 1 h each way), had quotas or deadlines to meet, and/or feared losing employment because of layoffs and mergers. Diagnoses were obtained through history. The diagnosis of sleep apnea was by standard sleep laboratory criteria, and consisted of 410 apnea/ hypopneic episodes per hour with a mean oxygen saturation that was o94%. Men on medications for work-related stress were excluded. The diagnosis of depression had been made previously by the primary care physician or by a treating psychiatrist or psychologist; most were on antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class. The diagnosis of asthma was a clinical one and consisted of men who used inhalers and/or oral medication, on a regular basis, for bronchodilatation or anti-inflammation, or those who had the need for acute bronchodilatation at least once in the previous 6 months. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was diagnosed in men who have had a cardiac event, who have angina and confirmed coronary artery disease by coronary angiography, who have silent ischemia diagnosed after coronary angiography, or who have a strong suspicion of coronary disease with hyperlipidemia."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory data", "text": "Total testosterone was measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone values were obtained using direct radioimmunoassay techniques. Hormone levels were drawn between 0800 and 1200 hours. All men had total testosterone levels measured at least twice, before and after the consultation, usually several weeks apart. Diagnosis of hypogonadism was made when total testosterone Hypogonadism in men with erectile dysfunction A Guay et al levels were o300 ng per 100 ml (o10.4 nmol l \u00c01 ) and the men showed multiple symptoms of androgen deficiency, defined as 3 or more symptoms/signs of hypogonadism. All hormone testing was carried out in the clinical laboratory of the Lahey Clinic Medical Center, Burlington, MA, USA.\nAs mentioned earlier, hypogonadism was defined as a total testosterone level o300 ng per 100 ml (o10.4 nmol l \u00c01 ) in all of the men. Primary hypogonadism was defined as a low testosterone accompanied by an LH level X9 IU l \u00c01 . Secondary hypogonadism was defined as a low testosterone accompanied by an LH level o9 IU l \u00c01 .

The strengths of the association were summarized using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimates for odds ratios (ORs) and OR estimates for each age strata along with their estimated 95% confidence intervals."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The mean age of the men was 57.4 years ( \u00b1 12.6 years). All of the men had sexual dysfunction. Figure 1 shows the incidence of hypogonadism in three age groups. Overall, 36% of the men in this study showed hypogonadism. Men under 40 years had an incidence of 43.2%, whereas men between the ages of 40 and 60 years had an incidence of 39.3%, and men over 60 years old had an incidence of 31.5%. In all, 6% had primary hypogonadism and 30% had secondary hypogonadism. This ratio did not significantly change with the various medical and psychological conditions studied. Table 1 tabulates the incidence of hypogonadism by decade, separating the incidence of primary from secondary hypogonadism. The peak decades occurred in men between the ages of 50 and 70 years, and did not rise after this, but the numbers of men studied in these decades were quite small. Table 2 shows the incidence of hypogonadism in the various organic causes of ED in the study population. The incidence in diabetes, 34%, was similar to other reports in the literature. The incidence of hypogonadism seen in other chronic illnesses was substantial: 30.8% in hypertension, 35 .0% in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 45.2% in asthma, 34.0% in seizure disorders, 64.3% in sleep apnea, 27.1% in excess alcohol consumption, 37.0% in medicated anxiety/depressive disorders, and 43.6% in work-related job stress. The incidences varied between 27.1 and 64.3%. Figure 1 Incidence of hypogonadism by age in 990 men with erectile dysfunction, and the differentiation between primary and secondary hypogonadism (adapted from Guay et al. 19 ). HGN, hypogonadism.\nHypogonadism in men with erectile dysfunction A Guay et al Table 2 also details the individual medical risk factors for ED and outlines the incidence of hypogonadism by decade. Also tabulated is the relative percentage of primary versus secondary hypogonadism, also by decade. The predominance of secondary hypogonadism over primary hypogonadism is noted not only by medical condition but also by age, when examined in detail by decade. The data also show, with few exceptions, that many men between the ages of 40 and 60, with a number of the various medical conditions, have a higher incidence of hypogonadism. The incidence of hypogonadism in diabetes mellitus and tobacco abuse is seen at an earlier age. Men using alcohol to excess seem to have a high incidence of hypogonadism throughout the age span, as do those with asthma. The incidence of hypogonadism is highest in men with sleep apnea, shown at 64.3%. Also of note is the onset of sleep apnea, which occurs at a younger age than thought previously, at least in men with ED. Table 3 isolates the men who have hypogonadism related to psychological issues. The incidence of hypogonadism in men with anxiety and/or depression is tabulated by decade. Again, the predominance of secondary hypogonadism is confirmed and even increases in this group. More patients with hypogonadism fall between the ages of 40 and 70 years, as was also seen in patients having medical (organic) causes of ED. The incidence of hypogonadism is 37.0% in men taking medication for serious anxiety and/or depression, but is lower than the 43.6% incidence seen in men who have the presumed less serious condition of work and life stresses. Perhaps we should reevaluate the seriousness of day-to-day life stresses on men's health.\nThe association between the various conditions and hypogonadism, using the categories of 'o40,' 'between '40 and 60' and '460' years old, revealed some interesting results. The information desired was whether men with the various conditions and ED were more likely to have hypogonadism. We did not observe any significant association between diabetes, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, alcohol abuse, multiple medications, asthma, seizure disorder, anxiety/depression and hypogonadism (P values for Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel general association were 0.48, 0.97, 0.25, 0.69, 0.22, 0.76 and 0.98, respectively). In contrast, we observed an association between hypertension (P \u00bc 0.025), tobacco abuse (P \u00bc 0.0059), sleep apnea (P \u00bc 0.0001), work stress (P \u00bc 0.041) and hypogonadism. These data were further analyzed for the OR and confidence interval, as shown in Figure 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Although much emphasis has been given to the relationship and high prevalence of hypogonadism in men with diabetes mellitus, 12 our study has shown that men with a host of other chronic illnesses also have hypogonadism. Even though this study involved a selected population of men who presented with ED, our results corroborate those of Mulligan et al., 9 who investigated general medical patients seen by primary care physicians. The similar incidence of hypogonadism in both studies is most likely because of the fact that both groups of patients had diabetes, hypertension and other similar chronic illnesses. Indeed, the medical risk factors for men with ED and with hypogonadism are the typical vascular medical disorders. 22, 23 Many of these risk factors are components of the metabolic syndrome, and a strong relationship has been made between metabolic syndrome, hypogonadism and vascular disease. [24] [25] [26] [27] These risk factors are also linked to insulin resistance, which is felt to be at the core of metabolic syndrome. 28, 29 The relationship between ED and cardiovascular risk has already been established. 26, 30, 31 Our findings suggest that the prevalence of secondary hypogonadism is far greater than that of primary hypogonadism. Furthermore, multiple medical and psychological conditions are associated with a high prevalence of hypogonadism. When our data were stratified by age, we noted that the highest prevalence of hypogonadism was found between the ages of 40 and 60 years. This may be explained by the fact that men in this age group are under higher work and life stresses. Surprisingly, we noted that there is a strong association between sleep apnea and hypogonadism, which is considered an underdiagnosed condition. Of even greater interest is the observation that men with work stresses have higher odds of having hypogonadism than the more established connection between hypogonadism and anxiety/depression (Figure 2) .\nHypogonadism is related not only to chronic medical illnesses but also to psychological problems. In our population of 990 men with ED, 208 had anxiety/depression and were taking CNS medications and most had depression. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, men with depression had a 1.8-fold increase in the prevalence of ED, independent of age and the comorbidities associated with ED. 32, 33 A study by Shores et al. 34 found that men with hypogonadism were at higher risk of developing depression. In a population of men with ED, 35% with hypogonadism had overt (or major) depressive scores by questionnaire versus 18% of their eugonadal counterparts. 10 These patients often have decreased libido, a known correlate of hypogonadism and depression. What is not well understood, or even discussed, is that work stress, often referred to as 'rat race,' is also related to hypogonadism. In our population, 197 men met these stressrelated criteria. These men did not have overt clinical depression but typically were men who worked more than 50 or 60 h a week, often at more than one job. Their jobs often involved traveling great distances and/or long commutes, along with meeting deadlines or quotas. Very often, relationship and/or or financial stresses were part of the presenting symptoms.\nThe highest prevalence of hypogonadism was in the middle years of 40-60 years of age. This seems Hypogonadism in men with erectile dysfunction A Guay et al contrary to multiple articles on the subject, in which it is accepted that the prevalence of hypogonadism increases with age. This probably represents a referral bias in our clinic, based on our education of the referring primary physicians over the years about stress factors, plus the fact that our Figure 2 Summary of the strength of associations between hypogonadism and chronic illnesses that showed significance, using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimates stratified by age and represented by Forest plot. HGN, hypogonadism.\nHypogonadism in men with erectile dysfunction A Guay et al geographical area is one of high professional stress. As the years between the ages of 40 and 60 are those of higher stress because of climbing the corporate ladder, losing jobs because of mergers and acquisitions, and men being unprepared for retirement financially in a high cost of living area, there is little wonder that these men have a higher prevalence of hypogonadism.\nWhen looking at the group of men who have anxiety/depression, the question may be posed as to whether the depression may be a symptom of the hypogonadism, and not of endogenous origin. This is impossible to assess as these men were already diagnosed and treated by their psychiatric health professionals or by their primary physicians. It is felt that hypogonadism may aggravate an existing depression, but this was not studied. All the men coming to our clinic complaining of decreased libido had their testosterone levels checked, but so too did all men complaining of ED. Obviously, men with emotional disorders should be studied more closely and prospectively to answer some of these questions.\nThere are always questions about the possible overlap between subjects with psychological causes and medical causes. It is safe to say that there is always an overlap. In a subanalysis, we found that organic ED with at least one medical cofactor was seen in 40.2% of the anxiety/depression group, and in 44.0% of the men in the work stress group. Conversely, this means that nearly 60% of the men in these groups did not have major medical conditions (acknowledging, however, that the men in the anxiety/depression group were on medications). This does prove that there is some overlap and also strongly suggests that psychological stress can indeed lower the testosterone levels. One recent paper called into question the prevalence of hypogonadism in the various medical cofactors 35 in men who take atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and have lower total testosterone levels than men who took simvastatin or no statin at all. Free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not affected. This might be related to the trend toward lower sex hormonebinding globulin levels in the study. As atorvastatin has a high penetration in the market, there may be many men with falsely low total testosterone levels. Atorvastatin, however, was approved for use in December 1996, and our databases were collected between July 1995 and July 1997. Given the time it takes to initially launch the drug and commence full marketing, it would seem that relatively few, if any, patients ever received it.\nWhen the incidence of hypogonadism was determined by decades, nearly all of the categories of illness were more prevalent in men aged 50-70 years, which is consistent with other studies. 22 Interestingly, this same age group showed increased hypogonadism in the category of men with life and work stresses, when it might have been thought that work stresses would be more prevalent in younger men as they are establishing their careers. The question of bias has to be entertained, as the majority of men seeking help for ED fall into the same age category of 50-70 years. 3 Most of the men with hypogonadism had secondary hypogonadism, showing a low testosterone level and low to low-normal LH levels. Overall, 6% of the men with hypogonadism had primary hypogonadism and 30% had secondary hypogonadism. On analysis of the individual medical and psychological cofactors (Tables 2 and 3 ), this proportion remained relatively stable. After age 40 or 50, men increasingly develop more chronic illnesses. It is our hypothesis that the stress of chronic illnesses may decrease the hypothalamic output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and/or the pituitary output of LH and follicle stimulating hormone. It has been well established that acute illness will cause hypogonadotropic, or secondary, hypogonadism. 36 This has been shown in a variety of clinical situations, including acute burns, 37 ethanol abuse, 38 presence and treatment of carcinoma, 39 or head trauma. 40 Psychological stresses have also been shown to cause secondary hypogonadism, as shown by Kreuz et al., 41 in the study of military officer candidate training, 42 or in combat situations under the threat of attack. 43 Secondary hypogonadism has also been shown in healthy civilian men, who were undergoing varying life stresses, such as training for marathon running, 44 amateur wrestling, 45 or, in general, athletic overtraining. 46 It is postulated that mental or physical stresses will increase catecholamines, which in turn decrease the hypothalamicpituitary hormonal response. Sato et al. 47 showed that low brain catecholamine neurotransmission in rats during long-term psychological stress impaired their sexual function. Demura et al. 48 studied immobilization stress in rats and found decreased LH and testosterone levels, consistent with secondary hypogonadism. Orr et al. 49 even suggested that immobilization stress might also directly affect direct testicular steroidogenesis by enzymatic inhibition. In humans, the stress of acute head trauma caused secondary hypogonadism, and the higher levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were significantly inversely proportional to the levels of testosterone. 40 Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were also found to be elevated in men just before and for some time after a parachute jump. 50 It is postulated that men with chronic illness have a functional suppression of their central hypothalamic-pituitary axis, but this needs further evaluation. Hormonal suppression in men with a variety of chronic medical conditions has been shown to be reversible with stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitary axis. 51, 52 One may suggest that, teleologically, reaction to threats and stresses with decreased production of sex steroids is plausible to conserve energy and to increase the survival hormones, 53 in a large epidemiological series of over 255 000 men with ED, found that men with ED were twice as likely to have diabetes mellitus than men without ED. Corona et al. 54 emphasized the role of obesity in men with ED and hypogonadism, even when corrected for comorbidities, especially hypertension. It is to be noted that simply replacing testosterone in men with hypogonadism may not correct the ED. We have previously shown that only 39% of the men with hypogonadism whose testosterone levels were normalized corrected the ED. 51 In a systemic review of 17 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, Bolona et al. 55 highlighted the inconsistent results of testosterone therapy. In our previously mentioned study, 51 the lack of effect of testosterone therapy on erectile function was attributed to other factors causing ED, that is, the concurrent presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and the use of multiple medications.\nChronic illnesses are a measure of health status or, put differently, good health. In the Boston Area Community Health Survey of 1822 men, Hall et al. 56 found a rather significant negative correlation (OR \u00bc 0.2) between low testosterone and health status. In a long-term epidemiological study with a different population but analyzed by the same group, 57 comorbidities and lifestyle influences were strongly associated with accelerated declining testosterone over those seen owing to aging. The European Male Aging Study, a prospective epidemiological evaluation of 3200 men over a 4-year period, found a great number of medical comorbidities correlating with low testosterone levels. 58 They examined a large number of comorbidities, including weight, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, bronchitis, asthma, peptic ulcer disease, thyroid conditions, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, prostate conditions and cancer. They showed the effect of these comorbidities in lowering the testosterone levels, independent of the normal age-related decline in androgen levels. They also found that some risk factors operated independently of age, but others did not. This brings up the possibility of modifying risk factors to maintain testosterone levels during aging. More research efforts, especially large prospective studies, are needed in this area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Many chronic illnesses including, but not limited to, diabetes are associated with hypogonadism. The majority of the men with the combination of hypogonadism, chronic illness and ED are clustered with high numbers in the 40 to 60-year-old age groups. The majority of men with hypogonadism and chronic illness in this population have secondary, but not primary, hypogonadism. Sleep apnea, an underdiagnosed condition, seems to have a strong association with hypogonadism. Men who report life and work stresses also have a high prevalence of hypogonadism. In how many of these men with medical and/or psychological causes of hypogonadism might we be able to correct their testosterone levels with lifestyle modifications remains an issue for further research."}]
