COVID-19 affects the entire health system through its direct effect as a communicable disease, as well as its ability to alter the overall mortality and burden of disease through impact on non-communicable diseases.\nGlobally, non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, accounted for greater than 70% of all deaths in 2017. 6 There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases may be associated on multiple levels, resulting in potentially unexpected effects on health outcomes. On one hand, COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as acute cardiac injury (e.g. myocarditis), stroke, and exacerbation of subclinical vascular pathology. [7] [8] [9] On the other hand, due to worldwide population ageing, many individuals may have multiple chronic medical conditions which can negatively impact the outcome of COVID-19 infection. 10 A combination of frailty, ageing, and vascular comorbidities, together with COVID-19, represents a scenario that can exponentially increase hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and hospital readmissions. This may explain the increased death rates in some countries, particularly among vulnerable patients with non-communicable diseases. 11 Governments are urgently attempting to implement national policies and institute an efficient response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 12 There are several important public health concerns that need to be addressed at this crucial stage of the pandemic, including the importance of active surveillance, border control, the possible role of tourists, and identification of those at risk. Therefore, collection of accurate and comprehensive global data regarding COVID-19, along with other major causes of disease burden, should be a public health priority.

These relationships are more evident in high-income countries, where we found the highest rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million when compared to other countries. This could be explained, at least partially, by the greater number of COVID-19 tests, active surveillance models, and ageing populations. Although noncommunicable/cardiovascular disease DALYs were not independently associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths, the higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases among the elderly may play a major role in the burden of COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 is a worldwide health crisis with drastic social, economic, and health consequences.\nIn order to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, health policymakers require accurate and comprehensive relevant health data. In the current study, we summarized data regarding COVID-19 cases and deaths in 185 countries. High-income countries have the greatest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We found a correlation between baseline non-communicable diseases and COVID-19 cases. National and regional burden of all non-communicable diseases, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke had a significant correlation with COVID-19 deaths.\nAlthough we did not find an independent association between non-communicable/cardiovascular disease DALYs and COVID-19 cases and deaths, there was a significant association between life expectancy and COVID-19 cases. Life expectancy and HALE in high-income countries are higher than in other countries, and this improved longevity is associated with a higher prevalence of non-communicable disease. 1 These findings may explain the increased rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in high-income countries, where a considerable portion of the community consists of older adults with baseline non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. Many COVID-19-related deaths in high-income countries are older individuals and residents of long-term care facilities, [22] [23] [24] where a considerable number of people may have concurrent non-communicable diseases. In addition, the difference in affordability and access to long-term care in high-income countries compared to other regions may explain some of the differences between cases and COVID-19-related deaths among high-income countries versus low-and middle-income countries. 25 Although the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths is lower in low-and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries, we may observe a potential shift towards a higher mortality rate in low-and middle-income countries due to poorer control of non-communicable diseases, despite the corresponding younger demographic structure. 26 This is particularly important after the recent exponential growth in the number of cases in Brazil 27 and changes in Africa. 28 Elderly individuals, particularly those residing in long-term care, may suffer from frailty syndrome, resulting in a reduced capacity to respond to acute physiological stressors, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this regard, it appears as though many countries have not adequately prepared to prevent communicable diseases of this magnitude. In addition, an increase in the total mortality rate of some countries during the pandemic as compared to the previous years may be due to changes in health care delivery for vulnerable citizens. Between March 13 and April 17 2020, England and Wales reported an additional 11334 deaths compared to their five year average. COVID-19 accounted for 8753 of these deaths. 29 Many countries have detrimentally altered the delivery of healthcare to patients suffering from non-communicable diseases during the pandemic, thus it is possible that a significant portion of non-diagnosed COVID-19 additional deaths are due to patients' lack of control of non-communicable diseases. 11, 30 While differences pertaining to COVID-19 cases and mortality between countries (e.g. low-and middle-income countries versus high-income countries) can be attributed to lower life expectancy in low-and middle-income countries, other factors such as time of initiation of lockdowns, testing per population, active surveillance, and border control may also play a significant role in the discrepancy of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted numerous countries to implement nation-wide lockdowns in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. One possible reason for a higher rate of COVID-19 death in high-income countries may be a delay in the time of lockdown. However, we did not find an independent association between the time of lockdown and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. From a public health perspective, it is crucial to implement active surveillance for new cases and enhanced techniques for contact tracing. Successful models have been reported in some South Asian countries. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] This is particularly important in enclosed settings, such as long-term care and cruise ships, where it is crucial to actively monitor for the initial source of the infection, as well as identify potentially infected staff, guests, visitors, and residents. 22 We also observed a strong association between the number of tourists and COVID-19 mortality, emphasizing the importance of border control between, and probably within, countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the current pandemic, one of the most important public health and government concerns is when to cease national quarantines. While many countries may change their national isolation policies because of economic factors, at this crucial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, the convergence of COVID-19 with non-communicable diseases, particularly among the elderly, has yet to be addressed from a public health perspective. Mounting evidence suggests that infectious diseases are prognostic determinants for non-communicable diseases. 36 Such associations between non-communicable and communicable diseases emphasize the importance of a comprehensive strategy for integrating infection and non-communicable diseases. Specifically, many outpatient clinics have stopped working, and vulnerable patient populations may have reduced access to their previously established preventive measures. In addition, many patients are reluctant to seek medical care due to fear of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The public should be informed that hospitals remain the best place for acute care. Hospital administrators should also ensure patient safety through appropriate preventive measures. For example, many important aspects of patient care, ranging from emergency medical services dispatch to decisions regarding acute vascular interventional therapies, can be performed via telemedicine. 37 Early supported discharge services 38 should be organized for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases with or without confirmed COVID-19. In addition, online 24/7 outpatient support with secure cross-platform applications may help fill the gap left by the reduction in traditional faceto-face visits for chronic diseases that require regular follow-up.\nOur study has some limitations. We found significant variations between the rates of confirmed cases per number of performed tests in different regions. Differences in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in low-and middle-income countries may be related to reduced testing and active screening of suspected cases, affecting the accuracy of reports. Many countries have not reported the number of tests performed; therefore, we do not have access to official reports of COVID-19 testing in several countries. Additionally, we were unable to assess the quality and sensitivity of tests in different countries. Moreover, it is possible that many cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries have been followed only in the community, without hospitalizations. This may affect the total number of both confirmed cases and deaths in these countries. In the current study, we entered GBD super regions as a categorical variable in the mixed effect model. This classification will enable us to compare countries and regions according to their geographic closeness to capture important public health confounders. Although we entered some of the important confounders that may be associated with COVID-19 into our statistical model; e.g. lockdown time, burden of non-communicable disease, geographical locations, HALE (as a snapshot of global health and age), and tourist number (as a marker of international visitors), we were not able to capture many other confounders, such as national and religious ceremonies (e.g. new year celebrations, sport championships, etc) even when using the GBD super region classification. This may explain the instability of our adjusted model with a large variability in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the mixed effect analysis. In addition, COVID-19 has a dynamic exponential pattern which may affect the results of any adjusted analytic model. As COVID-19 figures are moving targets, and different countries are achieving peak infection at different times, it is likely that some countries still did not reach their peak at the time of analysis. In addition, there is a possibility for a second peak in many countries after reopening business. This would underestimate the correlation between COVID-19 and NCD figures in some countries and regions. Therefore, the results of the adjusted model should be interpreted cautiously. In addition, we used group data in this study which is a subject of ecological fallacy and cannot be interfered with at an individual-based level. 39 Nevertheless, the major strength of our study is the reliance on available worldwide data, which provides the opportunity to investigate overlaps of non-communicable diseases and population ageing with COVID-19 on a global scale."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The underlying message of our study is the need for an evidence-based approach to the convergence of the ageing population, non-communicable diseases, and COVID-19.

The results can subsequently be employed as a reference for public health officials regarding the healthcare system's capacity, and guide decisions during the current pandemic, as well as future global emergencies. Additionally, a model containing our results would allow for coordinated care towards individuals (particularly the elderly) enduring this multi-disease burden, as well as resource allocation towards populations with higher risk of morbidity and mortality.
