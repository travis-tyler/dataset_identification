Although ALS is perceived as being rare, approximately 6,000 Americans die annually from the condition (Hirtz et al., 2007) . Furthermore, the number of ALS cases across the globe will increase to nearly 400,000 in 2040, predominantly due to aging of the population (Arthur et al., 2016) . This increase is anticipated to place an enormous socioeconomic burden on global healthcare systems, in particular because the annual healthcare cost per patient with ALS is among the highest for any neurological disease (Gladman and Zinman, 2015) .\nApproximately 10% of ALS cases display a family history (FALS), whereas the remaining 90% of ALS cases are sporadic (SALS) in nature. Driven in large part by advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, the genetic etiology of two-thirds of FALS cases and about 10% of SALS cases is now known (Chia et al., 2018; Renton et al., 2014) . Mutations in SOD1 were the first identified cause of ALS (Rosen et al., 1993) , contributing to $20% of FALS and $2% of SALS. More recently, pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat expansions located within the first intron of the C9orf72 gene on chromosome 9p21 were identified as the most common cause of both FALS ($40%) and SALS ($7%) (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011) . Interestingly, this repeat expansion contributes to $10% of all frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, thus genetically explaining much of the overlap between these clinical syndromes (Majounie et al., 2012) . As a result of these major discoveries, there are several ongoing efforts toward directed silencing of these mutant genes, which could result in a therapeutic treatment for up to 10% of all ALS cases and for a similar portion of FTD cases.\nIn addition to the insights provided by each novel ALS gene, the collective knowledge gained from genetic factors provides a more comprehensive understanding of the interacting pathways underlying motor neuron degeneration. For example, the identification of ALS genes has revealed at least three pathways believed to contribute to the development of ALS: (1) RNA metabolism (based on the observation of mutations in C9orf72, FUS, HNRNPA1, and MATR3) , (2) protein homeostasis (UBQLN2, VCP, OPTN, and VAPB), and (3) cytoskeletal dynamics (PFN1, TUBA4A, and DCTN1) (Chia et al., 2018; Robberecht and Eykens, 2015; Taylor et al., 2016) . Understanding the mechanisms leading to disease pathogenesis again provides targets for therapeutic intervention that may be applicable to all forms of ALS.\nDue to the decreased accessibility of multiple affected family members with unknown genetic etiology, there has been an increased focus on the identification of ALS-associated genes with moderate to low impact. Despite their lower effect, such is based on the rs113247976 SNP using 85 European ancestry samples (CEU) from the November 2010 release of the 1000 Genomes Project dataset. R 2 of the p.Pro986Leu (rs113247976) with additional SNPs achieving genome-wide significance was 0.544 (rs117027576), 0.544 (rs118082508), 0.741 (rs116900480), and 0.347 (rs142321490).\ngenes continue to provide valuable insight into ALS pathogenesis. For example, the product of the risk factor TBK1 is known to interact with the product of ALS-associated gene OPTN, further solidifying the role of autophagy and protein homeostasis in disease development (Cirulli et al., 2015; Freischmidt et al., 2015; Maruyama et al., 2010; Morton et al., 2008) . Similarly, the risk factor NEK1, identified through a rare variant burden analysis (RVB) of index FALS (i.e., one affected sample per family), is a known binding partner of C21orf2, an ALS risk factor found through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (Cirulli et al., 2015; Kenna et al., 2016; Malovannaya et al., 2011; van Rheenen et al., 2016) . The interaction of these two proteins is required for efficient DNA damage repair (Fang et al., 2015) , a pathway that is becoming increasingly implicated as a contributing factor in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases (Copped\u00e8 and Migliore, 2015; Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2016; Madabhushi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "GWASs Identify KIF5A as a Novel ALS-Associated Gene To identify new susceptibility loci operating in ALS, we undertook a large-scale GWAS involving 12,663 patients diagnosed with ALS and 53,439 control subjects (Tables S1 and S2) . Our data were then incorporated into a meta-analysis with a recently published GWAS involving 12,577 ALS cases and 23,475 control subjects . After imputation and quality-control measures (see STAR Methods and Figure S1 for the workflow and Figure S2 for the multidimensional scaling plot), 10,031,630 genotyped and imputed variants from 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 control samples were available for association analysis ( Figure 1A ). Quantile-quantile plots did not show evidence of significant population stratification (l 1000 = 1.001; Figure S3 ). SNPs achieving genome-wide significance (p < 5.0 3 10 \u00c08 ) are listed in Tables 1 and S3 and suggestive loci with SNPs associated at p < 5.0 3 10 \u00c07 are listed in Table S4 .\nOur analysis revealed five previously identified loci that achieved genome-wide significance (loci including TNIP1, C9orf72, TBK1, UNC13A, and C21orf2) (Benyamin et al., 2017; Laaksovirta et al., 2010; Shatunov et al., 2010; van Es et al., 2009; van Rheenen et al., 2016) . In addition, we observed a strong association signal for five SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 12q14.1 that reached genome-wide statistical significance spanning a region of several hundred kilobases (Table 1 ; Figure 1B ). Of the five SNPs, two of them resided in close proximity to each other within a large intergenic region and two in proximity to short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7), a gene expressed primarily in skin. However, one SNP (rs113247976) results in a p.Pro986Leu coding change within the kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene (p = 6.4 3 10 \u00c010 , odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.24-1.53; Figure 2 ). The case:control allele frequencies for the combined discovery cohort were 2.07%:1.55% and genotype counts were 5: 529: 12,043 to 7: 786: 22,682 (homozygotes alternative allele: heterozygotes: homozygous reference allele; Figure 2 ). Calculations based on our cohort size as well as the OR and allele frequency of rs113247976 result in an $99.5% power to detect this as an ALS-associated SNP."}, {"section_title": "Rare Variant Burden Analysis Identifies KIF5A as an ALS Gene", "text": "In an independent line of investigation, we attempted to identify novel ALS genes through exome-wide RVB. In brief, RVB compares the frequency of variants within each gene below a userdefined frequency threshold in a case-control cohort. As the last two ALS-associated genes identified by this methodology (TBK1 and NEK1) displayed an increased frequency of loss-offunction (LOF) variants, we focused our initial analysis on such variants (consisting of nonsense and predicted splice altering) (Cirulli et al., 2015; Freischmidt et al., 2015; Kenna et al., 2016) .\nToward this end, we performed RVB testing for association of LOF variants in a cohort of 1,138 index FALS cases and 19,494 controls, after applying quality-control filters (Experimental Model and Subject Details; Figure S4 ; Tables S5 and S6) . Genes displaying p < 5.0 3 10 \u00c04 are shown in Table 2 . The previously identified ALS genes, TBK1 (p = 5.58 3 10 \u00c07 , OR = 15.11, 95% CI = 5.81-38.69) and NEK1 (p = 1.68 3 10 \u00c06 , OR = 6.64, 95% CI = 3.32-12.51), yielded strong associations with ALS, reaching exome-wide significance (Figure 3 ). In addition, we observed a single novel gene reaching exome-wide significance, KIF5A (p = 5.55 3 10 \u00c07 ; OR = 32.07, 95% CI = 9. 05-135.27) . Within this gene, we observed 6 LOF variants in our 1,138 cases (0.53%) compared to 3 such variants in our comparison cohort of 19,494 controls (0.015%; Table 2 ). There was no evidence of genomic inflation (l = 0.93; Figure S5 ), sequencing center or other sub-cohort bias ( Figure S6 ), or call rate bias (Figure S7) in our analysis. Of the index FALS cases carrying KIF5A LOF mutations, we obtained DNA from two siblings of the proband carrying a c.2993-3C>T, exon 27 -5 0 splice junction variant and from a sibling of a different proband carrying a c.3020+2T>A, exon 27 -3 0 splice junction variant. These variants segregated with disease within each of these families. Sanger sequencing validated all identified LOF variants containing samples in the discovery set and affected relatives. Interestingly, when we investigated the location of the six ALSassociated variants present in KIF5A, all occurred within a 34 bp stretch of DNA and were predicted to affect splicing of exon 27, which encodes amino acids 998-1007 (Table 3; Figure 4A ). Five of the six variants were located on sequential base pairs on the 3 0 end of the exon, whereas one was located on the 5 0 end of the exon. We used the application ASSEDA (Automated Splice Site and Exon Definition Analyses) to predict any mutant mRNA splice isoforms resulting from these variants (Tompson et al., 2007) . This algorithm was chosen as it is known to have high performance in splice prediction (Caminsky et al., 2014) . ASSEDA predicted a complete skipping of exon 27 for all variants, yielding a transcript with a frameshift at coding amino acid 998, the deletion of the normal C-terminal 34 amino acids of the cargo-binding domain, and the extension of an aberrant 39 amino acids to the C terminus (Table 3; Figures 4B and 4C) . The presence of transcripts with skipped exon 27 was demonstrated by performing RT-PCR in two patients carrying exon 27 -3 0 splice junction variants (c.3020+2T>A and c.3020+1G>A) using RNA from lymphoblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively. This splice form was not detected in four control lines ( Figure 4D ). Sequence analysis of the smaller RT-PCR products obtained from the patient cells confirmed the exon 26-28 splicing event. Material for RT-PCR was not available for any other patient carrying a KIF5A LOF variant.\nOur initial RVB was restricted to single nucleotide variants due to the limited sensitivity and comparatively high false-positive rates associated with identifying small insertions and deletions (indels) within exome sequencing data (Fang et al., 2014) . Based on our discovery of increased LOF variants within KIF5A, we reevaluated this region for the presence of indels. Our analysis revealed two (0.026%) indels within our cohort of 1,138 FALS cases, compared to zero (0%) indels among 19,494 control samples. Both of these indels (p.Asp996fs and p.Asn999fs) resulted in a frameshift of the KIF5A protein coding sequence, and were located close to the splice junction variants that we previously observed to cause skipping of exon 27, resulting in a frameshift at amino acid 998 (Table 3) . Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of both indels. Combining the results of the single nucleotide and indel variant analysis yielded a highly significant p of 3.8 3 10 \u00c09 (OR = 41.16, 95% CI = 12.61-167.57). We failed to detect any signals of RVB association for rare missense variants across KIF5A or within any sub-domain of the gene (Table S8 ).\nReplication Analysis of rs113247976 and LOF Variants in KIF5A Given the strong signal of the missense variant identified by our GWAS (p.Pro986Leu, rs113247976) and its close proximity to the LOF variants identified by our RVB (amino acids 996-999), we attempted to replicate its association with ALS by analyzing additional cohorts. To accomplish this, we evaluated this variant in a cohort of 4,159 ALS cases and 18,650 controls that were non-overlapping with our GWAS discovery analysis (STAR Methods; Figure S8 ). This included non-overlapping samples from our RVB (673 FALS and 17,696 controls). Analysis of the cohort revealed an allele frequency of 1.78% in cases and 1.32% in controls (rs113247976, p = 3.82 3 10 \u00c04 , OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.17-1.70), thereby replicating the association of the original GWAS. A meta-analysis of the GWAS and replication cohort (n = 24,965 cases and 78,454 controls) yielded a highly significant p of 7.09 3 10 \u00c013 (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.33-1.45; Figure 2 ). These results support the association of KIF5A p.Pro986Leu with ALS. However, at this point we cannot definitely state that the missense variant is the primary risk factor, as we cannot rule out other variants in linkage disequilibrium. We next performed mutational screening of KIF5A in an additional cohort of 9,046 ALS cases that had not been included in our original RVB. This revealed three additional carriers of C-terminal variants. One sporadic patient harbored an exon 26 frameshift mutation (p.Asn997fs) and a second sporadic patient harbored an exon 27 splice-altering mutation (c.2993-1G>A; Table 3 ). The third patient carried a p.Arg1007Lys (c.3020G>A) mutation and had a familial history of ALS. This mutation was also observed in FALS patients from our RVB; however, a comparison of 240,715 common variant sites between the two patients failed to reveal a familial relationship (Experimental Model and Subject Details). Additionally, one patient was observed to carry a predicted splice-altering variant proximal to exon 3 (c.291+5G>A). However, this variant was not supported as creating an aberrant transcript by ASSEDA. The cohort used for this analysis was comprised mainly of sporadic ALS cases. LOF variants were not observed in a follow-up panel of 1,955 controls. Comparison of the LOF variants in sporadic patients (2/9,046 cases, 0.022%) with either the 1,955 replication controls or all controls analyzed in this study (21,449 controls) yielded insignificant p values (0.868 and 0.423, respectively). Interestingly, the frequency of LOF variants in sporadic cases is lower than that observed in our original FALS cohort (0.703%), suggesting that KIF5A LOF variants display a high penetrance. Furthermore, the rate of LOF variants reported in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database is lower than we observed in the control samples used in our discovery cohort (0.007% versus 0.015%).\nALS-Associated Mutations in KIF5A Are Distinct from SPG10/CMT2 Mutations Missense mutations within KIF5A are a known cause of hereditary spastic paraparesis (spastic paraplegia type 10, autosomal dominant; OMIM: 604187) and of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) (Crimella et al., 2012; Jennings et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2002) . Although SPG10 and CMT2 share Analysis of the p.Pro986Leu (rs113247976) variant within each of the described cohorts is shown. Allelic association for all subcohorts was analyzed by logistic regression followed by a fixed-effects meta-analysis. The Forest plot (right) displays the distribution of OR estimates across study cohorts with the vertical gray line denoting the OR estimated under the meta-analysis, and with the width of the horizontal lines and the diamonds corresponding to 95% confidence intervals. clinical features with ALS, a careful examination of the clinical records of the ALS cases with LOF mutations in KIF5A ruled out misdiagnosis. Furthermore, we detected no variants previously associated with SPG10 or CMT2 in our FALS cohort .\nTo further elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships, we evaluated the location of mutations within KIF5A. Interestingly, mutations contributing to SPG10 and to CMT2 are almost exclusively missense changes and are located in the N-terminal motor domain (amino acids 9-327) of KIF5A ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, the mutations identified as contributing to ALS are found predominantly in the C-terminal cargo-binding region of KIF5A (amino acids 907-1032) with the highly penetrant FALS mutations showing LOF. These results indicate that the functional domain mutated in KIF5A dictates the clinical phenotype, resulting in distinct yet overlapping neurodegenerative diseases."}, {"section_title": "Patients with KIF5A LOF Mutations Display Younger Age at Onset and Longer Survival", "text": "To establish the existence of any commonalities between patients with LOF mutations in the C-terminal region of KIF5A, we evaluated their clinical phenotype. Cases with LOF mutations exhibited a median age of onset at 46.5 years (n = 19; Table S7 ). This is lower than the age of onset reported for ALS in epidemiological studies (65.2 years, interquartile range 56.0-72.2) (Ahmeti et al., 2013) . Interestingly, we also observed an increased disease duration (survival) in patients harboring these LOF mutations. The median survival time of ALS patients is 20-36 months (Ahmeti et al., 2013) . In contrast, cases with LOF mutations exhibited a median survival of nearly 10 years (117 months, n = 17; Table S7 ). ALS patients with symptom onset before 40 years of age have been shown to have longer survival, often exceeding 10 years (Chi\u00f2 et al., 2009 ). Previously reported (gray) and novel (black) genes exhibiting a significant excess of rare LOF variants in patients are shown. splice junction P M n/a n/a n/a n/a 57,966,423 C>T 15 c.1630C>T p.Arg544* -F n/a n/a n/a n/a 57,976,884 G>C 28 c.3021G>C 5 0 splice junction N F n/a n/a n/a n/a patients with uncomplicated types of hereditary spastic paraparesis and CMT2 display a normal life expectancy (Patzk\u00f3 and Shy, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We previously identified KIF5A as a candidate gene for ALS in our prior study that lacked the power to draw a definitive conclusion (Kenna et al., 2016) . KIF5A was also a candidate ALS gene in a previous GWAS, though it similarly failed to reach genomewide significance (McLaughlin et al., 2017; van Rheenen et al., 2016) , as well as a single gene study selected based on the a priori knowledge of its role in HSP/CMT2 and cytoskeletal function (Brenner et al., 2018) . Here, we have confirmed KIF5A as an ALS-associated gene with genome-wide significance through two independent approaches. By performing a GWAS involving $80,000 samples, in addition to replicating five previously published loci, as well as the previously reported locus SCFD1 using a linear mixed model analysis (data not shown), we identified a missense variant within the KIF5A gene that reached genomewide significance for association with ALS risk. It should be stated though, that as with all GWASs, we cannot rule out that other variants in linkage disequilibrium represent the primary risk factor. In an independent line of investigation, we applied RVB to exome sequencing of $21,000 samples and identified an exome-wide significant association between FALS risk and rare KIF5A LOF variants. Analyses of KIF5A in independent replication cohorts both confirmed our initial finding for the p.Pro986Leu variant and revealed three additional carriers of LOF variants in 9,046 ALS cases. a relatively common, but low penetrance, risk allele for ALS, while LOF variants constitute rare, but high penetrance, risk factors. Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in intracellular transport of organelles within eukaryotic cells. In mammals, there are three heavy-chain isoforms of KIF5: KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C (Miki et al., 2001) . The three proteins homo-and heterodimerize through their coiled-coiled stalk domain, and create a complex with two kinesin light chains via binding to the tail domain (Hirokawa et al., 1989) . All three KIF5 genes are expressed in neurons (Kanai et al., 2000) and function to transport many cargos by binding to distinct adaptor proteins.\nThe central role of kinesins in axonal transport leads us to speculate that mutations in KIF5A cause disease by disrupting this process. Indeed, defects in axonal transport are a common observation in ALS patients and are already known to directly contribute to motor neuron degeneration pathogenesis (Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006; Hirokawa et al., 2010; Millecamps and Julien, 2013) . KIF5 mediates the transport of granules containing both RNA and RNA-binding proteins within neuronal dendrites and axons (Kanai et al., 2004) . Among these cargos are the ALS-associated proteins FUS and hnRNPA1 (Guo et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2009; Vance et al., 2009) . Similarly, KIF5 mediates the transport of VAPB through the adaptor protein protrudin (Matsuzaki et al., 2011) , and mutations in the VAPB gene have been identified in ALS and late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (Nishimura et al., 2004 (Nishimura et al., , 2005 . KIF5 is responsible for the axonal transport of neurofilaments (Wang and Brown, 2010) and KIF5A knockout mice display abnormal transport of neurofilaments (Xia et al., 2003) . Abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments is a pathological hallmark of ALS and rare mutations in neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) are associated with ALS (Al-Chalabi et al., 1999).\nKIF5 also contributes to the transport of mitochondria (Kanai et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 1998) and motor neurons derived from KIF5A \u00c0/\u00c0 mice display transport deficits and reduced survival (Karle et al., 2012) . Impaired transport and dysfunction of mitochondria represent another common hallmark observed in ALS patients (Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006; Guo et al., 2017; Palomo and Manfredi, 2015; Smith et al., 2017) . KIF5 also contributes to the transport of AMPA-type (Heisler et al., 2014; Setou et al., 2002) and GABA A receptors (Nakajima et al., 2012) . In keeping with reported ALS genes such as NEK1 (Thiel et al., 2011) and PFN1 (Wu et al., 2012) , modulation of KIF5A expression has been shown to influence the formation of neurite-like membrane protrusions (Matsuzaki et al., 2011) . Given its critical interactions with the cytoskeleton, the identification of KIF5A mutations further extends the list of cytoskeletalrelated proteins implicated in ALS pathogenesis, such as PFN1, TUBA4A, NEFH, and peripherin (Al-Chalabi et al., 1999; Gros-Louis et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012 ).\nAn important question raised by the current study is why variation within the C-terminal cargo-binding domain is associated with ALS, while missense variations of the N-terminal motor domain are associated with hereditary spastic paraparesis and CMT2. Missense mutations within this latter domain have been shown to affect microtubule binding and/or ATP hydrolysis, resulting in a defective KIF5A-mediated anterograde transport of cargo along dendrites and axons. This, in turn, leads to the axonal retrograde degeneration observed both in hereditary spastic paraparesis and CMT2, two length-dependent axonopathies (Ebbing et al., 2008) . In contrast, the primary cellular lesion in ALS is believed to occur within motor neuron cell bodies, where cytoplasmic protein aggregates are consistently observed, and to propagate anterogradely along neurites. We anticipate that LOF variants within the C-terminal domain of KIF5A will disrupt binding with specific cargo proteins. This is supported by a study in zebrafish in which truncation of the C terminus resulted in a dramatic disruption of axonal localization of mitochondria (Campbell et al., 2014) . One possible mechanism is that disruption of binding to cargo may possibly lead to their accumulation and seed aggregation within the cell body, resulting in a deficiency at neurite terminals. Deficiency in KIF5A expression and cargo binding has been associated with accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilaments and amyloid precursor protein within neuronal cell bodies, and subsequent neurodegeneration, in patients with multiple sclerosis (Hares et al., 2017) . While differences in KIF5A kinetics and KIF5A interactions constitute one possibility to explain the phenotypic heterogeneity, it is also possible C-terminal and N-terminal variants act through a common mechanism, but that a difference in the relative extent of loss-or gain-of-function toxicities leads to milder (i.e., hereditary spastic paraplegia or CMT2) or more severe (i.e., ALS) phenotypes."}, {"section_title": "STAR+METHODS", "text": "Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: Causative mutations for SPG10 and CMT2 described within the literature (Crimella et al., 2012; Jennings et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2002) and ALS-associated mutations identified within this study are shown. As illustrated, mutations causative for SPG10/CMT2 are predominantly missense changes located in the N-terminal motor domain. In contrast, ALS mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal motor domain and are LOF. The double asterisk denotes the risk variant identified through the GWAS.

ALS WXS/WGS replication cohort Replication analyses included sequencing data for a further 9,046 ALS cases and 1,955 non-ALS controls that were not also represented in the FALS discovery set. These samples included 2,742 cases subjected to WXS by the ALS Sequencing Consortium, as described previously (Cirulli et al., 2015) ; 719 cases subjected to WXS by the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging; 307 cases and 296 controls subjected to WGS by the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging; 155 cases subjected to WGS by the CReATe Consortium; 1,017 cases subjected to WGS by the NYGC ALS Consortium, Genomic Translation for ALS Care (GTAC) Consortium and Answer ALS Foundation; and 4,100 cases and 1,659 controls subjected to WGS by the Project MinE Sequencing Consortium.\nAll samples included in the case cohort had been diagnosed with ALS according to the El Escorial criteria (Brooks, 1994) by a neurologist specializing in ALS.

These SNP genotyping arrays assay 716,503 SNPs across the genome. Individual-level genotypes for these samples are available on the dbGaP web portal (accession number phs000101.v4.p1). The remainder of the control cohort had been previously genotyped on HumanOmni BeadChips (Illumina) as part of other GWAS efforts (Table S2) . Analyses were confined to the 595,692 autosomal SNPs that were common across the SNP genotyping arrays.\nGeneration of FALS case-control callset for exome-wide RVB discovery analysis Exome sequencing of cases was performed as previously described (Kenna et al., 2016) . Control exome sequences were generated as described under the relevant dbGAP and EGA project accessions. Sequence reads were aligned to human reference GRCh37 using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) and processed according to recommended Genome Analysis Toolkit's (GATK) best practices (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/). Joint variant detection and genotyping of all samples were performed using the GATK HaplotypeCaller. Variant quality control was performed using the GATK variant quality score recalibration method with default filters. A minimum variant quality by depth (QD) score of 2 was also imposed and all genotypes associated with genotype quality (GQ)< 20 were reset to missing. Variants were also excluded in the event of case or control call rates < 70% (post genotype QC). Identified variants can be viewed through our web based ALS Variant Server (see link below). Generation of ALS case-control callset for KIF5A replication analysis Data for the KIF5A locus was extracted from all independently generated sequencing datasets and remapped to GRCh37. Variant calling was performed using the GATK haplotype caller as described above. In addition to the KIF5A locus, data was also extracted for a panel of 240,715 common variant sites and used to perform a single unified sample QC as described below."}, {"section_title": "Functional annotation of variants identified by WXS/WGS", "text": "Variant calls were assigned predicted functional consequences using snpEFF (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Effect) (Cingolani et al., 2012) , dbNSFP (A Database of Human Non-synonymous SNVs and Their Functional Predictions and Annotations) (Liu et al., 2013) and dbscSNV (database of splice site consequences of Single Nucleotide Variants) (Jian et al., 2014) , which is incorporated into dbNSFP. Variants were classified as ''loss of function'' (LOF) where the sequence change was predicted to encode a premature stop codon, a frameshift causing insertion-deletion or a splice site disrupting SNV. Variants were classified as potentially splice altering if assigned an ''ada'' or ''rf'' score > 0.7 by dbscSNV. Splice variants of potential interest were further assessed for putative effects on exon skipping using a secondary algorithm -automated splice site and exon definition server (ASSEDA) (Tompson et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "RT-PCR Analysis", "text": "Total RNA was prepared from lymphoblast lines using Trizol reagent.

We excluded samples that demonstrated: call rates of less than 97.5%; non-European ancestry; abnormal F inbreeding coefficient; mismatch between phenotypic and genotypic gender; or, cryptic relatedness defined as identity-by-descent proportion of inheritance (pi_hat from PLINK) greater than 0.125. Samples in common between our study and van Rheenen's study were identified using the checksum program id_geno_checksum and were removed from our analyses. We excluded palindromic SNPs, as well as SNPs with: call rates less than 95% in the US and Italian cohorts or less than 99% in the UK, French and Belgium cohorts; minor allele frequency less than 0.05 in the control cohorts; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P less than 10 \u00c07 in the US and Italian control cohorts and less than 10 \u00c05 in the UK, French and Belgium cohorts; missingness by case-control status P less than 10 \u00c05 ; or SNPs associated between the UK and French control cohorts with P less than 5.0x10 \u00c08 . After quality control, 8,229 case and 36,329 control samples were included in the analysis, and 436,746 SNPs were available for imputation in the USA and Italy cohorts, and 420,131 SNPs were available in the UK, French and Belgium cohorts. Estimation of the haplotypes was performed with SHAPEIT (version 2.r790) (Delaneau et al., 2013) . Imputation was performed for individual batches based on ethnicity using the 1000 Genomes Project dataset (phase 3, version 5a, release 2013-05-02, http://www. internationalgenome.org/) as reference and using Minimac3 software (version 1.0.11) (Das et al., 2016) with default settings. After imputation, principal components were calculated using PLINK software after removing known hypervariable regions and the 1 MB surrounding the C9orf72 region. After analysis of the Scree plots, 2 to 4 principal components were retained per cohort as covariates in the association analyses to compensate for any residual population stratification.\nLogistic regression was performed per batch using mach2dat software (version 1.0.24) (Marchini and Howie, 2010) incorporating 2 to 4 principal components, age and gender as covariates, with dosage of imputed SNPs selected based on a Minimac3 R 2 value of imputation accuracy greater than 0.3. SNPs with an absolute beta coefficient value above 5 or with a minor allele frequency less than 0.01 were excluded from meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was then performed combining the association results of the 13 batches of our individual-level studies with van Rheenen's study summary statistics using METAL software (version 2011-03-25) (Willer et al., 2010) under an inverse-weighted, fixed effect model. A threshold P of 5.0 3 10 \u00c08 was set for genome-wide significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing in the GWAS (Pe'er et al., 2008) .\nThe programming code used to analyze these data is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/AudeDN/ALS_GWAS_ 1000G_mach2dat_2017), and GWAS summary statistics results for all tested SNPs are available from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000101.v4.p1. Analysis of WXS/WGS genotypes For both the discovery and replication phases, samples were excluded from the study in the event of failing to meet standard genotype call rate, heterozygosity, duplication, relatedness or population stratification filters as summarized in Table S6 . Each of these filters was performed using a set of autosomal markers meeting all of the following criteria: call rate > 0.95, minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, p > 0.001 for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium pruning (R 2 < 0.5, window size = 50, step = 5). Filtering of autosomal markers, sample call rate assessments and sample heterozygosity assessments were performed using PLINK software. Study duplicates and sample relatedness within the WXS/WGS cohorts was identified using KING software (Manichaikul et al., 2010) . Study duplicates between WXS/WGS cohorts and GWAS datasets were identified using the checksum program id_geno_checksum. LASER was used to generate PCA coordinates for samples from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). Samples from the FALS discovery cohort were then mapped to this reference co-ordinate space. The discovery cohort was restricted to cases and controls occurring within 3 standard deviations of the mean for European HGDP samples along principal components 1-4. RVB analyses were performed by penalized logistic regression of case-control status with respect to number of minor alleles observed per sample per gene with and MAF < 0.001. Analyses were only performed where the dataset contained more than 3 variant allele occurrences. Replication analyses of rs113247976 were performed using the same logistic regression protocol as used for RVB analyses. All analyses were conditioned on the first 4 eigenvectors generated by principal components analysis of common variant profiles. Genomic inflation factors were calculated using genome-wide association analysis for quantitative, binary and time-tillevent traits using GenABEL software. Candidate associations were tested for signs of call-rate or subcohort biases as outlined in Figures S6 and S7 . Meta-analysis of rs113247976 association results between sequencing and GWAS was performed using METAL.
