Previous studies demonstrated the diverse roles of APOE \u03b54 allele in cognitive abilities dependent on different ages. In young populations, the APOE \u03b54 allele has a beneficial effect on learning and memory ability. However, the APOE \u03b54 allele is also associated with the decline of learning and memory ability in old subjects (Han and Bondi, 2008; Caselli et al., 2009; Tuminello and Han, 2011) . These interesting findings have been conceptualized as the APOE antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis (Han and Bondi, 2008; Caselli et al., 2009; Tuminello and Han, 2011) .\nThe hippocampus is critical for episodic memory function and its size is considered as an index of the degree of cognitive decline (Kilpatrick et al., 1997; Eldridge et al., 2000; Ystad et al., 2009) . A previous study also showed that the APOE \u03b54 allele contributes to the reduction of hippocampal volume in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Khan et al., 2017) . Additionally, APOE \u03b54 was found to reduce hippocampal volumes and impair episodic memory in a dose-dependent manner (APOE \u03b54 homozygous > APOE \u03b54 heterozygous > APOE \u03b54 noncarriers) (Liu et al., 2016) . A recent study revealed that hippocampal volume was positively associated with episodic memory in cognitively normal old individuals with APOE \u03b54 homozygotes (Lim et al., 2017) . However, it is unknown whether the APOE \u03b54 allele also has antagonistic pleiotropic effects on the association of hippocampal volumes with episodic memory across the AD continuum. Our primary goal was to examine whether the APOE \u03b54 allele modulates the relationship between hippocampal volumes and verbal memory in subjects with NC, MCI, and mild AD from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Demographic and imaging data used in the preparation of this study were extracted from the ADNI database 1 in January 2017.

More specifically, the association between HpVR and delayed recall was stronger in APOE \u03b54 carriers compared to non-carriers. Figure 1C shows that APOE \u03b54 carriers outperform non-carriers on delayed recall memory among subjects with large HpVR (right side of the x-axis) but this advantage gradually disappears and reverses to confer memory deficits among subjects with moderate to small HpVR (left side of the x-axis). However, the association of the APOE4 * HpVR interaction with delayed recall scores in the MCI group did not survive FDR correction (p = 0.096).

Our study found an interesting fact that, depending on different hippocampal volumes, the APOE \u03b54 allele asserts different effects on delayed recall. Our data suggested that the deleterious effect of APOE \u03b54 on delayed recall altered by HpVR such that this effect was most evident among aMCI patients with small to moderate HpVR, but this disadvantage was absent or even reversed among aMCI patients with larger HpVR, indicating the dual effects of APOE \u03b54 on the association of delayed recall memory and hippocampal volumes.\nAntagonistic pleiotropy (Williams, 1957) posits that certain genes or alleles may affect fitness (for instance, survival, and reproduction) differentially at different ages. Recently, the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of APOE has been proposed by some researchers based on findings that the impact of the APOE \u03b54 allele on cognitive functioning, episodic memory in particular, may be beneficial at younger ages, while it appears detrimental in later life (Han and Bondi, 2008; Caselli et al., 2009; Tuminello and Han, 2011; Jochemsen et al., 2012) .

All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, MMSE scores, and diagnostic group (overall sample only).\nHowever, concomitant underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Increasing evidence suggested that APOE \u03b54 carriers may primarily recruit greater compensatory resources to maintain equivalent or superior levels of memory performance as APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. Nevertheless, once AD pathological burdens sufficiently accumulate, APOE\u03b54 carriers' compensatory recruitment will fail to sustain memory performance and memory decline ensues (Han and Bondi, 2008) . For instance, one study using fMRI techniques suggested that APOE \u03b54 carriers, in non-demented older people, showed greater activation in the hippocampus and other brain regions during the encoding portion of a memory task, providing evidence for APOE\u03b54 carriers' compensatory recruitment. In other words, APOE \u03b54 carriers may more greatly activate memory-related brain regions to sustain the same or better level of cognitive performance as APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. Dickerson et al. (2005) also reported findings supportive of APOE\u03b54 carriers' compensatory recruitment in three diagnostic groups, including cognitively normal older people and patients with MCI or AD. They found that APOE\u03b54 carriers, irrespective of diagnosis, showed increased hippocampal activity during the encoding portion of a face-name task.\nSimilarly, a more recent study suggested that APOE\u03b54 carriers recruited additional neural resources to successfully complete a challenging working memory task (Scheller et al., 2017) . However, once the compensatory recruitment of neural resources fails, memory may begin to decline (Han and Bondi, 2008; Tuminello and Han, 2011) . Most cross-sectional studies have supported the idea that APOE \u03b54 carriers in older people performed more poorly than non-carriers in episodic memory tasks (Honea et al., 2009; Adamson et al., 2010; Kukolja et al., 2010) , while not universally the case (Welsh-Bohmer et al., 2009) . Furthermore, one important study by Caselli et al. (2009) longitudinally followed individuals ranging from 21 to 97 years of age. They found that memory decline in APOE\u03b54 carriers started before 60 years of age and showed a steeper rate of memory decline compared to non-carriers, indicating that the detrimental effects of APOE \u03b54 on episodic memory may become evident around the age of 60 years. Similarly, based on our findings ( Figure 1C) , APOE \u03b54 carriers in the aMCI group, despite similar hippocampal volumes, outperformed non-carriers on episodic memory among subjects with large HpVR (HpVR > approximately 5.2, referring to the compensatory recruitment state). Once AD pathological burdens sufficiently accrue (such as hippocampal atrophy), this APOE \u03b54 advantage was not evident and gradually reversed to confer memory deficits among subjects with moderate to small HpVR (HpVR < approximately 5.2, referring to the failure of compensatory recruitment). Our data indicated that APOE \u03b54 carriers as an at-risk population for AD may benefit from drug or non-drug interventions that are tailored to the levels of hippocampal atrophy. After acquisition of APOE \u03b54 genotype and hippocampal volume data, APOE \u03b54 carriers could be further targeted by some interventions to maintain memory performance at this paramount turning point. Our findings have several important implications. The dual effects of APOE \u03b54 on the association of delayed recall memory with hippocampal volumes are clinically critical because delayed recall memory is used to diagnose aMCI and AD dementia (Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014) and norms of episodic memory tests are currently not APOE \u03b54-adjusted. Therefore, this may lead to some misdiagnoses if we do not take APOE \u03b54 status into consideration. For instance, due to our findings ( Figure 1C) , a true aMCI diagnosis may be more likely to be delayed in APOE \u03b54 carriers than non-carriers in individuals with HpVR > approximately 5.2, because beneficial effects of APOE \u03b54 on episodic memory in these subjects may mask underlying AD neuropathology, particularly in the earlier stages of disease.\nThere are several potential limitations in the present study. First, the cross-sectional design prevents us from determining temporality in the association between episodic memory and HpVR. In this cross-section analysis, we also could not measure rates of memory decline in APOE \u03b54 carriers vs. non-carriers. Longitudinal studies are needed to more accurately test the hypothesis that APOE \u03b54 status may modulate the relationship between hippocampus volumes and episodic memory. Second, the APOE antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis proposes that the APOE \u03b54 allele is linked to better cognitive functioning in young adulthood and then it reverses to confer cognitive deficits in older age. However, in the current study, the lack of younger people limits our test of the APOE antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis. Third, the HpVR by APOE \u03b54 interaction for memory testing was not significant in the control or in the AD dementia group. One potential explanation may be due to the fact that the variability of memory scores and hippocampal volumes may be low in controls, and memory scores and hippocampal volumes may have reached a plateau in AD patients. Finally, after FDR correction, a marginally significant two-way APOE \u03b54 * HpVR interaction for delayed recall in MCI subjects was observed (p = 0.096), and thus this finding requires replication.\nIn summary, our study highlights the potential role of APOE \u03b54 in affecting the relationship between hippocampus volumes and delayed recall memory in MCI patients."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY", "text": "Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
