[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease, not only affects periarticular tissue but also damages body systems including the skin, lungs, heart, and blood vessels (McInnes and Schett, 2011; Scott et al., 2010) . The global prevalence of RA is approximately 0.5%-1.1% (Alamanos et al., 2005) . Studies have indicated that inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) (Chakraborty et al., 2010; Hein and O'Banion, 2009; Lynch and Mills, 2012) . The serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1, transforming growth factor-beta, IL-12, and IL-18, are elevated in patients with AD (Swardfager et al., 2010) . A systemic review and meta-analysis indicated a significantly increased risk of dementia inpatients with RA (Ungprasert et al., 2016) .\nRA is typically treated with two types of anti-inflammatory agents: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Kawai, 2003) . NSAIDs are effective at controlling joint pain and swelling but are not effective at preventing structural damage, and various adverse events following the long-term use of NSAIDs are very common in RA (Negrei et al., 2016) . DMARDs are categorized into conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) and biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and can influence the pathogenic mechanisms of RA and slow disease progression, structural damage, and disability (Mottonen et al., 1999; Negrei et al., 2016; Yazici, 2009) .\nIn Taiwan, several csDMARDs are available for RA patients including azathioprine, cyclosporine [CS] , hydroxychloroquine [HCQ] , leflunomide, methotrexate [MTX] , and sulfasalazine. MTX is the gold standard medicine for over 25 years in treating RA patients (Negrei et al., 2016) . Leflunomide should not be used in pregnant women to prevent infant deformity (Negrei et al., 2016) . Although sulfasalazine is safe for pregnant women but breastfeeding should be avoided (Negrei et al., 2016) . Finally, HCQ is usually combined with other DMARDs such as MTX and sulfasalazine to treat RA patients (Negrei et al., 2016) .\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging examined 1, 686 participants, and showed a significantly lower risk of AD among NSAIDs users (Stewart et al., 1997) ; a clinical trial similarly confirmed that cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor use can protect mild to moderately impaired patients with AD (Rogers et al., 1993) . In addition, Pittoni et al. (2002) demonstrated that the infliximab of bDMARDs downregulates the serum concentration of IL-18 rapidly and persistently in patients with RA, while Zivojinovic et al. (2012) determined that etanercept reduces the serum concentration of IL-6 in patients with RA. A cohort-based Markov model study in South Korea indicated that treatment initiated with etanercept in patients with RA was more cost-effective than that initiated with leflunomide (Park et al., 2016) . Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al. (2016) showed that DMARDs can effectively reduce the mortality of patients with RA. Moreover, a recent observational study reported that prolonged NSAID use reduces the risk of dementia in patients with RA (Chang et al., 2016) . Similar to NSAIDs, DMARDs are commonly used to treat RA today; however, studies investigating the relationship between DMARDs and the risk of dementia in patients with RA are lacking. Therefore, in this case-control study, we evaluated the association between DMARDs and the risk of dementia in patients with RA."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program, which was initiated in 1995, covers > 99% of the 23.74 million people in Taiwan (Cheng et al., 2012) . The current data were derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which was established by the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). The NHIRD contains the registration files and medical claims data of all NHI enrollees, and previous studies have indicated that the database is accurate and highly valid (Cheng et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2014) . Another prior study reported a higher positive predictive value of approximately 93.2% for overall dementia diagnoses by using national hospital discharge register data (van de Vorst et al., 2015) . In the present study, patients' diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The Registry of Catastrophic Illness Patient Database (RCIPD) was also used to confirm the diagnoses of patients with RA. In Taiwan, rheumatologists can apply for a catastrophic illness card for patients with RA who meet four or more diagnostic criteria based on the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria (Chung et al., 2014) . Notably, patients with RA who have catastrophic illness cards are exempt from making copayments when seeking medical services.

Within this cohort, those who developed dementia (ICD-9-CM codes 290, 294.1, and 3310) were also categorized into the dementia group. By contrast, patients with RA who did not have dementia formed the control group; both groups were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to a propensity score. The score was estimated using logistic regression, which considered age, sex, index date of dementia diagnosis, and comorbidities, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, head injury, depression, stroke, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

No significant difference was observed on the use of NSAIDs and bDMARDs in both groups. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed based on the preexisting comorbidities of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, COPD, coronary artery disease, head injury, depression, stroke, and ESRD between the dementia and control groups (all P > 0.05) ( Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Association of risk of dementia with DMARDs and covariates", "text": "The risk of dementia was 1.63-fold higher (OR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.33-2.00) in patients with RA patients who used csDMARDs than in those who did not use csDMARDs. Conversely, no significant risk of dementia was observed in patients with RA who used NSAIDs or bDMARDs, or who were also diagnosed with a baseline comorbidity, compared with their counterparts (Table 2) . Table 3 presents a list of the ORs of dementia associated with cumulative exposure days to csDMARDs. Specifically, patients who used csDMARDs had significantly higher ORs than those who did not use DMARDs, regardless of the number of exposure days to csDMARDs. For example, patients who used HCQ for < 305 and \u2265305 days respectively exhibited 1.67-fold (95% CI = 1.21-2.30) and 1.91-fold (95% CI = 1.39-2.64) higher risks of dementiathan those who did not use DMARDs. Patients who used leflunomide for < 240 days exhibited a 2.93-fold (95% CI = 1.67-5.75) higher risk of dementia than those who did not use DMARDs, whereas patients who used MTX for < 395 and \u2265 395 days respectively exhibited 1.70-fold (95% CI = 1.19-2.24) and 1.58-fold (95% CI = 1.20-2.07) higher risks of dementia than those who did not use DMARDs.

The use of csDMARDs did not show significant association with Alzheimer's dementia (Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Dementia is a global health priority because of its high economic cost, which was approximately US$604 billion worldwide in 2010 ; the disease also substantially affects both patients and their families (Wortmann, 2012) . The prevalence of dementia has rapidly increased every year and expected to approximately double every 20 years since 2010 . Our study is the first to investigate the association between DMARD use and the risk of dementia in patients with RA. We found that the risk of dementia was 1.63-fold higher in patients with RA who used csDMARDs than in those who did not use csDMARDs. We also evaluated the cumulative exposure days and joint effect of csDMARDs on the risk of dementia in patients with RA. Furthermore, we found that use of csDMARDs was significantly associated with vascular dementia (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.21-2.61). Wernick and Smith (1989) found that central nervous system toxicity is more common in patients with RA who are older and who use MTX, particularly among those whose RA is comorbid with renal insufficiency. Our study indicated that the risk of dementia was significantly higher in patients with RA who use MTX than in those who do not use DMARDs, irrespective of exposure days. We reviewed the literature to identify the possible mechanisms of MTX-induced dementia. The first possible mechanism is folic acid depletion (Ramos et al., 2005) , because MTX is an antagonist of folic acid (Cutolo et al., 2001 ); one review article reported an association between folate deficiency and AD (Hinterberger and Fischer, 2013) . The second possible mechanism is that MTX influences learning and memory functions by altering hippocampal brain amine levels (Madhyastha et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 1999) , for which several studies have demonstrated a correlation (Clayton and Williams, 2000; El-Ghundi et al., 1999; Izquierdo et al., 1998; Kobayashi et al., 2000; Madhyastha et al., 2002; Vitiello et al., 1997) . Finally, MTX may block gene polymorphisms in DNA and RNA, such as MTHFR 677CC, GGH 401TT, and CT genotypes (Negrei et al., 2016; Swierkot et al., 2015) . One case report also described similar neurological toxicities such as flaccid hemiparesis, dementia, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9-like syndrome in three renal transplant patients treated with CS (Palmer and Toto, 1991) . In CS-induced dementia, CS inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and leading to energy failure, cell necrosis, and neurological diseases such as AD, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; these dysfunctions occur because, as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria plays a crucial role in generating the ATP necessary for cellular function (Norenberg and Rao, 2007) . In the present study, the use of another csDMARD, HCQ, was associated with a significantly higher risk of dementia (OR = 1.67-1.91) in patients with RA than in those who did not use DMARDs. Moreover, two studies (Sampson et al., 2016; Wekerle, 2016) have indicated that the gut-brain connection might be a possible mechanism of dementia induced by csDMARDs such as HCQ, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and azathioprine. A broad-scale prospective clinical trial should be conducted to discuss how the gut-brain connection leads to dementia in patients with RA who are treated with csDMARDs.\nAzathioprine and cyclosporine were not correlated with dementia in our study. Azathioprine or cyclosporine may be used alone to treat RA patients without combination with other csDMARDs, therefore, risk of dementia was not significant.\nJoensuu et al. noted that bDMARDs cost more than do csDMARDs, but found no significant difference in their effectiveness (Joensuu et al., (Tobinick et al., 2006) . Pittoni et al. (2002) and Zivojinovic et al. (2012) ) also determined that bDMARDs can reduce inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with RA. In the present study, patients with RA who used bDMARDs were shown to have a lower risk of dementia (OR = 0.71) despite the finding of no statistical significance. This result is very interesting, because anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents are large molecules and thus cannot cross the blood-brain barrier when subcutaneously injected for dementia treatment (Banks et al., 1995) . According to NHIA regulations in Taiwan (National Health Insurance Administration, 2015), rheumatologists should first prescribe csDMARDs to treat patients with RA, followed by bDMARDs if treatment with csDMARDs fails. One nationwide cohort study comparing a RA cohort with a non-RA cohort showed a lower risk of dementia among those who used NSAIDs (Chang et al., 2016) which is in conflicts with our findings. This discrepancy can be attributed to the diversity of patients in the present study. Our case-control study also reported no significant risk of dementia in patients with RA who had any comorbidity, because controls were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to the propensity score.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the database does not contain the score of scales such as the MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and SIB, and we therefore could not evaluate any improvement in our patients. Second, the score of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale is not available in the database (Tan et al., 2016) . Hence, we could not ensure high medication adherence in our patients. Nevertheless, the strength of our study is that the NHI program is universal and mandatory in Taiwan. Moreover, NHI beneficiaries are assigned personal identification numbers, which enabled us to trace the detailed medication use of study patients throughout the follow-up period. Overall, studies on the cumulative effect of DMARDs in patients with RA who also have dementia are lacking, on which this present study has focused."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Patients with RA who use csDMARDs were significantly associated with dementia especially vascular dementia than those who do not use csDMARD, regardless of the cumulative exposure days to csDMARDs. Our findings highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary team for treating patients with RA. It is recommended that the Ministry of Health and Welfare targets patients with RA treated with csDMARDs by establishing a suitable medical plan for preventing dementia development and reducing unnecessary medical costs."}]
