Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score \u054527 or memory z score\u0545\u22121.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype.\nRESULTS Among 2908 persons with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [12.8] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4% [95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% [95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was not associated with low MMSE scores (mean difference, 3% [95% CI, \u22121% to 6%], P = .16).

Understanding the association between amyloid pathology and cognitive functioning is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of AD-prevention trials.\nLongitudinal cohort studies [4] [5] [6] have revealed an association between the presence of amyloid pathology and long-term cognitive decline.

However, a low cognitive score had limited value as a screening measure for early AD. The association between amyloid pathology and cognition existed independent of sex, educational level, and APOE genotype, but these factors contributed to individual estimates of cognitive level. We further observed 10-to 15-year intervals between the onset of amyloid positivity and emergence of low memory scores in persons with normal cognition and between the agerelated increase in low memory scores and prevalence of ADtype dementia. Of note, the proportion of low memory scores in amyloidpositive participants with normal cognition increased rapidly after the age of 70 years. Possible explanations for this age association are that more extensive amounts of amyloid deposition are needed before becoming clinically manifest, that other pathology is also present after this age, or that cognitive vulnerability to amyloid pathology may be higher at older age. This finding agrees with a recent population-based study 13 in cognitively normal individuals aged 50 to 69 years in which amyloid-PET levels were unrelated to cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of episodic memory. Previous contrasting findings from cross-sectional studies 4, 7, 8 that examined the amyloid-cognition association may therefore, in addition to the previously identified task complexity, 14 be explained by age of the individuals in the study sample.\nWe found no association of amyloid pathology with low MMSE score in participants with normal cognition. This result contrasts with a meta-analysis of biomarker and neuropathologic studies.\n11 However, that meta-analysis also included global cognition tests that have a larger memory component than the MMSE. In patients with MCI, amyloid-positive patients had (depending on age) low memory and MMSE scores 5% to 20% more often than amyloid-negative patients. Unlike in participants with normal cognition, frequencies of low cognitive scores in amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative patients were more similar at older ages in patients with MCI. This finding is in line with a study in persons with dementia, 15 suggesting that neuropathologic changes other than amyloid may contribute to cognitive impairment at more advanced age in patients with MCI but not in persons with normal cognition. Sex and amyloid pathology independently predicted cognitive performance, suggesting that amyloid-related cognitive decline is equally prevalent in men and women, as has also been suggested in a large cross-sectional study 16 of cognitively normal individuals from the general population not included in our study. High educational level was also associated with fewer cognitive deficiencies independent of amyloid status. This finding is consistent with earlier studies 17, 18 showing that cognitive reserve helps to preserve cognition in pathologic conditions and aging. Our study suggests that a high educational level does not counteract the effect of amyloid pathology on cognition but instead delays its expression, which agrees with earlier studies."}, {"section_title": "19,20", "text": "Each APOE-\u03b54 allele increased the risk of low cognitive performance independent of amyloid status.

[22] [23] [24] Remarkably, our results indicate that the APOE genotype was also associated with cognitive performance in amyloid-negative participants.

Therefore, these findings are important for the design of secondary AD prevention trials. Because amyloid positivity has become a requirement for enrollment in many AD prevention trials, cognitive testing would be an inexpensive and noninvasive alternative to screen for amyloid positivity. Our study showed that a low cognitive score for screening of amyloid positivity had only limited utility. Cognitive screening efficiency may be improved by more sensitive neuropsychological tests or test norms based on cognitively normal persons without amyloid pathology. The latter is supported by our finding that amyloid pathology appeared to explain a substantial part of the socalled age-related memory decline (Figure 3) .

There were several sources of variance among the pooled studies, including differences in amyloid assessment methods, participant selection, and other aspects of study design. However, the association of these differences with amyloid positivity was modest, 1 and the association of amyloid status with cognitive performance was independent of biomarker modality. Furthermore, the type of memory test differed across studies but did not affect the association between amyloid and cognitive performance. Another potential limitation is that amyloid pathology might be associated with decline in other cognitive domains, such as executive functioning, 8,11 that were not assessed in this study. Furthermore, the power to detect an association between amyloid positivity and MMSE score in participants with normal cognition was limited by the restricted range of MMSE scores in this group. In addition, because our findings were based on research or memory clinic populations, results may not be generalizable to the overall population or other settings.
