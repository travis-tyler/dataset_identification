Introduction U.S. beef cow-calf operations vary in size, available resources, profitability, and the use of technology. Census of Agriculture data (USDA 2017) indicate there were close to 730,000 operations with beef cows in the U.S in 2017, with 36 percent of all farms having beef cows. 1 Many were part-time, as evidenced by about 80% of these farms having fewer than 50 cows. Opportunities remain to improve management practices, both production and financial, in many cow-calf operations in major cow-calf states. Census of Agriculture data (2017) indicate that beef cow numbers, while leveling off in recent years, have remained robust over time, climbing 9.3 percent since 2012 to 31.7 million cows in 2017. And, while the number of farms having beef cows remained relatively flat at about 730,000 in 2017 compared to 2012, consolidation continues. The percentage of farms with 50 or more cows grew 18% between 2012 and 2017 to over 150,000 farms, and the percentage of cows on such farms was 73% in 2017 compared to 70% in 2012. Census of Agriculture data (2017) also indicate that growth in beef cow numbers occurred in all of the top ten beef cow states: Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Montana, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Iowa."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "This study uses data from the 2018 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) cattle and calves version, conducted by the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service and Economic Research Service. For 2018, this dataset provides 2,201 usable responses, including 114 backgrounding cow-calf operations. The ARMS collects information on farm type, size, and structure; income and expenses; farm and household characteristics; and production practices; and farm and household characteristics. Because ARMS is a design-based survey using stratified sampling, weights or expansion factors are included for each observation to extend results to the cow-calf farm population of the largest U.S. cow-calf states, representing 90% of U.S. cow-calf production. A parametric translog input distance function approach using stochastic production frontier (SPF) methods is used to estimate productivity, returns to scale (RTS), and technical efficiency (TE). Potential endogeneity of inputs is controlled for via instrumental variables. Six combinations of size and backgrounding status are compared in this study. We test for self-selection into backgrounding. In addition to comparing RTS and TE measures among the categories, we also compare farm profitability measures such as farm net return on assets and household return on assets, as well as adoption rates of technologies and management practices among the six size / system categories."}, {"section_title": "Characterizing Beef-Cow Farm Production Technology", "text": "The input distance function used in this study is denoted as D I (X,Y,R), where X refers to inputs, Y to outputs, and R to other farm efficiency determinants. Two outputs are included in our model: YCOW = value of cow-calf production and YOTH = value of production of all other livestock and crops on the farm. Inputs include expenses associated with: XLAB = labor; XCAP = capital; and XMISC = miscellaneous including fuel, fertilizer, and feed. Variable XLAND = land, where differences in land characteristics are accounted for using state-level quality-adjusted values for the U.S. as estimated in Ball et al. (2008)."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of D I (X,Y,R) requires imposing linear homogeneity in input levels (F\u00e4re and", "text": "Primont 1995), accomplished through normalization (Lovell et al. 1994):  where i denotes farm; t the time period; k,l the outputs; m,n the inputs; and q,r the R variables. In our analysis, X1 is land, resulting in the function being specified on a per-acre basis. Structural R variables include soil texture (TEXT), water-holding capacity of the soil (WATHCA), the population accessibility of the farm (POP), and whether the farm is classified as backgrounding stock (STOCKBG). Marginal productive contributions (MPC) are estimated by the first order elasticities: for outputs MPCm = -\uf065DI,Ym = -\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln Ym = \uf065X1,Ym, and for inputs MPCk = -\uf065DI,X*m = -\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln X*k = \uf065X1,X*k. MPCm represents an increase in input use when output expands, and is expected to be positive like an output elasticity or marginal cost measure. MPCk represents the shadow value of the k th input relative to X1 (Fare and Primont 1995), and is expected to be negative like the slope of an isoquant. The scale elasticity SE = -\uf065DI,Y = -\uf053m\uf0b6ln D I (X,Y,R)/\uf0b6ln Ym = \uf065X1,Y provides a measure of scale economies (SE). SE<1 indicates increasing RTS. TE \"scores\" are estimated as TE = exp(-uit)."}, {"section_title": "Selection Bias", "text": "Bias associated with selecting to background calves versus not background may be of concern for SPF estimation. Because backgrounding producers self-select into backgrounding, their productivity may have differed from that of non-backgrounding farmers regardless of whether or not they had chosen to background. Greene (2010) provides an approach for testing for selectivity bias in nonlinear SPFs, and correcting for it so that it does not bias SPF estimation. We use this procedure and refer the interested reader to Greene (2010) for more information."}, {"section_title": "Factors Impacting Technical Efficiency", "text": "The impacts of producer and farm characteristics on TE can be measured as \"inefficiency effects\" on uit. Assumed to be independently distributed, inefficiency effects uit arise by truncation (at zero) of the exponential distribution with mean \uf06dit, and variance \u03c3 2 . The parametric SPF approach, introduced by Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977), was modified by Battese and Coelli (1995) to specify stochastic frontiers for TE effects and simultaneously estimate all parameters involved. For the present study, the treatment effects test conducted in LIMDEP was statistically conclusive, so we use LIMDEP to estimate drivers for TE without treatment effect bias in the second-stage estimation procedure rather than follow the model described in Battese and Coelli (1995). To achieve a feasible solution for the treatment effects model, it was necessary to filter the original sample of 2,021 cow-calf operations that had 40 or more cows, and to filter out all observations in New Mexico. Our frontier estimates in LIMDEP used 1,581 observations on 1,581 (See Econometric Software, Inc. LIMDEP, Version 8.0). Potential inefficiency drivers included in the model are whether the operator used rotational grazing (ROTATE); the operator's age (AGE); the operator's education (EDUC); the number of hours the operator worked off-farm (OPOFFFARM); the number of hours the spouse worked off-farm (SPOFFFARM); the degree of financial leverage measured as the debt-asset ratio (DEBT/ASSET); farm size as measured using a dummy variable, LARGE, indicating the farm had \u2265500 cows, with small and medium farms of <500 cows as the base; and regional discrete variables for the PACIFIC region, with the combined rest-of-the-U.S. serving as the base. Operator and spousal off-farm work may be endogenous to the system, resulting in these independent variables being correlated with the error term in the regression model. For U.S. beef-cow operations, off-farm operator and spousal work often provides a significant portion of farm household income, and may impact the amount of farm labor used and/or input efficiency. We use instrumental variables to predict operator and spousal off-farm labor."}, {"section_title": "Farm Categories and Measures for Comparison", "text": "We compare economic and productivity measures of six combinations of backgrounding status and farm size in this study. Backgrounding farms are broken into the following size categories: <175 cows, 175-499 cows, and \u2265500 cows. To ensure comparisons across similar sized farms, the non-backgrounding farms are broken into similar sized categories. These size categories allow for comparisons of farm efficiency measures as estimated from the SPF as well as additional financial, productivity, and economic measures by category. Because ARMS uses a complex sampling procedure and weights to represent the U.S. population of cow-calf farms, the delete-a-group Jackknife procedure is used in this study for statistical comparisons of means among categories (Dubman 2000). Production measures that are compared by farm size and system include the number of pasture acres used per cow, the use of artificial insemination, the use of a veterinarian, the use of embryo transplants, the use of a nutritionist, use of the Internet, and the testing of forage quality. Farm financial measures compared by system and farm size include farm net return on assets, household net return on assets, and farm debt-asset ratio, all of which are whole-farm and not limited to the beef-cow enterprise. Table 1 presents farm characteristics and economic measures by backgrounding status and farm size. The largest numbers of producers were in the smallest size categories for both backgrounding categories. The category representing the smallest number of farms is largescale backgrounding farms with \u2265500 cows, representing 1,911 farms. Non-backgrounding farms with <175 cows represented the largest percentage of total production, 33.5% of the total value of production, while backgrounding farms with <175 cows produced the least, 2.6% of the total value of production. The backgrounding and non-backgrounding groups <175 cow, 175-499, and >500 cow categories had similar numbers of cows per farm by system (96, 280, and 1,143 by size group for the backgrounding operations and 83, 286, and 1,108 for the nonbackgrounding group), thus making backgrounding versus non-backgrounding comparisons possible within those size categories. Of the six technologies and management systems chosen for examination, the largest differences in usage were generally by farm size, with larger-scale operations in either one or both backgrounding and non-backgrounding systems more heavily utilizing technologies. Table 2 shows SPF estimates. Of the 22 model coefficients, 19 are significant at P \u2264 0.10. The STOCKBG variable is significant and has a positive sign, meaning that the backgrounding system shifts the frontier upward. The rho is significant, suggesting there is selection bias associated with opting to operate a backgrounding cow-calf operation, and is corrected for in the analysis. The model-based TE estimate is 0.89 at the mean, indicating that the average farm can improve the efficiency of its input usage. The RTS estimate is 0.53 at the mean, indicating increasing RTS. Marginal productive contributions for inputs and outputs have the expected signs and all are significant at P \u2264 0.10 (Table 3)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Production and Technology Comparisons by Size Category", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Stochastic Frontier Results", "text": "Among the TE drivers shown in Table 4, operator age, operator education, rotational grazing, operator off-farm work, spouse off-farm work debt/asset ratio, large size of operation relative to smaller sizes, and the Pacific region are statistically significant at P \u2264 0.10. Operator age was positively associated with farm TE, consistent with experience increasing production efficiency. In contrast to Nehring et al. (2009), operator off-farm work increased farm TE, though spouse off-farm work decreased TE. This provides evidence of operator off-farm work providing access to resources to boost TE. Farms more financially leveraged in cow-calf production were more technically efficient than less leveraged farms. Large-sized cow-calf farms were more technically efficient than small-sized cow-calf farms. Farms in the Pacific region were more technically efficient than farms in the combined rest-of-the-U.S. Table 1 and examining SPF results by system and size, we find that RTS increased with size for both backgrounding and non-backgrounding farms. These results show evidence of improved productivity in the use of inputs as farms increase in size, both for backgrounding and non-backgrounding farms. Major differences in TE were not found by backgrounding status."}, {"section_title": "Referring back to", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparisons of Beef-cow Farm Costs and Profitability", "text": "Whole-farm financial measures provide further insight into profitability by system and farm size. Farm net return on assets progressively increased with increasingly larger farms for both backgrounding and non-backgrounding farms. Household return on assets showed an increase with increased farm size for backgrounding farms, but decreased with increased farm size for non-backgrounding farms. It is noteworthy that off-farm income on smaller backgrounding and non-backgrounding farms is higher than that for medium and larger backgrounding and non-backgrounding operations, reflecting the important role of off-farm income in many cowcalf regions (see Nehring et al 2009). Debt-asset ratio showed a significant increase from the smallest to the largest backgrounding size category, but the pattern for the non-backgrounding operations showed no difference by size. Land values as reported by respondents to the ARMS generally decreased with farm size, with the largest backgrounding beef cow operations farming the lowest-value land, and the smallest backgrounding operations farming the highestvalue land."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The U.S. cow-calf industry consists of a wide range of farm sizes and multiple production systems. Over 75% of U.S. cow-calf farms tend fewer than 175 cows and account for <35% of the value of production on beef cow operations, while <6% tend \u2265500 cows but account for >30% of the value of production. Two distinct production systems in the cow-calf industry include backgrounding and non-backgrounding production. This level of diversity among farms naturally leads to questions of competitiveness of farms by size and production system. Our estimated SPF included a backgrounding dummy variable and corrected for selection bias associated with backgrounding production, so major differences were not found in TE by backgrounding/non-backgrounding status. Average TE values by system and size category ranged from 0.88 to 0.89, which would not generally be considered a wide range. Nonetheless, a number of TE drivers were found, with large-sized farms more technically efficient than medium and small farms. And, older, more highly leveraged operators who worked more hours off-farm and used rotational grazing were more technically efficient. These results provide additional perspective to the literature on the drivers of TE in farming. Perhaps the more interesting results from the SPF analysis show returns to scale associated with cow-calf farming. Returns to scale for the smallest backgrounding and nonbackgrounding farms (175 to 500 cows) were 0.59 and 0.55, respectively, and for the >500 cow backgrounding and non-backgrounding categories, .85 and 0.89, respectively. This provides strong evidence of economies of size up to the largest size category examined in our study. Larger-scale operations were on average more profitable, as evidenced by whole-farm, enterprise costs and returns. Comparing across production systems for 2018, using wholefarm, household, and enterprise measures of profitability, backgrounding operations experienced greater profitability than non-backgrounding operations of similar sizes. While larger cow-calf operations are clearly mare scale and technically efficient, offfarm income makes smaller and medium operations competitive as reflected in competitive household income in both production systems and all size groups We suggest further research on production system competitiveness as new data become available through future ARMS and other surveys, and note that Nehring et al. 2009 found significant regional differences."}, {"section_title": "Footnote", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "The U.S. Census of Agriculture shows 729,046 operations with beef cows in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017.
