This brief focuses only on OECD member countries; thus, the analyses in this report do not include the Russian Federation and Cyprus. 2 PIAAC also included an assessment of problem solving in technology-rich environments, a domain that measured adults' ability to interact with information communication technologies. Only those PIAAC respondents who took the assessment on a computer participated in this domain. In order to keep a consistent sample of respondents across domains, this brief does not include a discussion of problem solving in technology-rich environments and focuses instead only on literacy and numeracy. 3 For the detailed country sample size counts please refer to Chapter 14 of the OECD's PIAAC technical report at http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/_Technical%20Report_17OCT13.pdf. 4 In order to facilitate cross-national education comparisons, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) created the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED:97). The three education attainment categories used in this brief correspond to the following ISCED:97 levels: ISCED:97 2 and lower (Less than high school); ISCED:97 3 and 4a-b (High school, no associate' s degree); and ISCED:97 5a-b and 6 (Associate' s degree or above). 5 In this report, those who had started, but not finished college-as well as those who were currently attending college-are counted as having only a high school degree. Similarly, those who had at least an associate's degree could have an associate's, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D., or professional degrees.
