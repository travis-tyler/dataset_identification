Methods: Three-year longitudinal data from cognitively normal participants who underwent cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measurement and/or amyloid positron emission tomography in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, were analyzed. Comparisons between participants with and without amyloid b (Ab) accumulation, and between those with and without elevated tau levels tau among participants with Ab accumulation were performed. Results: Among 84 participants with available cerebrospinal fluid biomarker and/or amyloid positron emission tomography data, 19 (22.6%) exhibited Ab accumulation. The frequency of APOE \u03b54 alleles was significantly higher in participants with Ab accumulation. There were no significant differences in any of the cognitive tests at the baseline; however, participants with Ab accumulation exhibited a decline in clock drawing test (linear mixed-effects model, P 5 .008) and a tendency toward loss of practice effects in the Mini-Mental State Examination and the logical memory over time.\nAlthough it did not reach statistical significance, the analysis indicated a decline in measurements of executive function over time in participants with elevated tau levels compared with those with normal tau levels. Discussion: The frequency of preclinical AD in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative was lower than in similar studies because of the younger age of the participants and lower frequency of APOE \u03b54 carriage. Although limitations in sample size precluded definitive conclusions, the results suggest that even in the preclinical phase of AD, loss of practice effects in episodic memory tests and at a later stage, decline in executive function, are present.

During the preclinical AD phase, only pathophysiological changes of AD can be detected using biomarkers. Cognitive impairment, however, is virtually undetectable using conventional cognitive tests according to definition of preclinical AD. Therefore, to effectively design and successfully conduct clinical trials on preclinical AD, clinical and cognitive characteristics of preclinical AD in addition to biomarker profiles should be elucidated.\nTo date, a few previous studies have investigated longitudinal changes in clinical and cognitive profiles in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals with amyloid b (Ab) accumulation proven by biomarker data. Donohue et al. reported that CN individuals with Ab accumulation exhibited a tendency toward worse scores in the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum of boxes and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 4 years of follow-up [1] . On the other hand, the INSIGHT-preAD did not reveal any difference in scores of the MMSE and the CDR at 30 months of follow-up [2] .\nThe Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) was the first large-scale longitudinal observational study in Japan, conducted between 2008 and 2014, following the North American ADNI (NA-ADNI), to elucidate the natural history of the early stages of AD in the Japanese population. We recently reported that individuals with mild cognitive impairment or mild AD exhibited similar profiles of cognitive and functional decline in the J-ADNI and the NA-ADNI [3] . The J-ADNI also included a 3-year follow-up with intensive assessments of 154 CN individuals from a total of 537 participants between 60 and 84 years of age. In the present study, we investigated the frequency of preclinical AD in the Japanese population and performed analyses and comparisons of clinical and cognitive data from participants with and without Ab accumulation, to characterize demographics and longitudinal cognitive and functional decline in Japanese individuals with preclinical AD. This information is advantageous for the effective recruitment of individuals with preclinical AD and in developing cognitive outcome measures in clinical trials on preclinical AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Acquisition of the J-ADNI data and ethics approval", "text": "The entire data set of the J-ADNI was downloaded from the National Bioscience Database Center (Tokyo, Japan, https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0043-v1) on October 12, 2017, on approval of the Ethics Committees of the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine (Tokyo, Japan; approval number 11628) and the National Bioscience Database Center (DU-0039)."}, {"section_title": "Participants and variables analyzed", "text": "The study protocol used in the J-ADNI has been described in detail elsewhere [3] . To describe the eligibility criteria briefly, CN participants in the J-ADNI were required to be 60 to 84 years of age, and have a physician's diagnosis of not having dementia or mild cognitive impairment, a CDR score of 0, and an MMSE score of 24 to 30 at the time of screening. Only participants with results of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker at the baseline assessment were included in the analyses. Positive Ab accumulation was defined as either positive or equivocal amyloid deposition on 11 C-PiB or 11 C-BF-227 PET by visual reads [4] , or CSF Ab 1-42 below 333 pg/mL at the baseline assessment [3] . Thus, negative Ab accumulation was defined as either negative scan on amyloid PET or CSF Ab . 333 pg/mL. Elevated tau level was defined as CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) . 45 pg/mL at the baseline assessment. Brain tau status could be defined only among participants who underwent CSF biomarker analyses at the baseline. These cutoff values for CSF biomarkers were established using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of CSF Ab 1-42 and p-tau measurements at the baseline from 35 AD and 53 CN cases.\nDemographic data, including age, sex, education, family history within first-degree relatives and frequency of APOE \u03b54 alleles, were analyzed. For clinical scales, the CDR, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, and the Geriatric Depression Scale were analyzed. Cognitive measures were selected to assess each cognitive domain and global cognition: the MMSE and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scalecognitive subscale 13 for global cognition; the logical memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised for episodic memory; the digit span and the digit symbol substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, category fluency, and trail making test for executive function; the Boston naming test for semantic function; and the clock drawing test and clock copying test for visuospatial function."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "All the statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

The Ab positivity rate among CN elderly individuals was lower in the J-ADNI than in similar large-scale studies: 38.1% of participants 65 to 85 years of age in the NA-ADNI [7] ; 33% of participants 60 years of age in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle [8] ; and 28% of participants 70 to 85 years of age in the INSIGHT-preAD [2] . Carriage of APOE \u03b54 allele is known to be a major risk factor, not only for AD dementia [9] , but also for preclinical Ab accumulation [10] ; however, it did not fully account for the Ab positivity rate being lower in our study. The frequency of APOE \u03b54 among all participants in the analysis was 25%, which is lower than in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (43%), but is essentially comparable with the figures reported in the NA-ADNI (28%) and the INSIGHT-preAD (20%). The major reason for the lower Ab positivity rate in the J-ADNI was believed the younger age of the cohort, given that age is known to be another major risk factor for Ab accumulation independent of APOE \u03b54 [8, 10] . The frequency of APOE \u03b54 carriers among CN individuals was higher in the J-ADNI than in a population-based study by the Japanese Genetic Study Consortium for AD (17.5%) [11] . Although no precedent longitudinal cohort studies investigating early stage of AD were conducted before the J-ADNI in Japan, Abbreviations: Ab, amyloid b; Ab1, participants with Ab accumulation; Ab2, participants without Ab accumulation; CDR-SB, clinical dementia rating sum of boxes; NPI-Q, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire; FAQ, Functional Assessment Questionnaire; GDS, Geriatric Depression Scale; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; ADAS-cog 13, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13.\nNOTE.

P values were determined by use of the Student's t-test for age, education, and CSF biomarkers, the chi-squared test for sex and family history, and the Fisher's exact test for the frequency of APOE \u03b54 alleles. and the participants were recruited solely from the community, not from other cohort studies in which participants or their family members had participated, study participation itself may have contributed to enrichment of APOE \u03b54 carriers to some degree.\nSimilar to reports from several other previous studies [1, 2, 10] , CN participants with Ab accumulation in the J-ADNI tended to exhibit a significantly greater number of APOE \u03b54 alleles than those without Ab accumulation [1, 2] . Despite repetition of cognitive tests during the follow-up period, the participants with Ab accumulation exhibited a trend toward loss of practice effects in the MMSE and the logical memory. A previous study reported that individuals who maintained a CDR score of 0 for 3 years exhibited practice effects on episodic memory measures [12] . Although Ab biomarkers were not included in the previous study, as cognitively stable individuals are considered to have a lower possibility of Ab accumulation, previous results match with those in our study. Thus, detection of APOE \u03b54 carriage and loss of practice effects in repetition of memory tests may be useful to effectively enrich individuals with preclinical AD before measurement of an Ab biomarker.\nWe next probed which cognitive domain is more impaired in individuals with preclinical AD. Donohue et al. developed the preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC) to measure amyloid-related cognitive decline in preclinical AD for use in a clinical trial on preclinical AD. The PACC is composed of the MMSE, two memory tests: the logical memory and the free and cued selective reminding test, and the digit symbol substitution test [7] . Individuals with preclinical AD exhibited longitudinal decline on every component of the PACC [13] . Furthermore, Papp et al. developed the PACC5, which added category fluency tests to the PACC as a cognitive composite more sensitive to amyloid-related cognitive decline in preclinical AD than the PACC [14] . Monsell et al. reported a greater rate of decline in the attention and working memory domain in individuals with preclinical AD than CN individuals without AD pathology [15] . These studies suggest a decline, not only in episodic memory but also in executive function, can be seen in preclinical AD. Although there was a limitation in sample size in our study, we further divided the participants with Ab accumulation into those with elevated and normal tau levels. Each group corresponded to stage 1 and stage 2/3 of preclinical AD, respectively [16] . Our results suggested that individuals in stage 2/3 of preclinical AD may already present measurable-albeit not clinically significant-decline in episodic memory, and begin declining in multiple measures of executive function. This finding will help inform the development of a novel cognitive composite to assess cognitive decline in preclinical AD. CSF p-tau is known to be correlated with neocortical neurofibrillary tangle pathology [17] ; therefore, it appears reasonable that decline in episodic memory was seen first, followed by the decline in executive function, which reflects the spatial progression of neurofibrillary tangle pathology as the disease progresses [18] .\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that preclinical AD in Japanese individuals did not differ from that reported in other studies from western countries. Characteristics of cognitive profiles of preclinical AD may lie in the decline in executive function as well as episodic memory, becoming more obvious as the stage progresses. To draw definitive conclusions, studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods on preclinical AD are needed. To support ongoing global clinical trials on preclinical AD, multimodal comparison of participants with preclinical AD between the J-ADNI and the NA-ADNI is necessary in the near future."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1. Systematic review: The Pubmed database was searched to identify large-scale longitudinal studies examining the frequency of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive profiles of individuals with preclinical AD. The present study was the first study to examine these in a Japanese population using data from the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\n2. Interpretation: Analyses revealed that the frequency of preclinical AD was lower in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort because of younger age and lower frequency of APOE \u03b54 carriage. Individuals with amyloid b accumulation tended to lack practice effects in the MiniMental State Examination and the logical memory, and score poorly on executive function tests. These cognitive profiles of preclinical AD were consistent with results from previous studies."}, {"section_title": "Future directions:", "text": "Results from the present study may inform the development of more sensitive cognitive composites for future prevention trials and the consideration of repetitive memory tests as prescreening to effectively recruit individuals with preclinical AD."}]
