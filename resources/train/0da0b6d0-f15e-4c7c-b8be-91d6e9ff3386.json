Despite substantial progress in understanding the anatomical and functional development of the human brain, little is known on the spatialtemporal patterns and genetic influences on white matter maturation in twins. Neuroimaging data acquired from longitudinal twin studies provide a unique platform for scientists to investigate such issues. However, the interpretation of neuroimaging data from longitudinal twin studies is hindered by the lacking of appropriate image processing and statistical tools. In this study, we developed a statistical framework for analyzing longitudinal twin neuroimaging data, which is consisted of generalized estimating equation (GEE2) and a test procedure. The GEE2 method can jointly model imaging measures with genetic effect, environmental effect, and behavioral and clinical variables. The score test statistic is used to test linear hypothesis such as the association between brain structure and function with the covariates of interest. A resampling method is used to control the family-wise error rate to adjust for multiple comparisons. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we demonstrate the application of our statistical methods in quantifying the spatiotemporal white matter maturation patterns and in detecting the genetic effects in a longitudinal neonatal twin study. The proposed approach can be easily applied to longitudinal twin data with multiple outcomes and accommodate incomplete and unbalanced data, i.e., subjects with different number of measurements."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Longitudinal neuroimaging studies have grown rapidly for better understanding the progress of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders or the normal brain development, and typical large-scale longitudinal studies include ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and the NIH MRI study of normal brain as in [1] . Compared with cross-sectional neuroimaging studies, longitudinal neuroimaging follow-up may allow characterization of correlation between individual change in neuroimaging measurements (e.g., volumetric and morphometric) and the covariates of interest (such as age, diagnostic status, gene, and gender). Longitudinal design may also allow one to examine a causal role of time-dependent covariate (e.g., exposure) in disease process. A distinctive feature of longitudinal neuroimaging data is the temporal order of the imaging measures (see more discussions in [2, 3] ). Particularly, imaging measurements of the same individual usually exhibit positive correlation and the strength of the correlation may decrease with prolonged time separation.\nTwin neuroimaging studies are invaluable for disentangling the effects of genes and environments on brain functions and structures. The twin design typically compares the similarity of monozygotic twins (MZ, who are developed from a single fertilized egg and therefore share 100% of their genes) to that of dizygotic twins (DZ, who are developed from two fertilized eggs and therefore share on average 50% of their alleles). These known differences in genetic similarity, together with the assumption of equal environments for MZ and DZ twins allows us to explore the effects of genetic and environmental variance on a phenotype, such as brain structure. The current neuroimaging twin studies have focused upon locating the brain regions subject to either environmental factors or genetic factors. For instance, high heritability was found in intracranial volume, global gray and white matter volume [4] , cerebral hemisphere volume [5] . Cortical thickness in sensorimotor cortex, middle frontal cortex and anterior temporal cortex were found to be under the influence of genetic factors [6] . High heritabilities were also located in paralimbic structures and temporal/parietal neocortical regions [7] .\nThe longitudinal twin neuroimaging studies, which combine both the longitudinal design and the twin design, provide a unique platform for examining the effects of gene and environment on the development of brain functions and structures. To properly analyze the longitudinal twin imaging measures, any image processing and statistical tools must account for three key features: the temporal correlation among the repeated measures, the different genetic and environmental effects among MZ and DZ twins, and the spatial correlation between each twin pair. Failure to account for these three features can result in misleading scientific inferences [2] . However, advanced image processing and statistical tools designated to complex and correlated image data along with behavioral and clinical information remains lacking. The crosssectional image processing and statistical tools may be useful for longitudinal twin imaging data, but they are not statistically optimal in power. To the best of our knowledge, most existing neuroimaging software platforms including SPM, AFNI, and FSL do not have any valid methods to process and analyze neuroimaging data from longitudinal twin studies.\nWe propose two statistical methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal twin studies. We develop second-order generalized estimating equations (GEE2) for jointly modeling univariate (or multivariate) imaging measures with covariates of interest in longitudinal twin studies (including genetic and environmental factors, behavioral and clinical variables). Compared with the structural equation modeling (SEM) for twin neuroimaging data, GEE2 avoids the assumption that latent genetic and environmental variables follow a Gaussian distribution. We develop a score test statistic to test linear hypotheses such as the associations between brain structure and function and covariates of interest. In order to adjust for multiple comparisons, a resampling method is used to control the family-wise error rate. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in analyzing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to quantify spatiotemporal patterns and detect genetic influences on early postnatal white matter development."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Image Acquisition and Preprocessing", "text": "Our study is approved by the institutional review board.

In order to construct voxel based atlas, the FA images from all subjects were co-registered towards a template of a twoyear old FA image (not a subject in this study) with a widely used elastic registration method HAMMER [8] , which relies on neighborhood intensity distribution and edge information for image alignment instead of image intensity alone."}, {"section_title": "Generalized Estimating Equations", "text": "We observe imaging, behavioral and clinical data from n twins at m i time points t ij for 1,..., , 1,..., i i n j m = = in a longitudinal study.

The growth patterns of FA and MD from these regions are given in Fig. 1 for both MZ and DZ twins. There is a slight difference existed between the growth curves between MZ and DZ twins.

This work may be the first study to identify the growth patterns of DTI parameters in longitudinal twin study. Our preliminary results demonstrated that genetic influences upon brain development can be identified with the squared difference images under the assumption of equal environmental exposure. Furthermore, our approach may suggest the existence of dynamic component of genetic influences on brain development in this early postnatal stage.\nThere are several potential improvements can be made to the current approach. One is to use the two GEE equations (Eq. (2) and (5)) iteratively for joint estimation of growth patterns and genetic influences. Another extension is to use multivariate analysis to improve the sensitivity in detecting genetic related influences. At last, from imaging registration end, the statistical analysis will benefit from an improved registration of the DTI images across different ages."}]
