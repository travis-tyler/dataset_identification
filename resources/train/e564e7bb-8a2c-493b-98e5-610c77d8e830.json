A man with two watches is never sure\" (Segal's law) Around the world, one area of interest in education is comparative studies in educational achievement, in particular, in mathematics, science and reading. There are two well-subscribed programs involving science, namely, PISA and TIMSS. In the same year 2015, PISA (The Programme for International Student Assessment) and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) are coming up to us together. PISA is a triennial international survey which aims to evaluate education systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students since 2000, while TIMSS has been conducted on a regular 4-year cycle since 1995, and measures the trends in mathematics and science achievement at the fourth and eighth grades. Grades are the main indicator of ability and performance that can have long-term consequences for pupil achievement and thereby on future employment perspectives, High performing school systems prepare their students for these knowledge-based jobs (Tucker, 2011) . Able students with a good understanding of science form a pool of future engineers and scientists. It has been taken for granted that assessment achievement is a good measure of quality of human capital (Lee & Barro, 2001) , and national competence in science and technology primarily depend on the quality of human capital. The importance of human capital at the country level is supported by the observation of large differences in labor productivity between countries (Hall & Jones, 1999) . PISA and TIMSS, which clock is more accurate to indicate national S&T (science & technology) competitiveness?\nQualitative descriptions of S&T competitiveness, when considered, generally come from one of two sources: quality of human capital or R&D inputs. Average IQ of the population provides another measure of quality of human capital (Meisenberg & Lynn, 2011) . In this study, the researcher not only considered the education influence but also focused the other factors which affect the national competitiveness in S&T. Whether and to what extent these factors are related to S&T competitiveness? The results are very useful for every country, regardless of this country belongs to developed countries or developing countries. This paper provided a guider to national policy makers."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "Since the number of scientific and technical journal articles (per million people) which shows the activities involved in research and development can better represent the competence of science and technology (Chen & Luoh\uff0c2010) , the researcher used it to investigate the relationships between PISA or TIMSS science scores and competence in science and technology, would like to see whether there is a strong link between them.

Latvia) and Confucian Asian countries (such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore) generally performed a little poorer than predicted. The results are similar with previous studies (Wu, 2009) . This observation prompted an investigation of whether other factors relating to characteristics of Western and Eastern European/Asian countries may have an impact."}, {"section_title": "Other possible factors impacting S&T competence", "text": "PISA shows a better evaluate indicator for national competitiveness in S&T than TIMSS, however, average IQ of the population provides another measure of quality of human capital. It should be considered. And some other factors impacting S&T competence also should be factored in. For instance, Israel's Performance on PISA science was lower, but their research and development expenditure is the highest in the world at 4.27% (data from World Development Index constructed by the World Bank). This may be the reason why Israel has the strong competence of S&T. As the same, Nordic countries' (Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) number of researchers in R&D per million people are the top countries in the world, average IQ of the population and the R&D expenditure (% of GDP) are also much higher in the world. Maybe these factors contribute to the Nordic countries' higher S&T competence. The number of S&T journal articles per million people in Switzerland is the highest in the world. This may be due to the combination of four important factors: higher research and development (R&D) expenditure, more researchers in R&D, higher quality of education, and higher average IQ of the population. So we must consider these factors which also influence the S&T competence: average IQ of the population, the number of researchers in R&D per million people and R&D expenditure (% of GDP). The researcher would like to see whether there is still a strong link between science scores and S&T competence while adding the other three important factors."}, {"section_title": "Regression Model", "text": "Standard regression model is considered as follows:\nWhere article, score, researcher, IQ, expenditure and u are number of S&T journal articles per million people, PISA science scores, researchers in R&D (per million people), Intelligence tests, research and development expenditure (% of GDP) and the random error term, respectively. Here PISA science scores are used, because it is a better measure of national competitiveness in S&T than TIMSS."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Due to the unavailability of data on the number of researchers in R&D per million people, IQ or the R&D expenditure (% of GDP) in some countries in the year 2009, there are 42 countries remained. Table. 1 shows the correlations of four factors and log-transformed articles per million people.\nA number of observations can be made: 1. All variable including log-transformed articles per million people, research and development (R&D) expenditure, researchers in R&D, science scores, and average IQ of the population, form a positive manifold. However, the correlations between R&D expenditure (% of GDP) and number of researchers in R&D per million people are higher than any of the other correlations in the table. 2. The science scores is more highly correlated with lg(articles) than the other factors, this suggests the science scores is a most important determinant of the S&T competence. 3. IQ is related more closely to the science scores than other factors. This shows that higher IQ students can get better grades. Tables 2 shows the results of regression models in which various outcomes are predicted by the four factors: science scores, researchers in R&D, average IQ of the population research and development (R&D) expenditure. The results of Tables 2 confirm that lg(articles) are related more closely to science scores than other three factors.\nWhen the number of researchers in R&D per million people added in the analysis, we can see clearly the correlation between PISA science scores and the number of scientific and technical journal articles (per million people) remains significant ( see column (2) of Table 2 ). It is worth noting that under this model, both factors contribute significantly to explain the number of scientific and technical journal articles (per million people). In column (3) of Table 2 , the average IQ of the population is added into the regression model. The significant impact of science scores remains, but the number of researchers in R&D per million people is no longer related to competence. However, if average IQ of the population and the R & D expenditure (% of GDP) are retained as the only two measures of the number of scientific and technical journal articles (per million people), the result in column (5) suggest the two factors are very important variables that contribute to national S &T competence. IQ of the population and R & D expenditure are both significant at 1%."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "The most important finding in this study is that differential performances of countries in S &T competence can be largely accounted for by two kinds of factors.\nIn particular, quality of human capital is the most significant factor. The other factor is R&D inputs. Average IQ of the population and educational test score provide measures of quality of human capital. R&D inputs are embodied in the number of researchers in R&D per million people and R&D expenditure (% of GDP).\nFirstly, the researcher investigated whether students' science score is a good indicator of the competence in S&T. The study shows PISA is a better measure of competence in S & T than TIMSS. What makes different? Both PISA and TIMSS assess students' achievement levels in science. There has been considerable interest in comparing the two surveys, as the results from these two surveys have not always been consistent (Brown et al, 2007) . So it is essential to gain a clear understanding of what each survey assesses. Barry McGaw, the Director for Education of the OECD, characterized the difference as TIMSS being interested to discover, \"what science have you been taught and how much have you learned?\", while for PISA it was \"what can you do with the science you have been taught?\". Rather than assessing the same subjects as TIMSS, PISA aims to assess scientific literacy. As a mission statement, it is claimed that:\nThe prime aim of the OECD/PISA assessment is to determine the extent to which young people have acquired the wider knowledge in reading literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy that they will need in adult life.(OECD, 2004) Furthermore, average IQ of the population as another measure of quality of human capital is also obvious to indicate competence in S&T. The reason we can find from Table 1 , the correlation coefficient (0.805) between educational test score and IQ of the population is quite higher. Studies repeatedly show that performance on intelligence tests is correlated with school achievement (Brody, 1997; Sattler, 2002) . At the individual level within countries, correlations between IQ tests and school achievement tests are typically between 0.5 and 0.7 (Jencks et al, 1972; Jensen, 1998; Mackintosh, 2011) , but can be as high as 0.8 (Deary et al, 2007) . At the country level, correlations between the results of IQ tests and scholastic assessments are in the vicinity of 0.9 (Lynn & Meisenberg, 2010) . However, Table1 and Table 2 show that IQ is weaker than science test score in predicting competence in S&T. Why? A reasonable explanation is that scientific literacy can be obtained through high quality educational system rather than natural IQ. We must also note that the relationship between IQ scores and school achievement is an imperfect one, with many exceptions to the rule. Although students with high IQs typically perform well in school, we cannot say conclusively that their high achievement is actually the result of their intelligence. Intelligence probably does play an important role in school achievement, but quality of instruction is also involved. Therefore, to a certain extent, the difference between school achievement and IQ can be used as a measure for the quality of the educational system (Meisenberg & Lynn, 2011) .\nMoreover, the study also shows that R&D input is another important determinant to the competence in S & T. R&D inputs are embodied in the number of researchers in R&D per million people and R&D expenditure (% of GDP). From the study, we can see that they are both important determinants to the competence in S & T. The correlations between R&D expenditure (% of GDP) and number of researchers in R&D per million people are higher than any of the other correlations in the Table 1 . One plausible explanation is that a larger proportion of R&D expenditure cost on the researchers. The study of Goolsbee (1998) showed that the majority of R&D spending is actually salary payments for R&D workers and the supply of this scientific and engineering talent is quite inelastic. N. S.F. (1995) documents that between 45 and 83% of total spending is wages and benefits of scientific personnel (depending on how one counts overhead which includes individual benefits). A reasonable approximation for the total share might be 2/3. So in 1995 the US government spent almost $70 billion on R&D, $45 billion of that was wages and benefits for R&D workers.\nHigher quality of human capital and more R&D inputs in Confucian Asian countries, however, Confucian Asian countries (such as Japan, Korea and Singapore) generally performed a little poorer than predicted. A possible explanation is the lower self-concept. Report based on OECD (2007) showed that the lowest scoring countries on science self-concept were Confucian Asian countries, especially Japan and South Korea. Wilkins' (2004) report based on TIMSS 1995 also showed that the lowest scoring countries on both math and science self-concept were Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong-China. Thus it appears that high self-doubt is a consistent finding in Confucian countries. Lower self-concept means higher anxiety, lower interest and lower enjoyment in science.\nThe findings from this paper indicate that higher quality of human capital and more R&D inputs are the two magic weapons to national competence in S&T, especially higher quality of human capital. United States lead the world in science and technology generally benefits from the influx of foreign S&T students and highly skilled labor to immigrate to the United States. In order to get higher quality of human capital, two methods offered:\n1. Improve K-12 education in general, and science and technology education in particular. "}]
