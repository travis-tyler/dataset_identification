We generated synthetic datasets, varying parameters of 171 mutation frequency in cases and controls, and applied network propagation using varying 172 parameter settings of the algorithm. In these simulations we focus on an un-mutated target 173 gene and vary the mutation frequency in the gene's neighborhood differentially between cases 174 and controls. Next, we test how well the smoothed score obtained through network 175 propagation in the target gene separates cases from controls. Further details can be found in 176 SI Appendix. A summary of results from the investigation of the parameter space for network 177 propagation on simulated data can be found in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1 . We 178 observed (Supplementary Figure 1B) that variation in both diffusion length \u03b1 and percentage 179 of edges retained influences the difference in a hub gene's smoothed score between cases 180 and controls only marginally.
