[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose: There is continuing controversy over the most appropriate treatment for screen detected and clinically localized prostate cancer, and increasing interest in monitoring such men initially with radical treatment targeted at cancers showing signs of progressive potential but while they are still curable. Current evidence on monitoring protocols and biomarkers used to predict disease progression was systematically reviewed. Materials and Methods: The MEDLINE and Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) bibliographic databases were searched from 1988 to October 2004, supplemented by manual searches of reference lists, focusing on studies reporting monitoring of men with localized prostate cancer. Results: A total of 48 potentially eligible articles were found but only 5 studies, in which there was a total of 451 participants, restricted entry criteria to men with clinically localized (T1-T2) prostate cancer. Monitoring protocols varied with little consensus, although the majority used prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination, while some added re-biopsy to assess progression. Actuarial probabilities of freedom from disease progression at 4 to 5 years of followup were 67% to 72%. However, up to 50% of men abandoned monitoring within 2 years, largely because of anxiety related to increasing prostate specific antigen rather than objective evidence of disease progression. There was no robust evidence to support prostate specific antigen doubling times or velocity to identify men in whom disease may progress. Studies were characterized by small sample size, short-term followup, observer bias and uncertain validity around variable definitions of progression. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that some form of monitoring would be a suitable treatment option in men with localized prostate cancer but there is little consensus over what markers should be used in such a program or how progression should be properly defined. The search for a method that safely identifies men with prostate cancer who could avoid radical intervention must continue."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A nnually more than 500,000 men worldwide are diagnosed with prostate cancer, accounting for 10% of all male incident cancers, 1 and it is rapidly becoming the most common cancer in men. Autopsy studies show that cancerous cells can be found in the prostate of 30% to 40% of men at age 60 years, increasing to 60% to 70% by age 80 years, and yet in a 50-year-old man in the United States the lifetime risk of clinical and fatal prostate cancer is estimated to be only 9.5% and 2.9%, respectively. 2 The dilemma is that, although most cancers detected by screening are clinically confined to the prostate and, hence, are potentially curable, current screening tests cannot differentiate between cancers that have low biological likelihood of progression and those with more aggressive potential. 3 Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of radical surgery and radiotherapy for screen detected disease. 4 Thus, screening may result in substantial over diagnosis and over treatment of clinically insignificant prostate cancer.\nThe doubts surrounding the benefits of screening and early radical treatment have led in recent years to increasing use of monitoring, variously termed active monitoring, surveillance or watchful waiting, as a therapeutic option. 4 This involves regular followup using 1 or more of certain investigations in men with clinically localized cancers, including PSA testing, DRE, review of symptoms and sometimes TRUS guided re-biopsy. These investigations aim to determine which cancers should be treated with potentially curative interventions and when this should be done. This differs from traditional watchful waiting regimens, in which followup typically waited for the development of systemic disease and the therapeutic goal was palliation. Appropriate targeting of active monitoring requires markers that can differentiate between indolent tumors and those with aggressive potential suitable for radical curative treatment.\n(after 1988) that followed men initially treated conservatively with watchful waiting or active monitoring.

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] These reports showed that 22% to 73.2% of men abandoned active monitoring within 2 to 5 years 6 -12 with patient preference the most commonly cited factor by physicians. 6, 9, 10 Higher baseline PSA and tumor stage, 11 and short PSA doubling time (less than 2 to 3 years) 6,7 were associated with higher subsequent rates of active treatment, while older age 8, 11 and adverse pretreatment social circumstances 8 were associated with lower rates of choosing active treatment.\nThe 13 remaining studies had predefined objective measures of progression [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] but 8 included men with advanced disease (stage T2-T3) who were followed with palliative intent (tables 2 and 3).

All protocols included serial PSA and DRE assessment, while 3 included repeat TRUS guided biopsies 13, 14, 16 and others included various clinical measures (table 4) . Progression rates for T1c-T2 disease were between 17% and 33% with little clear relationship with median duration of followup, mean age or median initial PSA. A large proportion of men underwent radical treatment without clinical evidence of progression, usually because of anxiety or withdrawal prompted by PSA progression. For example, Patel et al reported that only 17 of 31 men changing to radical treatment met the criteria for progression. 13 In the Johns Hopkins series 13% of men (9 of 70) showed a change in Gleason score of 6 or less to 7 or greater on repeat biopsy. 26 In 8 of these men the change occurred within 15 months of initial sampling. Patel et al found that 23% of men with localized prostate cancer had worse Gleason scores within 6 months of initial biopsy, while 61% had no cancer detected at repeat biopsy. 13 In a case series that included 4% of men with stage T3 a total of 53% (24 of 45)\nNumber of studies included and excluded from review who underwent routine repeat sextant biopsy had evidence of progression at a median of 33 months. 17 In 2 of the 5 eligible studies of localized cancer men were followed using a combination of clinical (DRE/radiological/clinical evidence of metastases) and biochemical (PSA) criteria but they did not include routine histological surveillance. 15, 23 The short-term probability of metastases in the 5 studies of localized cancer was low, that is in 4 there was no evidence of metastatic progression at a median of between 23 and 44.1 months of followup. 13, 14, 16, 23 One of the men (2%) in the T1a cancer series had progression to bony metastases after 12 years. 15 In 2 of the 8 case studies of more advanced disease 3 of 64 20 and 2 of 113 22 men had skeletal metastases at a median followup of 21 to 22 months (table 3) . PSA monitoring. All 5 studies of localized cases included PSA measures in the monitoring protocols (table 6) . [13] [14] [15] [16] 23 One study included twice yearly percent f/tPSA measurements, 14 although it is not clear how these measures were used to trigger further investigation. Another included PSA velocity calculated from at least 3 values during 12 months and PSA velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml yearly was included in a composite definition of progression (table 5) . 13 Four studies diagnosed progression using PSA criteria, 13, 15, 16, 23 including PSA velocity 13 and PSA doubling time (table 7) . 16 In the series of Choo et al median PSA doubling time was 6.68 years 16 and the proportion of men with rapid PSA doubling time (less than 2 years) reported by Patel 13 and Choo 16 et al was 11%. Of the men 12% to 46% had negative doubling time 13, 16 and 42% had PSA doubling time more than 10 years, 16 suggesting a limited impact of low volume cancer on serial PSA in a large number of men.\nThere is some evidence that biopsy criteria are more likely to result in a diagnosis of progression than PSA criteria. In the series of Patel et al the predominant factors determining the diagnosis of progression were 1) biopsy criteria, accounting for 57% of cases of diagnosed progression due to increased Gleason score in 30% and increased cancer volume in 27%, 2) PSA velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml yearly in 36% and 3) clinical findings on DRE or TRUS in 7%. 13 Progression rates were lower in the 2 studies that included PSA measures (25% of patients progressed in a median of 44.1 months 13 and 17% progressed in 29 16 ) than in a study based only on unfavorable repeat biopsy findings (29% progressed in 23 months). 14 "}, {"section_title": "Factors Associated With Disease Progression", "text": "Actuarial probabilities of freedom from disease progression at 4 to 5 years of followup were 67% to 72%. 13, 15, 16 We reviewed the evidence on potential prognostic factors associated with prostate cancer progression.

Three dynamic markers of prostate cancer progression were investigated, including 1) PSA doubling time, 2) PSA velocity (PSA per unit of time) and 3) rate of change in f/tPSA with time. Patel et al found no association of PSA doubling time with progression (p \u03ed 0.3), although PSA velocity was incorporated in the definition of progression. 13 Choo et al found that median PSA doubling times differed in men with clinical or histological progression (5.4 and 3.4 years) compared with no clinical or histological progression (7.4 and 7.5 years) but the number of men with progression was small (29 of 231), effect estimates were imprecise and the results could have arisen by chance (p \u03ed 0.97 and 0.31, respectively). 16, 28 None of the men with PSA doubling time less than 2 years had a positive bone scan 16 but longer followup would be required to assess the prognoses.\nGreater PSA velocity was associated with histological progression but there was extensive overlap in values in men who progressed (mean 1.1 ng/ml yearly, range 0.0 to 5.2) vs those who did not (mean 0.35 ng/ml yearly, range 0.0 to 3.3, p \u03ed 0.03), 14, 27 limiting its accuracy as a prognostic marker. A combination of percent fPSA, PSA velocity and gland volume may distinguish men with favorable vs unfavorable histological features on repeat biopsy (65% sensitivity at 90% specificity).\n14 Rate of change of f/tPSA above the median, ie 0.0096 yearly or greater, was associated with 85% progression-free survival at 5 years vs 58% in men below the median (p \u03ed 0.071). 16, 29 However, 43% of men were defined as having progressed based on PSA doubling time, so that the apparent association between rate of change in f/tPSA and progression-free survival may reflect the correlation between these 2 measures of PSA velocity (r \u03ed -0.18, p \u03ed 0.021).\nSix of the 8 studies including men with T3-T4 disease investigated the role of PSA doubling time as a marker of prostate cancer progression (table 2) . 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25 Rapid PSA doubling time or higher PSA velocity was associated with a poor prognosis in some of these studies 18, 20, 22, 30 but there were limitations. In 1 report associations disappeared after controlling for other prognostic factors, 20 including mean nuclear volume, 20, 30 while in another increasing PSA was a criterion for defining progression, 18 so that the relationship carries little meaning. In a third study PSA doubling time was not associated with clinical progression in an analysis ignoring PSA results obtained 2 to 12 months before the date of progression. 22 The latter study suggests an observer bias since knowledge of the latest available PSA results, ie whether increasing or stable, may have influenced the diagnosis of clinical progression. Others showed no relationship between PSA change with time or rapid PSA doubling time and disease progression. 17, 25 Two of the studies that included advanced cases identified other potential markers, that is mean nuclear volume 20 and circulating prostate cells (table 2) . 19 These studies require replication. No association was found between the mean annual increase in prostatic volume and clinical progression in a study in 29 men."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We investigated the protocols and markers used in the PSA testing era to predict and define prostate cancer progression but only 5 observational studies in men with localized (T1-T2) prostate cancer were identified up to 2004. These reports involved a total of only 451 men followed less than 5 years. A key challenge in monitoring programs is to achieve an appropriate balance between enabling men with slowly growing localized prostate cancer to avoid radical intervention while also ensuring that those in whom disease will progress to threaten the length and/or quality of life can be identified and offered the opportunity of cure. The only consensus in the current literature is that PSA and DRE should be assessed. The timing of these assessments has not been agreed on and different forms of PSA criteria are used, including PSA velocity, 13 doubling time, 13, 16 total level and free-to-total ratio. 19 Three studies also recommended repeat transrectal biopsies 13, 14, 16 but timing varied from every 6 months to annually and protocols differed in the number of cores obtained. There is even less consensus about the definition of disease progression and/or the need for active intervention (table 7) . All studies used combinations of criteria, sometimes in complex or highly refined detail, and they somewhat inevitably described wide-ranging progression levels of 8% to 33%.\nIn men with clinically evident prostate cancer diagnosed in the prePSA era initial Gleason score was strongly associated with prostate cancer survival. 31 However, except for the study of Neulander et al 21 standard clinicopathological criteria at diagnosis (serum PSA, stage or grade) were not strongly associated with disease progression in the monitoring studies reviewed. This paradox may be related to the different patient populations considered, that is clinically evident prostate cancer diagnosed in the prePSA era 31 compared with predominantly T1 localized prostate cancer in men on active monitoring protocols. Studies using re-biopsy in the protocol and histological definitions of progression, eg changes in Gleason score or pattern, or an increase in the number or proportion of cores with cancer, described high Systemic progression (mets) 3 15, 16, 23 rates of progression within the first 2 to 3 years of followup. 13, 17, 26 The sampling error associated with TRUS guided biopsy is well known. 32 The large proportion of observed changes in histology occurring in a short time suggests that findings of progression on repeat biopsy probably reflect initial under sampling of a higher grade component rather than true dedifferentiation, casting doubt on the reliability of re-biopsy as a tool to diagnose progression.\nFour of the 5 monitoring studies used some form of PSA change to identify progression, 13, 15, 16, 23 making statistical associations between PSA based biomarkers and progression meaningless. These studies effectively assumed that rapidly increasing PSA should be an indication for treatment, eliminating the opportunity to observe whether cancer would have progressed based on more objective criteria. It has been suggested that rapid PSA doubling time, eg less than 1 to 2 years, can be used to identify men in whom disease may progress. There was no evidence in the studies included in this review to support this, that is some men show no evidence of progression despite rapid PSA doubling time 13, 28 and some cancers that progress do so despite stable PSA. 17 In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging there was little difference in PSA doubling time measured on serial frozen serum up to 12 to 26 years before diagnosis in men who subsequently had metastatic disease compared with doubling time in those who did not progress 5.5 to 12.3 years after diagnosis (p \u03ed 0.47). 33 However, this study was based on only 16 cases. The absence of an association between rapid PSA doubling time and progression seems counterintuitive but the hypothesis is based on inference, that is the loss of growth control is a key step leading to prostate cancer progression, serum PSA is proportional to tumor volume (r 2 \u03ed 0.49) 34 and more rapid PSA doubling time is associated with advanced disease. 35 A recent study in 1,095 men with predominantly T1c cancer and baseline PSA less than 10 ng/ml offered more compelling evidence. 36 Men with PSA velocity greater than 2.0 ng/ml yearly (highest quartile) in the year before diagnosis were at 9.8-fold (95% CI 2.8 to 34.3) increased risk for death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy vs men in the lowest 3 quartiles (PSA velocity less than 2.0 ng/ml yearly). Nevertheless, the role of PSA velocity in active monitoring protocols remains undefined.\nIn the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging serum f/tPSA was lower in men diagnosed with aggressive compared with nonaggressive disease at the visit nearest the diagnosis (8% vs 19%, p \u03ed 0.006), and 5 years (8% vs 16%, p \u03ed 0.003) and 10 years (9% vs 23%, p \u03ed 0.008) before diagnosis. 37 At 10 to 15 years before diagnosis total PSA was similar in the 2 groups, suggesting that f/tPSA may be predictive of tumor behavior at a time when total PSA provides no information on tumor aggressiveness. 37 Baseline percent fPSA 14 and the rate of change in f/tPSA 29 were associated with disease progression in the active monitoring studies reviewed but these findings require replication in well designed studies in other populations. The rate of change in f/tPSA with time appears to provide information different than that of total PSA doubling time because the correlation between these 2 measures is weak (r \u03ed 0.18). 29 A combination of percent fPSA, PSA velocity and gland volume may predict cancer with progressive potential 14 but the use of prediction rules based on these variables and the outcomes must be tested in a clinical setting. Measurement error due to biological or laboratory variation may attenuate underlying associations between PSA doubling time and progression. This problem is compounded because the studies reviewed generally involved fewer than 100 men, were of less than 5 years in duration and had progression rates around 20%, leading to low statistical power to detect clinically important effects. There is also uncertainty about the number of PSA measurements and the duration of PSA monitoring needed to calculate PSA doubling time or velocity with precision. Differences in results among studies may reflect the wide variability in PSA doubling time in an individual depending on the methods used for calculation. 5, 12, 18 Short-term changes in PSA correlate only moderately with overall PSA velocity (r \u03ed 0.418), 5 PSA doubling time was underestimated by 2 years in 18% of men when calculated for 1 year or less 18 and there are only moderate correlations between short and long-term estimations of PSA doubling time (r \u03ed 0.53 to 0.56). 12 Thus, an initial increase in PSA may not truly reflect the cancer growth rate in an individual. 10 A large proportion of men abandon active monitoring without objective evidence of progression. Patient anxiety, 13 request 16 or withdrawal because of increased PSA 13, 16, 23 were the most common reasons for abandoning monitoring in up to a third of patients. Between 1992 and 1994, and 1998 and 2000 there was a 42% decrease in active monitoring rates in the United States with the most rapid decrease in patients with the most favorable baseline clinical variables. 38 The clinical meaning of re-biopsy or regular PSA test findings is uncertain but reporting them to patients is highly likely to raise anxiety, adversely affect quality of life and make it difficult for patients to remain on monitoring.\nThe real dilemma with monitoring is the risk faced by patients of missing the window of opportunity to achieve cure when it is necessary because it is possible that the first sign of progressing disease may also mean that it is no longer curable. It is this concern that has hampered most monitoring studies to date because to our knowledge the real natural history of the disease has not been studied. However, it would appear that the current protocols including increasing PSA and grade change following biopsy probably cause too many men to opt out of monitoring but these measures may be of limited value for determining cancer that is biologically active. There is a clear need to develop accurate, clinically relevant markers of disease progression that can unambiguously provide reassurance or initiate therapy as appropriate. As molecular techniques improve, novel prognostic markers may be developed. Currently few markers have been identified in surveillance studies performed before or during the PSA era, including mean nuclear volume, 20 angiogenesis, 39 vascular endothelial growth factor and neuroendocrine expression, 40 p53 nuclear protein accumulation, 41 MIB-1 antibody, 42 DNA ploidy, 43 \u2423-catenin 44 and c-erbB-2 oncogene. 45 Most of them have been tested in single studies only and without replication it is not possible to rule out chance, bias or confounding as alternative explanations of reported associations."}]
