Where might it be easier or harder to increase land in cover crops and where might it be more or less beneficial? For conservation organizations to set more detailed and attainable goals than the current imperatives, they need high-quality baseline data. Here we review the existing sources of information on cover crop adoption, perform a new analysis of current cover crop adoption as a proportion of cover cropable land within specific farming rotations, and use our results to inform regional targets guiding cover crop expansion."}, {"section_title": "SOURCES OF COVER CROP DATA", "text": "HAVE IMPROVED Prior to 2014, most estimates of cover crop use came from regional surveys, which provided a nuanced understanding of cover crop adoption, but only at a regional scale. Examples of these include Bryant et al. (2013), NC SARE (2015), Bergtold et al. (2012), and USDA NRCS (2012). A notable exception was the Agricultural Resource Management Survey of 2010 to 2011 (Wade et al. 2015), which reported the results of a nationally representative survey of cover crop use. The study also reported cover crop use as a percentage of total cropland instead of land area broadly. With regional data on proportion of cropland cover cropped, it was possible to compare the practice across areas of varying geographical scales and landscape characteristics (i.e., proportion of land in farms). The study concluded that there were substantial differences in cover crop adoption across the nine farm resource regions of the United States. No region was reported to have more than 6% of cropland planted to cover crops annually. The 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture was the first year that cover crop land area was reported as a distinct practice (it had previously been reported within the category of fallow land) (USDA NASS 2012). This census provided the first complete nationwide state and county-level data on area planted to cover crops. The USDA Economic Research Service used this census data to produce county-level proportions of cover cropped land in relation to the total amount of harvested annual and perennial cropland (Bowman et al. 2016). They demonstrated that proportion of harvested cropland that is cover cropped varies widely across the country and even between adjacent counties, and is highest in the eastern and southern United States. We recognize the nationwide focus and percentage-based data in these studies as two necessary characteristics for developing a national cover cropping strategy."}, {"section_title": "HOW TO ANALYZE COVER CROP ADOPTION EXCLUSIVELY ON SUITABLE LAND", "text": "We assert there should be one additional consideration for cover crop baseline data: not all the cropland in the country is suitable for cover crops. Long et al. (2012) set a precedent for only including available cropland in a cover crop study by assuming that an estimated \"tillable acres\" was the only land available for cover crops. We also see value in only considering available cropland, but developed a different set of determining criteria. Cropland, as defined by the census, includes all cropland that was harvested, idled, cover cropped, failed, or abandoned as well as annual pasture and grazing land available for planting. It does not include permanent pasture or woodland (USDA NASS 2012). The inclusion of nonharvested cropland notably factors in perennial crops not yet ready for harvest, such as newly planted orchards. By this definition, cropland includes annual crops such as corn (Zea mays L.), soybeans (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), small grains, and vegetables, but also perennial crops such as fruit and nut trees, greenhouse and nursery plants, berries, and hay. Since the principal benefit of cover cropping is living plant material on the ground year-round, it is misleading to include perennial pasture and other perennially cropped land in estimates of present or future cover crop goals. Cover crops are typically planted after annual crops; therefore, annually planted cropland is the only land that can be expected to regularly accommodate cover crops. Substantial components of \"total cropland\" therefore are unsuitable for cover cropping and should not be included in estimates of future cover crop adoption. Particularly, perennial cropland has no regular window in its rotation suitable for cover crops. Bowman et al. (2016) included these perennially covered land areas, which could skew adoption rates significantly lower where perennial cropland is high. We assert that the proportion of cover cropped acres would be more reflective of an area's true potential for more cover crops if only land that is likely able to receive cover crops is included in the analysis. Using annually planted cropland as a baseline to assess potential for cover cropping provides a more informative and relevant baseline for cover crop adoption and is therefore the better estimate to base goalsetting for future cover crop adoption. In this study we calculate the nationwide, state-level cover crop adoption as a percentage of annually planted cropland."}, {"section_title": "CALCULATIONS", "text": "This process involved two calculations: (1) calculating the annually planted arable land in each state, and (2) then dividing the hectares (acres) of cover crops in the state by the annually planted area. All values are reported as acres or square feet and were converted to hectares. All the data used for this analysis came from the 2012 USDA Census of Agriculture as reported in USDA's Quickstat 2.0 database (USDA NASS 2016). We determined the percentage of annually planted hectares that are cover cropped in the United States by state, rather than by county, because state cover crop planting totals are publicly available, whereas county totals are not. The state-scale analysis increases the likelihood that we obtained a representative sample of annual cropland area. All land area values reported by the census are inflated by a small percentage to account for nonresponders. To calculate the annually planted arable acres we defined certain categories of cropland as either annual or perennial. We summed the hectares of perennial crops and subtracted these from the total hectares of cropland to create an \"annually planted hectares\" value for each state: Total cropland -Perennial cropland = Annually planted cropland. (1) Table 1 lists perennial crop categories as listed in the 2012 Census of Agriculture that were subtracted from \"total cropland\" to calculate \"annually planted cropland.\" Annually planted cropland makes up approximately 84% of total cropland. To estimate the proportion of annually planted cropland planted to a cover crop, we used the state-level hectares planted to cover crops (\"acres planted to a cover crop,\" hereafter \"cover cropped land\") as reported in the \"Practices, Land use, Cropland, Cover crop planted, (excl. CRP) -acres\" section of the database. The state-level value \"acres planted to a cover crop\" was divided by the previously calculated \"annually planted cropland.\" Cover cropped land \u00f7 Annually planted cropland = Proportion cover cropped. 2For the purposes of this paper, we assumed that reported cover cropped hectares are exclusively planted after annually planted crops in a given year. This is likely realistic, though there may be exceptions. The publicly available census data gives us no way of confirming that the fields with annual cropland and cover crops are the same fields. Consequently, our analyses are a comparison of the relative rates of cover crop adoption, rather than an exact calculation of the percentage of annual cropland planted with cover crops."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proportion of Cropland in Annual Crops.", "text": "In 2012, the percentage of a state's cropland that was annually cropped ranged from a high of 98% in Illinois to a low of 23% in West Virginia. The Heartland and Northern Great Plains states have the greatest proportions of annually planted cropland, while northeastern states have the lowest. Hayland had the greatest influence on almost every state's percentage of annually planted cropland (Hawaii, California, and Florida were more affected by tree crops). Proportion of Annual Cropland Planted to Cover Crops. Connecticut had the highest proportion of annual cropland planted to cover crops at 29.6%, North Dakota had the lowest proportion at 0.9% (figure 1). From our analysis, 4.16 million ha (10.28 million ac) out of 142 million ha (352 million ac) of annually planted cropland were cover cropped, or 2.9% of the land available for cover cropping was actually cover cropped. The average area of cover crops planted per state was 83,210 ha (205,615 ac), and the median was 58,116 (143,607 ac). Texas planted the most cover crops: an estimated 368,693 ha (911,060 ac). Rhode Table 1 Perennial crop data items from the 2012 census that we converted to hectares and removed from cropland totals in order to isolate annually planted cropland as all annually planted fruit, vegetable, herb, forage, and row crops. Island planted the fewest: 1,026 (2,535 ac). Despite this, Rhode Island outperformed Texas in proportion of cropland cover cropped. Depending on a region's goal, either cover cropped land area or proportion of cropland cover cropped could be a more informative metric. With regards to the percentage of available cropland cover cropped by state, our data affirm the general trends determined by Bowman et al. (2016). The top 15 states by annual cropland cover cropped are on the East Coast of the United States. However, the elimination of perennial cropland from the equation did substantially change the national picture: the elimination of perennial cropland caused the proportion of cover cropped land in 27 states to increase by 1% or more. The proportion in five states increased by more than 10%. These were northeastern states: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. Nevada and West Virginia were two notable outlier states: both have a substantial amount of cropland that is perennial (71% and 76%, respectively) but an exceptionally low proportion of cover crops compared to other highly perennial states."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "There are substantial differences by state in both available annual cropland for cover cropping and the percentage of those hectares cover cropped. Available cropland is related to the suitability of the state's agricultural land for annual crops. States with greater topographic relief or mountain soils have lower percentages of annually planted cropland than flatter states with historically prairie soils. For example, only 24% of the cropland in the \"Mountain State\" of West Virginia is annually planted, whereas the notoriously flat states of Iowa and Kansas have 96% and 91% annually planted cropland. While our analysis of cover crop adoption in predominantly agriculture states like those found in the Midwest agreed with previous analyses (Bowman et al. 2016), it diverged strongly in predominantly northeastern states where crop diversity is high and where farming is performed on a geographically diverse landscape. Here we estimate that cover crop adoption is twice as large as previously reported. For example, estimates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island increased from 14%, 11%, and 12% to 29%, 28%, and 28%, respectively (figure 2). Why have some states covered more of their available land than others? Regional differences in cropping systems certainly factor in. It's common for East Coast states to harvest corn for silage, and this provides a longer window for planting cover crops than harvesting corn for grain. Midwestern states almost exclusively harvest corn for grain. Average annual rainfall could have an influence in this regard. The USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program acknowledges that \"[cover crops] may dry the soil out too much and rob the following crop of needed moisture\" (Clark 2007). This could be a major concern in areas frequently short on water such as the Midwest and West. Temperature or frost date would be a logical limitation to cover crop adoption, but northeastern states are outperforming many other states with similar average annual minimum temperatures. Financial incentives could also explain part of the discrepancies. Maryland is a state with a substantial farming industry (Maryland State Archives 2017) with high cover cropping rates. The Maryland Department of Agriculture has been incentivizing cover crops since the late 1990s and has seen an almost fourfold increase in farmer applications to the program during that time, reporting almost 193,440 ha (478,000 ac) approved in the program for the 2014 to 2015 season (Maryland Department of Agriculture 2015). It is likely that the environmental payment incentive is contributing to the higher rates of adoption in Maryland, but an equally salient contributor"}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Proportion of annual cropland planted to cover crops in each state in 2012. The bars indicate the percentage of annually planted cropland cover cropped, the dots represent the percentage of total cropland cover cropped. is the regulatory pressure to reduce agricultural runoff into the Chesapeake Bay. No state has greater than 29.6% of their annually planted land area planted to cover crops. Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states have planted cover crops in a far lower proportion of available land: much of the Midwest cover cropped only 2% to 3% of annually planted cropland in 2012. This indicates there's great potential to increase the proportion of annually cropped land that is cover cropped, regardless of the scale of agriculture in any given state. The multiple year survey of farmers in the Mississippi River Basin suggests that farmers who aren't already cover cropping need financial incentives, crop insurance premium reductions, and neighbor-to-neighbor outreach to encourage and facilitate greater adoption (NC SARE 2015). Current users will need a different suite of incentives to encourage them to expand cover crop adoption. In regions of the country outside the Mississippi River Basin, it is likely that still different incentives will be necessary based on regional variations in soils, topography, climate, nutrient management regulations, and cropping systems. Increasing the area planted to cover crops is a goal because of the environmental benefits cover crops are expected to provide. If state or national conservation programs have to choose where to target cover crop outreach due to fund limitations, targeting particularly vulnerable land management situations would deliver the most effective environmental returns. This might lead to the funneling of funds to critical watersheds, or it could lead to targeting certain scenarios and practices found across the country. Farms on land with highly erosive soil types or steep slopes could be targeted, or land that would otherwise have low residue over the winter, like soybean fields."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We demonstrated that calculating cover crop adoption as a proportion of just annually planted cropland provides substantially different statewide proportions than when considering all cropland. Because all of the data we used is publicly accessible, we encourage readers to update our calculations using the same methods as subsequent agriculture censuses occur to track the nation's progress. This methodology enables setting informed goals based on specific contexts of the agricultural land base, cropping systems, and environmental resource concerns in a region. Our findings highlight the fact that cover crop adoption on annually planted cropland is currently highest in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and southeastern states. Nevertheless, even in these states cover crop adoption is <30% of potential cover cropped area. Another way to describe the data is that these states are closest to realizing the full potential from cover cropping. These states include areas with significant nutrient pollution concerns and climatic challenges to cover cropping. Despite this, or possibly because of it, these regions have managed to lead the country in cover crop adoption. We also highlight that cover crop adoption is lowest in the midwestern states, an area that also contributes significantly to nutrient pollution in the Gulf of Mexico. The overlap of low cover crop adoption with an environmental resource concern in this region suggests that national goals for increasing cover crop use should be targeted in the Midwest, but lessons on implementation could be gleaned from eastern states. Attainment of regional cover cropping goals will also depend on understanding and overcoming regionally specific barriers to cover crop adoption."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "Cover crop adoption percentages when considering all harvested cropland versus just annual cropland.
