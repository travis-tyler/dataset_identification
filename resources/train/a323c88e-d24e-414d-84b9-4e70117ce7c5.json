[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Susceptibility to AD is considerably determined by genetic factors which hitherto were primarily identified using case-control designs. Elucidating the genetic architecture of additional AD-related phenotypic traits, ideally those linked to the underlying disease process, holds great promise in gaining deeper insights into the genetic basis of AD and in developing better clinical prediction models. To this end, we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data in 931 participants of the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) sample to search for novel genetic determinants of AD biomarker variability. Specifically, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses on 16 traits, including 14 measures of amyloid-beta (A\uf062) and tau-protein species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to confirming the well-established effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) on diagnostic outcome and phenotypes related to A\uf06242, we detected novel potential signals in the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) for CSF-A\uf06238 and CSF-A\uf06240 levels, and confirmed the previously described sex-specific association between SNPs in geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and CSF-tau. Utilizing the results from independent case-control AD GWAS to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) revealed that AD risk variants only explain a small fraction of CSF biomarker variability. In conclusion, our study represents a detailed first account of GWAS analyses on CSF-A\uf062 and -tau related traits in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset. In subsequent work, we will utilize the genomics data generated here in GWAS of other AD-relevant clinical outcomes ascertained in this unique dataset."}, {"section_title": "Page 6", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disorder, which leads to cognitive decline, loss of autonomy, dementia, and eventually death. Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide deposits (\"plaques\") and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates (\"tangles\") in the brain [1] , [2] . Using genetic linkage analysis followed by positional cloning led to the discovery of rare mutations in three genes encoding the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2) that cause fully penetrant monogenic forms of AD [3] . However, the vast majority of patients likely summer from a polygenic (\"sporadic\") form of AD which is driven by numerous genomic variants [4] , the identification of which are the main aim of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\nThe most strongly and most consistently associated AD risk gene (even prior to GWAS [5] ) is APOE, which encodes apolipoprotein E, a cholesterol transport protein that has been implicated in numerous amyloid-specific pathways, including amyloid trafficking as well as plaque clearance [2] , [6] . In addition to APOE, nearly three dozen independent loci have now been reported to be associated with disease risk by GWAS [7] - [9] . Pathophysiologically, the risk genes identified to date appear to predominantly act through modulations of the immune system response, endocytotic mechanisms, cholesterol homeostasis, and APP catabolic processes [7] , [8] .\nDespite these general advances in the field of AD genetics, many key questions still remain to be answered. First, even when analyzed in combination, the currently known AD risk factors explain only a fraction of the phenotypic variance [7] , and, accordingly, only have limited applicability as early markers for disease onset and progression [7] , [10] . Second, most of the currently reported AD Page 7 susceptibility genes were identified using classic case-control designs comparing clinically manifest dementia-stage AD vs control individuals, typically lacking data on early-stage impairments (e.g. mild cognitive impairment [MCI] ) and clinical follow-up to ascertain progression and eventually conversion to AD. Finally, while some studies have investigated the correlation between genetics and non-genetic biomarkers, this was hitherto typically done as bivariate assessments owing to the lack of a broad spectrum of biomarkers and imaging data in the same individuals. To overcome at least some of these shortcomings we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data in the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) sample [11] . This powerful and unique dataset allows to combine genomic data (and \"-omics\" data from other domains) with preclinical biomarker levels to eventually improve our ability for an early detection and prevention of AD. While similar to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study [12] in various aspects, EMIF-AD MBD extends ADNI and scope in several important ways, e.g. in the breadth of the biomarker assessments as well as the availability of \"-omics\" data from various different domains in the same individuals (for more details see Bos et al., 2018 [11] ).\nIn this report we focus exclusively on the description of the results from genome-wide association analyses using various A\u03b2 and tau-relevant outcomes available in EMIF-AD MBD. Specifically, we performed GWAS and polygenic risk score (PRS) assessments for more than a dozen binary and quantitative phenotypes related to measures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 and tau proteins in addition to using simple diagnostic status (i.e. AD, MCI and control). Whenever available, we compare our findings using equivalent GWAS results from the ADNI dataset.

In addition, A\u03b2 status, cognitive test results and at least two of the following were available at baseline for analyses in all EMIF-AD MBD individuals: plasma (n = 1189), DNA (n = 929), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 862), or CSF (n = 767 individuals).\nFurthermore, clinical follow-up data were available for 759 individuals. The demographic information of the 16 outcome phenotypes (9 binary and 7 quantitative) of the EMIF-AD MBD dataset utilized in this paper is summarized in Table 1 . Depending on the availability of the clinical records, each phenotype has different effective sample sizes. We categorized the phenotypes analyzed in this study into three main categories, i.e. \"diagnosis\", \"amyloid protein assessment\" and \"tau protein assessment\" (NB: the diagnostic criteria used here for AD are not incorporating on biomarker status so that some AD cases were classified as \"amyloid negative\"). Details related to sample ascertainment and phenotype / biomarker collection in EMIF-AD MBD have been described previously [11] and are summarized for the relevant traits of this study in Supplementary Table 1 .

These analyses included a dichotomous \"amyloid classification\" (normal/abnormal) variable, representing a combination of CSF Page 15 A\u03b242/40 ratio, local CSF-A\u03b242, and the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on an amyloid PET scan (see methods section on \"amyloid classification\" in Bos et al. [11] for more details). Using this amyloid variable (available for n=871 individuals, of which n=455 were classified as \"abnormal\" and n=416 as \"normal\") across all diagnostic groups, we observed multiple genome-wide significant signals in the APOE region on chromosome 19 (Figure 1) . Similar to the GWAS on diagnostic outcome, the strongest association was observed with the APOE \"\uf0654\" allele (i.e. SNP rs429358: OR = 5.66, 95% CI = 4.09-7.84, P = 1.95E-25; Figure 1a , Suppl. Table 4 ), which was also very strong in equivalent analyses in the ADNI dataset (P = 4.15E-22). Despite the consistency of the APOE findings, none of the other suggestive signals outside the APOE region replicated in ADNI (Suppl. Table 4 ). As expected, gene-based tests using MAGMA highlighted APOE (and neighboring loci) as the most significant gene(s) associated with the \"amyloid classification\" variable (P = 1.13E-18, Figure 1b , Suppl. Table 4 ). In addition, a second locus emerged at genome-wide significance in the gene-based analyses, i.e. fermitin family homolog 2 (FERMT2) (P = 1.03E-06) located on chromosome 14q22.1.\nWhile this gene was originally reported to represent an AD risk locus [8] , this notion was not replicated in the much larger GWAS by Jansen et al. [7] . Furthermore, gene-based tests in ADNI did not reveal evidence for association between markers in FERMT2 and the \"amyloid classification\" phenotype (P = 0.23) suggesting that this gene is at best marginally involved in determining variance of this trait.\nAdditional analyses using the \"amyloid classification\" variable limited to MCI and control individuals revealed a similar picture as in the full dataset (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 , respectively), i.e. the strongest association signals were observed for APOE (all replicated in equivalent analyses in ADNI).\nIn addition, we identified a few suggestive non-APOE signals on other chromosomes, albeit none of these showed evidence for independent replication in ADNI.

The most noteworthy finding emerging from these analyses was genomewide significant association between CSF-A\u03b240 and markers in the gene encoding zinc finger Supplementary Table 13 ; similar results were obtained with CSF-A\u03b238). Despite the highly significant and consistent association between CSF-A\u03b240 and CSF-A\u03b238 levels and ZFHX3, this finding was not replicated in ADNI (gene-based P-value = 0.77; Supplementary   Table 13 )."}, {"section_title": "GWAS on dichotomous and continuous CSF tau variables", "text": "Similar to the GWAS analyses for CSF A\u03b2 measures, there were several dichotomous and continuous measures of CSF tau available in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset (see Table 1 Table 15 ).

These results showed marginal evidence for association in the ADNI cohort on the SNP level (for rs6444469 with P-value = 0.09), but not on the gene level (P-value = 0.59; Supplementary Table 15 ). Interestingly, association between markers in GMNC and CSF-Ttau levels were previously described [28] . A follow-up study to the original report provided evidence for sexspecific differences at this locus (rs1393060 proximal to GMNC and in strong LD with rs6444469 [r 2 =1]: P-value = 4.57E-10 in females compared to P-value = 0.03 in males) suggesting stronger effects in females [29] . In EMIF-AD MBD, we also observed a stronger association in females for GMNC at hence, providing independent replication of the previous report. Similarly, the association results for rs6444469 and CSF-Ttau in ADNI were more pronounced in females (P-value = 0.013) than males (Pvalue = 0.93). The other available CSF tau measure was CSF-Ptau, which is known to strongly correlate with CSF-Ttau levels [30] , a correlation which we also observe in our data (Pearson r 2 = 0.87, P-value < 2.2E-16). Owing to this phenotypic correlation, the GWAS results for both variables also look quite similar, as expected (Suppl. Figure 13b , Suppl. Table 17 ), and replicate the sex-specific difference."}, {"section_title": "Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses on all outcome traits", "text": "In addition to testing all above-mentioned traits for SNPs and genes in the context of genome-wide analyses, we also computed association statistics with aggregated variant data in the form of PRS using AD case-control results from Lambert et al. [8] and Jansen et al. [7] . The aim was to assess the degree Page 18 at which established AD-associated markers also show association with the \"AD-related\" (endo-) phenotypes analyzed here. Although a considerable amount of sample overlap exists across the two AD risk GWAS (i.e. both use the \"stage I\" GWAS data from the IGAP sample in their discovery phase), both studies use different analysis paradigms and different replication cohorts. Given that the final effective sample size used in Jansen et al. is nearly 10-times larger than that in Lambert, we hypothesized that the results and, accordingly: PRS, derived from the larger study are more \"precise\" and will therefore show stronger association and explain more of the trait variance analyzed here. PRSbased results are summarized in Table 2 , while full results can be found in Supplementary Table 18 (for PRS from Jansen et al. [7] ) and 19 (for PRS from IGAP [8] ). Overall, we observed significant PRSbased associations with many, but not all, traits analyzed in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset. For both PRS models, the best associated trait was a diagnosis of AD and all measures involving CSF-A\u03b242 levels. In contrast, no noteworthy associations were observed with CSF-A\u03b238 and CSF-A\u03b240 levels nor with either of the two available CSF-tau measures (CSF-Ttau and CSF-Ptau). Comparing the \"performance\" of both PRS against each other revealed that -against our expectation -the IGAP-based results tended to show the stronger statistical support (i.e. smaller P-values) and explained slightly more of the phenotypic variance (i.e. showed higher r 2 ) than the PRS derived from more recent and larger GWAS by Jansen et al. (Supp. Table 18 vs. 19 ). The only exception being the case-control analyses on AD status, where the Jansen PRS outperformed that from IGAP (i.e. r 2 = 4.35%, P-value = 4.03E-06 vs. r 2 = 2.98%, P-value = 1.07E-04, respectively). Interestingly, the association of AD-based PRS with risk for MCI was minor in both models (r 2 = 0.83%, P-value = 0.02, and r 2 = 0.65%, P-value = 0.039, for Jansen and IGAP, respectively).\nTo investigate the contribution of markers in the APOE region, we repeated all analyses excluding variants within 1 MB of APOE (chr19:45409039-45412650; bottom part of Supp. Tables 18 and 19 ). Page 19 As expected, removal of APOE region markers from the PRS decreased the variance explained for most of the traits analyzed here, albeit to varying degrees. Most affected were the analyses on AD (strongest reduction in r 2 in analyses excluding APOE effects vs. the full model including APOE = 73.8% in IGAP) and essentially all CSF-A\u03b242 related measures (strongest reduction in r 2 = 88.9% for trait \"AB_Zscore\" in IGAP) for both PRS models. Less affected by the removal of APOE were the analyses of CSF-tau species (strongest reduction in r 2 = 29.0% for CSF-Ttau in non-APOE vs. APOE models). Page 20 Discussion This is the first GWAS utilizing part of the wide array of AD-relevant phenotypes and biomarkers available in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset. The phenotypes analyzed here related either to clinical diagnosis (i.e. AD or MCI) or to levels of CSF biomarkers revolving around various biochemical species of amyloid or tau proteins. While GWAS results have already been reported for some of the biomarkers analyzed here (e.g. in ADNI), ours are the first to combine genomic and biomarker data in the newly established EMIF-AD MBD dataset. The main findings of our study can be summarized in the following five points: 1) the most prominent genetic signals in analyses of either diagnostic outcome or phenotypes related to CSF-A\u03b242 were observed with markers in or near APOE, which is in good agreement with equivalent analyses in ADNI and other datasets; 2) our analyses identified one novel association in analyses of CSF-A\u03b238 and CSF-A\u03b240 levels and DNA sequence variants in ZFHX3 (a.k.a. ATBF1 [AT-motif binding factor 1]), although these signals were not replicated in the ADNI dataset; 3) using CSF-tau species (i.e. Ttau and Ptau), we confirmed the previously described association with SNPs in GMNC, including the recently reported effect modification by sex at this locus; 4) PRS analyses revealed that AD risk SNPs are mostly associated with phenotypes related to CSF-A\uf06242 but not CSF-A\uf06238 or CSF-A\uf06240 or CSF-tau; 5) exclusion of APOE from the PRS analyses suggest that non-APOE AD GWAS SNPs explain at most 2.5% of the phenotypic variance underlying a diagnosis of AD in this dataset. Collectively, these results implicate that the genetic architecture underlying many traits relevant for AD research in EMIF-AD MBD compare well to other datasets of European descent paving the way for future genomic discoveries with additional phenotypes available in this unique cohort [11] .\nDespite these promising first results, our study is potentially confined by a number of possible Page 21 limitations: First and foremost, despite the breadth of available phenotype data, the overall sample size of the EMIF-AD MBD dataset is comparatively small and, as a result, may not be adequately powered to detect genetic variants exerting smaller effects. To a degree, this limitation is alleviated by the fact that many available outcome phenotypes are of a quantitative nature, which are more powerful than analyses of dichotomous traits (e.g. disease risk). Second, many of the phenotypes available in EMIF-AD MBD are not currently ascertained in other, independent datasets (such as ADNI), making independent replication of any novel findings difficult. This situation can be expected to improve somewhat once the phenotypic breadth in ADNI and other cohorts is extended. Still, until independent replication is available, novel GWAS findings from EMIF-AD MBD must be interpreted with caution.\nThis includes the putative association between CSF-A\u03b238 and CSF-A\u03b240 and markers in ZFHX3, which were highly significant and consistent in EMIF-AD MBD but not replicated in ADNI. Until more independent data on these outcome traits are available, the ZFHX3 association should be considered \"provisional\". In this context it is comforting, however, that many well-established genetics findings (such as the association between APOE and measures of CSF-A\u03b2 or GMNC and CSF-tau) were reproduced in EMIF-AD MBD. Third, while the genome-wide SNP genotype data was generated in one run of consecutive experiments in one laboratory, the same is not true for the phenotype measurements, which were performed locally in each of the 11 participating sites. In some instances, the compiled phenotype data are not based on the same biochemical assays across sites for some variables, e.g. measurements of tau protein. While the EMIF-AD MBD phenotype team went to great lengths to alleviate this potential problem by normalizing variables for each center (see Bos et al. [11] for more details), the possibility of artefactual findings owing to phenotypic heterogeneity remains.\nFinally, as described in the overall cohort description manuscript, the EMIF-AD MBD dataset is not designed to be \"representative\" of the general population but was assembled with the aim to achieve approximately equal proportions of amyloid+ vs. amyloid-individuals in all three diagnostic Page 22 subgroups. While this ascertainment strategy does not invalidate our GWAS results per se, they may not be generalizable to the population as a whole. However, this limitation may affect any study with clinically ascertained participants and, thus, applies to most previously published GWAS in the field, including those performed in ADNI.\nIn conclusion, our first-wave of GWAS analyses in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset provides a first important step in a series of additional genome-wide and epigenome-wide (using DNA methylation profiles) association analyses in this valuable and unique cohort.
