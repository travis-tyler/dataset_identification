[{"section_title": "", "text": "positions five to six years after graduation (Sauermann and Roach, 2012). The combination of an increasing number of graduates and a flat or decreasing number of tenure-track positions has caused many PhDs to seek careers outside of the traditional academic path (Cyranoski et al., 2011;Taylor, 2011; Fix the PhD, 2011). In a study of over  (NSF, 2009) found that only ~ 14% of PhDs in the biological sciences held tenure-track research faculty ABSTR ACT. The world of science continues to train and grant degrees to an abundance of eager young investigators, yet the number of tenure-track positions in oceanography and related fields is not increasing. Nevertheless, academic institutions and scientific research programs still largely emphasize academic careers for PhD recipients. Rarely do graduate programs explicitly provide information on, or preparation for, careers outside of the university setting. Here, we describe a series of four workshops on careers and networking that were organized and led by graduate students and postdocs from the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE). This grassroots effort allowed young scientists to sculpt and organize the information and training sought by their peers. As these efforts were highly successful, we recommend that graduate students at other academic institutions consider using this approach. * Authors contributed equally to this work. 1 The Survey of Earned Doctorates is an annual census of all individuals who receive research doctorates from a US academic institution in an academic year (July 1 through June 30 of the following year). The 2009 census covered individuals who earned doctorates in the academic year ending June 2009. NSF's Science Resources Statistics division compiled the results of the survey. 2 For easier reading, we will use the term \"students\" to collectively refer to graduate students and postdocs."}, {"section_title": "B Y D A N I E L A B \u00d6 T T J E R * , S E A N P.
