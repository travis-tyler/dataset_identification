It benefitted greatly from the NIH's emphasis on improving MRI acquisition and analysis methods prior to initiating high-throughput data collection. The HCP-style paradigm differs from common practices (the 'traditional paradigm') in the human neuroimaging community that emerged during the early years of PET and functional MRI (fMRI). These include (i) voxel-based (volumetric) analysis of data acquired at relatively coarse spatial and temporal resolutions on small groups of subjects; (ii) extensive unconstrained spatial smoothing that attempts to compensate for imperfect cross-subject alignment, improve signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and satisfy oversimplified statistical assumptions 13 ; (iii) analysis without using parcellations at all, or using parcellations either derived from Brodmann's 2D schematic drawing or from locations relative to gyri and sulci; and (iv) the reporting of summary results using 3D volumetric standard space coordinates while keeping the extensively analyzed data private. Relative to the new paradigm, the traditional paradigm has limitations in spatial fidelity, neuroanatomical fundamentals and the robustness of cross-study comparisons, along lines also noted by Turner 14, 15 .\nThough most neuroimaging studies still use the traditional paradigm, important exceptions dating as far back as the 1990s include numerous studies on retinotopy that used fMRI data to map the arrangement of visual areas on cortical surface models of individual subjects 16, 17 . Thanks in part to this emphasis on surface-based analyses, the visual system is one of the better-understood functional systems in the human brain. We anticipate accelerated progress in understanding other brain regions as the new paradigm is applied to them more routinely.\nA solid conceptual understanding of MRI acquisition, preprocessing and analysis (tenets 1-5) is important for applying the HCP-style paradigm to one's own studies, as well as for understanding the methodological choices made by the HCP and its successors (see below). Many of these choices were driven by fundamental properties of human brain anatomy, the physics of MRI, and human physiology."}, {"section_title": "Tenets 1 and 2: multimodal data acquisition informed by brain anatomy and physiology", "text": "Comprehensive noninvasive brain mapping of many subjects using multimodal MRI. The HCP acquired ~4 h of structural, functional, and diffusion images (along with auxiliary 'field map' images to help with image preprocessing). The structural images were T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) images (see Supplementary Note 1 for a discussion of the relationship between these terms and MRI contrast). These images allow noninvasive measurement of architectural properties such as myelin content within the cerebral cortex and cortical thickness that match well with corresponding invasive measures [18] [19] [20] . The structural images also generate geometrical models of brain anatomy (cortical surface meshes and subcortical segmentations 18, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ) that are critical for all other analyses. The functional images included task-based fMRI, in which the subjects carried out behavioral tasks while in the scanner 29 , and resting-state scans, in which subjects fixated on a crosshair. These functional images enable measurement of functional activation within brain areas and functional connectivity based on correlations of the fMRI signal between brain areas in the absence of a task or controlled external stimuli. They can also map the internal topographic organization within brain areas, such as the ordered representation of visual space within visual areas using task-driven 16, 17, 30 or resting-state-based 9 methods (visuotopic organization). The similarity of these detailed maps across species 31 and in comparison with invasive studies in nonhuman primates 32, 33 confirms that fMRI can accurately capture properties of brain organization. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) uses directionally dependent water diffusion within white matter to encode average axonal fiber orientations, which can be connected by streamline tractography algorithms to estimate brain structural connectivity, yielding results that are modestly correlated with invasively measured anatomical connectivity 34, 35 . dMRI also allows estimates of microscopic structural properties of brain tissue, such as the integrity and orderliness of axons (for example, refs. [36] [37] [38] . Thus, the HCP MRI data enable brain architecture, function, connectivity and topography to be estimated noninvasively. The large number of subjects (~1,100) imaged by the HCP enables statistically precise estimation of these measures in the healthy young adult population and investigation of the nature and extent of their individual variability, while the focus on twins (and their non-twin siblings) enables assessment of their heritability."}, {"section_title": "How brain anatomy drives MRI spatial resolution.", "text": "The cerebral cortex, the seat of human cognition, is a folded sheet 1.6-4 mm thick (mean ~2.6 mm) with a surface area of ~1,000 cm 2 per hemisphere 19, 39 . High quality structural images (both T1w and T2w) are vital for generating accurate geometrical models upon which all other analyses are based (surface meshes for the cerebral cortex and gray matter regions of interest for the subcortical structures) 6 . For the main HCP, we acquired these images at an isotropic spatial resolution of 0.7 mm (voxel cubes 0.7 mm on each side), enabling accurate individual subject maps of cortical myelin content and thickness together with precise models of the inner (white matter) and outer (pial) surfaces. In general, we recommend acquiring T1w and T2w images at 0.8 mm isotropic or better (half the minimum thickness of the cortex), in contrast to the single 1-mm T1w image traditionally acquired. Such high-resolution images benefit from tightly fitting, multichannel radio frequency receiving head coils, such as the Siemens 32-channel head coil used by the HCP.\nFor fMRI, it is important to acquire images of sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish among cortical gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid and white matter, and between opposite banks of cortical folds. The HCP acquired high-resolution fMRI data at 2 mm isotropic (with high resolution fMRI defined as having voxels smaller than the mean cortical thickness of 2.6 mm; Supplementary Fig. 1 ) on its customized 3-tesla (3 T) scanner (and at 1.6 mm isotropic at 7 T). High-resolution fMRI, in contrast to resolutions as low as 4 mm that have been traditionally used in fMRI, enables more precise localization of functional signals 6 .\ndMRI aims to address a fundamentally resolution-starved problem: mapping connections through brain white matter whose individual axons are mostly <1 \u00b5m in diameter 40 with MRI voxels that exceed 1 mm isotropic, contain hundreds of thousands of axons 41 and typically include multiple populations of fibers crossing in various directions. Both of the HCP consortia used customized MRI scanners and pulse sequences to acquire in vivo human diffusion data of unprecedented npg r e v i e w resolution 5, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] 46, 48) , in contrast to the 2-2.5 mm resolution of traditional dMRI. The recently introduced Siemens Prisma MRI scanner (80 mT/m), developed in part because of the HCP, enables the community to acquire similar dMRI data.\nFaster, longer imaging for cleaner fMRI data and more robust estimates of white matter fiber orientation. Most MRI-based functional imaging relies on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism, in which increased neural activity indirectly alters the regional deoxygenated hemoglobin content over a time course (hemodynamic response function) of many seconds 49 . Accordingly, one might think that it is sufficient to acquire fMRI images at intervals modestly faster than the hemodynamic response function (a repetition time (TR) of 2-3 s has been typical for whole brain imaging). However, fMRI images are corrupted by many sources of time-dependent (temporal) artifacts, including subject movement, physiology and scanner instability. Many artifacts occur more rapidly than the typical fMRI volume TR and thus are aliased into the signal. High-temporal-resolution fMRI data (i.e., TR < 1 s) facilitates more selective and effective artifact removal 7, 8 and improves statistical efficiency, particularly for multivariate statistics 50 . Recent data also suggest that there may be faster components to the BOLD response 51, 52 , which would be better captured with faster scans. The HCP acquired fMRI data at TR = 0.72 s for 3 T and 1 s for 7 T using MRI pulse sequences that acquire many brain slices at a time ('multiband' or 'simultaneous multislice' echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences; Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ) 5, 44, [53] [54] [55] . For diffusion imaging, using these sequences to reduce the TR allows more images to be acquired with diffusion weightings at different strengths and along a larger number of unique spatial directions in the same amount of time. The resulting higher angular resolution and effective SNR enables multiple fiber populations to be more robustly identified in each imaging voxel, helping to resolve crossing fiber pathways and improve tractography 5, 45 .\nThe HCP used 1 h of scan time for each of three modalities: task fMRI, resting-state fMRI (rfMRI), and diffusion imaging. This enabled data for seven fMRI tasks to be acquired, covering multiple cognitive domains and involving most of the brain 29 (http://protocols. humanconnectome.org/HCP/3T/task-fMRI-protocol-details.html), along with four 15-min resting-state fMRI runs (helping to provide more stable connectivity estimates 56 ) and 270 different diffusion measures (90 unique diffusion directions for each of three different diffusion weighting strengths; i.e., 'shells'), enabling better fiber orientation and tissue microstructure modeling at high resolution 57, 58 . See Supplementary Note 4 for particulars on various HCP-Short protocols optimized for subjects who are less tolerant of long scans than are healthy young adults.\nTenets 3 and 4: optimizing the precision of data analysis Aligning all MRI modalities within the subject's physical space. A key early task of preprocessing is to align all MRI modalities so that every image volume is in the subject's undistorted physical space. Head movements occur in the scanner, both between acquisition of each dataset and during acquisition. Because head movement during T1w and T2w images causes uncorrectable blurring, the HCP acquired at least two pairs of T1w and T2w images and used all scans that were rated as good or excellent in overall quality 12 (see Supplementary Note 5 for further discussion of this issue and potential solutions). Spatial effects of movement during fMRI or dMRI acquisitions can be corrected after the fact using image registration to realign the images; however, movement also induces temporal variations of image intensities that must be corrected through other means described below. Movement between images of different modalities is corrected with advanced registration algorithms that use knowledge of brain tissue boundaries and the expected image intensity gradients across those boundaries to align images 59 .\nIdeally, image registration within each subject would entail simple translations or rotations, but MRI images have many forms of spatial distortion and must be unwarped before images faithfully represent the individual brain's real physical dimensions and thus can be precisely aligned. These distortions all derive from imperfections in the scanner's encoding of physical space using perturbations (linear gradients) of the main magnetic field. All MRI images are slightly distorted by small nonlinearities in the space-encoding gradients that are correctible using information measured and specified by the scanner manufacturer (gradient distortion; Supplementary Note 6). In addition, placement of the subject's head in the scanner induces idiosyncratic variations in the magnetic field (field inhomogeneities), particularly near the air-filled spaces in the head (sinuses and ear canals), which can be measured using the auxiliary field-map scan mentioned above. Correcting these distortions with a field map is critical for accurately aligning data across modalities within each subject, although traditionally this scan is often omitted, leading to poor alignment in some brain regions. Scanner vendors provide a standard field map scan (based on gradient echoes), but the HCP developed an alternative 'spin echo EPI field map' that is faster, at least as accurate and also enables correction of fMRI image intensity biases (Supplementary Note 7). These field map scans should exactly match the geometry and distortion properties of the functional imaging scans. Diffusion imaging scans have additional 'eddy current' distortions caused by switching on and off the strong magnetic field gradients used to generate diffusion weighting. The HCP developed a new algorithm for correcting eddy current distortions that outperforms previous methods and allows quality control and outlier detection (Supplementary Note 8) [60] [61] [62] . With field maps, advanced distortion correction methods and anatomically informed registration algorithms, the HCP's spatial preprocessing pipelines 6 precisely align the T1w, T2w, fMRI and diffusion data to the subject's physical space while minimizing interpolation-induced blurring by combining all spatial transformations in a single spline interpolation.\nCleaning time-dependent artifacts from MRI time series data. In functional imaging, many processes other than the BOLD-related fluctuations of interest cause time-dependent intensity fluctuations. This structured temporal noise is especially problematic for resting-state functional connectivity because it uses correlations of noisy signals in different parts of the brain rather than correlation of a predefined noiseless task design with noisy data. Temporal noise can either increase or reduce functional connectivity artifactually and lead to incorrect conclusions [63] [64] [65] . Major sources of structured temporal noise include subject movement, subject physiology and the physics of MRI. It is useful to consider the fMRI time series as containing fluctuations arising from (i) the BOLD signals of interest, (ii) structured temporal noise and (iii) unstructured random Gaussian temporal noise 12 . Temporal cleanup aims to remove temporal noise as selectively as possible while minimizing the impact on the BOLD npg r e v i e w signals of interest. The HCP devised a method based on independent components analysis (ICA) 66 , which splits the fMRI time series into structured components and unstructured noise, representing all of the temporal variance. The structured components are then categorized by a machine learning classifier (FIX) into signal and noise 7, 8 , and the noise components are removed by regressing them out of the data. For HCP data, the ICA+FIX approach removes spatially specific (i.e., affecting only part of the brain in a particular way) structured noise components and retains spatially specific BOLD signal components (i.e., resting-state networks) with better than 99% accuracy 7, 8 . In contrast, traditional approaches, which include bandpass filtering, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression, and censoring of high-motion frames 64, 65 , are not as selective at targeting structured noise while preserving BOLD signal. However, a controversy remains about 'global' fluctuations in fMRI (Box 1, Supplementary Note 9 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), as the spatial ICA+FIX approach is not designed to separate these global fluctuations in the average fMRI signal into signal and noise components. For dMRI, subject motion and physiology can cause signal loss. Such outliers can be detected using a new approach that builds a model of the diffusion signal from all of the data, allowing artifactual measurements to be identified and replaced with estimates of what the signal should have been (Supplementary Note 8) [60] [61] [62] .\nThe traditional approach to reducing unstructured Gaussian noise involves spatial and temporal smoothing, which unfortunately affect both signal and noise unselectively. A common problem in traditional neuroimaging is that smoothing mixes the gray matter functional signals of a given brain area with signals from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and nearby brain areas, markedly reducing the spatial fidelity of neuroimaging data. Parcellation (tenet 6) enables averaging of data without mixing signal across different tissue types or between different brain areas to the extent that the parcellation is neurobiologically accurate. Thus, parcellation acts as a neuroanatomically informed method of nonlinear smoothing. Another option is to selectively smooth unstructured noise more than structured BOLD signal (Supplementary Note 10) . This reduces certain artifacts (Supplementary Fig. 7 ) and enhances SNR without concomitant spatial blurring and without invoking a brain parcellation.\nPreserving precision from voxels to CIFTI grayordinates. It is vital that the preprocessing and analysis techniques used on high-resolution HCP-style data maintain this hard-won spatial resolution. Besides removing distortions and accurately aligning data across modalities within each subject, the analysis must put the data into a framework that enables accurate cross-subject and cross-study comparisons (tenet 5, below). The traditional neuroimaging paradigm represents spatial data in a regular 3D array of voxels (an image volume) that reflects the output of the MRI image reconstruction process. Because the cerebral cortex has a folded, sheet-like geometry, it is advantageous to visualize and analyze cortical data on surface mesh vertices instead of volume voxels 16, 26, 27, 39 . However, subcortical gray matter structures are mostly globular in shape and remain best represented using volume voxels. To represent the inherently dual geometry of the brain, the HCP developed the CIFTI file format 6 ,"}, {"section_title": "Box 1 Global fMRI temporal fluctuations", "text": "How best to handle global signals and artifacts present in fMRI data is a hotly debated topic 63, 64, [106] [107] [108] . The core phenomenon involves slow and spatially widespread fluctuations in the fMRI time series. The average time series across the brain includes both neural signal (for example, the average of all the resting-state networks) and structured noise (for example, physiological noise), and the debate centers on whether the average time series should be regressed out of the data to remove the effects of global noise 63 or whether it should be preserved to avoid distorting neural signals by removing their average. Additive global noise will by definition artifactually increase 'full' correlations across the brain (especially problematic if it differs across groups), but removal of a global neural signal will artifactually decrease correlations across the brain and, more problematically, distort the pattern of correlations for particularly large or strong networks 63, 109, 110 What is needed to get past the current impasse is a method that selectively separates global signal from global noise. Though no such method is yet available, we offer several observations about global fMRI fluctuations. (i) In HCP data, the global signal (after ICA+FIX cleanup) is primarily a gray matter signal, with a near-zero amplitude in white matter voxels and low-level anti-correlation with cerebrospinal fluid (Supplementary Fig. 5 ).\n(ii) Within gray matter, the mean time course has much higher amplitude in sensory regions (for example, visual, auditory, vestibular and somatosensory cortex, plus the lateral geniculate nucleus and other thalamic nuclei) and is lower in the cerebellum and many neocortical cognitive regions ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Thus, the global signal is not uniform across the brain, or even across gray matter, and these observations constrain the possible sources of the global fluctuations, as follows:\nPhysiological effects. Substantial fMRI time series variance is attributable to physiological variables, including rate and depth of breathing, heart rate and end tidal partial pressure of expired CO 2 (refs. 111-113) . Indeed, any physiological process that affects global perfusion pressure of the brain (i.e., the above three or even yawning) may transiently alter the amount of deoxyhemoglobin in the brain and contribute to global, physiologically driven artifactual fluctuations of the BOLD signal. Different brain areas and tissue types may be differentially sensitive to such changes in perfusion pressure because of differing metabolic rates, which may explain regional differences in global signal amplitude.\nHead movements (direct, biophysical). Transient head movements are sometimes followed by global fluctuations in the fMRI signal, leading to suggestions that head movements could directly cause these fluctuations 63, 65, 107 . However, head movements are unlikely to cause global fluctuations directly, given the lack of a plausible biophysical mechanism for how head movement might induce tissue-specific and brain-area-specific effects on the fMRI time series, let alone globally uniform changes in signal intensity short of complete head coil exit and reentry (Supplementary Note 9).\nHead movements (indirect, neural). Head movements may induce neural responses in somatosensory, vestibular and/or visual systems that may in turn modulate wider brain activity in a pattern very consistent with that mentioned above.\nWidespread and/or high amplitude RSNs, average of the RSNs. As discussed above, a portion of the global fluctuations will represent the average of the RSNs with particular weighting toward more widespread or stronger networks. It will be important to separate global physiological effects from spatially widespread neural effects (using either extrinsic physiological monitoring or intrinsic fMRI-data-driven means that have yet to be developed). Short of a complete solution to the problem of global fluctuations, we note that some approaches to analysis (such as the use of partial correlation when estimating functional connectivity and multivariate measures in general) are much more immune to the effects of global noise fluctuations than others (for example, full-correlation functional connectivity and univariate measures in general) 114 . r e v i e w which integrates surface vertices and subcortical voxels into a single file and represents each major gray matter structure using the appropriate geometry (Fig. 1) . CIFTI gray matter vertices and voxels are called grayordinates. Analyses focusing only on grayordinates (for example, fMRI) dramatically reduce file sizes and computational burdens (Fig. 1) . For dMRI, surface representations allow more accurate anatomical constraints in tractography (for example, the white matter surface can be used as the cortical destination for tractography). The final common outputs of the HCP preprocessing and analysis pipelines are data sets in the CIFTI standard space 6 . Connectome Workbench natively supports CIFTI, and other tools (for example, FSL, FreeSurfer, FieldTrip and nibabel) are currently implementing CIFTI compatibility. In particular, FSL's PALM software enables permutation-based statistical inference on CIFTI data sets (http://fsl. fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) 67 . The CIFTI grayordinates analysis framework allows each brain structure to be registered using the approach best suited to it (tenet 5).\nTenet 5: accurately aligning brain areas across subjects and studies Cross-subject comparisons. Analyses that combine neuroimaging data obtained from different individuals benefit greatly from accurately aligning corresponding brain areas so that like is compared with like 15 . Alignment of subcortical and cortical structures is best achieved through differing means. Subcortical structures are less variable in size, shape and position across subjects, and reasonable alignment is achieved by nonlinear 3D registration to a standard template as in the traditional paradigm. The HCP currently uses FSL's FNIRT for nonlinear registration of T1w images to the MNI standard volumetric space, but registrations that also incorporate dMRI fiber orientations in the white matter may improve alignment of subcortical white matter fiber tracts (Supplementary Note 11) 68, 69 .\nFor human cerebral cortex, the complexity and variability of folding patterns and of areas relative to folds 39,70-72 presents a profoundly challenging, ill-posed problem for nonlinear 3D registration. Though alternative approaches such as hyperalignment (where alignment is not spatially constrained) are useful in some contexts, many neuroscientific questions are best addressed by aligning subjects to a common space. Registering cortical surfaces rather than brain volumes enables better alignment because accurate cortical segmentation of each subject reduces the dimensionality of the registration problem from 3D to 2D: alignment need only occur along the cortical sheet, as opposed to a 3D alignment of the folded sheet itself 27, 39, [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] .\nThough surface-based registration of the cerebral cortex to an atlas is not a part of the traditional paradigm, it has been adopted by a growing number of investigators. Most use surface registration based on cortical folding patterns 27,39,73-77 , which achieves geographic correspondence in regions where folding patterns are consistent across individuals and functional correspondence in regions where areal boundaries are consistently related to folding. Because cortical folding patterns are highly variable in many regions of cortex and their relationships to cortical areas are similarly variable, folding patterns alone are not enough to achieve alignment of (functional) cortical areas across most of the cerebral cortex. Registration needs instead to be driven by features that are more closely tied to cortical areas, such as architecture, function, connectivity and topography 78 . Such arealfeature-based cortical surface registration can dramatically improve the sharpness of group average maps and enhance group statistics, as it largely compensates for differences across subjects in cortical areal size, shape and position. Indeed, alignment based on myelin maps, resting-state network maps and visuotopic connectivity maps yields sharper task fMRI contrast maps with higher statistics, even though the task fMRI data are not used in the registration (Fig. 2) 9, 10 . Areal-feature aligned data were recently released by the HCP (dubbed \"MSMAll\" because they use the multimodal surface matching algorithm 10 and all of the useful modalities listed above). We believe that many studies will benefit from using areal-feature-based surface registration as a starting point, even if they choose to make final comparisons across subjects using other means; for example, hyperalignment 79 Supplementary Fig. 8 ), and they do not contain information about the spatial extent or boundaries of activation. Conclusive cross-study comparisons require assessment of the overlap of activated regions and whether their boundaries align or not. Cross-study comparisons also rely on the absence of any 'drift' in alignment between the studies (Supplementary Note 13 and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). When drift is eliminated and boundaries are compared, direct and conclusive assessments of cross-study agreement are possible ( Supplementary  Fig. 10 and see below)."}, {"section_title": "Tenet 6: neuroanatomically accurate maps of brain areas", "text": "Accurately subdividing the brain into its constituent parts (areas or parcels) has been a holy grail for brain cartographers and other neuroanatomists for more than a century [81] [82] [83] . The goal is to reliably identify parcels that are distinct from one another in architecture, function, connectivity and/or topographic organization and are consistently identifiable in most or all individuals. For neuroimaging, parcellation serves to (i) clarify 'where we are' in the brain when describing results 15 , (ii) facilitate comparisons across individuals and studies, and (iii) reduce the dimensionality of complex and noisy data sets while respecting neuroanatomically distinct boundaries. Parcellation can dramatically improve statistical sensitivity and power by averaging across neuroanatomically similar units of the brain, enhancing SNR and reducing the vast number of statistical comparisons often carried out in neuroimaging (circumventing problematic corrections for multiple comparisons that have affected a substantial fraction of the neuroimaging literature 13 ). As noted above, parcellation is an attractive alternative to traditional spatial smoothing for analyses that are interested in effects at the areal level (in practice, most studies that provide a standard space coordinate table). A cortical areal parcellation should ideally have four key qualities. (i) It should be based on many (hundreds of) well-aligned subjects so that it represents the typical areal arrangement in the studied population (for example, healthy young adults for the HCP). (ii) It should reflect complementary and converging evidence from multiple modalities across the whole cerebral neocortex for completeness and for higher confidence in boundaries. Most parcellation efforts to date have relied instead on information from a single modality, such as architecture 71, 84 , retinotopy 17, 30 or resting-state fMRI [85] [86] [87] , and often do not cover the whole hemisphere. (iii) It should reflect existing terminology for areas previously reported in the neuroanatomical literature and rational terminology for newly defined areas. (iv) It should be possible to automatically replicate the parcellation in individual subjects' data sets on the basis of multimodal areal fingerprints, even in subjects with atypical areal arrangements or those from future studies. The recently reported HCP Multi-Modal Parcellation, version 1.0 (HCP_MMP1.0) meets these criteria 9 , but we expect that this will not be the final word on cortical parcellation. Analogous multimodal parcellations are also needed for subcortical structures and the cerebellum.\nThe HCP_MMP1.0 parcellation (Fig. 3) contains 180 distinct areas per hemisphere, symmetrically arranged across the two hemispheres. Eighty-three areas correspond reasonably well with areas defined in one or more prior studies and were assigned the same names, while 97 were assigned new names. The group average parcellation was used to train a machine-learning classifier (a multilayer perceptron 88 ) to enable a fully automated process for identifying areas in individual subjects on the basis of each area's multimodal fingerprint, even in individuals having atypical topological arrangements of areas (Supplementary Fig. 11 ).\nMore generally, the classifier can reliably detect cortical areas in individual subjects without using the HCP's task fMRI data (using only myelin maps, thickness maps, resting-state network maps and restingstate visuotopic maps), enabling generalization of the approach to many non-HCP neuroimaging data sets. Individual investigators wishing to apply the HCP Pipelines, areal-feature-based registration and trained areal classifier to their own individual subjects need only acquire T1w, T2w, field map and fMRI data as described above, as even non-resting-state fMRI data include similar patterns of connectivity 89 . The population-based parcellation can also be applied directly to registered individual subjects, though it will not be accurate where individual subjects deviate from the typical layout of areas. The HCP's multimodal 'hard' parcellation v1.0 provides a neuroanatomical foundation for future neuroimaging analyses, though other 'weighted' approaches provide valuable complementary information as well (Supplementary Note 14) . It is worth noting that FreeSurfer Figure 2 Improved intersubject registration using information based on areal features in addition to cortical folding. Top row: group task-fMRI z-statistic maps (story vs. baseline contrast from the language task on the left and the two-back (2BK) vs. zero-back (0BK) contrast in the working memory task on the right) from 120 HCP subjects in the first and second quarter data releases after intersubject registration using the multimodal surface matching (MSM) method constrained only by folding (FreeSurfer's 'sulc' maps). Bottom row: sharper group task-fMRI maps and higher z-statistics obtained when using resting-state networks (RSNs) along with myelin maps to constrain the registration. Circled areas and arrows indicate regions of increased contrast in the areal-feature-based registration compared to the folding-based registration. Subject recruitment procedures and informed consent forms, including consent to share de-identified data, were approved by the Washington University institutional review board. Data at http://balsa.wustl.edu/97V4.\nnpg r e v i e w uses an algorithm to automatically label gyri and sulci in individual subjects based on manually generated training labels that is similar in spirit to our areal classifier 90 .\nTenet 7: routine data sharing and advanced informatics for data management Data sharing for individual laboratories. Data may be publicly shared at many levels, including extensively processed, preprocessed and unprocessed stages, together with the code used for analysis. Data sharing is increasingly mandated by journals and funding agencies. Although the HCP has shared its data using an advanced informatics infrastructure (described below), most individual investigators only publish their results in journal articles, as the additional time and informatics skills required for more expansive data sharing have made it impractical. Generating and editing manuscript figures is typically a tedious process involving multiple software applications that neither work efficiently together nor aid in preparing data for sharing after publication. Routine sharing of extensively processed data would be expedited by a streamlined process for generating publication-ready figures that is integrated with a service for easy post-publication sharing of the associated data. An integrated approach to data visualization, figure generation and data sharing is now available. Connectome Workbench, a freely available general-purpose neuroimaging visualization platform, provides a flexible interface for displaying rich, multimodal neuroimaging data sets. Workbench enables visualization of various data types overlaid on surfaces or volumes (NIFTI, GIFTI or CIFTI files). Multipanel montage figures can be generated by combining web-browser-like tabs that can also be annotated (for example, with text, symbols and imported image panels) directly in Workbench. For example, Figure 4 is one of 42 published figures in one study 9 exported from Workbench without further editing. Importantly, Workbench allows such complex displays to be saved as 'scenes' , which can be quickly reopened, edited, resaved and exported as publication-ready images. Data from such figures can be shared by uploading the scene file to the BALSA database (http://balsa.wustl.edu/) 11 directly from Workbench, together with basic information about the publication. Scene-specific URLs enable one-click linking from a published figure to the corresponding page in BALSA (see figure legends) . Adoption of similar strategies by other neuroimaging software and databases would accelerate sharing of extensively analyzed data and facilitate more accurate and diverse comparisons across studies.\nLarge-scale data sharing and an advanced informatics infrastructure. Well-designed data management tools and processes are vital for the successful collection and analysis of high-quality HCP-style data on a large scale. ConnectomeDB (https://db.humanconnectome.org/), the primary database for HCP data, was designed for user-friendly sharing of unprocessed and preprocessed data from a large number of individual subjects, which can be selectively downloaded using a variety of flexible criteria 12, 91 . ConnectomeDB is based on the XNAT informatics platform (http://www.xnat.org/) 92 , which manages imaging data through a structured workflow from acquisition to quality control to automated processing 91 . It also provides data entry and import tools npg r e v i e w for task and biometric data collected during image acquisition, as well as behavioral and other nonimaging data. ConnectomeDB also serves as the data management platform for the Lifespan Connectome projects, has been deployed by some Connectomes Related to Human Disease projects (see below), and can benefit other groups carrying out large-scale HCP-style studies (source code at http://www.xnat. org/download/). Given the complexity of the HCP project and the massive size of the HCP datasets, documentation and distribution required a multifaceted approach (Box 2).\nHCP-style follow-up studies. The original (healthy young adult) HCP will be succeeded by several large-scale imaging projects that use HCP-style data acquisition, analysis and sharing to study different populations in health and disease. Data sharing for many of these projects will be managed by the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF; http://www.humanconnectome.org/ccf ), an NIH-funded resource devoted to supporting data sharing from the Connectomes Related to Human Disease projects (11 currently funded, with more anticipated in 2017) plus three Lifespan HCP projects (Fig. 5) . The CCF is an extension of the ConnectomeDB infrastructure and will provide a common interface for searching within and across projects. In addition, it is developing common acquisition protocols and maintaining the HCP's processing pipelines to maximize cross-study comparisons and analysis, and it is partnering with other connectomics studies, such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study and UK Developing HCP (http://www.developingconnectome.org/), to encourage harmonization of acquisition and analysis methods. Versions of the HCP-Short protocol (Supplementary Note 4) have been adapted for a variety of vendors and scanner models, with the goal of producing images of similar spatial and temporal resolution."}, {"section_title": "Concluding comments", "text": "The NIH had two interrelated core goals in launching the HCP: (i) to generate a publicly shared, widely used repository of high-quality multimodal neuroimaging data suitable for mapping the human connectome and (ii) to advance the methods used in neuroimaging research. More than 140 studies have acknowledged the use of HCP data, and for half of these the authors were largely or entirely outside the HCP consortium (https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/ x/YQDJAw). These studies address a wide range of questions using various imaging modalities. Five brief examples highlight some of this progress. Smith et al. 93 identified a \"positive-negative\" phenotypic axis that covaries with differences in the strength of functional connectivity in a subset of brain regions that are generally implicated in higher cognitive functions. Yeo et al. 94 investigated the overlap and segregation of the brain's functional networks, finding that association regions tend to overlap with at least two networks whereas somatosensory and visual regions are more isolated. Wang et al. 95 investigated functional network parcellations at the individual level using HCP data. Hawrylycz et al. 96 demonstrated correlations between gene expression patterns in post-mortem human cortex and HCP-based in vivo functional connectivity. Tavor et al. 97 showed that a model npg r e v i e w relating task-independent (rfMRI) measurements to task activity can accurately predict task activation maps for unseen subjects, suggesting a coupling between brain connectivity and function at the level of individual subjects. After release of the final S1100 imaging and genotyping data (summer 2016) and the individual-subject cortical parcellations (projected autumn 2016), we anticipate that a growing fraction of studies using HCP data will use the full set of available subjects, better-aligned data, multimodal parcellations of group average and individual subjects, and family structure (for example, twins). Capitalizing on the full richness of the HCP data offers the best prospects for robust and neurobiologically grounded findings.\nEven with large amounts of high-quality data, it remains extremely important to use caution in interpreting complex neuroimaging data sets and the indirect inferences related to brain connectivity available from neuroimaging. Neither functional connectivity based on rfMRI nor structural connectivity based on dMRI tractography provides good quantitative estimates of the actual strength of direct anatomical connectivity between areas or regions. This reflects a variety of methodological biases and other limitations that have become better understood in recent years (Supplementary Note 15) 2, 35, 98 , but remain serious challenges even with the advances provided by the HCP-style paradigm. Research continues to further validate noninvasive connectivity methods and maximize their accuracy.\nThe HCP-style paradigm brings together a wide range of methodological advances, many provided by investigators or projects outside the HCP and others reflecting direct HCP innovations. New MRI scanner technology (Siemens Prisma) and pulse sequence technology (multiband) were developed in part through the HCP, enabling faster imaging of finer details. Many improvements in image distortion correction, registration and data-driven image denoising enable selective removal of artifacts while preserving the precision of the signals of interest. The CIFTI grayordinates analysis framework, together with areal-feature-based surface registration, largely compensates for individual variability across subjects without causing or resorting to blurring of the data. A multimodal cortical parcellation provides a new neuroanatomical foundation for studies of the human cerebral cortex and is a valuable prerequisite for generating areato-area connectomes in individuals and group averages. Intuitive, user-friendly data visualization software together with integrated neuroimaging databases and software pipelines enable easier data processing and sharing.\nThe overarching objectives of the HCP-style paradigm are (i) to acquire and analyze neuroimaging data as accurately as possible in each individual from their original brain imaging voxels to their individually mapped brain areas; (ii) to use precise intersubject alignment while avoiding smoothing to minimize blurring across brain areal boundaries when comparing results across individuals, groups and studies; and (iii) to routinely share neuroimaging data in a way that facilitates conclusive cross-study comparisons. Unlike traditional volume-based approaches that often result in statistically significant 'blobs' or 3D coordinates of unclear neuroanatomical identity, the HCP-style paradigm aims to remain as faithful as possible to the Box 2 Accessing and using HCP data, software and protocols Overview of the HCP's data sharing. ConnectomeDB (http://db.humanconnectome.org/) is the primary repository of HCP imaging, behavioral and demographic data. Three-tesla structural, functional and diffusion imaging data for ~1,100 subjects are shared in unprocessed, minimally preprocessed, and more extensively processed forms and staged over four major releases (Q1, Q1-Q3, S500, S900), with the final S1100 release slated for summer 2016. Seven-tesla data acquired on 180 subjects have been released in part, with the rest to follow shortly. Magnetoencephalography data acquired from 95 subjects give a window on fast temporal dynamics of the brain and were released in the fall of 2015 (ref. 115) . Notably, the S900 release and the forthcoming S1100 release include the improved intersubject registration provided by MSMAll. The HCP_MMP1.0 parcellation is available in BALSA (https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/RVVG), and individual subject parcellations for each HCP subject will be released on ConnectomeDB in the future (anticipated in fall 2016).\nHCP data set is much larger than those of past studies. With the high spatial and temporal resolution of HCP data, the data set is at least an order of magnitude larger than widely used open-access neuroimaging data sets such as ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu) 116 . For a single subject, the compressed NIFTI-formatted unprocessed data are around 10 GB, and the preprocessed data are nearly 30 GB.\nHCP data are widely used via multiple modes of data access. To date, >5,200 investigators have agreed to HCP open-access data-use terms (~520 to restricted-access terms for accessing family structure and other sensitive data). Users can (i) access ConnectomeDB directly to download packages for individual subjects, user-selected subject groups or HCP-specified groups; (ii) purchase Connectome-in-a-Box for the cost of the hard drives, which can be shared by investigators at a given institution; and (iii) access data via the Amazon cloud for processing on the cloud (or for download). Data downloaded directly from ConnectomeDB exceed 5,400 terabytes (TB), with an additional 2,000 TB transferred via hard drives (Connectome-in-a-Box) and the Amazon cloud.\nData documentation. The richness and complexity of the HCP data require extensive documentation for users to understand what is available, how the data sets are organized and how they were processed, including quality control measures. Available resources include (i) a Reference Manual associated with each data release (http://humanconnectome.org/documentation/); (ii) HCP course materials (lectures, tutorials and associated data, available at http://humanconnectome.org/courses/); (iii) publications (for example, for database organization) 91 ; and (iv) the HCP public wiki (https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/Home/), which provides additional documentation, answers to frequently asked questions, and updates (including known issues and planned fixes).\nSoftware sharing. Also important to the replicability of neuroimaging studies is the sharing of the software used for analysis. Scripts for HCP pipelines are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines/), and their usage is described in the HCP course materials. This includes pipelines for magnetoencephalography as well as MRI data. Connectome Workbench is available as binaries and source code (http://www. humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench.html, on GitHub, and at http://neuro.debian.net/) along with tutorials. Many of the labs that make up the HCP consortia also share their software on either their own websites or the HCP website. User Support. Users of the HCP's data and software are supported on the 'HCP-Users' mailing list (https://www.humanconnectome.org/contact/ hcp-users-request.php), where support requests are answered by HCP consortium members and other community members in a public forum so that all users may benefit. npg r e v i e w underlying neuroanatomy, even in the face of the remarkable individual variability of human brains. Indeed, the gains in spatial sharpness and clarity provided by the HCP-style paradigm (Fig. 6) are qualitatively analogous to those made in astronomy after the introduction of adaptive optics and space telescopes to overcome the atmospheric blurring that plagues conventional ground-based telescopes 99 . We provide concrete, generally applicable guidelines for individual laboratories wishing to embark on a new study using the HCP-style paradigm, though of course not all recommendations will fit every study, and methods will continue to improve (Supplementary Note 16) .\nWe propose that the diverse technological and conceptual advances in imaging integrated by and developed within the HCP meet the criteria of a new paradigm 100 for neuroimaging research. The HCP-style paradigm has a differing set of assumptions (for example, that blurriness in brain images is not a fact of life but an avoidable artifact of traditional methods and that neuroanatomical localization is critical to understanding the brain). It invokes new terminology and provides substantial new capabilities for further research. It is also disruptive to business as usual as practiced by the majority of neuroimaging investigators, and legacy data may not be easily comparable with ) from 10 post-mortem subjects mapped to a cortical atlas surface. Black arrows, locations where the volume-based mapping spreads across gyral and sulcal folds. Center: Surface-based registration of hOc5 from the same 10 subjects mapped to individual surface reconstructions, then to a surface-based atlas using FreeSurfer's folding-based surface registration method 74 . White arrows, outlier hOc5 from individual subjects that are not well aligned to the FreeSurfer group average owing to imperfect correspondence between areal boundaries and sulcal folds. The white oval is in the same location across all panels, showing how the volume-based alignment drifts away from the surface-based alignments, in addition to having substantially lower cross-subject overlap. Right: group average cortical myelin map (from 196 HCP subjects) with a yellow-orange-red hotspot indicating the MT+ complex and retinotopic areal maximum probability maps (MPMs) from 12 non-HCP subjects, both registered independently using arealfeature-based surface registration and de-drifted (Supplementary Note 13). As shown in Supplementary Figure 10 , the white dots represent a contour along which functional connectivity rapidly changes and which aligns with the border between retinotopic areas MT and pMST from a separate study. This is an example of the more conclusive cross-study, cross-modal r e v i e w data from the HCP-style paradigm while maintaining the new paradigm's improved standards of spatial fidelity and neuroanatomical localization ( Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Notes 17 and 18). Thus moving to the new paradigm should not be undertaken lightly. That said, we believe the benefits decidedly outweigh the costs, as the new paradigm opens up a variety of novel analysis strategies that will likely accelerate our understanding of human brain structure and function and may even prove useful in a clinical setting. Instead of relying on rough evidence of spatial proximity as in the old model, we aim in the new paradigm to precisely compare the overlap and boundaries of results from differing studies to see if they likely refer to the same brain areas or not. Additionally, we are able to separate differences in brain function or connectivity much more precisely from differences in brain areal size, shape and position. We can investigate the significance of variations in individual subject areal topologies from the population's typical topology. Finally, the HCP-style paradigm is better positioned to exploit further improvements in brain image acquisition that will enable even finer-grained study of the brain at the level of cortical layers or columns, as well as finer subcortical organization [101] [102] [103] . Nonetheless, the challenges to neuroimaging remain daunting, and we hope that new technologies and ideas will lead to further paradigmatic advances in the future."}]
