[{"section_title": "LIST OF FIGURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The elderly are commonly accepted as being vulnerable to natural hazards. Although the normative changes associated with aging might not apply to all members of this population, the elderly are generally at greater risk and more likely to be harmed throughout all stages of a disaster (Morrow, 1999). In the 2003 European heat wave, the worst natural disaster to affect the continent in the last 50 years, approximately 30,000 people died -primarily older people (Earth Policy Institute, 2003;United Nations Environment Programme, 2004). Two years later, when Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast, most Katrina victims were elderly (Associated Press, Oct 23, 2005;The Times, Feb 18, 2006). Although they comprised only 15 percent of New Orleans\" total population, over 70 percent of Hurricane Katrina-related deaths were among older people (AARP, 2006). As we saw most recently in Japan, the elderly bore the brunt of the initial impacts of the devastating earthquake and tsunami. The twin disaster took its heaviest toll on the elderly in Japan, where nearly 1 in 4 people is over 65 (Associated Press/The Huffington, March 17, 2011). Not only were the majority of deaths from the elderly population, but also at the time of this writing elderly survivors were still grappling with lost medication, hypothermia, dehydration, and respiratory diseases (The Guardian, March 17, 2011). \"We are aging -not just as individuals or communities but also as a world\" (U.S. National Institute on Aging, 2007). Indeed, a notable demographic trend in the United States is the rapid aging of the population (Population Reference Bureau, 2005). Because the Baby Boomer cohort (those born between 1946 and 1964) started entering their elderly years after 2010, there will be a significant growth in the nation\"s older population in ensuing decades (Figure 1-1). By 2030, the projected number of people 65 years and older will reach 72 million, nearly a 100 percent increase from the 2003 elderly population size (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). As the U.S. population is graying rapidly, older people\"s concerns and needs should not be subsumed under the broad banner of vulnerable groups (Humanitarian Policy Network, 2005). Given that the older population will grow more diverse as it grows larger, there is a heightened need to understand the traits of the elderly and the basis for their vulnerability. This chapter provides the background information and sets the stage for the research presented in this thesis. I begin with the introduction of the key concepts around which the thesis revolves, i.e., the elderly and vulnerability. I then provide an overview of literature that broadly addressed issues relating to vulnerability and go on to discuss challenges for contemporary vulnerability research. Next, I review prior work specifically concerning how the elderly are affected by natural disasters, weaving together threads of research from various disciplines: geography, sociology, psychology, and medicine. Finally, I identify the deficiencies in past literature and end with the research questions for and study area of this thesis."}, {"section_title": "Definitions and Key Concepts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Who are the elderly?", "text": "How old is old? Most industrialized countries accept the chronological age of 65 years as the definition of an older person while the United Nations refers to older people as those who are 60 and over. In contrast to the chronological milestones, old age in many developing countries is considered to start at the point when active contribution to society is no longer possible (Gorman, 1999). The blurring boundary between the old and the young in today\"s world makes it difficult to specify one universal numerical cutoff to mark later life. This research follows the developed nation standard and uses the chronological age of 65 and over as the definition of elderly."}, {"section_title": "What is vulnerability?", "text": "Vulnerability is a contested term. Broadly speaking, it refers to the potential of a system to be harmed (Cutter, 1996;Turner et al., 2003). Rooted in geography and natural hazards research, the term vulnerability has different disciplinary applications in fields like ecology, food security, public health, poverty and development, and climate change research (F\u00fcssel, 2007). Therefore, it is not surprising that the concept of vulnerability encompasses a variety of definitions. The range of definitions is a reflection of the various research traditions and is necessary to cover the full spectrum of the concept (Adger, 2006;Eakin and Luers, 2006;Gallop\u00edn, 2006). This research adopts the hazards-of-place model of vulnerability (Cutter, 1996). Here, vulnerability is interpreted as the integration of physical and social vulnerability in a geographical domain. In this heuristic model, risks are offset or amplified by mitigation to produce a hazard potential. The hazard potential is modulated by the geographical context to create physical vulnerability. In parallel, the hazard potential is filtered through the social fabric to determine social vulnerability. The interaction and intersection of physical and social vulnerability lead to the overall vulnerability of the elderly population."}, {"section_title": "Review of Literature", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Frameworks", "text": "Within the discipline of geography, researchers use different conceptualizations when the major approaches to vulnerability research vary significantly. The risk-hazard approach treats vulnerability as exposure to hazards driven by internal biophysical factors. Scholars following this lineage focus on assessing the exposure to hazards as well as the potential impacts on exposed populations. Political ecology sees vulnerability as a state constructed by socioeconomic, political, and cultural circumstances. Scholars adhering to this intellectual tradition focus on the root causes of vulnerability and stress the importance of access to resources and power before a disaster (Eakin and Luers, 2006). The two perspectives combine to produce Cutter\"s hazards-of-place model in which vulnerability is determined by both geographical and social contexts. It is noteworthy that in a coupled human-environment system, people are open to multiple stressors. In one instance, the vulnerability to natural hazards is likely to be compounded by climate change. Climate change vulnerability research has become an important component of the discourse of vulnerability. In the field of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as a function of a system\"s exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate variations (IPCC, 2001). This framework identifies three major dimensions of vulnerability and offers valuable insights into the understanding of vulnerability dynamics for my research."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessment", "text": "One common theme and central tool in vulnerability research refers to the measurement of vulnerability. Scholars have assessed vulnerability to identify vulnerable areas or groups, to quantify and visualize vulnerability, and to prioritize mitigation or adaptation actions (Moss et al., 2001;Cutter et al., 2003;Brooks et al., 2005;Rygel et al., 2006;Kleinosky et al., 2007). Early research on people\"s vulnerability to natural hazards gave considerable attention to physical vulnerability (Blaikie et al., 1994;Mileti, 1999). People are vulnerable because they are exposed to potential hazards. In order to delineate physical vulnerability, researchers mapped the distribution of hazards and then overlaid the results with the human occupancy of hazard risk zones (Cutter et al., 1997). Accordingly, they evaluated the extent and degree of loss of life and property from a potential harmful event drawn upon the spatial intersection of society and hazards. The appreciation of the role of socioeconomic profiles emerged later in the literature, as researchers realized that populations exposed to hazards are not equally vulnerable (Eakin and Luers, 2006). Individuals\" socioeconomic and demographic status differentiates their sensitivity and adaptive capacity -along with exposure, the other two dimensions of vulnerability -to hazards. To improve understanding of how these factors influence vulnerability, scholars developed social vulnerability assessment. A social vulnerability assessment commonly ends up with a single social vulnerability index (Cutter et al., 2003) by summing the selected vulnerability indicators. Constructed from a set of social vulnerability indicators, social vulnerability indices provide unitless comparative values over space (Cutter et al., 2003;Rygel et al., 2006;Kleinosky et al., 2007;Cutter and Finch, 2008). To inform a holistic understanding of the vulnerability of the elderly to one particular set of hazards at one particular place, I integrate physical and social vulnerability in the analysis. I assess physical vulnerability by examining the occupancy of hazard risk zones by the elderly. I measure social vulnerability based on the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the elderly. There is general agreement about the major factors that affect social vulnerability, including age, poverty, social capital, physical limitations, infrastructure and lifelines, gender, and race (Enarson and Morrow, 1998;Fothergill et al., 1999;Morrow, 1999;Cutter et al., 2003;Fothergill and Peek, 2004). Because my research aims to assess the vulnerability of the elderly, I do not simply take into account generic vulnerability indicators from the academic vulnerability literature. I believe there is a need to identify viable indicators for vulnerability of the elderly by investigating academic research not specifically aimed at vulnerability. I also believe that non-academic publications are another essential resource for understanding social vulnerability. For example, reports from HelpAge International (a non-profit worldwide federation of more than 75 national organizations providing care and support for older people) can broaden our knowledge of disaster impacts on the elderly, as well as our understanding of the concerns and needs of the elderly in natural disasters, from a non-academic perspective."}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Vulnerability Research", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conceptualization", "text": "As noted earlier, researchers from various intellectual arenas specify the concept of vulnerability differently; even researchers within the same discipline use different conceptualizations. The concept of vulnerability has been used in a wide range of research contexts other than in geography. Finding a universal language for vulnerability has been one common challenge in vulnerability research. F\u00fcssel (2007) reviewed the range of definitions of vulnerability and argued that continued plurality would become a hindrance in interdisciplinary research. A common definition of vulnerability is much needed to advance the understanding of vulnerability, yet reaching consensus is challenging. Some scholars have argued that previous attempts to develop a shared vulnerability framework were superficial (Pickett et al., 1999;Newell et al., 2005). A more thoughtful attempt by O\" Brien et al. (2007) distinguished outcome vulnerability and contextual vulnerability in climate change research. They argued the infeasibility of building an integrative conceptual model of vulnerability because the differences of framings and divergence of discourses underpinning the framings were too great to overcome. Although the concept of vulnerability is still multidimensional and contested, today many scholars agree that a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability entails the integration of geographical context and social fabric (Blaikie et al., 1994;Turner et al., 2003;F\u00fcssel, 2007;Polsky et al., 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Risk Perception", "text": "One of the challenges for vulnerability research is to develop vulnerability measures incorporating human perceptions (Adger, 2006). Kusenbach et al. (2010) used the term \"residual vulnerability\" to represent the counterpart of objective vulnerability. In their research, the investigators followed residual vulnerability closely by including disaster experiences, perceived risk, and preparations that might hamper residents\" evacuation readiness and consequently increase their vulnerability. Their findings revealed the paradox between the residents\" willingness to evacuate and inadequate preparation for disaster evacuation. Similar to that of household residents, Howe (2011) observed the gap between risk perception and preparedness among business owners. The mismatch does not provide an optimistic outlook for developing a robust quantification of vulnerability. My research does not address the issue of risk perception and vulnerability but does consider risk perception as an important determinant of vulnerability for the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Scale", "text": "Vulnerability is scale-dependent and inherently heterogeneous. Spatially, a country at the national level can be highly vulnerable to climate change while one city, one community, or even one household in this country may not necessarily be vulnerable to the same degree and in the same way. Temporally, a currently vulnerable system, for example, may become less vulnerable in the future after the appropriate implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions. Determining an appropriate scale is another challenge in vulnerability research. On the one hand, vulnerability assessments are expected to be comparable so that decision makers are able to identify common leverage points to reduce vulnerability (Easterling et al., 2000;Frich et al., 2002). On the other hand, the proposition that vulnerability is place-based has been widely recognized. The determinants of vulnerability are dynamic, site specific and system specific (Smit and Wandel, 2006). Key information can be lost after statistical aggregation (Klein, 2004) and that is why research at broad scales has been criticized for obscuring the details at smaller scales. Responding to this criticism, my research analyzes the vulnerability of the elderly at a local level."}, {"section_title": "Variable Weighting", "text": "This challenge is in particular associated with quantitative assessment of social vulnerability. In this case, researchers create a social vulnerability index based on a suite of vulnerability indicators by applying certain weighting strategies. In their assessment of social vulnerability to environmental hazards in the United States, Cutter et al. (2003) selected eleven indicators to calculate a social vulnerability index using an additive model, assuming the equal contribution (i.e., equal weighting) of each indicator to social vulnerability. Brooks et al. (2005) collected experts\" views through a focus group exercise and used different sets of weightings in the assessment of vulnerability to climate-related mortality at the national level. However, either weight averaging or expert-defined weights is problematic and subjective. Not all indicators affect vulnerability in the same way; the significance of the indicators can change from place to place. Scholars in the vulnerability community have tossed around how vulnerability indicators should be weighted. Rygel et al. (2006) attempted to attack the variable weighting problem by applying Pareto ranking to an assessment of the vulnerability of the Hampton Roads, Virginia metropolitan region to storm surge. Pareto ranking enabled vulnerability to be ordered based on multiple objective optimizations without the arbitrary practice of weighting the various vulnerability indicators. A simpler approach that might be adopted is to avert the weighting process by constructing separate indices representing different elements of vulnerability (Adger et al., 2004). My research uses both a single index and separate indices and compares the results from the two methods."}, {"section_title": "Prior Work on Vulnerability of the Elderly", "text": "Research studies from sociology, psychology, and medicine have examined agerelated vulnerability and demonstrated the patterns of disaster impacts on the elderly. Regarding the sociological impacts of disasters, the hypothesis of relative deprivation (Friedsam, 1961) indicates that elderly victims are more likely to over-report their disaster losses. Given that many older individuals have fixed incomes and their relative worth declines as they age, elderly victims of a disaster have a greater perception of loss than younger adults (Ngo, 2001). Moreover, research results from Kaniasty and Norris (1995) affirmed the \"pattern of neglect,\" a concept coined by Kilijanek and Drabek (1979), which stated that the elderly are less likely to receive external help including emotional support, informational support, and tangible support. In terms of the psychological impacts, there is no consensus reached on how vulnerable the elderly are. The inoculation hypothesis contends the elderly have lower psychological vulnerability resulting from their greater life experience and previous disaster exposure (Norris and Murrell, 1988;Ngo, 2001). Contradictorily, others postulate the elderly are not psychologically disaster-tolerant because of their diminished social circle from the multiple losses likely to occur in later life: deaths of spouses, friends, and relatives (Bell 1978;Oriol, 1999). The findings concerning the physiological impacts on the elderly are consistent in the literature. Old age is positively correlated with higher occurrences of mortality among the empirical studies. Degenerative diseases are common in the elderly and their presence has a positive influence on post-disaster mortality (Ngo, 2001). In addition, disasters impacts are disproportionately severe on those elderly without adequate transportation means and personal support (Bolin and Klenow, 1988;Seplaki et al., 2006;Rosenkoetter et al., 2007). Evacuation entails financial and social capital, such as vehicles and connectedness with relatives. Therefore, those elderly individuals with low socioeconomic status and low social connectedness are highly vulnerable. Some authors have claimed that the most vulnerable older adults are those who are housebound and need routine in-home care and services (Mensah et al., 2005;McGuire, 2007) because disaster-induced breakdown in lifelines affects life-support equipment, such as oxygen generators or electric wheelchairs (Fernandez et al., 2002;California Department of Aging, 2004). Moreover, the elderly are less tolerant of changes in temperature (Shock, 1977) and more susceptible to dehydration (Papper, 1973). A host of age-related characteristics and age-dependent changes can impair the capability of the elderly to prepare for a disaster, to process risk communication and evacuate in a disaster, and to recover after a disaster (Ngo, 2001;Mayhorn, 2005). Basically, factors that put the elderly at an increased risk include but not limited to the following: fixed retirement income, ambulatory difficulty, cognitive degradation, antecedent health problems, and lack of social network. It is even proposed that older adults on fixed incomes are more likely to reside in areas at higher risk, where buildings are older and more likely to suffer damage (California Department of Aging, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Deficiencies in Past Literature", "text": "Greater decline in mobility, health conditions, and socioeconomic status with age tends to erode the coping capacity of the elderly during the various stages of a disaster, amplifying their sensitivity to its effects while limiting their capacity to adapt, thereby shifting their vulnerability in varying ways with differing degrees. While sociologists, psychologists, and physiologists have widely studied age-related vulnerability, an appreciation of spatial contexts is missing in the research. In contrast to other social scientists, geographers tend to be more concerned with spatial contexts and to argue that vulnerability is place-based and system-specific (Smit and Wandel, 2006;Eakin and Boj\u00f3rquez-Tapia, 2008). Among the analyses of vulnerability, age is an important consideration and has been repeatedly cited as an indicator of vulnerability (O\"Brien and Mileti, 1992;Hewitt, 1997;Morrow, 1999;Cutter et al., 2000;Wu et al., 2002;Cutter et al., 2003;Kleinosky et al., 2007;Cutter and Finch, 2008) because the elderly are more difficult to move and subject to health complications from certain hazard events (O\"Brien and Mileti, 1992;Cutter et al., 2000). It is assumed that the higher the proportion of elderly in a community, the more vulnerable and less resilient it is (Cutter and Finch, 2008). There is no empirical work, however, that specifically addresses the vulnerability of the elderly in a spatial context in the United States to confirm this critical assumption. As the elderly population continues to grow in size and diversify in characteristics, their vulnerability will also grow in complexity, so it is imperative that we attempt to confirm this assumption before the task grows more difficult. Consequently, my research uses Sarasota County, Florida as a case study to analyze the vulnerability of the elderly to hurricane hazards."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions and Objective", "text": "The purpose of this research is to understand the vulnerability among the elderly in Sarasota County, Florida by incorporating physical and social aspects of vulnerability in the analysis. The analysis poses the overarching research question, how vulnerable are the elderly to hurricane hazards and are all elderly people equally vulnerable? To answer this central question, I ask three subsidiary questions:"}, {"section_title": "1)", "text": "What are important indicators of the vulnerability of the elderly? 2) How does geographical location shape vulnerability? 3) How do socioeconomic attributes shape vulnerability? The first subsidiary question identifies viably important vulnerability indicators that capture the characteristics of the elderly during a hurricane and sets the stage for subsequent analyses of physical and social vulnerability. The second subsidiary question looks at the interaction between location and vulnerability. I inventory hurricane hazard risk zones and measure physical vulnerability by using a geographical information system (GIS) to overlay the locations of the elderly and the distributions of these risk zones. The third subsidiary question investigates the interplay of socioeconomic profiles and vulnerability. I conduct an indicator-based assessment of social vulnerability of the elderly and visualize the variations in vulnerable segments of the elderly spatially and quantitatively. The insights gained from those separate solutions to each subsidiary question will combine to elicit a comprehensive answer to my overarching research question."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "To address these research questions, this thesis presents a case study of the elderly in Sarasota County, Florida. Sarasota County is located on the west-central Gulf Coast of Florida. It has four incorporated cities and towns: the City of Sarasota, the City of North Port, the City of Venice, and the southern portion of the Town of Longboat Key ( Figure   1-2). In addition to these incorporated areas, Sarasota County is home to many unincorporated areas such as Bee Ridge, Englewood, Southgate, and many others (not shown). The majority of Sarasota County is located within the Gulf Coastal Lowlands along which barrier islands, spits, and lagoons are developed. The county has a very flat topography with elevations ranging from mean sea level along the Gulf Coast and the lower Myakka River to a maximum of approximately 100 feet in the extreme northeastern part of the county (Campell, 1985). The northeast is generally higher than the southwest but elevations increase imperceptibly (Lane, 1973 (Figure 1-3). Therefore, Sarasota County presents an excellent case for studying the vulnerability of the elderly to hurricane hazards."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "In our aging society, as the elderly population is growing in size and diversifying in characteristics, it is imperative to understand the composition of the vulnerable elderly and the basis for their vulnerability to natural hazards. This thesis uses Sarasota County, Florida as a case study and addresses vulnerability at a local level. By performing a detailed analysis of vulnerability that targets the elderly population and synthesizes both the physical and social aspects of vulnerability, this study is expected to help inform well-tailored vulnerability-reduction measures by decision makers. The subsequent five chapters will detail the methods, findings, and conclusions of this thesis.   Fothergill et al., 1999). The chapter organizes the resulting indicators and variables using the Vulnerability Scoping Diagram (Polsky et al., 2007). For the second phase, to answer the question regarding location and vulnerability, Chapter 4 measures physical vulnerability by using GIS to overlay the locations of the elderly and hurricane risk zones to investigate whether the elderly are prone to hurricanes hazards because they concentrate in certain areas. For the third phase, to unveil how social standing affects vulnerability of the elderly across space, Chapter 5 performs a social vulnerability assessment and creates social vulnerability indices using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to demonstrate the variations quantitatively and spatially in vulnerable segments of the elderly. The three phases are independent, but related because the results of the first phase of the research set the stage for the second and third phases. In Chapter 6, the insights gained from these separate solutions combine to provide a holistic basis for answering the grand research question. It is important to note that this chapter does not provide a thorough explanation of how I applied the methods used in Chapters 3, 4, and 5. Instead, it provides the rationale for using those methods, as well as a brief literature review for the methods. I determined that providing details on the methods in the context of the indicator analysis, physical vulnerability assessment, and social vulnerability assessment (i.e., embedding details of the methods in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively) would be more informative than isolating those details in a formal methods chapter.\nWith the assistance of the four-stage typology and VSD, this chapter identified factors explaining the capability and efficacy of the elderly to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and reconstruct their world after a hurricane disaster. The social vulnerability indicators include financial capital, aging-in-place, risk perception, health and nutrition, physical and mental changes, social capital and living arrangement, psychological impacts, and educational attainment. At the same time, the vulnerability of the elderly to hazards is modulated by physical aspects of vulnerability -i.e., the elderly\"s occupancy of hurricane risk zones -which is the subject of Chapter 4.\nThis chapter performed an indicator-based analysis of potential social vulnerability of Sarasota\"s elderly population and produced five separate social vulnerability indices to assess the degree and composition of their social vulnerability. The five indices have their basis in the five principal components from the PCA, which extracts key socioeconomic and demographic determinants of the elderly\"s sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Note that there are more individual variables with high loadings on these components than the general names can express. Among the five components, higher positive scores on the \"poor and disabled old-old with a limited social network\" (C2), \"elderly in group quarters\" (C3), and \"poor young-old\" (C4) mean greater social vulnerability while higher absolute negative scores on \"financially secure young-old\" (C1) and \"financially affluent elderly\" (C5) translate into greater social vulnerability. Social vulnerability hotspots, including the most and second-most socially vulnerable block groups, are marked with red and orange, respectively, on the maps.   With home design overlooking the special needs of the older people, aging-in-place can increase the vulnerability of those uninstitutionalized elderly during a disaster even though it attends to the need for autonomy."}, {"section_title": "Phase I: Indicator Identification and Selection", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Four-stage Typology", "text": "In the first phase, Chapter 3, I identify viable vulnerability indicators and specify potential proxy variables for these indicators by applying a four-stage typology to findings from the literature and publications from HelpAge International. This typology is modified from an eight-stage analysis that Fothergill et al. (1999) and Fothergill and Peek (2004), respectively, employed to synthesize previous studies regarding patterns of race and ethnicity related to disaster and patterns of poverty related to disaster in the  (3) dimensions, (4) components, and (5) measures of the vulnerability process in question (Polsky et al., 2007). In this research, the hazard refers to hurricanes and the associated outcomes include damage from hurricane winds, storm surge, rainfall and flooding. The exposure unit focuses on the elderly population. The dimension of exposure captures potential for loss of the elderly from biophysical factors whereas the dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity exhibit the elderly\"s potential to be harmed associated with socioeconomic factors. The components and measures correspond to the vulnerability indicators and proxy variables, respectively, and can be quantitative or qualitative. The VSD provides two major functions: (1) to act as a starting point for understanding the details of vulnerability of an entity and (2) to build a basis for metaanalyses of vulnerability assessments (Cutter, 2001(Cutter, , 2003Polsky et al., 2007). In addition, it is a useful template for working with stakeholders to check the validity of components and measures so as to better inform policy-making. In one instance, Pearsall (2009) employed the VSD in consultation with local residents and planners to identify components and measures that contribute to vulnerabilities of New York City to the hazard of soil contamination. Similarly, Moreno and Becken (2009) applied the diagram to a climate change vulnerability assessment for coastal tourism in Fiji and used it to connect science and policy by engaging stakeholders in the activity. In the Human-Environment Regional Observatory (HERO) project, researchers adopted the VSD to compare the vulnerability of local water supply systems to the impacts of drought across four study sites with varying human and natural landscapes in the United States (Sorrensen et al., 2005;Polsky et al., 2007). More recently, a group of scientists are creating a web-based Vulnerability Assessment Support System (VASS) built on a participatory VSD (Yarnal and Howe, 2011 AAG;Coletti et al., 2010 AAG).\n"}, {"section_title": "Phase II: Physical Vulnerability", "text": "In \nThis phase dealt with the second subsidiary research question about the interaction between geographical location and vulnerability among the elderly. A physical vulnerability assessment of the elderly characterized this phase. I examined the spatial patterns of potential storm surge and flooding from hurricanes, and depicted the locations of critical structures and the elderly population. In accordance with the perspective treating physical vulnerability as a preexisting condition primarily caused by the dimension of exposure, the elderly are only considered vulnerable to hurricane hazards when they reside in the hurricane hazard zones in the analysis. To discern how the elderly place themselves in relation to storm surge and flood risk zones and in turn their physical vulnerability, I used a GIS to overlay the distributions of the elderly and hurricane hazards. Because Sarasota County has very little relief, a large proportion of the county is vulnerable to storm surge and floods produced by hurricanes. The results showed the barrier islands, low-lying coastal areas, and inland areas in the vicinity of the Myakka River are most prone to these hurricane hazards. About 4 percent of the county is currently at risk of storm surge from the weakest (category 1) hurricanes whereas over 20 percent is susceptible to storm surge from the strongest (category 4-5) hurricanes. Precipitation-induced flooding from hurricanes may exacerbate the impacts caused by storm surge and affect locations much farther inland. Currently, approximately 20 percent of the county\"s total land area is located in the high risk zones subject to 100-year floods. The majority of the county\"s evacuation routes and hospitals can be exposed to a combined storm surge and flood risk in the worst cases. It is evident that many of the elderly in Sarasota County have put themselves in harm\"s way by occupying the barrier islands and low-lying portions categorized as storm surge and flood risk zones. A substantial number of the elderly live on Longboat Key, the southern portion of Siesta Key, coastal Sarasota and coastal Venice, and parts of inland North Port around the Myakka River. These elderly are thus most physically vulnerable to the compound hazard of hurricane storm surge inundation and precipitation-induced floods. In addition, the county has a concentration of nursing homes or assisted living facilities for elderly built in the storm surge and flood risk zones. Future decision-making should steer the development of the institutions for the elderly away from these higher risk areas."}, {"section_title": "Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model", "text": "To define exposure to storm surge, I use maps based on the outputs from the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model encompassing Sarasota County. The SLOSH model accounts for storm surge values from a combination of a storm\"s windspeed, its motion, and the bathymetry of near-shore waters; it is best used for defining the potential maximum surge for a location (National Hurricane Center, 2010a). The model has been widely used to determine areas at risk from storm surge (Jelesnianski et al., 1992;Wu et al., 2002;Kleinosky et al., 2007) including Sarasota County (Frazier et al., 2010a Categorizing a geophysical phenomenon as a natural hazard, however, requires the interaction between the event and people. Consequently, I overlay the locations of the elderly and storm surge risk zones to interpret the occupancy of the elderly in these risk zones, and subsequently explain their physical vulnerability to storm surge. One weakness associated with the SLOSH model is its exclusion of storm size or local topography when predicting storm surge. For this reason, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced a new hurricane scale called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (National Hurricane Center, 2010b) without ties to specific storm surge effects for each hurricane category. In the new scale, storm surge forecasts will be re-expressed in terms of height above ground level. The new approach to storm surge prediction is not available in time for my research. I know about the weakness of tying storm surge to hurricane category but choose to stick with the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale given (1) the older scale is still the standard being used by scientists and local stakeholders and (2) the uncertainty on when revised categories will be promulgated and how they will influence risk mapping."}, {"section_title": "Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)", "text": "To define exposure to hurricane related rainfall and flooding, I use the FEMA "}, {"section_title": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)", "text": "Principal components analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure used to reveal relationships among a multitude of original variables in terms of a smaller set of uncorrelated principal components that are linear combinations of the original variables (Goddard and Kirby, 1976;Pett et al., 2003).

Given the absence of an agreed-upon, robust weighting strategy, I prefer to adopt another approach proposed by Adger et al. 2004, which is constructing separate indices representing different elements of vulnerability. The results of the PCA will identify a set of the most influential indicators (principal components) and prepare for the construction of these separate social vulnerability indices. Following the PCA, I use the component scores generated by the procedure to estimate each block group\"s ranking on the principal components and accordingly to produce a series of maps indicating the degree of social vulnerability by individual principal component. By analyzing social vulnerability disaggregated by component, I avert subjective weighting decisions as well as the loss of information in aggregation."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This chapter corresponds to the first phase of the analysis.

These perspectives are necessary for the understanding of agerelated issues and how they apply to vulnerability. Next, I transition from a more abstract discussion of concepts towards a more applied discussion, in which I examine and summarize vulnerability indicators and proxy variables for the elderly via a four-stage typology. I close with a VSD that visually represents the resulting indicators and variables. From this exercise, I conclude that a number of factors combine to shape the vulnerability of the elderly during a hurricane disaster.\nSome scholars have defined physical vulnerability as the vulnerability of the physical environment (Pelling, 2003) and others have interpreted the term as whatever is physically at risk of being affected when people place themselves and the built environment in harm\"s way (Cutter et al., 2000). For example, people within the World Bank\"s Hazard Management Unit (Dilley et al., 2005) used the concept of physical vulnerability to represent the weakness of human-built physical systems (e.g., buildings and infrastructure) as a function of hazard severity whereas Cardona (2004) related physical vulnerability to a fusion of the degree of exposure, the fragility of the exposed elements, and the human settlements in hazard-prone zones. While the definitions of physical vulnerability vary, the term primarily refers to the exposure of an entity to a source of potential harm (Yarnal, 2007). Although there is no definitive definition of physical vulnerability, it is clear that this aspect of vulnerability relates to location. For instance, Florida residents living in flood plains, low-lying areas, and barrier islands are highly physically vulnerable regardless of their socioeconomic profiles because they are exposed to hurricane hazards. As noted in the introduction to this thesis, classifying a geophysical phenomenon as a natural hazard requires the interplay of the event and something that people value. The assessment of physical vulnerability often involves the specification of the occurrence probability of a given hazard and the descriptions of areas likely to be influenced (Cutter et al., 1997). In this thesis, therefore, the level of exposure to hurricane hazards and the human occupancy of hurricane hazard risk zones determine the degree of physical vulnerability and, as a result, the measurement of physical vulnerability integrates the distribution of hurricane hazards and the elderly population within Sarasota County. In the following physical vulnerability assessment, I examine the spatial patterns of potential storm surge and flooding associated with hurricanes, depict the locations of critical structures, and combine the elderly\"s occupancy of the defined risk zones."}, {"section_title": "Terms Related to Diversity within the Elderly Population", "text": "In 1974, sociologist and psychologist Bernice L. Neugarten coined the terms young-old and old-old to highlight the diversity within the older population. She categorized people between 55 to 74 years old as young-old and those 75 and older as old-old. Her seminal paper, \"Age Groups in American Society and the Rise of the Young-Old,\" proclaimed that the elderly were as diverse as the younger generation. In that paper, she also made a distinction between those who are relatively healthy, affluent, independent, and active (the young-old) and those who do not have these traits in their later years (the old-old), arguing that social policies must be need-based rather than strictly age-based (Neugarten, 1974). Since Neugarten\"s time, the terminology used to define the older population subgroups has varied. Authors often use the ages of the group to define the population they are discussing. For example, sometimes the older population is divided into three subgroups, with the population ranging from 65 to 74 years defined as \"the young old,\" the population 75 to 84 years called \"the aged,\" and the population 85 years and over termed \"the oldest old\" (U.S. Census Bureau, 1996;Werner, personal communication, 2011). However, Neugarten (1981) thought it important to be aware that the classification of the older population solely in chronological terms is expedient but not necessarily accurate. My research simply breaks the older population into two groups -the young-old (the population that is 65-74 years old) and the old-old (the population 75 years and over) -to probe how the elderly population differs within and across its component subgroups with respect to vulnerability. In most cases, the young-old are much less vulnerable than the old-old when facing a natural hazard. Nonetheless, when inventorying the vulnerability of the elderly, we should take into account multiple variables beyond chronological age because the elderly are as diverse demographically and socioeconomically as their younger counterparts, with variations attributable to differences not only in chronological age, but also in health status, sensory functions, financial resources, social capital, and so on. Some chronologically older elderly are healthy, strong, and immune to age-dependent diseases while some younger elderly depend on regular medical treatment to survive. Some of the elderly are financially well off, such as many of the \"snowbirds\" that spend the winter at their second home in Sarasota County, while some elderly permanent residents may live below the poverty line and receive government assistance. Some elderly live with or near their children, maintaining social interconnectedness, while others live alone, suffering widowhood. In short, the older population is mixed in needs, capabilities, and resources and therefore demonstrates differing degrees of vulnerability to natural hazards."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Indicators and Proxy Variables", "text": "There is general agreement about the major factors that place populations at greater risk: age, gender, race, poverty, and son on (Enarson and Morrow, 1998;Morrow 1999;Fothergill et al., 1999;Cutter et al., 2003;Fothergill and Peek, 2004 (1) the results of indicator identification for vulnerability of the elderly using a four-stage analysis, and (2) the visual conveyance of the vulnerability indicators using the VSD."}, {"section_title": "Stage I: Preparedness", "text": "Preparedness can be understood as proactive actions taken to reduce the potential negative effects from future disasters (Coppola, 2007). show drug prices now climb faster than inflation (AARP, 2010) and older people can be doubly disadvantaged because of the prevalence of age-dependent diseases and attendant health-care costs in later life stages. In addition, some older people, mainly women, act as caregivers to grandchildren and this grandparenting tends to add an additional burden on the elderly because of the extra claims on their limited financial resources (HelpAge International, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Stage II: Occurrence of the Hazardous Event", "text": "While a hurricane is passing an area, i.e., that period after preparedness and right before emergency response, the elderly are particularly vulnerable physically and perhaps psychologically. One factor that may increase that vulnerability is aging-in-place."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 2: Aging-in-place", "text": "Aging-in-place is a concept emphasizing the importance of, as well as the strategies for supporting people so they can grow old at home as long and comfortably as possible (Rowles, 1993;Chapin and Dobbs-Kepper. 2001;Tang and Pickard, 2008). It is a movement, a policy approach, an industry, a housing and care alternative, a solution, and a dream to the approaching \"silver tsunami\" Tenenbaum, 2010). Growing old at home offers alternative living and care arrangements for older people who prefer to stay at home or in a home-like environment. It also enables a growing segment of the elderly, particularly those with an independent mind, to delay or avert the move to institutional care. According to an NPR report, only 5 percent of Americans ages 65 and older live in long-term care institutions like nursing homes and 9 out of 10 older people want to grow old in their own homes after they retire (NPR, 2010). However, aging-in-place is a double-edged sword from a vulnerability perspective. As people age, the incidence of illness and disability increases. For those living alone and staying put as they age, information flow and external assistance is generally reduced. Moreover, as a person ages, their home also ages; without homeretrofitting or original home design accommodating the special needs of older people, aging-in-place will increase the vulnerability of the elderly in a disaster even it caters to their dignity and pursuit of autonomy during non-disaster times. The uninstitutionalized older population is more vulnerable while the storm is occurring. First, nursing homes or formal assisted-living facilities are overseen by federal, state, and local jurisdictions and have to meet certain standards (Mitchell and Kemp, 2000), such as the enforcement of building codes. In contrast, high wind, flooding, and storm surge induced by a hurricane may wreak havoc on the aging homes of uninstitutionalized older people. Second, the uninstitutionalized population, let alone the sick and frail older people with physical limitations and sensory impairments, may not know how to react during a storm or make adjustments when facing a disaster without guidance. Third, during a power outage during and after the event, it is much easier to locate and reach institutionalized older people compared to those who are not affiliated with any institutions."}, {"section_title": "Stage III: Response", "text": "Emergency response refers to actions aimed at limiting injuries, loss of life, and damage to property and the environment that are taken as soon as it becomes apparent that a hazardous event is imminent. It includes not only those activities that address the immediate needs (first aid, search and rescue, and shelter) to ensure the survival of a maximum number of people affected, but also involves the rapid resumption of critical infrastructure (such as opening transportation routes, restoring communications and electricity, and ensuring food and clean water distribution) to allow recovery to take place (Coppola, 2007). There is a host of factors that has an impact on the capacity of older people to respond to a disaster at the individual level."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 3: Risk Perception", "text": "As stated in Chapter 1, this research does not address the issue of risk perception and vulnerability, but it is undeniable that risk perception is a fundamental characteristic that influences the ability of the elderly to respond to a disaster. The elderly have a lifetime\"s accumulation so that they tend to perceive larger loss of material possessions than younger people do (Friedsam, 1961;Ngo, 2001). Moreover, many elderly people assume that after longtime residence at one place, they are more familiar with local weather-related anomalies and believe they can ride out the disaster as they did last time. Thus, because of their emotional attachments to material possessions and places of residence, and because of their previous experiences with disasters, the elderly tend to discount their need to comply with evacuation mandates (Arbore, 2007;Henderson et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 4: Health and Nutrition", "text": "Survival largely relies on immediate access to relief following a disaster. Differentiated from other groups, the elderly have specific and special needs related to health and nutrition. They are disproportionately affected by a disaster unless disaster relief has been sensitized to the special concerns of this vulnerable group. Older people are more likely than younger people to have mobility problems and chronic illness such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the event of a disaster, they often cannot walk long distances to access relief and service points or compete in queues for relief packages due to the limited physical strength (HelpAge International, 2000). In addition, they may not be able to chew and digest food supplies because of their worn-and-torn teeth. Currently, the Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MRE) packages made available to older people after a disaster usually contain too much sodium, fat, and calories and have the potential to send some into glucose shock from too much sugar or to raise their blood pressure from too much sodium (CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 5: Physical and Mental Changes", "text": "Age-dependent changes are associated with degradations in attention, memory, text comprehension, and decision-making (Mayhorn, 2005). Nerve endings may weaken and lose their sensitivity, which affects all the faculties. Poor vision and hearing can affect balance and mobility. Furthermore, the physical changes in the brain and nervous system may result in short-term memory loss and sometimes in acute confusion and disorientation, especially when familiar patterns and environments are disrupted (HelpAge International, 2000). Consequently, the elderly are more likely to become casualties due to their difficulty in processing risk communication and in evacuating an area during the response stage. For example, it is not easy for the elderly to discriminate between similarly colored objects and to adapt to darkness (Jackson et al., 1999). In another instance, auditory decline results in decreased sensitivity at higher auditory frequencies and hearing-impaired elderly are less able to hear warnings on the radio or TV (FEMA, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Stage IV: Recovery and Reconstruction", "text": "This stage pertains to the activities associated with getting the population back to normal life. Compared to response (taking hours to weeks), recovery is longer term (taking weeks to months) and refers to getting the infrastructure fully operating so that the socioeconomic system can function, at least at a rudimentary level. Reconstruction follows recovery, hypothetically extending from months after disaster to several years later (Fothergill et al., 1999;Fothergill and Peek, 2004;Coppola, 2007). It is the longest-term process and means putting the system back to its pre-disaster state or moving it to an improved, more resilient state. During recovery and reconstruction, older people who are invisible during the response process are also disadvantaged and highly vulnerable. Research results show the elderly are disproportionately vulnerable because they suffer more severe losses and recover slowly (Friedsam, 1961;Glass et al., 1977;Klenow, 1983, 1988;Tanida, 1996). Physical limitation, fixed retirement income, and lack of social network impair older people\"s recovery and reconstruction after a disaster (Ngo, 2001;Mayhorn, 2005 connections, and emotional and practical support (Hoffman, 2005). Together with the aforementioned components, other contributing factors are reviewed in the following."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 6: Social Capital and Living Arrangement", "text": "As people age, they may experience decreasing social interaction accompanying retirement and the loss of a spouse. According to Role Theory, individuals learn to perform new roles, adjust to changing roles, relinquish old ones, and therefore become integrated into society (Cottrell, 1942). The elderly are more likely to lose roles than to acquire new ones. Retirement and dependency take the place of relationships and roles typical of adulthood (Cavan et al., 1949) and retirement-derived erosion of social identity and decline in self-esteem (Rosow, 1985) facilitate the elderly\"s withdrawal from society (Cumming and Henry, 1961). The reduced social interaction later brings about social isolation, eventually causing the lack of social network for the elderly. Loss of a spouse also accounts for the diminishing social capital of the elderly.  International, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "\uf0b7 Indicator 8: Educational Attainment", "text": "Educational attainment is another influential factor during recovery for the elderly. In general, people with a higher level of education tend to have greater incomegenerating ability and access to resources and services.

But these vulnerability indicators are selective rather than exhaustive. For instance, gender is a confounding factor in constructing the vulnerability of the elderly. Men and women age differently. It is significant that women outlive men and women mostly marry men who are older than they are. As a result, older women are more likely to be widowed than older men are (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Widowhood can be a precursor to poverty and isolation because the minimized financial social networking puts older women in harm\"s way. At this point in the development of our understanding of the elderly, it is too complicated to handle the vulnerability of the elderly from a gender perspective, so that variable will not be part of my analysis.

Particularly exposed to hurricane landfall are southern Florida, the Carolinas, and the Gulf Coast (Keller, 1999;Hyndman, 2006;Barnes, 2007). Human populations are concentrated along coasts (Adger et al., 2005) and coastal populations have become a rapidly growing segment of the world population. Globally, nearly one quarter of the world\"s population lives within 100 km of the coast (Small et al., 2003). Concern is mounting that population growth with climate change as a multiplier will compound the effects of hurricanes, thereby threatening the sustainability of coastal communities (Whitehead et al., 2000;Trenberth, 2005;Frazier et al., 2009;Frazier et al., 2010a National Hurricane Center, 2011a). Indeed, inland floods bring great risks to interior communities that are normally buffered from the strongest winds and storm surges. Moreover, floods can rupture sewer and water lines and consequently cause water contamination and significant health problems (World Health Organization, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane History of Sarasota County", "text": "Despite Florida\"s reputation as a hurricane magnet, Sarasota County has been affected less often compared to many other parts of the state. It has not suffered a direct hit by a hurricane since 1944. Prior to that date, the 1921 storm (storms before 1950 were not named) was the first hurricane that wrought structural damage to the county in the twentieth century (Sarasota Herald Tribune, October 17, 2010a). The storm made landfall near Tarpon Springs, with Tampa being the hardest hit area, but the impacts went beyond the shores of Tampa Bay and Florida\"s west coast (Barnes, 2007). \"In Sarasota the tidal surge of more than 7 feet inundated Casey, Siesta, St. Armand's, Longboat and Anna Maria Keys and sent the water from Sarasota Bay past Five Points in downtown Sarasota.\" This incident as an unanticipated trigger transformed the county from a fishing village to a resort city, making its bayfront more attractive to tourists (Sarasota History Alive, 2011). Hurricanes continued to bypass Sarasota after the 1921 storm until 1944. In 1944, a big storm known as the Havana-Florida Hurricane (Barnes, 2007) or the Florida-Cuba Hurricane (Sumner, 1944), came onshore south of Sarasota with gusts in excess of 100 mph at Vamo, near Nakomis. The category 3 storm maintained its strength northward while crossing the state and generated a considerable storm surge causing extensive damage in Florida. The most severe damage from the surge was seen along the Florida west coast. In Sarasota, the low-lying areas were inundated; statewide, the citrus crop was destroyed by the storm (Barnes, 2007). Although there was little loss of life in Florida, total property damage was over $100 million (Sumner, 1944 (Barnes, 2007). Sarasota\"s immunity from hurricanes in the future remains uncertain. There is no scientific consensus of future characteristics of hurricanes but research results generally show that the future is likely to have more intense tropical cyclones in the context of climate change (Trenberth, 2005;IPCC, 2007). In addition to the changing geophysical processes, anthropogenic factors, such as the continuing trend of population increase and coastal development, may also contribute to the county\"s physical vulnerability to hurricanes (Cutter et al., 2000;Whitehead et al., 2000;Wu et al. 2002;Kleinosky et al. 2007;Frazier et al., 2010a).

Social vulnerability can couple with physical vulnerability to provide even greater insights to the state of vulnerability among the older population in Sarasota County. For example, all elderly people on barrier islands are physically at great risk from hurricane hazards but individuals may exhibit markedly different degrees of social vulnerability. In another instance, some elderly may live in areas relatively far from the coast but may still be quite vulnerable to major hurricanes because they possess higher sensitivity and limited capacity to adapt. By investigating the socioeconomic standing of the elderly, I am able to differentiate their sensitivity and adaptive capacity so as to reveal a more holistic picture of their vulnerability to hurricane hazards.

After reorganization, I obtained 64variables with 204 cases (i.e., all census block groups in Sarasota County) per variable and chose them for inclusion in the PCA of social vulnerability. These variables embrace a range of topics including disability, income and poverty, living arrangement, language proficiency, telephone and vehicle availability, and types of housing tenure. The variables parallel the vulnerability indicators portrayed in the VSD such as financial capital, health and nutrition, physical and mental changes, social capital, and living arrangement. Some of the variables suggested by the VSD were left out of the PCA because data were unavailable. Table 5-1 lists the 64 items grouped by topic with names and descriptions.

In that sense, PCA is a variablereduction technique. Perhaps more important is that a rotated PCA identifies the main modes of variation in the dataset.

Here, I used 0.6 as an arbitrary threshold across which loadings were considered strong or high. The items with salient loadings on C1 refer predominantly to the young-old population (from 65 to 74 years old) who are, for example: (1) owners of their housing units (0.979); (2) at or above the poverty level (0.969); (3) disabled or not (0.963 and 0.966); and (4) with vehicle and telephone available (0.954 and 0.944). Each of these variables is consistent with one another because the ownership of housing units, telephones, and vehicles signify livelihood security, if not personal wealth. When a hurricane hits, this group perhaps is less sensitive to hurricane hazards for several reasons. First, they may have invested more in emergency preparedness and built higher coping capacity than elderly people without these attributes. Second, having a telephone enables these people to call first responders for help and to keep in touch with family members and friends during disastrous events. Having telephones available as a communication option helps people maintain information flow even though phone services can be unreliable in hard-hit areas. Third, this group can evacuate an area quickly because they possess personal transportation. In addition, owner-occupants, in contrast to renters, are more likely to undertake home maintenance (Galster, 1983;Sweeney, 1974). Consequently, owneroccupied dwellings will demonstrate higher structural resistance to the impacts of hurricane hazards than rented dwellings. Overall, these items reflect a young-old population with a solid financial base regardless of their disability status. It is therefore possible to label C1 \"financially secure young-old.\" It is noteworthy that there are other variables loading moderately high on C1. Interestingly, these variables are not clearly conceptually related to the aforementioned items. However, a common theme runs through a few of these variables. The co-residence within C1 of both the old-old and young-old population suggests analogous social vulnerability to hurricane hazards. It may further imply that being in good health and having intra-family resource sharing can counteract disadvantages among the old-old. Future studies could separate out these two groups with a closer examination. The 16 items of C2 assemble a variety of items indicating the health, wealth, and living arrangement of the entire older population, but half of them substantially concern the characteristics of the old-old population. These eight items capture those individuals who are: disabled old-old (0.736); renters (0.780); below the poverty line (0.599, rounded to 0.6); with $10,000-$45,000 U.S. (0.668) or lower than $10,000 U.S. (0.646) yearly household income; living alone (0.840); in non-family households (0.838); and with no vehicles (0.800). The other half of the items with high loadings includes both the old-old and the young-old and pertains to different types of disability and living arrangements. C2 can thus be labeled \"poor and disabled old-old with a limited social network.\" The older people falling inside this category can be triply sensitive. Because the probability of losing family members increases as people age, the old-old are more likely to live by themselves and have limited family support. Simultaneously, disability minimizes their everyday activity space and accelerates the waning of social connections. The decreasing social capital and increasing health expenditure in later life further weaken economic safety nets when antecedent financial limitations associated with fixed retirement income has already put these elderly in harm\"s way. Therefore, this group of poor and disabled old-old deficient in social capital can be particularly disadvantaged during any phase of a disaster. For example, before the onset of a hurricane, they may have more difficulty processing risk communication because of sensory degradation. Once the hurricane hits, they perhaps have to be housebound because they have no private vehicles for evacuation or they have mobility problems. After the hurricane strike, they may find it extremely hard to negotiate the changed environment and relief bureaucracy. Items loading significantly on C3 encompass the institutionalized elderly population living in group quarters generally (0.973) or in nursing homes particularly (0.971), and the elderly population (both institutionalized and noninstitutionalized) living in group quarters (0.947). The contents of these three items are relatively homogeneous so C3 can be labeled \"elderly in group quarters.\" The group comprising C3 is special not only because it casts light on the elderly not living in households, but also because the subsets of the group, institutionalized and noninstitutionalized elderly, are heterogeneous in terms of vulnerability. In the event of a hurricane, the institutionalized older populations are less socially vulnerable compared to those living in group quarters other than institutions. It is plain that tangible assets (for example, medical equipment and supplies) or intangible resources (for example, staff knowledge and skills) of nursing homes and other institutions matter to the elderly in their daily lives, let alone in times of an emergency. Four high-loading items constitute C4, including young-old renters (0.600) without vehicles (0.635) that are either below the poverty level (0.760) or have household income less than $10,000 U.S. per year (0.736). Conceptual coherence simplifies the naming of C4: \"poor young-old.\" Despite the vulnerability primarily caused by poverty, better health and broader social networking that comes with being a member of the young-old population may offset the shortage of financial capital to some extent. Hence, the group may not be as vulnerable as the group making up C2, the \"poor and disabled old-old with a limited social network.\" C5 is composed of two dominant items loading above or equivalent to 0.6. These items relate to the entire older population (the young-old and the old-old) that has annual household incomes greater than $200,000 U.S. Therefore, C5 can be labeled \"financially affluent elderly.\" Again, the level of available financial resources is an overwhelming contributor to the vulnerability of the elderly no matter what the chronological age and this group in excellent financial condition is definitely less socially vulnerable than other groups. In summary, PCA with varimax rotation resulted in a five-component solution. The five components are \"financially secure young-old,\" \"poor and disabled old-old with a limited social network,\" \"elderly in group quarters,\" \"poor young-old,\" and \"financially affluent elderly.\" \"Financially secure young-old\" is by far the strongest component and explains most of the variance among the variables. The interpretation of the five components is in accordance with the insights gained from the four-stage typology and the VSD: variations of vulnerability of the elderly are attributable to differences in chronological age, financial resources, disability, living arrangement, and social capital. The PCA results support the use of these indicators for assessing the elderly\"s social vulnerability to hurricane hazards in Sarasota County.

Many of these block groups correspond to African-American, Hispanic, and Amish neighborhoods. One interesting finding is that St.   The scores on C3, \"elderly in group quarters,\" are mapped in Figure 5-5. Unlike those living in private households, the elderly residing in group quarters are unrelated persons so that the loose bonds they have with the wider community leads to low social cohesion. Moreover, they normally have severe physical or mental illness, requiring assistance for basic living activities and even long-term medical care. Generally speaking, the institutionalized elderly with access to authorized care are less vulnerable than the noninstitutionalized elderly living in group quarters other than institutions, although both tend to be more vulnerable than the elderly living in private households. In   Figure 5-6). No block group is classified into the lowest category (< -1.5 standard deviations) whereas quite a few are colored in light blue translating to a medium-to-low vulnerability. However, it is important to track these block groups because they can evolve to vulnerability hotspots when the elderly who opt for independent living at home (\"aging-in-place\") become less able to care for themselves. Maps for C4 and C5, \"poor young-old\" and \"financially affluent elderly,\" are delineated in Figures 5-7 and 5-8, respectively. For C4, the most vulnerable block groups (> 1.5 standard deviations) occur most often in the African-American and Hispanic parts of the City of Sarasota and some areas along the tributaries of the Myakka River in the City of North Port. In unincorporated areas, the vulnerability hotspots are situated in Palmer Ranch, again most likely because of the large mobile home estates in this area. Also of interest is the moderately high vulnerability demonstrated by the census units of Longboat Key (particularly the northern portion), Lido Key, and Siesta Key as they showed either a neutral or a low level of vulnerability in the first three components (C1 to C3). These areas are affluent and have a large number of automobiles. The explanation for this anomaly is that the renter population in these three desirable barrier island locations is so high that it overwhelms the other three variables that load highly on C4. With regard to C5, the lowest scores (< -1.5 standard deviations) represent the poorest elderly and thus the highest vulnerability. The vulnerability hotspots are overwhelmingly located in North Port close to the boundary between Sarasota and Charlotte County.

The impacts of hurricanes on the elderly depend on a set of interlocking factors, some of which have to do with location and some with the socioeconomic characteristics of the people living there. The social vulnerability assessment of this phase accounted for the dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the elderly. Here, the assessment created five social vulnerability indices in each census block group thereby making it possible to examine different elements of the elderly\"s social vulnerability. The five indices were based on the component scores generated in the Principal Components Analysis. The PCA with varimax rotation extracted five components including \"financially secure young-old,\" \"poor and disabled old-old with a limited social network,\" \"elderly in group quarters,\" \"poor young-old,\" and \"financially affluent elderly.\" They together explained a total of 75.7% of the variance, suggesting the variations of the social vulnerability among the elderly, for the most part, were attributable to differences in chronological age, financial resources, disability, living arrangement, and social capital. Among the five principal components, \"financially secure young-old\" accounted for most of the variance among the variables and thus implied being younger and wealthier than the average older population mattered most in determining the social vulnerability of Sarasota\"s elderly. These separate social vulnerability indices by individual principal component were well suited for illustrating both the degree and composition of the elderly\"s social vulnerability. For example, both the young-old and old-old in the City of North Port near the boundary between Sarasota and Charlotte County are most socially vulnerable because they in general tend to be poor. The elderly in the City of Venice are greatly socially vulnerable because many are disabled old-old who lack both financial and social capital. The City of Sarasota is of special interest because of its high density of socially vulnerable elderly. Within this city, a large proportion is occupied by socially vulnerable hotspots for different reasons: certain block groups near the beachfront have high concentrations of poor old-old while those situated farther inland have a greater number of the elderly (including young-old and old-old) in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Overall, the elderly of highest social vulnerability are overwhelmingly located in the areas away from the coast, which correspond to the African-American, Hispanic, and Amish neighborhoods as well as the areas with major developments of mobile home parks and institutions for the elderly. The elderly on the barrier islands have relatively low social vulnerability because they are wealthier regardless of the chronological age."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This thesis analyzed the vulnerability of the elderly of Sarasota County, Florida to storm surge inundation and precipitation-induced floods resulting from hurricanes. The analysis synthesized both physical and social vulnerability to address the overarching research question: how vulnerable are the elderly to hurricane hazards and are all elderly people equally vulnerable? The message from the analysis is clear: the elderly in the study area are by no means equally vulnerable and they are vulnerable to hurricane hazards in different ways. Hurricane-induced storm surge and flooding presents a considerable physical threat to the elderly inhabitants of the barrier islands. This segment of the older population is most exposed to hurricane hazards, but is in better financial condition and is thereby less socially vulnerable. In contrast, the elderly at significant distance from the beachfront are far less physically vulnerable but are most sensitive to the hazards and are least likely to cope in times of a disaster. The analysis calls attention to parts of the City of Sarasota and North Port. These locations are home to the most socially vulnerable elderly who may be spared from hurricane hazards caused by weak and moderate storms but can potentially suffer disproportionately when a stronger hurricane hits the area. Vulnerability-reduction policies should be tailored to the patterns of the vulnerability among the elderly. For instance, perhaps for the elderly on barrier islands, it is imperative to have a well-designed road network to channelize traffic and preserve road accessibility so that they can be evacuated in a timely fashion during a hurricane; for those living farther inland, perhaps it is more important to ensure an equal access to resources and services during emergencies and non-disaster times by relating the policies to larger development planning for the community."}, {"section_title": "Significance and Contribution", "text": "The U.S. population is aging rapidly. The changing demographics have presented a challenge for emergency management professionals. Knowledge of where the vulnerable elderly are located within communities and the nature of their socioeconomic circumstances is an important step towards effective emergency management. This thesis, to the best of my knowledge, helps to fill a void in research on vulnerability of the elderly as the only analysis that specifically addresses the vulnerability of the elderly within a particular geographical domain. The analysis has generated several important findings. First, it has located the elderly in coastal Florida, examined their occupancy of hurricane hazard risk zones, and illustrated how the elderly spatially intersect with vulnerable places. Second, by integrating the physical and social vulnerability in the analysis, the results have demonstrated the degree and composition of the vulnerability, highlighting the diversity of vulnerability of the elderly over space. Third, the analysis has provided information to local planners and emergency managers for developing well-tailored vulnerabilityreduction for the elderly."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Work", "text": "The thesis does not cover all aspects of the vulnerability of the elderly. In the analysis, I failed to pinpoint the exact locations of every elderly individual. We cannot assume the elderly are evenly distributed within each census block group. Moreover, I was not able to trade the more plentiful census block group data for the more limited, but higher spatial-resolution data at the census block level. The U.S. Census Bureau does not provide much socioeconomic data at a smaller scale out of concerns for privacy. Although higher-resolution data would permit a more accurate analysis, the coarser data at the census block group level were still adequate to make some basic points about the vulnerability of the elderly in the study area. Several important aspects of vulnerability have not been addressed because they are beyond the scope of this thesis. Although the numerical metrics and measures have shed light on the physical and social vulnerability of the elderly, full understanding of the interactions between the two can only be achieved through subsequent field research and qualitative methods. The temporal aspects of vulnerability are also not addressed in the work. The temporal context will yield additional insights into the vulnerability of the elderly because the study area has a distinct seasonal flow of population and thus changing seasonal exposure to hurricane hazards. The potential impacts from climate change are not discussed, either. While projected increases in hurricane frequency and intensity are uncertain, future hurricane damages will be exacerbated by rising sea levels. Last but not least, gender and race can be confounding factors in the vulnerability of the elderly to hurricane hazards, pointing to another major remaining field of research."}]
