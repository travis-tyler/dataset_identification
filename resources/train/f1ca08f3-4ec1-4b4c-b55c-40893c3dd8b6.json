[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Where companies innovate, and which factors promote local industrial innovation, is a question of enormous interest as the invention of new technologies is the key driver of long-run economic growth. Understanding the role of manufacturing for the location of innovation is particularly relevant as the production of goods over the past decades has increasingly moved out of the US and overseas. Some scholars and industry leaders argue that the development of new technologies depends crucially on familiarity with the production processes of existing technologies, and that, therefore, innovation will eventually follow manufacturing abroad [Pisano andShih, 2009, Liveris, 2011]. In this paper, I focus on the location of innovative activity, or research and development (R&D), of large manufacturing firms in the US and ask to what extent a firm's production sites shape the geography of its innovative activity. Access to information is a prominent factor for the location of industrial innovation, as demonstrated by a growing literature on knowledge spillovers. The transmission of knowledge, which plays a predominant role in the development of new ideas and inventions, is facilitated by geographic proximity [Jaffe et al., 1993]. In knowledge-intensive industries, including R&D, firms take advantage of each other's expertise and concentrate geographically [Audretsch and Feldman, 1996, Arzaghi and Henderson, 2008, Carlino et al., 2011. Universities and other publicly-funded research institutions also seem to foster local R&D [Furman et al., 2006]. While these studies have focused on knowledge spillovers from the external environment, they have paid little attention to how firm-internal factors affect where a firm innovates. Geographic proximity, in addition to improving information flows across firms, also fosters communication between the different divisions within a firm [Allen, 1977, van den Bulte andMoenaert, 1998]. If production and R&D inform each other, in their decision where to site R&D, firms will take into account the location of production sites. Cross-dependencies between R&D and production and the consequential co-location of these two activities have long garnered interest in the management literature [Kenney and Florida, 1994, Ambos, 2005, Ketokivi and Ali-Yrkk\u00f6, 2009. In a survey on new product development in electronics, Dedrick et al. [2009] observe that manufacturing tends to \"pull\" the development of new products to factory locations. Pisano and Shih [2009] argue that the manufacturing process is a factor in developing new products in most high-tech industries. Firms, then, face a trade-off between locating R&D in research hubs to take advantage of external knowledge spillovers and locating R&D close to production to improve internal communication. This trade-off has been explored in the literature, but few papers have studied the relative importance of external spillovers and firm-internal linkages empirically. 1 I show that within the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a firm's own production plants play an important role for its local R&D productivity, and that this effect is almost as large as the effect of other innovative activity. Looking only at firm-external knowledge spillovers therefore misses an important aspect of industrial innovation in the United States. Since there is no data on firm R&D spending on a detailed geographic level, I use patents as a measure of the firm's innovative activity in an MSA 2 . I focus on the largest R&D performing firms in the US, namely multi-unit firms which appear annually in the NSF Industrial R&D Survey. Of the patenting firms in this sample, more than 70% patent in more than one MSA, and on average, a firm patents in five different MSAs. As the propensity to patent, as well as the importance of different types of spillovers, varies across industries, I focus most of the empirical analysis on one particular industry, namely \"Chemicals and allied products\". Section 2 describes the data and the sample I use in greater detail. In order to investigate the effect on R&D productivity by production sites while controlling for firm-external sources of spillovers, I use a location choice framework. In the model, which I develop in section 3, firms choose whether and how much they invest in R&D in each MSA. The productivity of the local environment, which I assume to be known to the firm, can then be inferred from its location decisions. Since I observe these R&D location decisions only indirectly in the form of patents, I combine this location choice model with a stochastic production function for patents which follows a Poisson process [Hausman et al., 1984]. A firm engages in R&D in a few cities only because of fixed costs, which leads to the estimation of a zero-inflated Poisson model [Lambert, 1992]. 1 Henderson and Ono [2008] analyze the trade-off between proximity to plants and proximity to markets for headquarters of manufacturing firms. Mariani [2002] looks at the decisions of Japanese firms to establish R&D sites, production sites, or combined R&D-production sites in Europe. 2 This is made possible by information on the inventor's residential address, which locates each patent in a particular place, and on the institution that holds the rights to the patents (the \"assignee\") on a patent application. Corporate patent assignees can be linked to firms in the Census Bureau's Business Register, establishing a dataset of firm establishments and patents in each MSA. I am deeply indebted to William Kerr and Shihe Fu for making their assignee -firm link available to me, and to Gerald Carlino and Robert Hunt for allowing me to use their patent-MSA dataset. I find that, in the context of the model, a chemical firm's R&D productivity is about 1.8% higher if the number of its production workers in the same MSA increases by 10%. Taking an endogenous increase in R&D inputs into account, this corresponds to approximately 10% more patents by the firm in the MSA. In the average MSA, an average-sized plant raises the firm's R&D productivity by 2.5 times. Other patents in the MSA have a significant positive effect on the location of patents for firms in my sample, as expected given the evidence on external knowledge spillovers. The size of this effect is on the same order of magnitude as that of the firm's own production workers, suggesting that the scale of production activities is of similar importance for the firm as the overall research environment in the MSA. The elasticity with respect to same-industry employment is half the size of the elasticity with respect to production workers; firm-internal spillovers are therefore more important than spillovers across firms within the same industry. In my sample, academic R&D has no significant effect on the location of corporate patents. This result seems to contradict much of the literature but can be explained if firms in my sample locate non-patentable research around universities. I further find that other patents in the same technology classes as the firm's have a positive effect on patenting, while patents in the same industry have a negative effect. Firms that innovate in the same industry and in the same MSA therefore seem to experience detrimental competition effects. My estimation approach is validated by the finding that production workers within a 100km around the MSA have a positive effect on the firm's patents inside the MSA, while production workers at greater distances have no effect. The main conclusions are not unique to the chemical industry but hold for other manufacturing industries as well. I verify that my results are robust to alternative definitions of the variables and to alternative specifications of the econometric model. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it bridges the gap between the urban economics literature on localized spillovers and the management literature on withinfirm linkages. Firm-external and -internal factors, which are deemed important in either literature individually, together explain the geographic distribution of R&D more comprehensively. Secondly, the combination of patent and census data allows me to study the determinants of R&D location on an unprecedented scale. While the trade-off that firms may face in locating R&D either at research hubs or at production sites has been previously explored, a rigorous empirical analysis has not been possible due to a lack of adequate data 3 . Finally, this paper is innovative in the way that it combines a location choice model with a stochastic R&D production function of patents. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper to connect these two elements and offer a structural economic model to explain the distribution of a firm's patents across MSAs. Whether firms \"bundle\" innovation and production activities is an important question in light of their increasingly global structures. If production and R&D tend to locate together, the off-shoring of manufacturing may also induce a loss of know-how and innovative capacity [Cohen and Zysman, 1987, Ketokivi and Ali-Yrkk\u00f6, 2009, Pisano and Shih, 2009, Liveris, 2011. A global division of labor, in which developed economies specialize in innovation and developing economies in production, may not be as viable as commonly thought. Within national boundaries, too, cities and regions aim to attract innovative activity because of its associated local externalities. Development of new technologies in a city may lead to faster adoption of these technologies in the same city, increasing productivity, wages, and population [Glaeser et al., 1995]. 4 As R&D facilities create jobs for highly-educated people, externalities also operate through human capital. While the magnitude and mechanisms of human capital spillovers are debatable, educated people make better electoral decisions and are less prone to engage in crime [Moretti, 2004a,b], creating a more attractive and productive environment. If co-location of manufacturing and innovation is important, one strategy for cities to attract innovation, and correspondingly economic growth, may be to attract manufacturing."}, {"section_title": "Measuring innovation and production within firms", "text": "The lack of readily available data is the greatest impediment to studying within-firm linkages. Broken down to the firm and MSA level, the best information on corporate R&D stems from patents, which are R&D outputs. Data on a firm's establishments, although confidential, is available from data gathered by the US Census Bureau. For a sample of firms, a bridge between census files and patent applications lets me track innovation and production sites within the same firm. 5"}, {"section_title": "Patents quantify industrial innovation", "text": "According to Title 35 United States Code, any \"new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof\" is patentable. Patents have therefore frequently been used to measure the output of a firm's R&D efforts 6 . In contrast to R&D expenditures and employment figures, patents also provide detailed information on the location of R&D. A patent application contains the residential address(es) of its inventor(s) and can therefore be assigned to a particular MSA Hunt, 2009, Kerr, 2010] 7 . The greatest advantage of patent data, as far as this paper is concerned, is that patents trace innovation even if it does not take place in a designated R&D lab. Looking at the location of R&D labs only, for example, one does not pick up R&D performed outside of these dedicated establishments 8 . However, about 60% of patents in my sample occur in MSAs in which the Census' Auxiliary Establishment Survey does not identify an R&D lab. To study the co-location of R&D with other establishments, it is crucial to measure R&D in a way that does not depend on where it is located. R&D output and patents are not perfectly correlated. First, not all innovations are patented. Laws of nature and abstract ideas are not patentable, therefore patents do not record all progress in fundamental research. Even if patentable, firms only patent inventions if expected profits outweigh application costs, both in monetary terms and in terms of information disclosure. To the degree that patents measure commercially valuable inventions, as opposed to basic research or inventions of little value to the firm, they reflect the economically most important aspect of R&D. Different industries, however, face different trade-offs between patents and trade-secrets to protect their intellectual property. In a survey of manufacturing firms, Mansfield [1986] finds that the share of patentable inventions that were patented ranges from 50% to 86% across industries. To avoid heterogeneity in terms of how frequently and what types of inventions are patented, I focus the empirical analysis on one particular industry where patents are relatively common, namely Chemicals and allied products (as defined by SIC code 28) 9 . Second, patents can represent varying degrees of technological advancement. This observation could affect the interpretation of my results: If patents that are located with production sites are less important, the role of production for innovation is overestimated. More generally, the type of R&D that is performed at production sites may be systematically different from the type performed at centralized R&D labs. Frequently, long-range research concentrates at a central laboratory, while short-term, development-oriented R&D resides organizationally and physically with business units [Steele, 1975, Malecki, 1980, DeSanctis et al., 2002. Patent citations have proven useful to address heterogeneity in the importance and nature of patented inventions [Harhoff et al., 1999, Akcigit andKerr, 2010]. I follow this approach and find that weighting patents by the number of citations they received does not alter any results. Furthermore, in the sample I study, patents that are located close to production sites are at least as important, in terms of citation indeces, as patents at R&D only sites. I find that self-citation shares, measuring the degree to which a patent exploits existing technology 10 , are lower, if anything, for patents that are located close to production sites, compared to patents at R&D only sites. 11 As long as these limitations are taken into account, then, patents warrant the geographical investigation of industrial innovation, and in particular their co-location with production sites."}, {"section_title": "Linked patent and census data for large R&D performers", "text": "Patent statistics gain power when they are linked to other information about the patenting firm. While a link between patent assignee firms and the Compustat database has been available for a while, Kerr and others have recently led an effort to match patent assignees to firm identifiers in the census data. Such a link opens up new possibilities for research as census datasets not only include privately-held firms but also detailed information on establishment level. 12 Name-based matches between large patent and census datasets often use geographic information to reduce complexity: Patent assignee \"Microsoft\" is more likely to be matched to census firm \"Microsoft\" if both are located in Seattle. 13 This mechanism could lead to inflated colocation patterns in the combined dataset. To avoid this inherent bias in large-scale links, I use the link established by Kerr and Fu, which focuses on a small sample of firms that could be matched without the use of geographic information. Details of the applied matching procedure can be found in Kerr and Fu [2008]. The firm sample in this link consists of firms with complete records in the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development from 1986 to 1996 and with positive R&D expenditures in at least one of these years. Firms that enter in the R&D survey every year generally maintain R&D expenditures above $1 million annually 14 and over this period account for about 80% of total US R&D expenditures [Kerr and Fu, 2008]. I further drop from the sample firms that have only one establishment, of which there are few in the link to begin with. As I assume throughout that firms are unconstrained in their location decisions, large multiunit firms are the appropriate sample to study. For small firms, placing R&D activity away from the main establishment may not be an option for logistical and financial reasons. Including them in the sample may suggest that there are co-location benefits between manufacturing and R&D although in reality the co-location arises from constraints on the firm's choice set. Another benefit of looking at firms with stable R&D expenditures is that I do not have to take firm births or deaths into account. On the down side, restricting the sample to this balanced panel of large R&D performing companies limits the conclusions that can be drawn. My results have nothing to say about start-ups or small entrepreneurial firms. For most of the estimations the sample is further restricted to firms in the chemical industry (SIC 28, \"Chemicals and Allied Products\"), resulting in a sample of 128 firms. Focusing on the chemical industry lends credibility to the estimates because it avoids across-industry heterogeneity in patenting and spillover effects, and because industrial R&D and patents play an important role in the chemical industry. The firms in this sample employ on average 7000 employees and spend $ 60 million annually on R&D, of which roughly 90% is applied research and development and 10% basic research."}, {"section_title": "The distribution of a firm's patents across MSAs", "text": "The number of patents by firm varies considerably. Table 1 displays the distribution of the number of patents that sample firms apply for over the period 1988-1992, both for the chemical industry and for a pooled sample of other manufacturing industries. Although the sample firms all have large R&D budgets, 13% of firms in chemicals and 15% of firms in other industries do not apply for patents at all. On the other hand, 26% in chemicals and 13% in other industries apply for more than 100 patents. Chemical firms file patents more frequently than firms in the other industries: 119 patents in these five years on average, compared to 85. I next break out a firm's patents by MSA. MSAs are an appropriate spatial unit to use here as they are deliberately defined to capture local labor markets and the assumption that an inventor resides and works in the same MSA, which underlies the interpretation of the patent data, is plausible. 15 There are 313 Primary MSAs in the 1990 census definition, which I use here, so that on average a firm has 0.4 patents per MSA. 16 To describe the distribution of patents across MSAs and firms in more detail, I look at two aspects: the number of MSAs in which a firm patents, and the distribution of patents across MSA. First, based on the inventors' addresses the average chemical firm patents in 7 distinct MSAs. Table 2 shows the distribution of this number for the patenting chemical firms in my sample. More than two-thirds of firms patent in more than one and less than 20 MSAs. Only 21% of chemical firms patent in a single MSA, and 11% patent in more than 20. Second, as table 3 demonstrates, a firm's patents are unequally distributed across MSAs. Of the seven MSAs in which the average chemical firm patents, three MSAs have 1 patent each, another 3 MSAs have between 2 and 14 patents each, and one MSA has more than 15 patents by the firm. There is considerable variation, then, in whether and how much a firm patents in a given MSA. Figure 1 illustrates that, not accounting for any other MSA characteristics, patents are more likely to be in an MSA in which the firm operates a production site. The left column shows the number of MSAs with and without production sites by the average firm, while the right column shows the number of patents in each type of MSAs. The average chemical firm operates production sites in 10 different MSAs, which constitute 3% of all possible MSAs. These 10 MSAs contribute 76% of the firm's patents. The remaining MSAs, which contribute 24% of patents, may host establishments other than production plants. The large share of patents in the small share of MSAs with plants constitutes preliminary evidence for the co-location of patents and plants. The main estimation needs to control for other sources of knowledge spillovers, however, as they could be correlated with the location of production sites. In the next section I develop a theoretical framework that will serve as the basis for this estimation."}, {"section_title": "A Model for R&D Location Choice", "text": "Whether production sites generate spillovers for R&D is a question of whether R&D is more productive in proximity to production. Answering this question requires information on the productivity of R&D by a firm in a given location, and on the characteristics of the location. In the absence of information on R&D inputs by firm and MSA, I cannot simply regress various location attributes on value-added, as studies on agglomeration have done [e.g. Ciccone and Hall, 1996]. Even if data on R&D inputs were available, however, this approach might suffer from endogeneity as firms choose to locate R&D in places that are more productive. To deal with the absence of data on R&D input I follow a structural approach. I formulate a model which uses patents and R&D input costs rather than input quantities to determine productivity. This assumes that firms choose R&D inputs in response to local costs and local productivity. In this decision, the firm takes the size and location of manufacturing plants as well as the external environment as fixed. I offer a discussion of this assumption in section 6. I further ignore the strategic aspect of the patenting decision and assume that patents directly measure the quantity of valuable R&D output produced."}, {"section_title": "Set-up and Assumptions", "text": "Let i index firms and m index MSAs. I specify the firm's objective as (1) y im is the number of patents that the firm produces over a period of time in location m. I take patents to be a stochastic outcome, which the firm maximizes in expectation. I use the expected total number of patents as the outcome to be maximized, rather than overall firm profits, to abstract from how the firm capitalizes on a patent -which could be through licensing, improving production processes, or introducing a new product. The assumption that each patent is equally valuable to the firm simplifies the model, and I discuss extensions below. 17 The firm's choice variable is the vector of R&D employees in every location, (L i1 , . . . , L im ). L im determines the expected number of local patents y im via A im denotes the city-firm specific R&D productivity. The marginal productivity of R&D labor employed in the city is decreasing. This is a convenient shortcut to explain why firms patent in multiple locations. Results do not hinge on this particular assumption, however, as other explanations for multiple R&D locations, such as increasing marginal costs of R&D labor or the complementarity of R&D labor and productivity spillovers in patenting, would imply the same empirical specification. 18 The cost of using R&D labor L im in location m is given by w m is the local wage rate. c im is a city-firm specific fixed cost for R&D, which is incurred whenever the firm engages in R&D in a location, and which contains regulatory and infrastructure costs, for 17 The value a firm attaches to patents may differ across firms, but these differences cannot be distinguished from differences in R&D productivity. Firms that value patents more highly will invest more in R&D, as will firms that are more productive in it. Here, both patent valuation and firm-specific productivity will be captured in the term describing R&D productivity. 18 The solution of the model with a CES production function, where example. The fixed cost, in combination with decreasing returns in each location, leads firms to concentrate R&D in a small number of cities, as we saw they do in table 2. In this setting, the firm chooses the level of R&D labor in each city independently, i.e. L im does not depend on L in . This independence arises because both the value and the costs of patents sum across locations, and so the overall location problem reduces to one problem in each location. The decision of how much R&D to perform in a given city will depend on the amount of R&D performed in other cities if firms take their R&D budget as fixed when deciding on R&D locations, or if the marginal value of a patent to the firm decreases with the number of patents. Whether a firm performs R&D in a city is then based on the relative rank of that city in terms of R&D productivity net of costs, which makes the estimation approach below infeasible. 19 To illustrate the role of manufacturing for R&D productivity, however, the simple model derived here is sufficient. The model also uses only one R&D input factor, labor, the cost of which varies across MSAs and is constant across firms. This assumption could overstate the effect of production on R&D productivity, if R&D input costs in fact vary across firms. A model with R&D capital and labor, which allows capital costs to vary across firms, does not produce significantly different results, however, as appendix B illustrates."}, {"section_title": "The Firm's R&D Location Decision", "text": "Under the above assumptions, the firm's profit maximization problem is The optimal labor in city m, L * im , is where d im is an indicator variable, 19 The ranking of cities in terms of R&D productivity net of fixed costs is unobserved, and E[y] does not have a closed form solution in this case. Estimation can only proceed via simulation. Details for this case are available upon request. The definition of the indicator in equation 6 captures the fact that L * im is positive if and only if the expected R&D revenue in city m exceeds the fixed cost. If this condition is satisfied, the value of L * im is determined by the first order condition \u2202E[y im ] \u2202L im = w m . The expected number of patents at the profit-maximizing amount of R&D labor, using equation 2, is The expected patent count y im therefore depends on firm-city R&D productivity A im and costs w m and c im .

I specify that the firm-city specific R&D productivity is given by where b 0 is a constant and b a parameter vector. Plugging this into equations (6) and 7yields where I have defined I assume that, conditional on the covariates, y im follows a Poisson distribution. This is a rather restrictive assumption, but is frequently made in the patent literature. I further have to make assumptions on the distribution of the dummy d im , which indicates whether a firm performs R&D in a given MSA. The observed patents do not completely determine whether a firm performs R&D in a given MSA: If the patent outcome is zero, the indicator could be zero or one, as there may be no patents even if the firm does perform R&D. I assume where \u03b3 is a constant and \u03bd im is an independent draw from a standard normal distribution, as I want to remain agnostic about the determinants of the fixed cost. The probability that a firm invests into R&D is thus where \u03a6 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

In the specific version in equation 12, the variables in the zero-inflation part and those in the Poisson part are identical, i.e. W im = Z im = X im , because both the decision to invest in R&D and how much R&D labor to employ are determined by R&D productivity. In addition, the parameter vectors \u00b5 X and \u03b2 X -the opposite sign is a matter of convention -are of identical magnitude. This is a consequence of the assumption that the variables predicting R&D productivity do not affect the fixed costs. If a variable x is allowed to affect the fixed cost of an R&D lab, such that \u03b3 im = \u03b3 exp(\u03bdx im + \u03bd im ), then \u00b5 x = \u03bd + \u03b2 x , i.e. the difference between \u2212\u00b5 x and \u03b2 x is the variable's effect on the fixed cost. Removing the restriction \u03b2 X + \u00b5 X = 0 is therefore equivalent to allowing the independent variables X to have an effect on the fixed cost. As robustness checks, I compare results from the specific ZIP model derived above to those from a simple Poisson model, where fixed costs are zero, and to those from the general ZIP model, where the fixed costs could be a function of X im .

The average number of patents across all firm-MSAs is 0.4, but this figure masks large heterogeneity in the distribution of patents across cities as already seen in table 3. Conditional on having any patents in the MSA, the average number of patents per firm and MSA increases to about 17. The key predictor of interest is firm manufacturing activity in the MSA. I measure it by the number of production workers employed by the firm in the MSA, possibly aggregating several plants. On average a firm operates plants in 10 MSAs with 170 production workers each. This measure of manufacturing activity seeks to exclude research inputs, e.g. research staff working at a plant, since otherwise the effect of manufacturing activity on research output would partially operate through the direct relation between research inputs and outputs rather than through productivity. Production workers contribute 55% of plant employment on average. The remaining 45% of other employees are not further broken out by function, but could include R&D staff. By definition, production workers are not hired to perform research 22 , but I discuss possible exceptions below. Results are robust to using plant capital stock instead of production workers. I also control for overall employment across all US establishments of a firm to capture some of the heterogeneity across firms. Some firms may be inherently more productive in R&D across all cities, spending more on R&D generally. Since controlling for the size of the R&D budget directly may induce endogeneity, I use firm size rather than R&D expenditures at the firm level; the correlation between firm size and R&D expenditures is 0.9 in this sample.

The coefficient on production workers is positive and highly significant, in line with the hypothesis that local production matters for innovation. Other patents and industry employment in the MSA, measuring external spillovers, also bear the expected positive coefficients. MSA population has a negative effect on the firm's patenting, which may surprise given that larger MSAs are usually associated with higher productivity. Rents, however, are also higher in larger MSAs, and may not be entirely controlled for by the wage. In addition, I have already accounted for agglomeration benefits in terms of patents and own industry employment. The negative coefficient on MSA populations therefore captures the higher costs of performing R&D in larger MSAs, net of wages, patent and industry effects. 25 Firm size, across all MSAs, has a positive effect on the firm's patenting in the MSA. All else equal, larger firms produce more patents in a given MSA, either because they are more productive at it or find it cheaper or both. 26 The MSA wage variable aims to capture the cost of R&D labor and indeed enters negatively, but is imprecisely estimated. The fixed cost parameter, \u03b3, is estimated to be about 26, implying that an MSA which produces 26 patents in expectation (conditional on R&D investment) receives R&D investment with a 50% probability. Columns 1-3 experiment with MSA population and firm size, as these variables do not measure spillover effects directly and one could debate whether they should be included in the main specification at all. In the basic specification in column 1, which just includes the external spillover measures and MSA wage, the coefficient on production workers is the only one that is significantly larger than zero. Adding MSA population to the specification increases the coefficients on other patents so that it becomes significantly greater than zero, both in the case where when firm size is excluded or included (column 2 versus column 1 and column 4 versus column 3). Not controlling for MSA population would therefore blur the spillover effect of other inventive activity with congestion effects of larger MSAs. The coefficient on production workers, however, is not sensitive to the inclusion of MSA population. As the coefficient on production workers drops slightly, though insignificantly, when firm size is controlled for, I control for firm size in the main specification. To interpret the magnitude of the coefficients, table 6 computes elasticities (equations 17and (18)). The first column displays the elasticity of the expected number of patents with respect to the various independent variables, computed at the mean using the estimates in column 4 of Table   5. The expected number of patents increases with the number of production workers almost onefor-one. As the expected number of patents is not only affected by R&D productivity but also by an endogenous response in R&D inputs, the second column isolates the effect on R&D productivity. The value of 0.18 for the elasticity of R&D productivity with respect to production workers means that a 10% increase in the number of production workers implies a 1.8% increase in R&D productivity. Together with changes in the optimal amount of R&D labor employed, this accounts for the 10% increase in the expected number of patents suggested in column 1. The elasticities with respect to the other independent variables are generally of the same order as magnitude. A 10% increase in the number of patents in the surrounding MSA implies a 2.2% increase in R&D productivity, which is not significantly different from the effect of the firm's own production workers. With an elasticity of 0.085, other employment has a smaller effect. Table 7 explores how the probability of investment, the expected patents conditional on where large firms face lower R&D capital costs is worked out in appendix B. investment, and the underlying R&D productivity change with the covariates. The base scenario in column 1 is an MSA with all variables set to the mean, except that the number of production workers is zero (\"no plant\"). In this case, the expected number of patents conditional on investment is 4.3, and the probability of investment is 3.5%, multiplying to yield an unconditional expectation of 0.15 patents. In an MSA with an average-sized plant (column 2), the expected number of patents conditional on investment is 23, the probability of investment 53%, and the unconditional expectation therefore 15 patents. Compared to the base scenario R&D productivity is 2.5 times. The third column performs the experiment of \"doubling the MSA\" by setting population, within industry employment and the number of patents to twice the respective mean. This has an only minor impact on the firm's patenting: R&D productivity increases by 3%. The negative effect of population size is therefore slightly more than counteracted if patents and industry employment increase proportionately. The aggregate effect of production workers on patents is large. The estimated model predicts that if all sample firms stopped producing in the US, instead of inventing about 15,000 patents in five years, they would invent only 3,000. In the terms of the model, R&D is less productive in the absence of the spillovers and hence firms invest less into it, leading to a radically diminished number of patents overall. Of course this is a merely hypothetical exercise -I do not consider how any of the other quantities in the model may change in response. Nevertheless, this figure demonstrate that the effect of production workers on R&D productivity is of an economically important magnitude."}, {"section_title": "Further Findings", "text": "Having established the key result that manufacturing and R&D activity are significantly co-located at the firm level, I now turn to more nuanced findings about the drivers of industrial innovation at the firm-MSA level. Do other MSA attributes, in particular universities, matter for patenting in this sample? Which set of patents contributes to the positive effect of other local patents? Do production workers outside the MSA affect the firm's patenting inside the MSA? And finally, how particular are these results to the chemical industry? Table 8 shows that other innovative or academic characteristics of an MSA do not matter for corporate patents. I control for the number of doctorate-granting universities in the MSA, federal funds for academic R&D that universities in the MSA receive 27 , the share of advanced and professional degree holders in the MSA population, and whether the MSA is part of a larger consolidated metropolitan area (CMSA). None of these variables helps to predict the number of patents by the sample firms in the MSA."}, {"section_title": "Academic research has no significant effect", "text": "The finding that academic research does not affect patents is a surprising result, given examples such as Silicon Valley and the results of other studies [e.g. Jaffe, 1989, Furman and MacGarvie, 2007, Hausman, 2011. \u00d3hUallach\u00e1in [1999], however, does not find a significant relationship between research universities and patents in an MSA either, except for small MSAs outside of the manufacturing belt. The fact that academic research is not important for patents in my sample can be explained by two considerations: First, the sample only includes large, mature companies, and while there is no effect for this set of firms, there may well be an important effect of academic research for smaller companies and start-ups. Secondly, patents may not pick up the R&D that the sample firms perform close to universities. For example, firms may perform basic research, which does not lead to patentable results, next to universities. In R&D cooperations between a firm and a university, patents may be assigned to the university and only later sold to the firm."}, {"section_title": "Contrasting effects of patents in same technology versus same industry", "text": "The results above indicate a large and positive effect of other patents in the MSA that is hardly diminished when other measures of MSA research environment are included in the estimation. I find that this effect is driven by patents in related technology classes as the firms'. Patents in the same product industry as the firm, interestingly, have a negative effect. To measure how similar overall MSA patenting is to the firm's, I determine the patent class, subcategory and category in which the firm has the largest number of patents, combined over all MSAs for the years 1983-1987. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines roughly 400 patent classes, which have been aggregated to 36 sub-categories and six categories by Hall et al. [2001]. A firm patents in several different patent classes, and assigning the firm's most frequent patent class to all patents is an approximation. 28 To construct the number of patents in the firm's primary 2-digit SIC code, I use a probabilistic concordance between patent classifications and the SIC system that has been developed by Silverman, Johnson and Kerr [see Kerr, 2008]. On average, within a given MSA a firm will find 5 other patents in its modal patent class, 31 in its modal subcategory, 95 in its modal category, and 62 in its own 2-digit SIC industry. Patents in the same class, subcategory or category are not identical to patents in the same industry: The probability that a patent that belongs to the firm's modal patent subcategory is assigned to SIC 28 is slightly less than 50%. While the definition of patent classes is based on the firm's technologies, the definition of SIC codes is based on the firm's products. Table 9 includes these various measures of patents in the estimation, together with the overall number of MSA patents. As demonstrated in columns 1-3, the effect of patents in the firm's modal patent class, subcategory or category is positive and significant. The coefficients on patents in the same subcategory or category is about three times as large as the coefficient on patents in the same patent class since a patent class is represents a relatively narrow definition. At the same time, the effect of the unweighted number of patents vanishes to zero, which is expected if only patents in the same group are relevant. In column 4, the coefficient on patents in the same SIC industry is negative and significant, while the coefficients on total patents and employment in the same industry become significantly positive. These results hold up in columns 5 and 6, where patents in the same subcategory or category and patents in the same SIC industry are included simultaneously. For patents in similar technological fields, then, agglomeration is beneficial, while for patents in the same product market it is detrimental. The negative effect of patents in the same industry is potential evidence for competition or poaching effects that arise between firms that patent, and not just operate, in the same industry. For example, a firm may be in direct competition with other innovators in its own industry, but collaborate with those that use similar technologies in other 28 Alternatively, one could weight the MSA patents by the share of the firm's patents in each group: where k indexes patent classes, subcategories, or categories. If this weighted sum of other patents is large, the distribution of other patents in the MSA across groups is similar to the firm's. The conclusions are the same as when using only the group with the largest share. industries."}, {"section_title": "Production workers in close MSA surroundings matter", "text": "Production workers in a 100km ring around the MSA positively affect patents in the MSA, as well, while production workers beyond this distance do not. I construct disjoint \"rings\" around an MSA which consist of counties whose centroids are within a 100, 200, 500, 1000 or 1500km radius of the MSA centroid. The 100km ring consists of all counties with centroid at a distance less than 100km from the MSA centroid but that do not belong to the MSA itself; the 200km ring consists of all counties with centroid at a distance less than 200km but more than 100km from the MSA centroid, and so on. In table 10 production workers in these disjoint rings around the MSA enter into the model, first individually and then jointly in the last column. The effects are statistically indistinguishable from zero beyond the 100km ring. The point estimates decrease almost monotonically as the rings are further removed from the MSA. Within-firm linkages are therefore not contained within MSA boundaries, but decay with geographic distance from the MSA. The fact that the estimate is zero for large distances further validates the estimation approach. Table 11 shows that the positive effect of plants on R&D is not unique to the chemical industry."}, {"section_title": "Results not particular to chemical industry", "text": "Columns 2 and 3 contain estimates for instrument (SIC 38) 29 and electronics (SIC 36) manufacturers. 30 In both of these industries R&D, and patents, play an important role. For instruments, the coefficient on production workers is even higher than for chemicals, while for electronics it is about the same. In column 4, I use a pooled sample of manufacturing industries other than chemicals and the coefficient on production workers remains of similar magnitude. Co-location benefits of R&D and manufacturing are therefore not particular to firms in the chemical industry, but are a more general phenomenon in manufacturing industries.  Table 12 shows that the results are robust to measuring production activity differently, using citation-weighted patents, aggregating at the CMSA level, using 1992 as base year, and dropping pharmaceutical firms from the sample."}, {"section_title": "Robustness", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alternative definition of variables", "text": "In column 1 I use indicators for production worker quartiles, rather than the number of production workers itself, to control for the size of a production plant. Plants below the median do not matter for production at all, while plants in the fourth quartile have twice the effect of plants in the third quartile. The effect of production workers is therefore related to the scale of production activity, not just its existence. If production scale is measured by a plant's capital stock instead of its production workers, as in column 2, the coefficient is equally significant, but the implied elasticity or R&D productivity with respect to plant capital stock is only half the size of the elasticity with respect to production workers. A particular concern may be that if patents at plants are systematically less valuable than patents that are not with plants, the importance that production plays for R&D may be overstated. Column 3 shows that weighting patents by the number of citations they receive does not alter the estimates, and that therefore heterogeneity in the value of patents is not biasing the coefficients. 31 Since I assume that inventors live and work within one spatial unit, aggregation at too small a scale could yield misleading results. In column 4 I show that results are not sensitive to aggregating the data to consolidated metropolitan areas, which groups together MSAs that constitute a larger metro area. The CMSA New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island, for example, contains primary MSAs Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. The quality of the patent assignee -firm link is best from 1986 to 1996, and within this period two economic censuses take place. While I use data from the 1987 census in the main specification, column 5 shows that results are very similar if I use data from the 1992 census and correspondingly shift the dependent variable 5 years forward. There is considerable heterogeneity across firms even within the two-digit SIC definition of the chemical industry. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry, which is part of this broad definition of chemicals, may operate and organize differently. Column 6 shows that the estimates are robust to the exclusion of pharmaceutical firms."}, {"section_title": "Alternative specifications of the statistical model", "text": "In addition to varying the set of variables and how they are defined, I also verify that the results are not affected by the specific assumptions I make about the fixed costs in section 4. Table 13 compares the estimates obtained from three different versions of the model. The first one is a standard Poisson model, which corresponds to the case without fixed cost in the economic model, see section 4.2. The second model is the one used so far, which assumes positive fixed cost that are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. The third model relaxes those restrictions and allows the fixed costs to depend on the explanatory variables via \u03b3 im = \u03b3 exp(\u03bd X X im + \u03bd im ). In this case there are two full sets of coefficients, \u03b2 and \u00b5. The effect of independent variable x on the fixed cost \u03bd x is given by Panel A displays the estimated coefficients and standard errors. In the unconstrained model, \u03bd is significantly different from zero only for wages and MSA population. Both of these variables are significantly negatively correlated with fixed costs, suggesting that it is cheaper to set up an R&D site in large MSAs with high wages. This is plausible if, for example, fixed costs capture the cost of searching for suitable employees. Since the interpretation of the estimated coefficients varies between the models, panel B computes the elasticities of the arrival rate and of R&D productivity with respect to the covariates for each of the three models, analogous to table 6. Standard errors for the elasticities are derived using the delta-method. The point estimates for the Poisson model are slightly larger, but the estimates from the constrained and unconstrained ZIP models are very similar. Generally the difference between the estimates is not statistically significant. As this paper focuses on R&D productivity rather than on R&D fixed cost, and results do not hinge on the specific assumptions about fixed costs, I choose the constrained ZIP model as the main specification."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The estimate established above, namely that a 10% increase in production workers is associated with a 1.8% increase in firm-MSA R&D productivity, does not capture the causal effect of production scale on R&D productivity for several reasons. First of all, omitted variables which affect both R&D productivity and the location of production sites may induce a positive correlation between them even if there is no direct link. Secondly, the estimate may be partially driven by spillovers operating in the reverse direction, from R&D to production. I argue that, while I cannot rule out that some of the magnitude of the estimated effect is driven by endogeneity, neither omitted variables nor reverse causality can explain the effect entirely. I then discuss possible explanations for the link between production and R&D, how they fit with the model presented here, and their plausibility in light of the empirical results."}, {"section_title": "Omitted variables", "text": "The estimates do not seem to be biased by omitted MSA-wide or firm-wide variables. To eliminate this possibility, I control for MSA or firm fixed effects in the standard Poisson model; a zero-inflated Poisson model with fixed effects is computationally prohibitive here. As columns 1-3 of table 14 show, additional MSA or firm characteristics do not significantly reduce the effect of production workers. Since the simple Poisson model, which corresponds to zero fixed cost in the structural model, delivers results consistent with those of the ZIP model that I use as main specification (see table 13), I conclude that omitted firm-or MSA-level variables are not driving the results. An omitted variable that could bias the estimates has therefore to vary at the firm-MSA level. In the specification presented here, however, it is impossible to distinguish unobserved firm-MSA level heterogeneity that correlates with production and R&D productivity from spillovers between production and R&D. For example, a firm may locate most of its activities in the MSA where its founders live -simply because it likes the MSA, and not because it is profitable to locate activities together. I assess in how far this may be driving the estimates by controlling for headquarter employment in the MSA. If firms located R&D and production together only because they prefer a certain MSA over others, we would expect them to co-locate them with headquarters, and headquarter employment to wash out the effect of production workers on R&D. The location of headquarters, however, may also be endogenously determined by R&D productivity, and for this reason the main specification does not include headquarter employment. Column 5 of table 14 shows that the estimated effect of production workers is not entirely driven by the location of firm headquarters. Headquarter employment has a significantly positive effect on R&D productivity, and while the coefficient on production workers drops by about 30%, it is still positive and highly significant. This observation makes me confident that the colocation of production and R&D is not exclusively attributable to unobserved firm preferences for MSAs. Without the possibility to determine the exact magnitude of these preferences, however, the estimates presented in section 5 have to be interpreted as the combined effect of spillovers and unobserved firm-MSA tastes."}, {"section_title": "Reverse causality", "text": "The second reason why the estimate may not be interpreted as a causal effect is reverse causality. The model here emphasizes the location choice for R&D in response to given plants, but a firm may consider co-location benefits when it decides on where to establish plants. In this case, plants are located in an MSA precisely because R&D is also located there. If spillovers between R&D and plants operate in both directions, part of the estimated effect may stem from the benefit of R&D on manufacturing. To demonstrate that reverse causality can only explain a small part of the estimates, I look at whether plants predate patents or the other way around. This is complicated by the fact that the patent database used here goes back to 1975 only, and that patents are a stochastic flow, i.e. if no patent is observed in one year it does not mean that the firm did perform R&D that year. Notwithstanding these complications, table 15 gives an idea of the ages of patents and plants. In panel A I consider all firm-MSA observations with both patents from 1988-1992 and plants in 1987; these are 359 observations that heavily contribute to the estimated effect of production workers on patents. Patents occur for the first time after 1987 in 22% of these observations. In 90% of observations a plant existed in the MSA already prior to 1978 32 . For those observations for which it is possible to infer whether the patent or the plant occurred first, panel B tabulates the gap between those events. In only 10% of cases patents predate plants, and in three-quarters the patent occurred five or more years after the first plant. The bulk of the estimate is therefore explained by observations where the plant existed before the patents."}, {"section_title": "Alternative explanations for the estimated effect", "text": "As the above discussion illustrates, this paper does not claim to estimate the causal effect of production workers on patenting. Rather, it shows that a firm's production plants and patents tend to locate together, beyond the degree predicted by the external environment. As long as this pattern is the result of an optimized location decision, it suggests that there are important linkages between production and R&D within the firm that benefit from geographic proximity. The model in section 3 expresses these linkages in terms of R&D productivity gains. Here I discuss alternative explanations for the colocation of production and plants, and in how far they are consistent with the evidence. First, a firm may seek to concentrate its activities in a small number of MSAs to minimize monitoring and set-up costs. This contradicts the results from the unconstrained specification in table 13, which shows that production workers have a positive effect on R&D fixed costs, if they have an affect at all. If production and R&D locate together, the effect of production workers on R&D fixed costs should be negative. I do not rule out, however, that proximity to production reduces the cost of R&D inputs, for example by sharing equipment or labor. Neither the model nor the empirical evidence aim to distinguish between such cost advantages and productivity gains. Secondly, the coefficient on production workers could pick up a direct effect of R&D labor on R&D output if production workers performed R&D. Several pieces of evidence support the view that production workers invent at most a negligible share of patents. A recent survey of inventors finds that about 80% of US inventors in chemical fields have a PhD degree [Walsh and Nagaoka, 2009]. In addition, US patent law defines that only those who contributed ideas can be named as inventor on a patent, precluding as inventors workers who merely execute experiments. I furthermore observe that patents at plants receive more citations, have a lower share of self-citations, and score higher in terms of originality and generality than patents that appear in MSAs where the firm only operates an R&D lab. 33 If patents at plants were mainly invented by production workers, we would expect them to be incremental improvements of the existing production technology and to receive fewer citations, have a larger share of self-citations, and score lower in terms of originality and generality. I do not rule out that production workers patent in some cases, in particular in industries where production is sophisticated. In this situation, production and R&D are linked in a more immediate way than the model suggests, namely by sharing the same inputs. A location choice model for R&D would be inappropriate if patents were simply a by-product of operating a plant, however. This is clearly not the case: About one quarter of patents occur in MSAs in which the firm does not have a plant, and most inventors are not production workers, as discussed above."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Firm-internal linkages between production and R&D play an important role for the location of industrial innovation in the US. This paper establishes this fact by estimating the importance of a firm's production plants for the location of its patents, while controlling for firm-external sources of knowledge spillovers. In the context of the model presented here, the elasticity of R&D productivity with respect to production workers is 0.18. This implies that a firm is more than twice as productive at R&D in an MSA with one of its plants than in an otherwise identical MSA without a plant. Other patents in the MSA have a similar positive effect on firm R&D, while academic research does not play an important role in this sample. The ambition of this paper is not to estimate the causal effect of production workers on patenting, but rather to show that production plants are an important factor for R&D location that has been neglected in the discussion of knowledge spillovers. I overcome limitations of previous studies by using combined patent and census data, which allow me to track a firm's innovative and production activities at the MSA level. Relying on patent data to study spillovers bears some challenges, however. I restrict the main sample to large chemical firms to optimize the bridge between firms and patent assignees and the degree to which patents capture innovation. To make statements about R&D productivity, I explain unobserved R&D input levels within a structural model. The resulting estimates cannot isolate the effect of production workers from unobserved firm-and MSA-specific tastes. Furthermore, they may be partially driven by plants locating in response to R&D, rather than the other way around. Even this reverse causality argument assumes, however, that plants and R&D benefit from locating together. The patterns observed in this paper likely mask heterogeneity across firms, industries, and time periods. Even when restricted to large chemical manufacturers, the sample contains firms with different R&D processes, for which proximity between production and R&D is of different importance. Interactions between R&D and production may also change over the lifecycle of production technologies, with emerging technologies depending more strongly on the colocation of R&D and production. My results derive from data for the 1980s and 1990s, and since then new communication technologies may have reduced the cost of geographic distance. Case studies of particular industries and periods could be valuable tools to further shed light on the links between production and innovation. The research agenda that this paper points to entails two directions: First, it is important to understand why innovation and production are often located together within a firm, and how linkages between production and R&D operate. Based on conversations with R&D scientists in the chemical industry, my impression is that interactions between R&D and production vary across the stages of an R&D project. At the onset of a research project, R&D employees need to understand which problems production faces, and for this they need to talk to the people involved. After a new process or product has been developed, scaling it up requires the careful calibration of parameters to a particular facility. More systematic research on this topic is needed though. Second, it is worthwhile to study whether my results extend to the global level, and to quantify the effect that the off-shoring of production has on on domestic innovation. The answer has important implications for economic policy.  22, 24-27, 29-30, 32-38. For data sources see appendix.

Percentages indicate the share of these observations for which the difference between the first year a plant appeared and the first year a patent appeared falls into a certain time span. A Appendix: Data The patent data cover all patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 1975(USPTO) -1999. Primarily, the data are taken from the NBER patent file and based on the information included in patent applications. Patent applications contain the name and residential address of one or more of the inventors, which can be used to assign the patent to a geographic place. Carlino and Hunt have matched the original lead inventor address data to county fips codes Carlino et al. [see 2007], and their match provides the basis for the allocation of patents to MSAs. In cases where it is impossible to assign an individual county but possible to assign a unique MSA, for example because street and zip code information are missing but city information is available, I complement their match by assigning MSAs directly. The USPTO assigns patents to classes, which are not congruent with the SIC system. A concordance has been developed by Silverman, Johnson and Kerr. If patents need to be assigned to a specific industry, I use the concordance based on a patent's industry of manufacture. Data on a firm's manufacturing activities comes from the quinquennial Census of Manufacturers (CM) in 1987 and 1992. The CM collects detailed data at the plant level, including the county in which the plant is located, the number of employees and the number of employees directly involved in production (production workers), and the primary industry of the plant. Firms in the sample operate multiple plants (13.4 on average), and I assign the 2-digit SIC with the largest employment as the firm's SIC code. Data on non-manufacturing establishments are taken from the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSL) in census years 1987 and 1992. The SSL is directly taken from the Business Register and contains data on all employers in the United States from a variety of government agencies. In contrast to the census of manufacturers, which covers only manufacturing plants, the SSL includes all types of establishments that a firm operates, e.g. retail stores and administrative offices. Establishments under common ownership share a common firm identifier. One can infer an establishments function from the \"principal processing division\" (e.g. \"Census of Manufacturers\", \"Auxiliary Establishment Survey\") and the \"type of operations\" (e.g. \"Central Administrative Office\") variable. I use the SSL to compute firm headquarter employment in an MSA and total employment in an MSA by industry. I use the Industry R&D Survey discussed in section 2.2 for data on total firm R&D expenditures. The link between patent assignees and firms used here is described in detail by Kerr and Fu, but there are some points to note. Frequently, a firm holds patents under multiple patent assignee names, so in general the match between assignees and firms is many-to-one. Further, Kerr and Fu's link is time-invariant, that is, they match assignee and firm if the assignee name corresponds to the firm name for some year (firm names are pulled from the SSEL in 1987SSEL in , 1992SSEL in , 1997 and extend the link back and forth in time (e.g. \"abc corporation\" which files a patent in 1984 could be matched to \"abc corporation\" showing up in the SSEL in 1997).

For firms in the estimation sample (restricted to SIC 28), the ratio between R&D expenditures for materials and supplies to R&D expenditures for salaries and wages is 0.24. Using therefore a b = 0.24 and the estimated coefficient on the wage \u03b2 W = \u22121.07 yields a = 0.11 and b = 0.46. Combined with the estimate of \u03b2 S = 0.225, these parameter values imply h = \u22120.89. Table A3 compares the elasticities of R&D productivity from the model with labor only, presented in the main text, to those from the model with capital presented here. As expected, elasticities are smaller in the latter case, but differences are neither economically not statistically significant. "}]
