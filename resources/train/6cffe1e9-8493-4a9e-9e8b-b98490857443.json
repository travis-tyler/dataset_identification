The sample for the experimental study was drawn from first-to sixth-grade students (aged 7 to 12) in Hungarian primary schools. There were 505 classes from 134 schools (N=10,737) in the sample. Results confirmed that technology-based assessment can be used to make students' learning visible in the three main domains of schooling, independently of the grade measured.

The idea of using assessment and feedback to make learning visible was introduced by John Hattie. He synthesized results from more than 800 meta-analyses and concluded that taking students' diversity and teachers' capacity into account and providing students and teachers with proper feedback represent a very difficult and challenging task (Hattie, 2012) . The present paper introduces the theoretical foundations and realisations of such a technology-based, learningcentred and integrated (Pellegrino and Quellmalz, 2010 ) assessment system, which undertakes to make learning visible by providing students and teachers regular feedback in the fields of reading, mathematics and science through technology from the beginning of schooling to the end of the six years of primary education. The system has been developed by the Centre for Research on Learning and Instruction, University of Szeged. The eDia system supports and integrates all assessment steps, including theorybased item development, test administration, data analyses, and an easy-to-use and well-interpretable feedback module.\nIn this paper, we introduce and empirically validate the theoretical foundation of the eDia system, a three-dimensional model of learning that distinguishes the disciplinary, application and reasoning aspects of knowledge. We summarize how technology-based assessment (TBA) became mainstream over traditional testing and how the main issues in the field of assessment have changed in the last few decades, thus opening new possibilities and raising new research questions regarding assessment: e.g. how TBA makes it possible to measure new, complex constructs, which are impossible to measure with traditional assessment techniques; how TBA can support personalized learning; and how contextual information can be used for a significantly better understanding of the phenomenon under examination or for providing more elaborated feedback for teachers on their students' cognitive development beyond the simple test score."}, {"section_title": "THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS: A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF LEARNING", "text": "In the history of education, three goals, three main approaches, have become clear from the very beginning up to present-day schooling: (1) to educate the intellect and cultivate general cognitive abilities; (2) to increase the usability of knowledge acquired in school outside the school context; and, finally, (3) to teach content knowledge and elements of knowledge accumulated within science to become familiar with a given domain of culture (see Figure 1 ; Nunes and Csap\u00f3, 2011) . In past centuries, these goals have competed with each other, a tendency which can also be observed in the changing scope of large-scale international assessment programmes. The first prominent international assessment programme, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), started in the 1970s. In its first period, it dealt with the most commonly known dimension of knowledge, curricular content, thus the disciplinary dimension of knowledge. The major source of this dimension is the content of the sciences, which is part of school curricula. The three-dimensional model of learning (based on Moln\u00e1r and Csap\u00f3, 2019) .\nAround the turn of the millennium, another prominent large-scale assessment programme was launched, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). It has been operated by the OECD and shifted the focus of the most valuable knowledge from the disciplinary to the application dimension of knowledge by elaborating its conception and defining the competencies students need in a modern society.\nThere have been several attempts to assess the third dimension of knowledge, which is reasoning, in international large-scale assessment programmes. In the TIMSS frameworks, reasoning is identified, and there are tasks which assess this aspect of knowledge. PISA took a major step when it integrated reasoning into its assessment by choosing problem solving three times (out of the seven data collection cycles until 2018) as a fourth, innovative domain.\nIn the approach on which the eDia is based, it is assumed that the three aspects of learning described above should be present at the same time in school education. These goals should not compete for teaching time, and they must not exclude each other; they must reinforce and interact with each other. Teaching only one of these dimensions of knowledge, e.g. disciplinary content (which traditionally happens in many education systems), is not satisfactory in modern societies, where students are expected to solve problems in unknown, novel situations, to create new knowledge and to apply knowledge in a broad variety of contexts (for a more elaborated description of the model, see Csap\u00f3 and Cs\u00e9pe, 2012, for reading; Csap\u00f3 and Szendrei, 2011, for mathematics; and Csap\u00f3 and Szab\u00f3, 2012 , for science)."}, {"section_title": "TECHNOLOGY-BASED ASSESSMENT: FROM EFFICIENT TESTING TO PERSONALIZED LEARNING", "text": "In past decades, educational assessment has been one of the most dynamically developing areas in the field of education. Traditional summative educational assessment has focused on examining factual knowledge and mostly neglects skills needed for life in the 21st century. The development of information and communication technology (ICT) has strongly reshaped society and given rise to new competence needs (Redecker and Johannessen, 2013) . To enhance and foster these skills, new assessment was needed which goes beyond testing factual knowledge and provides meaningful and prompt feedback for both learners and teachers. The realisation of this issue was not possible with traditional assessment methods; a qualitatively different kind of assessment was called for. The OECD PISA assessments noted above have had a major impact on this developmental process by testing the preparedness of the participating countries for TBA and adapting and testing new methods and technologies in TBA. The first step in this developmental process was computer-based assessment (CBA) with firstgeneration computer-based tests, thus migrating items basically prepared for paper-and-pencil testing to computer. Conventional static tests were administered by computer with the advantages of automated scoring and feedback . In the next stage of development, technology was used, beyond providing automated feedback, to change item formats and replicate complex, real-life situations, using authentic tasks, interactions, dynamism, virtual worlds, collaboration (second-and third-generation computer-based tests; Pachler et al., 2010; Moln\u00e1r et al., 2017) to measure 21st-century skills. Thus, the use of technology has strongly improved the efficiency of testing procedures: it accelerates data collection, supports real-time automatic scoring, speeds up data processing, allows immediate feedback, and revolutionizes the whole process of assessment, including innovative task presentation (for a detailed discussion of technological issues, see Csap\u00f3, L\u0151rincz, and Moln\u00e1r, 2012) . In the 2010s, it was no longer debated; CBA became mainstream over traditional testing.\nIt started a new direction in the development and re-thinking of the purpose of assessment. Two new questions arise: (1) how can we use assessment to help teachers tailor education to individual students' needs? And, thus, how can we use assessment for personalized learning? And (2) how can information gathered beyond the answer data (e.g. time on task and repetition) be used and contribute to understanding the phenomenon and learning process under examination to provide more elaborated guidance and feedback to learners and teachers instead of using single indicators, such as a test score?\nThe development and scope of the eDia system, which is in the focus of the paper, fits this issue and the re-thinking of the assessment process. Among other functions, the primary function of the system is to provide regular diagnostic feedback for teachers on their students' development in the fields of reading, mathematics and science from the beginning of schooling to the end of the six years of primary education and to allow significantly more realistic, applications-oriented and authentic testing environments to measure more complex skills and abilities than are possible with traditional assessments."}, {"section_title": "The eDia System", "text": "In its present form, the eDia online assessment system is a technology-based, learning-centred and integrated assessment system. It can be divided into two parts: (1) the eDia platform, the software developed for low-stakes TBA, using a large number of items and optimized for large-scale assessment (up to 60,000 students at exactly the same time); (2) the item banks with tens of thousands of empirically scaled items in the fields of reading, mathematics and science.\nThe hardware infrastructure is based on a server farm at the University of Szeged. The online technology makes it possible for the eDia system not only to be available in Hungary, but also to be used for numerous assessment purposes in any country in the world (for more detailed information, see Csap\u00f3 and Moln\u00e1r, submitted) .\nThe eDia system integrates and supports the whole assessment process from item writing to wellinterpretable feedback. The easy-to-use item builder module makes it possible to develop first-, secondand third-generation tasks using any writing system. (The eDia system has already been used to administer tests in Chinese, Arabic and Russian, among other languages.) Thus, the system can be used to measure complex constructs requiring innovative item types, new forms of stimuli, such as interactive, dynamically changing elements (e.g. to measure problem solving in the MicroDYN approach; Greiff et al., 2013; Moln\u00e1r and Csap\u00f3, 2018) or simulation-based items (e.g. to measure ICT literacy; Tongori, 2018) . A real human-human scenario is also possible during data collection (e.g. to measure collaborative problem solving; P\u00e1sztor-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2018). These complex, mainly interactivity-and simulation-based item formats have been used for research and assessments beyond the diagnostic system, which is mainly based on first-and second-generation computer-based items, but the results will also be applied to diagnostic assessments in the long term.\nThe item editing module of the system also contains the scoring part of the tasks (a task can be constructed of several items), which makes it possible to employ different ways of scoring from very simple task-level dichotomous scoring to very complicated scoring methods, generally used by items with multiple solutions (e.g. combinatorial tasks). This scoring sub-module provides the information for the automated feedback module of the system. The eDia system is prepared for both automated and human scoring as well. The automatic scoring forms the basis for the immediate feedback provided by the diagnostic assessments. Human scoring is reserved for research purposes.\nThe test editing module of the system is responsible for test editing, thus forming tests out of the tasks in several ways. Tests can be constructed with traditional methods (using fixed tests for everybody in the assessment). They can also be created out of different tests from previously fixed booklets, thus eliminating the position effect and optimizing anchoring within the tests (at the present stage of the system development, this function is used for diagnostic assessments) or by using adaptive testing algorithms and techniques to maximize the amount of information extracted during testing by minimizing the differences between test difficulty level and students' ability level.\nThe test delivery module for the software makes it possible for tests administered in the eDia system to be available on any device (e.g. desktop computer and mobile tools) equipped with an internet browser.\nThe statistical analysis module for the system runs the IRT-based scaling procedure of the items that have already been administered and provides the basis for the feedback used in the diagnostic assessments. The computations are programmed using the built-in modules of the open source 'R' statistical program. The databases for the diagnostic assessments are large, comprising more than 250,000 rows and almost 80,000 columns so that it is impossible to run analyses in a statistical program outside the eDia system. The system has worked in experimental mode since 2014, and the databases for the diagnostic assessments contain the data for almost 70,000 students collected in a longitudinal form since 2014. Beyond the built-in statistical module, in the case of non-diagnostic assessments, there is also the possibility to export the data and run the analyses with different statistical program packages, which are not built into the system.\nThe feedback module of the system consists of several layers for different types of feedback. In the case of diagnostic assessments, all the tests and tasks used can be scored automatically. Automatic scoring makes immediate feedback possible; thus, in diagnostic assessments, the system provides students with immediate feedback on their achievement immediately after the test has been completed. This feedback is based mainly on percentages and supported with visual feedback using 1 to 10 balloons for the benefit of students in lower grades, where the number of balloons is proportionate to achievement.\nTeachers receive more elaborated feedback on their students' level of knowledge and skills than simply achievement data. The teacher-level feedback is IRT scale-based and norm referenced. The countrylevel mean achievement in each domain and for each grade is, by definition, set for 500 with a SD of 100.\nThe teacher-level feedback has two layers. One of the layers contains mostly table-based feedback with detailed information on students' scale-based achievement and a contextualized picture of the whole class, as well as the mean achievement of other members of the same age group in the entire school, school district, region and country.\nThe second layer of feedback generates a .pdf document for each student describing his or her knowledge level both in numbers and web figures and providing a detailed text-based description of his or her knowledge and skill level in the different dimensions of the three main domains.\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate how the system visualizes the norm reference-based student-level feedback, the weakness and strength of the students in the three domains and in the three dimensions of knowledge within one of the domains. The web figures do not contain exact numbers, but place the IRT-scaled achievement in the context of different reference data, such as achievement of other class members and country-level mean achievement (see e.g. Figures 2 and 3 ). The numbers in Figure 2 indicate the different domains (1: cumulative result; 2: mathematics; 3: reading; 4: science), while numbers in Figure 3 represent the different dimensions of knowledge (1: cumulative result in the field of mathematics; 2: application dimension; 3: content knowledge; 4: reasoning dimension). The lines in different colours provide information on the students' own achievement (red line) and refers to this achievement by visualizing classmates' achievement (thin blue lines) and the country-level mean achievement (green line).\nThe second main component of the system, the item bank, contains over 20,000 innovative (multimedia-supported), empirically scaled tasks in the fields of reading, mathematics and science. The tasks are developed in the three-dimensional approach of learning, distinguishing the disciplinary, application and reasoning aspects of knowledge.\nTo sum up, the software is developed for lowstakes TBA, using a large number of items and optimized for large-scale assessments with automated and detailed feedback. At present, it is used on a regular basis in more than 1000 elementary schools (approx. one-third of the primary schools in Hungary; see Csap\u00f3 and Moln\u00e1r, 2017) . In these schools, eDia makes learning visible by providing students and teachers regular feedback on their knowledge level in the fields of reading, mathematics and science, among other areas, based on the three-dimensional approach in each domain."}, {"section_title": "THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE eDia SYSTEM IN EVERYDAY SCHOOL PRACTICE TO MAKE LEARNING VISIBLE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Aims", "text": "In this study, we explore the possibilities of using TBA in an educational context to make learning visible.

The data collection happened within the confines of the diagnostic assessments, using the eDia-system in the elementary schools voluntary joint to the partner schools of the eDia-system. The participation in the study was also voluntary. The teachers had the right to decide in which domain or domains to allow their students to take the test; thus, not all students completed the test in all three domains. The proportion of boys and girls was about the same."}, {"section_title": "Instruments", "text": "The instruments for the implementation study were based on the item bank developed for diagnostic assessments. Almost 500 tasks were involved in the study, meaning 543 items for reading, 604 items for mathematics, and 492 items for science developed for measuring first-to sixth-graders cognitive development in the three dimensions of learning.\nOne 45-minute test consisted of 50-55 items for students in lower grades and 60-85 items for those in higher grades. Each test contained tasks from the three learning dimensions and for the vertical scaling tasks, which were originally developed both for students in lower and higher grades.\nAt the beginning of the tests, participants were provided with instructions about the usage of the eDia system, in which they can learn how to use the program: (1) at the top of the screen, a yellow bar indicates how far along they are in the test; (2) to move on to the next task, they click on the \"next\" button; (3) they click on the speaker if they want to listen to the task instructions or other sounds included in the task; and, finally, (4) after completing the last task, they receive immediate feedback on their achievement.\nThe test starts with warm-up tasks, differing between students in lower and higher grades. At the very beginning of the test, first-and second-graders receive tasks which are suitable to practise keyboarding and mouse skills.\nThird-to sixth-graders receive tasks from the chosen domain, which were originally developed for students in lower grades (e.g. third-graders' warm-up tasks were originally developed for first-and secondgraders, and fourth-graders' warm-up tasks were developed for second-and third-graders).\nBeyond the domain-specific warm-up tasks, the much more difficult tasks administered at the very end of the tests, typically developed for students in higher grades, also support the possibility of vertical scaling of the item bank (e.g. second-graders received a few tasks, which were originally developed for third-graders).\nIn the first three grades, instructions were provided both in on-screen written form and with a pre-recorded voice to prevent reading difficulties (see Figure 4 -domain mathematics; dimension: reasoning; Grade 1) and to increase the validity of the results. Thus, students from Grades 1 to 3 (ages 6-9) were asked to use headphones during the administration of the tests to be able to listen to the instructions and students in Grades 4-6 were also asked to wear headphones to be able to listen to multimedia elements in the test (see e.g. Figure 5 domain: science; dimension: application; Grade 6).\nAs the item pool developed for diagnostic assessments involve first-and second-generation computer-based tasks, students were expected to work on their own. After listening to or reading the instructions, they indicated their answers with the mouse or keyboard (in the case of desktop computers, which is the most common infrastructure in the Hungarian educational system) or by directly dragging, tapping or typing the elements in the tasks with their fingers on tablets.

The data were collected during regular school hours. Testing sessions were supervised by teachers, who had been thoroughly trained in test administration. The system was open for a period of six weeks, meaning teachers had the option to allow their students to take the tests in this six-week period of time.\nStudents entered the system with a specific confidential assessment code.

Second, as we see that TBA is applicable to make students' cognitive development visible in the three main domains and that teachers are open and willing to use technology-based diagnostic assessment to receive well contextualized feedback on their students' achievement, we have a large-scale database to validate the three-dimensional model of learning in all three main domains of learning. Finally, we examine whether the items and tasks used in the diagnostic assessments are appropriate to the ability level of the students."}, {"section_title": "Technology-based Assessment is Applicable in an Educational Context", "text": "Results supported the notion that CBA can be carried out even at the very beginning of schooling using the school infrastructure without any modern touch screen technology. Teachers and schools were interested in TBA and in the feedback connected with normative data on their students' and classes' cognitive development. In the voluntary data collection, the most preferred domain was mathematics (N=8,130), followed by reading (N=8,006). Far fewer teachers in the field of science decided to allow their students to take the diagnostic tests in the field of science (N=5,980). This proportion differed in Grade 2, where mathematics and reading received the same attention, and in Grade 6, were more teachers were interested in their students' reading skills than maths teachers were in their students' maths knowledge. Generally, about 40% of the school classes (41% of the students; see Table 2 ) that took part in the assessment preferred to collect information on their students' cognitive development in all three domains in diagnostic assessments, thus 40% of the teachers preferred to see their students' development in all three domains. On average, 20% of the participating classes completed tests in two out of the three areas, and 40% of the classes took only one test. This percentage changed by grade. Teachers of students in higher grades were more open to allowing their students to take tests from all three domains (almost 50%; see Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between the Three Dimensions of Learning", "text": "The bivariate correlations in the three dimensions of reading, mathematics and science were medium high, ranging from .422 to .630 (see Table 3 ), indicating that the three dimensions are correlated constructs, but not identical ones. On the sample level, the relations between the three dimensions of learning proved to be almost the same for reading and mathematics , followed by science (r=.51-52). On the whole, the strength of the relationship between the application and content dimensions of reading (r=.630) and mathematics (r=.613) proved to be the highest. The grade-level analyses (see Table 4 ) explored the differences in more detailed form and indicated that the strength of the correlations are not fixed. The correlation patterns differ between the different cohorts.\nThe strengths of the correlation coefficients were generally more homogeneous within grades than across grades. The strongest correlations were observable independently of the domain in Grades 5 and 6, followed by Grade 1. The behaviour of the relationships between the application and disciplinary dimensions proved to be the most stable across domains. In all three domains, it was very high at the beginning of schooling, it dropped in Grades 3 and 4, and, finally, it became strong again in Grades 5 and 6. In the case of the correlations between the reasoning and application dimensions of learning, we observed a different pattern. The strengths of the correlation coefficients were lower at the beginning of schooling and became stronger over time. Finally, the pattern of the correlation coefficients between the reasoning and disciplinary dimensions of learning proved to be similar to what we found in the correlations between the application and disciplinary dimensions of learning. The strengths of the correlation coefficients were higher at the beginning of schooling; they dropped in Grades 3-4 and became strong again in Grades 5-6.\nTo sum up, these correlations and correlation patterns confirm that the three dimensions of learning are strongly correlated, but not identical constructs. The strength of the correlation between the same dimensions of knowledge also depends on the grade and domain being measured.\nThus, it was possible to distinguish the disciplinary, application and psychological dimensions of learning. Learning can be made visible in all three dimensions of learning independently of the domain being measured."}, {"section_title": "The eDia System Item Bank is Appropriate to Make Learning Visible in the Three Main Domains of Learning", "text": "Rasch analyses were used to test the appropriateness of the tasks regarding the difficulty level of the 1500 items from the eDia system item bank. The item/person maps of abilities and difficulties show how the distributions of students and items relate to one another by locating both items and students on the same continuum and on the same scale. The distributions of person parameters (the ability measure of students) are on the left side of the figures, while the difficulty distributions of the items are on the right. More difficult items are positioned higher on the scale than less difficult ones, just as students with a higher ability level are positioned higher on the same scale then students with a lower ability level. The lowest values, meaning the easiest items and students with the lowest ability level, are located at the bottom. Students and items are located at the same level of the continuum if the ability level of the student is equal to the difficulty level of the item. This means that by definition the student has a 50% chance of correctly answering the item. The chance must be less than 50% if the ability level of the students is lower than the difficulty level of the item and vice versa (Bond and Fox, 2015) .\nFigures 6-8 show the item/person maps in the domains of reading, mathematics and science. In all three cases, the distribution of the items are in line with the knowledge level of the students. Thus, the item bank consists of very easy, very difficult and average items as well; there are no difficulty gaps on the line.\nThere are some noticeable differences in the comparison of the item/person maps in the three main domains of learning in the distribution of students' abilities, in the distributions of item difficulties and in how the distributions of item difficulties correspond to the distributions of the students' abilities. The student-level distributions are more similar in the case of reading and science, and there are much higher differences in the domain of mathematics. However, there are easy items in the item banks for precise assessments in all three domains; the number of easy items seems to be relatively lower than the number of difficult items, which seems to be higher than required.\nGenerally, the 1500 items extracted from the eDia system item bank are well structured and fit the knowledge level of first-to sixth-graders in all three main domains of learning. However, further study is needed to test the behaviour of the whole item bank."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "International large-scale assessments focus explicitly on students' achievement in several broad content domains, but the implicit goal is to find ways and even use assessment to make education more effective.

In the 21 st century, we need to solve problems on a daily basis by combining, applying and creating new knowledge from the knowledge we have acquired in and outside school. In the present paper, we have empirically confirmed the relevance of distinguishing the three dimensions of learning, the application, reasoning and disciplinary aspects of knowledge, which are highly correlated, but different constructs. Beyond confirming the applicability of the eDia system in an educational context, we have shown with item/person maps that the item bank for the eDia system is appropriate to measure students' cognitive development in the first six years of schooling.\nWe can conclude that TBA can be used in an educational context even at the very beginning of schooling and that it is appropriate to make learning visible at least in the three main domains of schooling and the three different dimensions of learning.\nIn educational practice, implementation of the eDia system paves the way for individualized, personalized learning. It helps both students and teachers to identify weaknesses and recognize and develop the domains where it is most needed. It supports a number of progressive initiatives, for example, meeting the requirements of evidence-based practice and data-based (assessment-based) instruction. As for research and theory-building, it produces an immense amount of assessment data and meta-data, providing materials for learning analytics and data mining. A better understanding of how the assessed domains and dimensions interact in cognitive development aids further improvement in the conditions for learning."}]
