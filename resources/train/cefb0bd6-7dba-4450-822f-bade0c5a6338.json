[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] Although recent studies have shown the importance of advection by ocean currents to the heat budget of the mixed layer in the tropical Pacific Ocean [Frankignoul et al., 1996;Bonjean, 2001;Picaut et al., 1996;Wang and McPhaden, 2000], little is yet known about its long term changes. The continuous observational record of near-surface currents stretches back to the early 1980s with the beginnings of the moored current array as well as the nearsurface drifter program. The purpose of this study is to document the changes in near-surface currents evident in these records during the 20-year period 1980 -1999 along with corresponding changes in the thermal structure and to discuss possible causes. [3] The pattern of climatological near-surface currents along the equator in the tropical Pacific is dominated by the westward South Equatorial Current whose speeds reach a maximum \u00c040 cm/s at 170\u00b0W in boreal fall when the trade winds intensify. In boreal spring the currents generally reduce to \u00c010 cm/s, while in the east the currents actually change direction [Wang and McPhaden, 1999;Yu and McPhaden, 1999]. During Nino years such as 1982 the South Equatorial Current may be disrupted by the surfacing of the Equatorial Undercurrent leading to a reversal of the near-surface currents throughout the central basin."}, {"section_title": "Observations", "text": "[4] The first near-surface velocity data set we use here is based on 15 m drogued drifter observations made available as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment Surface Velocity Program [Niiler et al., 1987;Grodsky and Carton, 2001]. These data are available sporadically with the data frequency increasing considerably in the 1990s. During the 1990s there are typically 640 6-hour average drifter velocity observations per month within 2 degrees of the equator between 160\u00b0E-80\u00b0W. The zonally averaged drifter currents along the equator (Figure 1) show an anomalous increase in westward flow of 7 cm/s, an increase of about 10%, during a 20-year period 1980 -99 characterized by frequent and strong Ninos. [5] Moored near-surface currents are also available at six locations along the equator spanning the longitude band from 156\u00b0E to 95\u00b0W. The longest of these records, and thus the one of most interest to us, is available at 110\u00b0W in the east, where it was originally deployed as part of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Studies (EPOCS) and North Pacific Experiment [NORPAX, Halpern, 1987]. At this location velocity has been measured using Vector Averaging Current Meters uniformly throughout the record. Error estimates for different versions of this instrument range from \u00b13 to \u00b17 cm/s. The 4-year running mean lowpass filtered moored currents at this location show an anomalous 9 cm/s increase in westward component, in agreement to within \u00b12 cm/s of the increase also evident in the drifter currents east of 165\u00b0W (comparison, Figure 1 inset). [6] In addition to secular changes in near-surface currents, secular changes are also apparent in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis [Kalnay et al., 1996] and Florida State University equatorial wind stresses (the latter converted to stress from pseudostress using a drag coefficient of 1.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 ). Both show a weak relaxation of the zonal component by 0.03 dyn\u00c1cm \u00c02 during the last 20 years (Figure 2a). However, Clarke and Lebedev [1996] note that much of this trend is not reflected in air pressure differences across the basin, which we would expect, and thus the trend may be spurious. In addition to winds there are clear decadal fluctuations in SST along the equator with a warming trend throughout the last 40 years [Meehl and Washington, 1996;Huang and Liu, 2001]. The thermocline, in contrast, appears to have gotten shallower over this time period [Huang and Liu, 2001, see their Figure 2]."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "[7] To examine the causes of low frequency changes in near-surface currents we now consider a reduced gravity tropical ocean following Pedlosky [1987]. We include Newtonian damping (r) and vertical diffusion, both of which we assume to be entirely contained in a near-surface mixed layer of depth h atop an active thermocline of depth H. Local acceleration is neglected because of the long timescale we consider relative to the crossing time of trapped equatorial waves (long-wave approximation). Finally, we consider only the effects of the zonal component of the trade winds, t x . Under these assumptions the zonally averaged near-surface zonal equatorial velocity is given by: where r is chosen to be 6.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 s \u00c01 following Lagerloef et al. [1999], while density, r, and the meridional derivative of the Coriolis term, b, take on their usual oceanic values and h\u00c1i indicates a spatial average (2\u00b0S-2\u00b0N, 120\u00b0E-90\u00b0W). Both the mixed layer depth and the thermocline depth are obtained by a direct binning of the available temperature profiles within a 2 degree band of the equator [primarily from the World Ocean Database of Levitus et al., 1998]. Mixed layer depth is then estimated based on the depth at which temperature is less than SST by 1\u00b0C, while thermocline depth is estimated based on the depth of the 20\u00b0C isotherm [Wang and McPhaden, 2000]. For zonal wind stress we use the reanalysis product. Experiments show that if a 0.5\u00b0C criteria is used for the mixed layer depth then hUi increases by $15% (within the depth error bars of Figure 2). When a density criterion is used [e.g. Carton et al., 2000] the results still fall within the estimated error. We make no attempt to include salinity effects in our final results, although they are clearly important in the west. The resulting model simulation of zonally averaged current shows an anomalous 10 cm/s increase in the strength of the   westward zonal currents over 20 years, in line with observations ( Figure 1). [8] As noted above, wind stress, mixed layer depth, and thermocline depth all contain trends (Figure 2), which potentially could contribute to trends in near-surface currents. In order to understand their separate contributions we present three additional model experiments in Figure 3. In the first experiment thermocline depth is set to a constant 200 m, but the trends in the other terms are retained. In the second experiment zonal stress is set to a constant \u00c00.2 dyn\u00c1cm \u00c02 , but the trends in the other terms are retained. In both of these experiments much of the secular trend in nearsurface currents remains. In the third experiment mixed layer depth is replaced with a constant h = 50 m, but the trends in the other terms are retained. In this experiment most of the trend in near-surface currents disappears. Thus, we conclude that much of the trend in near-surface currents is the result of a gradual shallowing of the mixed layer over the last 20 years. Since zonal transport (uh) in (1) depends entirely on zonal wind stress the trend in transport remains small. [9] This result leaves us with the interesting question of what controls the depth of the mixed layer. Three competing processes are known to be important, mechanical stirring which acts to deepen the mixed layer by entraining mass across the base of the mixed layer, while upwelling and positive buoyancy flux, both act to restrict deepening, the latter by enhancing the density discontinuity at the mixed layer base [Kraus and Turner, 1967]. Near the equator, ocean dynamics exert an important influence on the mixed layer [Schopf and Cane, 1983]. [10] Interestingly, two recent studies address aspects of decadal variability in the same region. McPhaden and Zhang [2002] report a weak $0.1 Nm \u00c02 decrease in zonal trade winds and a shallowing of the pycnocline by $30 m west of 160\u00b0W. We repeat our model experiments examining the relative change of velocity with longitude and find that the strongest trend is in the west, consistent with McPhaden and Zhang [2002], but that the trend is of the same sign at all longitudes. Huang and Liu [2001] point out that the temperature stratification in the equatorial Pacific has increased in the last 40 years. Our own estimate shows that the difference between SST and thermocline temperature at 150 meters increased by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 20 years. We suspect that this increase in stratification is at least partly responsible for the decrease in mixed layer depth. [11] Acknowledgments.
