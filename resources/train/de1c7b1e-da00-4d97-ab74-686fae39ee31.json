[{"section_title": "", "text": "Literacy scores for men and women were not measurably different, but men had higher numeracy scores than women. The average literacy score among U.S. adults was 272 (figure 1). Men's average score was 272, which was not measurably different from women's average score of 271. The average numeracy score among U.S. adults was 257. Men scored higher than women in numeracy. Their average score was 265, some 15 points higher than women's average score of 250. Men's numeracy scores were higher than women's in each age group and educational attainment level. Looking at adults in roughly ten-year age intervals, men had higher average numeracy scores than women in each age category, scoring between 9 and 18 points higher in each category (figure 2). For example, among those ages 16\u221224, men scored Data in this report are from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC).

Among those ages 55\u221265, men scored 261 and women scored 243. Men also had higher average numeracy scores than women with the same levels of educational attainment. Among those with less than a high school education, men scored 218, some 15 points higher than women's score of 203. Among adults with a high school diploma or some postsecondary education but no degree, men scored 255, some 16 points higher than women's score of 239. Finally, among those with a postsecondary degree, men scored 299, some 19 points higher than women's score of 280. Endnotes 1 In the PIAAC framework, literacy refers to the ability to read, understand, and use written text in a variety of life situations. Numeracy refers to the ability to understand and use mathematical information in a variety of life situations. Examples of literacy items include circling the word that correctly identifies a pictured object or reading a passage of text and answering a question about its meaning. Examples of numeracy items include reading the temperature in a picture of a thermometer or interpreting a graph with numeric data. PIAAC scores are typically reported using scale scores such as those used here, and proficiency levels; for information on men's and women's proficiency levels, see Literacy, Numeracy, and Problem   This NCES Data Point presents information on education topics of current interest. It was authored by Serena Hinz of RTI International. Estimates based on samples are subject to sampling variability, and apparent differences may not be statistically significant. All noted differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. In the design, conduct, and data processing of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error."}]
