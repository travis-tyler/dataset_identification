Around 20% of reported costs from natural disasters arise from TCs (Handmer et al., 2016) , while over 30% of insured losses are caused by TCs (Chen, 15 2004 ), due to extreme winds and riverine and coastal storm surge flooding. Minimising the losses in the built environment from these events can be approached in a range of ways. In Australia, the Wind Loading Standard (AS/NZS 1170 .2, 2011 specifies minimum design loads for buildings under the action of wind loading. Design loads vary across the country, depending on the sources and magnitude of winds, in an effort to minimise average annual losses across the country. Areas around the northern coastline have higher design loads, due to the exposure to TCs which generate higher wind speeds than 20 mid-latitude storms. Design criteria are defined with reference to a likelihood of exceedance over the expected lifetime of residential structures -this is a 10% likelihood in 50 years, commonly described as a (approximately) 1-in-500 year average recurrence interval.\nThe historical record of TCs in the Australian region covers barely 100 years (Kuleshov et al., 2010) . Of that record, only the last 30 years includes reasonably consistent information based on satellite data to assess the intensity of TCs. The short length 25 of record makes it difficult to infer average recurrence interval (ARI) wind speeds due to TCs at ARIs greater than 100 years (Emanuel and Jagger, 2010; Jagger and Elsner, 2006; Sanabria and Cechet, 2007) . It is a common approach to use stochastic simulations to estimate the wind speeds to establish building design standards and for assessing TC risk (Vickery et al., 2009 ).\nMany of these models exploit the statistical characteristics of TC behaviour to generate catalogues of synthetic events (Emanuel et al., 2006; Hall and Jewson, 2007; James and Mason, 2005; Li and Hong, 2014; Nakajo et al., 2014; Powell et al., 30 2005; Rumpf et al., 2007) .\nIn this vein, Geoscience Australia has developed a statistical-parametric model of TC behaviour -called the Tropical Cyclone Risk Model (TCRM) -to generate synthetic event sets that represent many thousands of years of TC activity. TCRM is designed to run on desktop computers with modest computational resources available, but is scalable to large multi-processor systems. As such, the model forgoes the more computationally intensive dynamical approach used in some TC hazard models 35 (Emanuel et al., 2006) . Instead, we use an autoregressive process to model synthetic TC tracks, including intensity, and use a two-dimensional parametric model to describe the TC wind field.\nTCRM is unique in that it is freely available for use in hazard and risk assessment applications. There are a number of published stochastic models (noted above) however these models are as a general rule, not publically available (exceptions include the model of Powell et al., 2005) and at no cost. Further, the formulation of these models may preclude application in regions other than those demonstrated in publications. That is, they may be tailored to the region where they are applied. TCRM is formulated such that it is largely independent of the region being simulated, though some components are derived using regionally-specific data. Where there are region-specific formulations in a component of the model, these can be readily adapted for different regions. TCRM is also an open-source software package, enabling users to contribute to ongoing development of the model and influence the future directions of development priorities. 5\nWhile the primary purpose for developing the model is to evaluate TC severe wind hazard, it can be configured to rapidly evaluate the swath of destructive winds from a single TC at high temporal and spatial resolution. In this configuration, a 2dimensional wind field at 0.02\u00b0 horizontal resolution, covering the entire track of a TC, is calculated in a matter of minutes.\nUsing TCRM in this manner, we have evaluated the impact of individual TCs on Australian communities, with applications in emergency management and urban planning (Arthur et al., 2008; Krause and Arthur, 2018) . 10\nIn Section 2, we describe the data used to develop and evaluate TCRM. Section 3 provides details of the track generation component of the model, and Section 4 describes the wind field modelling process. Section 5 describes the use of extreme value distributions to calculate ARI wind speeds, and Section 6 presents some initial results using TCRM in the Australian region."}, {"section_title": "Data 15", "text": "The analysis of TC wind hazard is based on historical observations of TC events and their characteristics. Specifically, the essential fields required for running the model include the date and time of TC observations, the location (longitude and latitude), intensity (central pressure) and a flag identifying unique TC events. Additional fields, such as the radius to maximum wind (Rmax) and the pressure of the outermost closed isobar (poci) can be included, though are not essential.\nFor the Australian region, we use the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS: Knapp et al., 20 2010) , which provides the most complete global set of historical TCs (Fig. 1) . IBTrACS provides the date, time, position (longitude and latitude) and estimated central pressure of TCs in the southern hemisphere every 6 hours (or more frequently) for seasons between 1981 and 2016 (36 years). The data have been quality controlled and provide a homogeneous set of TC records from World Meteorological Organisation-sanctioned forecast agencies. This time period does exclude some historically significant storms, which is more so due to their impacts on the community rather than any physical characteristics. 25\nHowever, for testing and development, homogeneity of the input dataset is prioritised over the length of record. Further, the absolute accuracy of the input data is viewed as a source of uncertainty in the return period hazard values presented here. A thorough treatment of the accuracies is warranted (Harper et al., 2008) , and the hazard values herein should be considered as only one view of the true wind hazard arising from TC events.\nThere are some attributes of TCs that are not reported in the IBTrACS dataset. The radius to maximum wind (Rmax) and pressure 30 of the outermost closed isobar (poci) are two useful values that can provide additional constraints on the intensity and size of TCs. For these variables, we use data obtained from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (2017), spanning 2002-2016 (15 years) .\nThis data is used to develop parametric models for these variables (described in Section 3), which are then used in the stochastic track generation process."}, {"section_title": "Model software 35", "text": "The TCRM software has been developed at Geoscience Australia as a free, open-source software package.

Despite this behaviour, the translation speed and bearing of TCs still display significant autocorrelation ( Fig. 2 and 3) , while there is also a moderate autocorrelation in the rate of pressure change across the entire region (Fig. 4 ).\nThe track model is based on the approach used by Hall and Jewson (2007) and Rumpf et al. (2007) , utilizing a lag-1 autoregressive technique to model the future behaviour of each synthetic TC. We extend this autoregressive technique and 10 apply it to the intensity (minimum central pressure) of the simulated TCs as well as the track behaviour.\nUsers specify a simulation domain, over which the TC wind hazard will be evaluated ( Fig. 1) . To ensure the simulated events capture the complete range of potential tracks entering this domain, an expanded track domain is defined. The track domain is determined by examining the extent of all historical tracks that enter the simulation domain. The frequency and behaviour of simulated TCs is then determined on the basis of observed events in the track domain. 15\nThe model is trained on the observed track data, using a series of 1\u00b0 by 1\u00b0 grid cells across the track domain to capture spatial variability in the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient) for selected TC parameters (speed of forward motion, bearing, intensity and, where available, Rmax). For each grid cell, a minimum of 100 valid observations are required before descriptive statistics are calculated. If there are insufficient valid observations, then the search area is expanded in steps of 1\u00b0 zonally (east-west) and 0.5\u00b0 meridionally (north-south) -to the maximum extent of the 20 track domain -until sufficient observations are found. Distributions for at-sea and over-land conditions are calculated separately to allow for different behaviours in these circumstances -specifically intensity in near-coastal areas."}, {"section_title": "Genesis", "text": "Genesis of TCs is modelled as a Poisson process based on historic frequency in the track domain, with locations of genesis randomly sampled from a 2-dimensional probability density function (PDF) of historic genesis points ( Fig. 5 ).

In the Australian region, it is not unusual to observe the formation of precursor tropical lows over land. To allow for this in TCRM, weak lows are maintained if their central pressure deficit increases above 5 hPa within 12 hours of the initial time. This allows for initial formation over land, as long as the incipient TC intensifies sufficiently (through the stochastic process described in the next section) -usually "}, {"section_title": "Tracks", "text": "Following determination of the initial location, intensity, translation speed and bearing of a TC event, the model applies an autoregressive process to step the TC forward in time.

A logistic distribution is used because the heavier tails provide a better representation of the distribution of residuals. Further, comparisons of full track simulations gave qualitatively better results when using the logistic distribution. A corresponding approach is used for the bearing (direction of movement) of simulated TCs.\nIntensity, measured as the minimum central pressure p(t), is also modelled in a similar manner, except it is the rate of change 15 of intensity ( ) that is predicted at each time step t, rather than the intensity itself as described by Eqs.

This means there is generally insufficient data to develop the autoregressive model with confidence across the entire model domain.\nIn the case of insufficient observations, a parametric model of Rmax is used, based on the model of Powell et al.

However, there are substantial and systematic differences between the two (Fig.   8 ). Using pltm will lead to synthetic TCs generating sufficient wind speeds to remain defined as TCs at higher central pressure values than observed. To define poci for the synthetic TCs, we modify pltm based on the central pressure, latitude and day of year, plus a random innovation:\nwhere pltm is the daily long term mean sea level pressure at the location of the TC, pc is the central pressure, \u03bb the latitude, dyear the day of year. \u03b5 is a random innovation sampled from a normal distribution with \u00b5 = 0 and \u03c3 = 2.572.

Differences in the decay rate of TCs can be identified between those making landfall on the northwest Australian coastline and the eastern coastline ( Fig. 11 ). We hypothesise that this is due to the presence of the Great Dividing Range along the eastern coast of Australia, with elevations exceeding 1400 metres in places (e.g. Mt Bartle Frere and Bellenden Ker). Further, the mean central pressure of landfalling cyclones in eastern Australia is higher than those along the western Australian coastline (Fig. 12) . 35 An exponential decay function was fitted to the normalised pressure deficit \u2206p /\u2206p0 for the 174 landfalling TCs (Fig. 13 ).

TCRM first uses a radial profile to estimate the gradient level wind associated with the vortex. To 10 allow users to explore the range of variability in ARI wind speeds associated with different radial profiles, we have implemented a number of profiles in TCRM. These include the Holland (1980) , Schloemer (1954) to implement simpler models that rely only on readily available best-track parameters (e.g. central pressure, latitude). For this verification study, the Powell et al. (2005) profile was used, with \u03b2 defined as:\nwhere \u03bb is the latitude of the TC centre and \u03b5 is a random variate sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation 0.286. The random innovation term is held fixed for each storm event. 20"}, {"section_title": "Boundary layer model", "text": "In addition to the range of radial profiles, users can also select one of three boundary layer models. These boundary layer models relate the winds at the gradient level to those near the surface, taking into account the asymmetry induced by the forward motion of the TC and surface friction effects. In parametric TC models, this is often achieved by vector addition of the forward motion and the gradient winds together with a surface wind reduction factor. Examples of this type include 25 McConochie et al.'s (2004) model, which varies the inflow angle as a function of radial distance, or the Hubbert model (Hubbert et al., 1991) . Alternatively, a linear analytic model (Kepert, 2001) of the boundary layer flow can be applied with minimal computational cost.\nIn this study, the linear boundary layer model of Kepert (2001) was applied to relate gradient level winds to surface winds. This model utilises a bulk formulation for the boundary layer with the drag coefficient set to a constant value of 0.002 and the 30 turbulent diffusivity for momentum set to 50 m 2 s -1 , as recommended by Kepert (2001) . The linear analytic model generates a surface wind speed corresponding to a 1-minute mean wind speed (Khare et al., 2009 ). This is converted to a 0.2-second gust wind speed using a wind speed conversion factor determined using the approach outlined in Harper et al. (2010) . The resulting wind fields represent a 10-metre above-ground, 0.2 second gust wind speed over flat terrain with an aerodynamic roughness length of 0.02 metres. This is carried across the entire model domain, including over-water areas. This choice is made to enable 35 direct comparison to other measures of regional-scale wind hazard such as weather station observations. Throughout the simulations, it is assumed the gradient-level wind is axisymmetric. However, the simulated tracks can extend to mid-latitudes, where TCs undergo transition to extra-tropical cyclones and the gradient level wind becomes asymmetric (Foley and Hanstrum, 1994; Jones et al., 2003; Loridan et al., 2013) . Further, the assumption in the linear boundary layer https://doi.org/10. 5194/nhess-2019-192 Preprint. (Foley and Hanstrum, 1994) . This means the simulated hazard values in the mid-latitudes (approximately poleward of 30\u00b0 in the southeastern Indian Ocean) are likely not indicative of the true wind hazard associated with (transitioning) TCs. It is also likely in these regions that other phenomena (e.g. thunderstorms) are the predominant source of extreme wind gusts. There are promising developments in the area of extra-tropical transition (Loridan et al., 2015) , which have direct application in 5 probabilistic modelling frameworks and may be integrated into TCRM in future releases."}, {"section_title": "Extreme value distribution fitting", "text": "Once wind swaths for the simulated TCs have been generated using the wind field module, the maximum wind speed from all simulated events, irrespective of direction, for each grid point is stored. Because of the large number of events simulated, it is possible to estimate average recurrence intervals (ARIs) for the wind speeds at each grid point. The simplest approach is to 10 use an empirical approach based on Eq. (14):\nwhere ri is the wind-speed rank of the ith event, nobs= 365.25 is the number of values per simulated year and nevents=10000\u00d7nobs is the total number of simulated 'daily' observations for the 10,000 year simulation. For each point across the simuation domain, we treat each simulated event as an individual 'daily' observation and rank the simulated wind speeds from all events. 15\nThis usually produces around 10 5 records (depending on the frequency of TCs at that location). The remaining 'daily' records are zero filled.\nA more sophisticated approach is also implemented, where the simulated maximum wind speed values are fitted to a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) using a peaks-over-threshold approach. ARI wind speeds are estimated from the GPD parameters using Eq. (15): 20\nwhere w is the wind speed with an ARI of t years. \u00b5, \u03c3 and \u03be are the location, scale and shape parameters of the fitted GPD distribution respectively and \u03c1 is the rate of exceedances above the threshold u. The threshold is set to the 99.5th\npercentile of the simulated wind speed values. As wind speeds are considered a bounded phenomenon (Lechner et al., 1992) , the fitted shape parameter \u03be can be constrained to be positive to ensure the resulting distribution is bounded at 25 long return periods (Holmes and Moriarty, 1999) . Again, this parameter fitting is performed at each point across the region of interest, leading to a spatial representation of ARI wind speeds.\nConfidence intervals are estimated from the covariance matrix of the parameter fit. This method is useful for estimating winds speeds at very long ARIs, where the frequency of events is very low. ARI wind speeds estimated using this method tend to be underestimated at lower ARIs compared to the empirical approach, largely because the threshold 30 selection excludes lower, more frequent wind speeds. The distribution of observed longitude crossing rates are well modelled for both eastward-and westward-moving storms (Fig.   15 ). The values represent the probability density of events crossing each longitude in 2 degree latitudinal segments. In general, the model simulates the longitude crossing rates well. Near 150\u00b0E, 15\u00b0S the model does not capture the rate of TCs crossing 5 Cape York Peninsula, which is related to the termination of TCs due to low intensity. Similar overall results are obtained for longitude crossing rates when the model is tested in the western North Pacific and Atlantic basins (not shown), including in mid-to high-latitudes, capturing the paths of recurving TCs."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Track model verification", "text": "TCRM simulations of minimum central pressure perform well, especially for the more intense (lower minimum central pressure) TC events (Fig. 16) . The lower tail of the simulated distribution closely follows the observed tail. For weak TC 10 events (> 980 hPa), the observed distributions lie outside the 90th percentile of the simulations. This has little impact on the derived extreme wind speeds, which are generated by the most intense TCs.\nThe spatial distribution of minimum central pressure is presented in Fig. 17 . Values represent the lowest minimum central pressure value observed in each 1\u00b0 by 1\u00b0 grid cell in the historical record. We apply the same process to each of 1000 synthetic event set, and the mean of those is presented. There is general agreement between the synthetic and observed (historic) 15 distributions, though individual events in the historic record do result in greater variability.

TCRM replicates the observed probability of landfall well, with the mean of the synthetic event sets generally close to the observed probability.

However, the mean landfall probability in the simulations for the region between gates 8 to 12 (between Exmouth and Port Hedland) is substantially lower than the observed landfall probability. This is possibly linked to lower genesis probabilities directly to the north of this area.\nHistorically, there is a local maximum in genesis probability between 120\u00b0E and 130\u00b0E, extending westward into the Indian Ocean near 10\u00b0S (Fig. 5 ). The mean genesis density for the simulations does not show the same local maximum, or the 30 westward extension. This lower genesis density is likely translating into lower track densities in the region, and therefore lowers landfall rates along the northwest Australian coast.

In total, 29 stations and 14 TCs are examined, providing a cursory analysis of the wind field model performance.\nThe configuration is kept consistent with that used to derive the ARI wind speeds, so no calibration of the parameters (e.g. 40 peakedness parameter) is performed for individual TCs used in the verification (c.f.

In a stochastic model such as TCRM, it is important that the wind field model display no significant bias in wind speed, and errors in the mean wind field are minimised. By using a consistent configuration for verifying the wind field model, it is possible to quantify the bias in the wind field that might arise in applying that configuration to a set of synthetically generated TCs. This will generally result in a poorer simulation of each individual TC when assessed using metrics such as root mean square error, since the parameters have not been optimised for the evolution of each individual event. The reader is 5 directed to the references for the profiles and boundary layer model for more thorough validation of those models.\nSimulated wind speeds are matched to corresponding observations from weather stations based on the time of observation. The wind field model provides data at five minute intervals, so it is possible that absolute peak observed values may not match the time interval. Observed wind speeds are corrected for gust averaging time periods (Harper et al., 2010) , as the default configuration for TCRM is to produce wind speeds representing a 0.2 second gust wind speed. No corrections for site exposure 10 (e.g. topographic enhancement, surface roughness changes) are made. during the passage of four separate TCs (Glenda, Olwyn, Yasi and Larry respectively).

It 20 appears a similar shift occurs in the observations several hours earlier, but winds turn back to the south rapidly at around 18Z on February 2. This difference is likely due to the model not containing any other sources of pressure gradient winds from synoptic-scale weather patterns such as high pressure ridging into the Coral Sea following the passage of the TC (for example, see the discussion in McConochie et al., 1999) .\nPeak wind speeds are closely simulated, except for Lucina Point in TC Yasi, where the wind field model underestimates the 25 peak wind speed by nearly 20 m s -1 . Among other events (Fig. 24, lower right panel) , the tendency is for the TCRM wind field simulation to overestimate peak wind speeds. There are likely several factors (for example, instrument failure or site exposure) leading to this overestimation, which may be drawn out in a more thorough validation of the wind field model and analysis of those event. The results here are likely due to our decision not to correct the observed wind speeds for site exposure, which would reduce the modelled wind speeds. 30\nFor the complete time histories (all corresponding time records, not just the peak), Fig. 24 presents the root mean square error, bias and mean absolute error for all 29 stations and 14 events modelled.

In the context of a stochastic model where many thousands of events will be simulated, the average RMSE outcome is acceptable, but the tendency for peak wind speeds to be overestimated requires further investigation."}, {"section_title": "ARI wind speed verification 35", "text": "ARI wind speeds for the Australian region are calculated from a simulation of 10,000 simulated TC seasons, or over 160,000 individual simulated TC events. Two ARI wind speeds are examined -the 50-year ARI wind speeds are compared to observed TC-related wind speeds, while the 500-year ARI wind speed is compared to the regional design wind speeds detailed in AS/NZS 1170.2 (2011). We use the 500-year ARI wind speed for comparison, as it represents the regional design wind speed for residential housing in AS /NZS 1170 /NZS .2 (2011 https://doi.org/10. 5194/nhess-2019-192 Preprint.

All TCs passing within 200 km of the station, when the station was open, were recorded. Daily maximum wind gusts corresponding to the closest passage of each TC were then extracted and empirical ARI values determined based on Eq. (14). Corrections are made for gust wind speed averaging times where instrumentation is known (Harper et al., 2010) . 5\nThe 500-year ARI wind speed map (Fig. 25 ) displays qualitative similarities to existing design wind loading standards (see ARI curves for selected locations are presented in Fig. 26 , along with estimated ARI wind speeds for observed TC-related 15 wind speeds (see below) at those locations. The solid line is a GPD fitted to the simulated wind speeds using peaks-overthreshold with a 99.5 th percentile threshold, but here we have relaxed the constraint of \u03be > 0. 90 th percentile confidence intervals are determined from the covariance matrix of the fitting routine.\nFor locations along the west coast (Carnarvon, Port Hedland), the model underestimates the hazard profile compared to the observed hazard profile. For Port Hedland (64 years of records), the simulated 50-year ARI wind speed is just under 50 m s -1 , 20\nwhile the observed 50-year ARI is approximately 57 m s -1 (Table 1) . Similarly at Carnarvon (65 years), the simulated 50-year ARI is 35 m s -1 and the observed 50-year ARI is close to 45 m s -1 . This is a significant discrepancy between the simulation and observations. In part, this is attributed to the comparatively low landfall rates along this section of the coastline (Fig. 19) , and so points to additional work on improving the simulation of intense TCs along this section of the Australian coastline, in terms of both event rates and intensity . 25 In other parts of the country, model performance is much better. Simulated ARI wind speeds at Darwin closely match the observed ARI wind speeds, but the outlying observation of TC Tracy (1974 -67 m s -1 ) is cause for further investigation. This analysis places the observed wind speed of Tracy at around a 5000-year ARI, but there is significant uncertainty on this estimate, and conjecture on the most appropriate way to estimate this from observations (Harper et al., 2012) . For east coast locations, the simulated ARI wind speeds for Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton are all close to the observed ARI wind 30 speeds, varying at the 50-year ARI by at most a few percent. The observed ARI wind speeds generally fall within the 95 th percentile confidence interval of a GPD fitted to the simulated values (not shown). It is also notable that observed and simulated ARI wind speeds lie below the corresponding regional wind loading design levels specified in AS/NZS 1170.2 (2011) for all locations, except for Port Hedland where observed ARI wind speeds are close to the regional design level.\nAn important component of stochastic models is to check for convergence in solutions (Shome et al., 2018) . For TCRM, this 35 can be checked by splitting the synthetic catalogue into two subsets, calculating ARI values from each and examining the range of values. A large difference in ARI wind speeds indicate the model has not converged. It is expected that at large ARIs the model would not converge, as variability in the tail of the distribution is to be expected when modelling rare events.\nSignificant difference in the ARI values for the two subsamples indicates the variability in the distribution is large. Fig. 27 shows the convergence checks for the locations mentioned above. Carnarvon, Port Hedland and Willis Island show little 40 difference in the subsets below the 1000-year ARI level -generally differing by less than 2%. Darwin, Townsville and Broome show divergence in the subsets at around the 500-year ARI level. Cairns and Rockhampton both display weak convergence beyond the 100-year ARI level, but converge again above 1000 years.

It is a free and open-source software model, with the goal of delivering TC wind hazard information to the hazard and risk modelling community in a free and transparent manner. Potential applications include evaluation of risk, scenario modelling for emergency management planning, informing wind loading requirements for building standards and projections of future climate hazard and risk.\nInitial evaluation of the model was performed using historical best-track data for the Australian region to generate a catalogue 10 of 10,000 years of events. The statistical track model performs well in areas with a high density of TC events, but confidence is reduced at higher latitudes and near the equator due to the lower number of historical events. Simulated ARI wind speeds are generally consistent with observations of TC-generated winds around Australia, except in the northwest of the country where the simulated ARI wind speeds are significantly lower than observed. This deficit is linked to low landfall rates in this part of the country and will be investigated into the future. There are also significant opportunities to improve model 15 performance at mid-latitudes, especially in processes such as extra-tropical transition, where other types of weather phenomena may have a substantial influence on the wind hazard climate.
