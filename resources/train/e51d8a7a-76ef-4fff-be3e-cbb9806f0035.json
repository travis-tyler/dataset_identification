Several researchers estimate the level of human capital from education attainment and examine the impact of human capital on GDP or economic growth [e.g., Mankiw, Romer and Weil, 1992] . On the other hand, relatively little is known about the effect of the diversity of human capital on GDP.\nApparently, the diversity of human capital differs across countries. Several recent international surveys reveal this variation. Although different surveys compare different abilities at different ages, some common tendencies can be found in the surveys. 1 How does this diversity of human capital influence GDP? The impor- 1 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) covers achievement in mathematics and science for early or middle teens, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) covers achievement in reading, mathematics and science for early or middle teens, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) examines 'document', 'prose' and 'quantitative' literacy for all people of working age, and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) examines the reading skills of young children. 2 Brown, Micklewright, Schnepf and Waldmann (2005) compare the difference between the 95th percentile and 5th percentile of achievement distributions for 18 OECD countries, converted from the data in TIMSS, PISA, and the late teens and early 20s in IALS. The 18 countries include Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Canada, Czech Republic, Sweden, Australia, Portugal, Norway, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Switzerland, UK, New Zealand and USA. The countries are ordered from the most equal achievement to the least equal achievement using the average ranking of the three surveys.\ntance of this question can be understood when we recognize that one of the central aims of an education policy is to provide students with equal education resources. For example, several reforms have been conducted to achieve equity in education outcomes in the United States. The 1971 landmark decision in Serrano v. Priest transformed the public education system in California, and other states (e.g., Michigan in 1994 and Washington in 1979) have also centralized their education systems in order to achieve equity in education resources. More recently, the \"No Child Left Behind Act\" by the George W. Bush administration aims to achieve equity in and a high quality of education by raising the performance of the lowest achieving students. Hence, the previous question leads us to ask a more important question: can an egalitarian education policy raise GDP?\nThe answer is not obvious. On the one hand, if a government fails to provide everybody with enough literacy skills, it would be difficult for workers to communicate and cooperate with each other. On the other hand, as top managers' decisions are influential in a company, we want them to understand the varieties of opinions and to make sound decisions. Hence, some may insist that an education policy should target the bottom of ability distribution; others may advocate the importance of education for the elite.\nIn order to evaluate the impact of an egalitarian education policy on GDP, we need a model to link education reform, the diversity of human capital and GDP in a unified framework. This paper aims to accomplish this task. It constructs an overlapping generation model in which education systems influence GDP by changing the variance in human capital and compares alternative education systems by their effects on GDP.\nThis model is distinguished from the previous literature in two aspects.\nFirst, we tractably parameterize the structure of industries and firms and examine how an education system and the production structure of an economy have an interactive effect on GDP. In particular, this paper pays special attention to the span of control in a firm and the complementarity of goods in an industry. A large span of control gives an individual the authority to reallocate large amounts of resources. Without authority, an able person cannot fully utilize his/her unusual talents. Hence, a high level of control favors an education system that produces a few highly educated workers.\nIf complementarity of goods exists, the value of a firm's product depends on other firms' product, and a good produced by incompetent persons may reduce the value of other firms' product. Hence, high complementarity of goods demands an education system that produces many reasonably welltrained workers. 3 Secondly, different from the previous literature that analyzes education policies in a dynamic general equilibrium model, education systems are characterized not only by their financing systems, but also by their abilitytracking programs. Hence, education systems change the way the heterogeneities of both income and ability influence the diversity of human capital.\nA private education system yields more diverse human capital than a public education system because the rich spend more on education than the poor. 4 3 For example, in a financial market, fund managers are allowed to allocate a large amount of resources to buy different stocks that are highly substitutable. It is likely to demand unusual talent. On the other hand, firms in the car industry need to combine a number of complementary intermediate goods (e.g., the quality of tires is likely to influence the value of brakes). This might demand many well-trained workers. The level of control in the car industry would be influenced by the structure in the firm. If intermediate good sectors are less vertically integrated, or bottom-up decision making is common, the level of control would be low. Again, it must demand reasonably well-trained workers. It is interesting to note that the structure of industries and firms in the U.S., which is regarded as having relatively heterogeneous human capital, seems to relatively favor unusual talent, while that in Japan, which is seen as having a relatively homogeneous human capital, relatively favors reasonably well-trained workers. 4 A private education system is defined as an education system in which individuals finance the costs of education, and a public system is defined as an education system in On the other hand, ability tracking students into separate groups according to their ability restricts those with whom they can interact as schoolmates or classmates. Since advantaged students interact with advantaged students, ability-tracking benefits advantaged students more than disadvantaged students through the peer effects. Hence, a streamed program yields more diverse human capital than an untracked program by amplifying the benefits from high innate ability. This paper analyzes an aggregate economy in which an income distribution converges to a stationary distribution, and shows that a public system yields higher GDP than a private system regardless of industry and firm structure, while the effect of an ability-tracking program on GDP depends on the production structure. As far as the variance of log income converging to a finite value, this paper shows that, given a current GDP and an ability distribution, a larger income difference reduces GDP at the next period. Since the public system always lowers income inequality more than the private system through the redistribution of income, it always attains a higher GDP than the private system.\nA similar mechanism is emphasized in the previous literature when the human capital accumulation function is concave in expenditure on education and the production function is linear in human capital (e.g., Loury, 1981, and Glomm and Ravikumar, 1992) . Our result shows that this still holds even if the diversity of human capital increases GDP on the production side.\nHowever, when the diversity of human capital is enhanced by ability tracking, the structure of the production side becomes important. Different from the dynamics of income distribution, the distribution of ability is exogenously given and the variance of ability is always finite. It is shown which revenues from labor income tax are assumed to finance the costs.\nthat a rise in inequality in ability can increase GDP at the next period.\nIt is also shown that an ability-tracking program can attain higher GDP if goods in an industry are fairly substitutable and if the span of control in a firm is sufficiently large. Hence, the private education system may increase GDP if a private school has more incentives or advantages to screen students through its entrance examination. 5 This result highlights a distinctive role of ability tracking in macroeconomics. This paper is based on the literature that compares the performance of different education systems in a dynamic general equilibrium model (e.g., Glomm and Ravikumar, 1992 , B\u00e9nabou, 1996 and Fern\u00e1ndez and Rogerson, 1998 . These papers compare different financing methods for education. In particular, B\u00e9nabou (1996) examines the effect of diversity of human capital on economic growth when the human capitals of individual agents have interactive effects on GDP. His main focus is to examine the role of complementarity of human capital at the community level and at the production level. By contrast, we do not consider a local interaction at the community level and pay more attention to the interaction at a production level. In particular, we explicitly examine the role of complementarity of products and a manager's span of control to compare education systems. We also explicitly analyze the effect of ability sorting on GDP.\nAbility tracking has been examined by Epple, Newlon and Romano (2002) and Brunello, Giannini and Ariga (2004) . Although these papers examine the benefits and costs of ability tracking, they do not examine the role of the production structure. The interaction between an education system and the structure of an industry and firm is the main focus of our paper.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model, and Section 3 shows some results about the relationship between income inequality and GDP. Section 4 compares the two education systems, the public and the private. Section 5 considers the case with ability tracking in public schools. Section 6 discusses some extensions and concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix."}, {"section_title": "The Model", "text": "In this section, we construct an overlapping generation model with human capital accumulation.

In our benchmark model, private schools are allowed to sort students based on their ability, while public schools are not. This assumption is relaxed later.

Each individual lives for three periods. In the first period, children obtain an education while they are still supported by their parents.\nIn the second period, young individuals work, spend part of their income for current consumption and the education of their children, and save the rest.\nIn the third period, old individuals consume their savings.\nHuman capital is formed with individual ability \u03be i t+1 (i.i.d. with mean 1), and public and private schooling. It is assumed that a child must spend 1 \u2212 \u03b8 fraction of his/her time at a public school and \u03b8 fraction of his/her time at a private school. The production function of human capital is given by:\nwhere U t and R i t are the quality of public and private education, respectively.

A similar specification of human capital formation can be found in, for example, B\u00e9nabou (1996) The quality of a peer group in each type of school crucially depends on the feasibility of sorting based on student ability. As a benchmark, we consider the case in which private schools are allowed to choose students based on their ability (and thus students are perfectly sorted in school by ability), but public schools are not. This is a standard case studied by, for example, Epple and Romano (1998), and we think that this is a plausible case because private schools have more incentives and advantages to screen students through their entrance exams than public schools. However, we will discuss how our results change if public schools are allowed to sort students based on ability in a later section.\nThe quality of a peer group in each type of school is determined as follows. On the one hand, since students are randomly assigned to a public school, the average ability in each public school is the same as the population mean ( that is,\u03be P ub t+1 = 1). On the other hand, since students are assumed to be sorted in the private school by ability, the average ability of students in a private school for students with ability \u03be i t+1 is given by\u03be P ri,i t+1 = \u03be i t+1 .

Although we assume that the tax rate is chosen by majority voting, equation (8) implies that \u03c4 t = \u03c4 * t is chosen by unanimity no matter what the income distribution. That is, equation (8) shows that the tax rate chosen in this paper is constant over time. 8 7 In principle, the choice of tax rate affects the next period interest rate through the aggregate human capital in the next period. Here we assume that voters ignore this effect of tax choice. 8 If only the young individuals have the voting right, then \u03c4 * t is chosen by unanimity. Even if both the young and the old individuals are franchised, \u03c4 t = \u03c4 * t is chosen by a majority because \u03c4 * t is always supported by at least half of the population (that is, all the young individuals always support \u03c4 t = \u03c4 * t )."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Income Distribution", "text": "In this section, we study the evolution of income distribution using the model described in the previous section.

Transition dynamics of GDP are characterized by equation (12) . Results from direct investigations on (12) are summarized by Proposition 1. Consequently, if the \"total\" elasticity of income to ability ((\u03c6+\u03b1\u03b8\u03bd)\u03c1/(1\u2212 \u03bb\u03c1)) is larger than unity, the variance of ability has positive effects of the next period's GDP. 9 The second part of Proposition 1 shows that the effect of inequality in current income on GDP at the next period depends on the parameters \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1 1\u2212\u03bb\u03c1 . The mechanical reason can be understood by equation (9) . Note that the left-hand side of the equation (9) is strictly concave in \u03c0 i t if and only if \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1/(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1) < 1. Hence, the high variance of \u03c0 i t reduces the expected value of \u03c0 i t+1 , and, therefore, GDP, if and only if \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1/(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1) < 1. On the other hand, equation (11) shows that the variance of log income converges to a finite value if and only if \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1/(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1) < 1. Hence, the following corollary is the immediate result. In their setting, the mapping from current income to next-period income is concave and, therefore, their income dynamics converge to a stationary process.\nDifferent from the previous literature, our production function in the consumption goods sector can be strictly convex in human capital if the span of control in a firm is large enough. It provides a possibility that the income in the next period can be a strictly convex function of current income. Nonetheless, Corollary 1 implies that the concavity of the production function for human capital must outweigh the convexity of the production function for consumption goods when the variance of log income converges to a finite value.\nAn intuitive reason can be understood as follows. Whenever an increase in inequality in current income always raises the average income at the next period, the mapping from current income to next income must exhibit convexity. However, the convexity of the mapping implies that the current rich are likely to receive disproportionately high income at the next period.\nThis means that inequality at the next period is larger than that in the current period. Hence, the variance of log income is infinite in the long run.\nIn other words, insofar as we restrict our attention to the income dynamics that have a finite variance in the long run, the mapping from the current income to the future income must exhibit concavity for some income level. 10 "}, {"section_title": "Steady State", "text": "Next, we examine the relationship between the steady-state variance in income and steady-state GDP. For this purpose, we must know when two aggregate state variables, ln Y t and \u2206 2 t , converge to steady states. Equation (11) shows that the variance of log income converges to a stationary point if and only if \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1 1\u2212\u03bb\u03c1 < 1. Provided that the variance of log income converges to a stationary point, equation (12) shows that the logarithm of GDP converges to a stationary point if and only if R < 1. Note that R < 1 guarantees \u03b1\u03b8\u03c1 1\u2212\u03bb\u03c1 < 1. This reasoning proves the following lemma.\nLemma 1: An aggregate economy converges to a stationary distribution if and only if R < 1.\nSince we would like to analyze the relationships among income inequality, 10 Technically, we obtain Corollary 1 because local concavity (around a steady state) implies global concavity in equation (9) . This is a standard assumption in this literature and we can still apply Corollary 1 when a deviation from the assumption is small. However, if a mapping from current income to future income exhibits a more general form, we may need additional assumptions on the variance of ability to guarantee the negative relationship between current inequality and future GDP. the heterogeneity in innate ability, and GDP in the long run, we assume R < 1 in the rest of this paper. 11 As the variance of log income has a finite value on the stationary distribution, an increase in inequality in current income lowers GDP at the next period during the transition process. We want to show how the result changes in the long run.\nUsing equations (11) and (12), the logarithm of GDP in the steady state is given by:\nwhere:\nand\nIf D > 0, then the greater is the variance of income, the higher the long-run GDP (and vice versa). The effects of income inequality on steady-state GDP is summarized as Proposition 2. This proposition tells us that when the production of the final good is sufficiently substitutable and the degree of the span of control is large 11 Even if we allow endogenous growth (that is, R = 1), the results regarding transition dynamics in the rest of the paper remain unchanged. Almost all results from the steadystate analysis also can be applied to the analysis of the long run growth if we relabel steady-state GDP to \"the long-run growth rate\". enough, the relationship between income inequality and GDP is positive in the steady state. Note that, similar to the case of transition, the variance of income affects the next period's GDP negatively. However, since the steady-state variance of income is determined by the variance of ability, which can have a positive impact on GDP, the total association between income variance (and hence the variance of ability) and GDP in the steady state depends on the combination of these two effects. When the final good production is sufficiently substitutable and the degree of the span of control is large enough, the positive effect of the high variance in ability dominates the negative effect of the variance of income.\nIn summary, the (causal) effect of income inequality on GDP is negative in our stationary economy, but heterogeneity in ability can have positive effects on GDP due to ability tracking and the span of control. Moreover, the long-run association between income inequality and GDP can be positive or negative depending on the production structure of the economy."}, {"section_title": "Public vs Private Education System", "text": "In the benchmark model, we allow both public and private education investment in human capital accumulation (when \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1]).

As a reduction in the current variance of income increases GDP at the next period, the public system generates a higher GDP than does the private. 12 "}, {"section_title": "Tracking vs Mixing in Public Schools", "text": "Can ability tracking in public schools increase GDP? To answer this question, we compare GDP under the public system with ability tracking to that under the public system without tracking.\nThe difference of the logarithm of GDP under these two education systems during transition is given by:\n= \u03b1\u03bd \u00b5 \u03c1(2\u03c6 + \u03b1\u03bd) From Proposition 5, we may conclude that ability tracking in public schools increases GDP when the production of the final good is a sufficiently substitutable (large \u03c1), the degree of the span of control (\u03bb) is large enough, the production function of human capital is less concave (large \u03b1), and/or the elasticity of human capital to the peer group effect (\u03bd) is large enough.\nIn summary, when public schools are allowed to select students based on their ability, the public system generates a higher GDP than the private both in transition and in the steady state. However, whether the ability tracking in public schools increases GDP crucially depends on the interaction between the production structure of the final and the intermediate goods and the technology of human capital accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we examined how different education systems change GDP through their influence on the diversity of human capital. We analyze an economy in which an income distribution converges to a stationary distribution. We show that the diversity of human capital due to income inequality always lowers GDP, while diverse human capital induced by heterogeneous ability can increase GDP if produced goods are sufficiently substitutable and firms have a large span of control. Hence, we may conclude that a public education system always yields higher GDP than a private education system, though the effect of ability tracking on GDP depends on the structure of industries and firms.\nIt is worth mentioning some cautions to the interpretation of our results.\nWe focus on the effect of different education systems on GDP. But obviously, GDP is not the only variable that governments should be concerned. In our model, both a private system and ability tracking increase the variance of log income and lower social mobility. Hence, our model indicates that equalizing school resources can also promote efficiency, but that ability tracking may induce a serious trade-off between efficiency and equity in some societies.\nOne of messages from this paper is that if a government wants to know how serious the trade-off is, it must carefully investigate the structure of industries and firms.\nAlthough we examine the effect of ability tracking on GDP in this paper,\nwe can extend our analysis to other policies that can change a mapping from ability to human capital. More specifically, we can extend our analysis to policies that influence the human capital accumulation function through the following path, h i t+1 = (\u03be i t+1 ) \u03c6(\u03b8,p)\n\u00b3 (e i t ) \u03b8 (g t ) 1\u2212\u03b8\u00b4\u03b1 , where p is a policy parameter. For example, when policy allows individuals more flexibility in choosing how many credits they can take in a year, it is likely that talented students take more courses than ordinary students do. 13 In this case, more able students accumulate a larger human capital not only because they are talented, but also because they study harder. Hence, the effect of ability on human capital is more than proportional and \u03c6 (\u03b8, p) becomes larger by this policy. According to our analysis, the impact of this policy on GDP depends on the structure of production. In this way, our analysis suggests that we cannot evaluate the economic consequences of a liberal education policy without the knowledge of how industries and firms are organized.\nAs indicated by this example, there will be more unexplored issues about the relationship between education policy and the structure of the production sector. We hope that this paper helps researchers in unraveling part of the complicated relationships. 13 The Japanese government substantially reduced the number of subjects that students must study in elementary school, junior high school and high school during 1990s. According to Kariya (2001) , as a result of this policy change, students who previously received poorer grades reallocate their time more to leisure than those who previously received a better grade."}, {"section_title": "A Proofs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A.1 Proposition 1", "text": "Proof.
