We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency."}, {"section_title": "1) Introduction", "text": "The data needed to accurately track the transmission and impact of COVID-19 have been hard to collect. The available data do not provide the full picture of the epidemic, are not standardized among countries, and are not always standardized within regions of the same country. Understandably, most governments (and modelers) have focused their efforts on in-country tracking and predictions, making international comparisons difficult. Data are defined and collected differently from country to country, from period to period (and sometimes even within a country at the same period). In an ideal scenario, we would have an accurate daily measurement of the proportion of people who are not infected, who have just become infected, who have recovered from the infection, and who have died from the infection. In actuality, each of these measurements is sub-optimal; tests to distinguish between the non-infected and the infected have been rationed (testing only when there are symptoms), recovered/immune patients have been tracked only from the infected cohort (with occasional one-off immunity tests across a larger population), and COVID-19 deaths have been defined differently at different points in time and across countries.\nEvery epidemic, every cluster starts and propagates through an infection. For the epidemic to be understood, we must understand environmental factors (which can include hours of daylight, temperature, humidity, ease of absorption of vitamin D, diet, and the presence of other pathogens, host factors (lifestyle, past and present exposure to other pathogens, obesity, co-morbid conditions, age, hygiene, mask wearing, and treatments), transmission factors (aerosol, hands, droplets, intermediary agent), and context (urban or rural, population density, types of heating and cooling, types of transportation, and gatherings, shared toilets) for example. The susceptibility rate is a function of the infection rate, the rate of recovery, and the death rate. The examination of large datasets and the comparisons of countries with each other can provide important clues regarding the behavior of the virus and this epidemic and can give clues regarding optimum management strategies. Any given factor can make the virus more or less infective, more or less benign, shorten or lengthen the time of contagion, or impact host resistance and recovery. These factors work together so that their influence may sometimes only be seen in large datasets. promote contagion and superspreading 18.7 times more often than open environments (Nishiura et al., 2020) .\nEpidemic clusters have been identified involving closed places with people gathering with little air circulation such as transportation centers, places of worship, slaughterhouses, companies, hospitals, care facilities, prisons, jails, and police stations. On a more general level, major cities including London, New York, Paris, Madrid, and Milan, with factories, airconditioned offices, dense public transportation, and regular crowed social and religious events offer higher superspreading opportunities than medium cities or rural areas where little superspreading happened. Endo et al. showed that super-spreaders contribute more to infectivity than most people and recommend concentrating efforts on identifying those 10% of the infected population. (Endo et al., 2020) Lloyd-Smith, et al. explained the dissemination of sarscov-1 and remind that for a dissemination k value around 0.1, containment might be obtainable at ((1-1/R0)/2). This means that herd immunity could be obtained, depending on an R 0 value between 14 % and 39 % for the sensitive population prone to an outbreak (Lloyd-Smith, Schreiber, Kopp, & Getz, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Contagion factors", "text": "A shenzen study confirms such overdispersion by observing that 8.9 % of cases caused 80 % of infections . Successfully controlling superspreading may bring such epidemics to extinction as with SARSCOV-1. The 10 % of people who are super-spreaders are often highly socially connected individuals. Their many connections make them more exposed and thus more likely to be infected early and more likely to spread early causing a higher spread rate in the first phase of the epidemic during which time they become infected, spread, and become immune (Gomes et al., 2020) . For example, a bus driver who sells tickets, may be more exposed, and, once infected, may contaminate dozens of people. After he recovers, he no longer infects anyone. Once these kinds of superspreaders have become immune, the epidemic slows down. This \"natural selection\" of super-spreaders would mean that herd immunity could be as low as 5 % to 35 % depending on the R rate which is dependent upon factors that lead to propagation and severity (Gomes et al., 2020) . Lewis tests susceptibility notion for Stockholm and reaches a herd immunity estimate between 7 % and 24 % depending mostly on correlation between susceptiblity and infectivity of individuals based on an R0 of 2.4 (Lewis, 2020) . Careful analysis across countries and taking into account that the virus was present in France since early December 2019 and possibly weeks or months before, it does seem that R value and severity of this virus may vary significantly. It may actually have a very low natural Rn that has maintained it active for a long time without being visible. This R value may vary between seasons. In the past, the rare severe cases may have been confused with flu, pneumonia or other infections. Its mildness may have kept it invisible until a set of conditions united for repeated consecutive super-spreading leading to this epidemic and consequent world panic.\nAlthough there was a case in France early December, the epidemic was invisible in terms of over-mortality until March 16 th . Hospitalizations began to peak in terms of death in week 14 between March 30th and April 5th as per Insee Data and EuroMomo. This is a combination of a very slow epidemic with an R that could be as low as 1.4 that picks up suddenly with and an R that may have tripled when the right conditions of clustering accumulated.\nChanges in R and severity maybe associated to changes in populations density, activation of heating and air conditioning (HVAC), multiplications of reunions in closed spaces (ski vacation, occasional holiday gatherings, changes in commuting), presence or absence of competing/multiplying other pathogens, ultraviolet light, vitamin D levels, relative humidity, mucosa, seasonal diet and other factors that have not yet been identified. Such factors may impact the virus itself or the host in terms of propagation, receptivity, course, symptoms, or severity, thus in turn impacting contagion and R value.\nClinical observations hint that infections have become milder in Europe. Since there is no indication of any mutation, this may be because of natural selection mechanisms such as a minor evolution in the virus or that the most vulnerable were infected earlier. This is often observed in epidemics towards the end. It may also be because spring or summer make the hosts transmit less viral load or resist better.\nAny association between susceptibility and super-spreaders would have been very strong if most transmission happened because of social contacts. This would have taken the bus driver, cashier, teacher, waiter, trainer, physician, nurse\u2026. out of the equation very early on.\nMuch of the superspreading seems to be related to places: discotheques, hospitals, schools, dorms, slaughterhouses, malls, transport,s supermarkets\u2026..Workers of such places are more susceptible and more likely to superspread as they spend more time and have more contacts with others in such places. Yet, it could be anyone who spends given enough time in such a place. HVAC may make dissemination more complex as it may become random within the space. This reduces the impact of such an association.\nMuch of contagion seems to require prolonged exposure and/or significant viral load. A cashier in an air-conditioned supermarket would be more exposed and would catch it earlier to pass it on earlier as it would stay longer in the supermarket. Once most nonresistant cashiers of supermarkets have become immune, they no longer contribute to superspreading. Superspreading becomes rarer in supermarkets. A customer may occasionally be at the origin of a cluster but as he spends less time, his impact, in most cases, would be relatively low compared to the cashier infecting customers all through several days, then infecting other cashiers whom in turn would infect other customers.\nA very similar situation would happen with a bus driver, transport salesperson, restaurant waiter, slaughterhouse employee, dorm inhabitant, mall employee\u2026\u2026 Sensitivity and resistance Another significant factor in contagion is Population resistance, that is the presence of a population whom, under normal circumstances would not get infected because of past immunity or other reasons as observed in the past.\nChildren are less likely to contract the virus and less likely to transmit it. In the French aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle case study, out of a population of 1760 sharing common dorms, common corridors, and common cantines for a month, 1043 (59%) were infected, but the other 41% tested negative in spite of having been exposed to significant viral loads repeatedly. This is mostly a male and rather young population. It is possible this resistance may be lower in an older population and potentially higher in women and children. It is also possible that a higher fraction of the adult population that may be resistant to virus under normal exposure. Part of that protection may be due to genetics, cross-immunity, past immunity or other factors. For example, SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells were detected in \u223c 40%-60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating \"common cold\" coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 (Grifoni et al., 2020) .\nRecent manifestations across the world in countries with tens of thousands of people gathering with close contacts in a very restricted open air space with few masks did not lead to cluster formation in spite of massive testing further confirming contamination happens indoors. Melbourne manifestation is particularly interesting as Melbourne is entering winter and Australia is tracing regularly and has to this date managed to keep virus under control."}, {"section_title": "Most identified clusters happened in :", "text": "Health Care facilities or Hospitals Slaughter houses Schools Hotels .

Locking down non-essential clustering places may have been sufficient to reverse the curve that started becoming aggressive around week 8 to 9. For at least 12 weeks the epidemic was moving at a very slow pace, becoming aggressive when conditions permitted.\nTemperature levels. We found no correlation for temperature, even though the epidemic did not pick up significantly where temperatures were below freezing. That may also be explained by lower population density in areas with lower temperatures. We could not find any correlations with temperature outside of an observation that infectivity did not increase when temperatures were below freezing. Wang et al. found that high temperature and high humidity reduced infectivity (Wang et al., 2020) , though we found correlations only with relative humidity, hours of daylight, and levels of ultraviolet radiation. We estimated the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval: 5.6-7.7).\nWe confirmed this by checking EuroMomo's data and dates and by comparing their curves with data extracted from INSEE in France and Statbel in Belgium which were consistent with EuroMoMo's data. We traced back with a fairly reasonable degree of confidence, infection peak time for countries by placing it 3 weeks before mortality peaks to evaluate how much of its natural course the disease had in different countries. Most peoples' lockdowns happened concurrently or after the peak had and when the curve was already diminishing.\nBelgium hit a plateau of 83 deaths on April 4th with consecutively 70, 75 and 86 to start dropping on April 8th, placing the probable peak and turnaround infection period around March 16th. That places the turnaround right after public places lockdown and before individual people lockdowned.\nFrance hit its plateau of excess rmortality on April 1st which places its probable peak around March 12th and March 14 th , after the ban on large gatherings, right before public places locked down, and 4 days before individual peoples were locked down. This applies also to Belgium, France, Italy, and the UK. No clear trend existed for lockdown in terms of mortality. Some public places were locked down early, some awaited outcomes and were locked down late, but we saw no clear trends to outcome for mortality in terms of when the lockdown occurred, how severe the lockdowns were, and how long they lasted. Most countries that locked down early avoided a severe peak, but Greece, Portugal, Malta, and Switzerland locked down late and had a mild epidemic.\n.

Countries deciding to lockdown their citizens did so as they were heading towards a high peak of infection and at the time without knowledge as to where they were in the curve except for predictions from mostly faulty epidemic models. Around April 10th (in Europe) consecutive drops began to occur each day in mortality. Studies from the Far East give us some sense as to what measures may have contributed to lowering of the curve.\nFrom the above data, it seems reasonable to assume that the epidemic followed much of its natural course in at least 17 of 21 countries mentioned. This is further confirmed by the absence of rebounds anywhere except for localized clusters in locations/populations that had not been exposed. Regions that were exposed and where the epidemic took its course benefit from a fair level of protection under spring and summer conditions with some risk of occasional clusters but a limited risk of a full national epidemic.\nLooking at a different part of the world, Japan had no lockdown, performed relatively few tests (less that most European countries), has very dense cities and one of the oldest populations, yet suffered a mild epidemic that did not seem to rebound. Japan simply instructed its population very early to avoid closed places, large crowds, and unnecessary physical contact with strangers as a policy that could be applied in the long term. Could that have sufficed? Perhaps their relatively superior diet and health helped. Tadjikistan had no lockdown and 6 deaths per million compared to Kazakstan's (with a lockdown) of 20 deaths per million. Japan's death rates were 8 deaths per million people; UK, 650; Spain, 607; Italy, 567; USA, 399; Germany, 52; and Norway, 46.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . In Europe, during the winter of 2020, Spain, Belgium, and the UK had a very different story than that of Portugal, Greece, Denmark or Germany with lower rates of infection. This can be particularly interesting, because of the high clustering nature of Covid and low dispersion factor. Once super-spreaders and clusters come under control, the propagation rate returns below 1 and the epidemic disappears.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190066 doi: medRxiv preprint (Mitchell, 2020) .

It has often been suggested that vitamin D may play a protective role in many respiratory and inflammatory diseases. Such suggestion may also be true for SARSCOV-2.

However, those countries closed their borders very early. In the presence of obesity, other variables (diabetes prevalence, smoking, age 70 years or older, life expectancy, population density) were insignificant, further demonstrating the importance of obesity as a significant indicator in the epidemic course. Japan, the country with the oldest population in the world, with very high population density, with no lockdown, few restrictions and low testing outperformed by most other countries, has the lowest obesity rate in the world at 4.3% and had minimal deaths. Others have confirmed these observations (Lighter et al., 2020; Tan, He, & MacGregor, 2020) .\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . The absolute death count as of June 25 is correlated with 2018 commercial AC demand at 0.86; 2018 total AC demand at 0.71; and commercial AC per capita at 0.58. Death per capita was associated with 2018 commercial AC demand at 0.77; commercial AC per capita at 0.64; and 2018 Total AC demand 2018 at 0.61 With regard to influenza spread, improvement of ventilation in high density public spaces could be an important and relatively easy-to-implement strategy supplementing vaccination, corresponding to a vaccination coverage of 60-70% for an efficacy of 40%, 50-60% for 60% efficacy, and 40-50% for 80% efficacy. In the aerosol model, consistently improved ventilation beats vaccination even with full coverage if efficacies are low. It can be done fast and it works for aerosols, known droplets, and yet unknown viruses (Lazzari, Smieszek, & Salath\u00e9, 2019) . All five hardest hit cities had a high concentration of modern office buildings and hotels with shared and/or a culture of centralized HVAC in office buildings, malls, homes (London, New York, Madrid, Brussels, Milan) . For most buildings, the easiest way to deliver outside air directly across the building envelope is to open a window. Window ventilation not only bypasses ductwork but increases outside air fraction and increases total air change rate as well (79). Administrators and building operators should discuss a plan for increasing perimeter, and specifically window, ventilation when outdoor temperatures are adequate for this practice (Dietz et al., 2020) .\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . Two studies hinted that blood type plays a role. We correlated multiple countries data mortality with blood type. We could not confirm these findings, with a slight statistical tendency the other way.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 Texas also had an up curve in which masks did not appear to show any effect. Texas made mask wearing mandatory on July 2nd. In these 2 states introduction of masks failed to bend the curve.\nWe used simulation tools to reproduce the dynamics of the epidemic comparing different regions and countries to understand dynamics of the epidemic. We ran a first set of simulations matching expansion, death rates and available antibody tests leading to 2 scenarios (seasonal and herd immunity). We published in late March preliminary results on propagmath.org indicating that both scenarios would lead to the epidemic subsiding by June 2020 in western Europe with a progressive gradient from South to North.\nWe observed that severity and fatality differed significantly from region to region beyond differences in accounting methods or healthcare systems needed to refine calculations, epidemic propagation, and severity. We explored the literature and isolated and tested significant factors, proposing a set of factors describing what may be an \"eco-system\" favorable to epidemic propagation or contraction. The most significant factors were hours of daylight and level of ultraviolet radiation (taking into account that different populations need different levels of UVs), closed spaces with recycled air (public transport, closed large gathering, events, shared A/C buildings with recycled air, slaughterhouses, and the like), humidity, age, and smoking status. We also accounted for the fact that data has accumulated to show that the virus started earlier than initially thought and thus has a lower R0. We saw that much of the propagation came from \"super-spreaders\" and in closed clusters. Super-spreaders are often more exposed and tend to be exposed earlier in the epidemic (for example, a transport driver would be exposed to hundreds of travelers and could in turn contaminate hundreds more). These super-spreaders are more likely to be infected in the first half of the epidemic. Once they subside, the R0 drops drastically.\nOur simulations on these factors led us to a herd immunity in major urban cities of around 20%-30% and in rural areas of around 7%-10% when weather conditions are most favorable to propagation and around 7%-14% in in major urban cities and 3%-6% in rural areas when weather conditions are least favorable to propagation. That would not stop clusters from happening in sunny, humid summers in slaughterhouses where temperatures are moderately cold, air is recycled, and people kept away from daylight. Epidemic spread conditions would not have occurred outside of a slaughterhouse. These simulations and herd immunity conclusions confirm other models showing that herd immunity may be much lower and faster than initially expected.\nOur simulations also show that in case of a new epidemic, changing A/C systems to fresh air, reducing population on public transport, favoring some teleworking, shutting down .

The population would be better protected and prepared for aerosol and droplet pathogens.\nGiven the correlation to UVs and the need for UV exposure combined with the literature on the benefits of vitamin D on respiratory diseases, inflammatory diseases, and even Covid-19, authorities could lead campaigns to ensure their populations have adequate sun exposure and vitamin D levels to protect in fall/winter from the common cold, influenza or a milder Covid.\nOur simulations led us to a crude corrected mortality rate between .06% and 0.4%, consistent with many serological studies except for Holland with 0.6% and Spain with 0.9%. Over-mortality can be calculated after the epidemic ends and may reduce these figures as it will take into account co-morbidities which seem to play a major role in this epidemic.\nOur simulations also lead us to 3 major scenarios Best case -Herd immunity or isolation is successful in the southern hemisphere before October and the virus disappears.\nMemory immunity case-The virus returns and 8% -15% of major cities' population (3%-5% rural) has lost its acquired immunity but can rely on memory immunity to produce quickly protective cells, thus reducing R 0 faster and severity faster. That would lead us to a curve that is 30% lower in number of cases and 38% lower in severity if little action is taken and 50% lower in number of cases and 70% lower in severity if effective moderating action is taken.\nSeasonal case-The virus returns and 8% -15% of major cities' population (3%-5% rural) has retained its acquired immunity thus reducing R 0 faster and severity even faster. That would lead us to a curve that is 60% lower in number of cases and 70% lower in severity if little action is taken and 70% lower in number of cases and 80% lower in severity if some effective moderating action is taken. If these projections are correct, in the following years we would have experienced the birth of a new common cold.\nIn all cases, we expect the next stages to be milder because of natural evolution, our ability to adapt, and maybe our ability to take reasonable constructive smart action.\nOur models, simulations are online to explore on .

Significant clusters have formed in gyms, hospitals, and slaughterhouses where masks were mandatory. The studies are not conclusive. A 2009 randomized, controlled trial in Japan did not demonstrate that masks prevented health care workers from contracted cold symptoms or colds. A 2010 systemic review found: \"There is some evidence to support the wearing of masks or respirators during illness to protect others, and public health emphasis on mask wearing during illness may help to reduce influenza virus transmission. There are fewer data to support the use of masks or respirators to prevent becoming infected (Cowling, Zhou, Ip, Leung, & Aiello, 2010 ). An RCT cautioned against the use of cloth masks due to moisture retention, reuse, and poor filtration, resulting in an increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally (MacIntyre et al., 2015) . Evidence as to efficacy is weak, and it becomes weaker when transposed into real life for large population and raises the question as to long term effects of prolonged mask wearing in populations.\nFor example, females wearing Hijab or Niqab had low plasma 25(OH)D levels, attributed to low sunlight or ultraviolet exposure (Mallah et al., 2011) . Masks reduce the surface area exposed to sunlight. The long-term use of traditional niqab can adversely affect the functional vital capacity and the fractional expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) among Saudi adult females (Alghadir, Aly, & Zafar, 2012) . Respiratory infections and asthma were significantly more common among veils users (p < 0.00001 and p < 0.0003, respectively, probably secondary to infection (Ahmad et al., 2001) . Discomfort levels increase with duration of time wearing masks and nasal resistance increases upon removal of an N-95 mask or a surgical facemask, potentially due to nasal physiological changes (Zhu, Lee, Wang, & Lee, 2014) . Masks wearing, is a political, sociological decision. The data does not support that it's being a meaningful factor in real life conditions where it may actually give an illusion of protection.\nDensity. Density is another driving factor and calls for attention, as the density of regions changes over time (especially from tourism), thus exposing naive populations who have had limited exposure to the virus. This may be limited when it happens in the summer, with some possible protection from sun and many open-air activities. These 2 driving factors may mitigate each other. However, the situation is different if people spend increasing time in closed places, aggravated by recycled air or HVAC where clusters may form. Authorities and people should consider alternatives to confined mass transport which may favor this epidemic and future ones beyond masks' relative protection. Authorities and companies may want to consider improving air circulation with renovated fresh air to protect employees and even gain productivity. SMIEZEK, et al. show how improving air exchange rates in buildings may correspond to a vaccination coverage of 60-70% for an efficacy of 40%, 50-60% for 60% efficacy, and 40-50% for 80% efficacy. In the aerosol model, consistently improved ventilation beats vaccination even with full coverage if efficacies are low (Lazzari et al., 2019) .\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . Data also indicates a very high r\u00f4le and proportion of deaths that are due to comorbidities mostly related to obesity and vitamin-d defficiency. This is further confirmed by the existence of many countries like Denmark observing an undermortality in spite of having some COVID deaths.\nProlonged anxiety, related to this episode is likely to increase obesity and vitamin-d defficiency making population more vulnerable.

This results in an IFR or lethality between 0.17% and 0.34%.\nHaving a closer look we notice a 3,725 count in over-mortality instead of 5,420 Covid declared deaths. Some of this could be due to deaths with comorbidities having been attributed to Covid. IFR may actually be lower and would drop to a range between 0.12 % to 0.34 %.\nLedberg (2020) explored the epidemic, only looking at the aggressive window from the end of March to early May reaching a count of 4857 representing a 10.5 % over-mortality, lower than the 1940/1941 influenza outbreak in terms of mortality/capita. Looking at a wider window gives a better perspective as to actual over-mortality. Covid's effect on a naive population has led to a maximum increased mortality of 8 % compared to influenza. in previous years assuming no deaths were caused by influenza, the effect of Covid on the population in Sweden where little restrictions were applied was an 8% increase in death compared to previous years, assuming all excessive death was caused by Covid and none by Influenza.\nThe 2020 Mortality from all causes was 0.48 %. Within that the over-mortality related to Covid was 0.04%. This is no comfort for those who lost loved ones, but as immunity builds, future eventual outbreaks are likely to be milder and more can be done to prevent mortality. Over a semester of Covid in Sweden, where the population was recommended to be cautious and large events were cancelled, but also where influenza seemed almost absent, the situation in terms of overmortality over a semester led to a situation 8 % to 10 % more severe than that of previous years in which there were influenza outbreaks.\nSweden is a country that does not benefit from sun, and where, like much of Europe, there is significant obesity. On the other hand, Stockholm, the main city, is less dense than some European capitals.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 9, 2020. . same excess in Covid counts with respect to over-mortality as observed for Sweden and Denmark. This difference could be caused by 2 possible explanations that could each could contribute to this massive 60 % overcount.

Especially for ordinary least squares regression, natural logarithmic transformations were done to remediate normality violations in the standardized residuals. Interpretation on the final model of the regression and analysis of variance were adjusted because of logarithmic transformations.\nFor correlational studies, whether continuous or count data were used, both Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlational tests were done according to the data used. Normality assumptions were not made as we used non-parametric correlation tests to overcome non-linearity. Most of these normality violations related to bimodal distribution, so running Pearson's correlation tests provided a complete description of the association. See On the Effects of Non-Normality on the Distribution of the Sample Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (Kowalski, 1975) . Also, power in significance testing were also done to ensure that for some data points that have very minimal number of samples, this was considered that the interpretation of significance is practically taken into consideration.\nFor cross-correlation of stochastic processes proper diagnostics were done to ensure the absence of autocorrelation processes that could signal the delayed copy of itself from its own function of lag. All significance levels are set at 0.05, otherwise specifically stated.\nOur initial Euro-centric approach led us to predict an end to the epidemic by late spring/ early summer in most of Europe which we published on March 20, 2020 (Karim, 2020) .\nSubsequently, we reviewed contemporary CoVid-19 studies for descriptions of the epidemic dynamics and the factors impacting spread or severity. We expanded our search for and use of worldwide data to help us calibrate models internationally. We applied our study to a variety of countries and continents in order to validate the approach and understand a wider range of situations.\nWe chose to focus on countries' published mortality rates rather than their published infection rates, as the former seemed more reliable. We confirmed that in Europe, communicated data on Covid-19 lethality matched the official mortality rates (in spite of many press articles indicating otherwise). We adjusted mortality numbers to account for methodology changes (e.g., France included retirement home deaths only in mid-February). We adjusted calculations by exploring case counts from the few reliable environments where enough tests were done to provide some validity. Finally, we included serology antibodies tests in our calculations, taking into account their error margins."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ".
