These states were selected from a set of nine states with available data to ensure variation in regional location and an adequate number of Title III-designated districts within each state to perform state-level analyses. National-level analyses were not feasible, due to the lack of completeness of 2006-07 and 2007-08 Title III-related data provided by state education officials through EDFacts   6 , a centralized data warehouse established by the U.S. Department of Education that features performance, financial, and other data-including Consolidated State Performance Reports (CSPRs) information-reported by state education agencies (SEAs), local education agencies (LEAs) and schools. In 2007-08, several new data elements were first required to be reported in EDFacts. Future data will be more complete and allow further analyses.\nFor Arizona, California, and New York, the Title III designation status (i.e., whether or not a subgrantee had missed its AMAOs for two or more consecutive years based on 2007-08 and prior years' test results) was collected for all 2007-08 Title III subgrantees from data located on state education agency Web sites or provided by state education officials. For North Carolina, the population of Title III subgrantees was constructed through data provided by state education officials through EDFacts 6 -specifically, the number of districts in 2007-08 for which states reported AMAO 1 and/or AMAO 2 as \"met\" or \"did not meet\" (North Carolina did not report data for AMAO 3 in 2007-08). Subgrantees designated under Title III were determined through extant data collected from the state Title III director in spring 2009. The resulting dataset contains:\n\u2022 Arizona: 215 Title III subgrantees;\n\u2022 California: 622 Title III subgrantees, including 56 charter schools that are not their own LEA according to the U.S.\nDepartment of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD);\n\u2022 The National Evaluation of Title III Implementation will provide more in-depth explorations of some of the issues presented in this brief, including analyses regarding\n\u2022 The procedures and considerations guiding states' development and revision of their AMAO targets and definitions;\n\u2022 Districts' awareness of their AMAO targets and performance status;\n\u2022 States' and districts' AMAO performance results through the 2008-09 school year; and\n\u2022 Characteristics of districts designated as having repeatedly missed their AMAO targets.
