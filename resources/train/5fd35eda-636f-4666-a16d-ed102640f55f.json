The number of S&E doctorate awards increased from 26,272 in 2004 and from 25,274 in 2003. Although there has been a 3-year increase in academic years 2002 through 2005, this follows a 4year decrease (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002) in S&E doctorate awards. The increase in the number of doctorate awards from 1996 to 2005 was only 2.7% (figure 1). Several demographic groups (women, non-U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizen Asians and underrepresented minorities) also received record numbers of S&E doctorates in 2005 (table 1). Post-9/11, there is little evidence of a decline in the number of or growth in noncitizens earning S&E doctorates from U.S. institutions. There was a slight drop in 2002, but that was also true for U.S. citizens. For the entire period from 2001 to 2005, S&E doctorates awarded to noncitizens increased by 25% and accounted for virtually all of the overall growth in S&E doctorate awards during the period. For several S&E fields, the 2005 counts were higher than the previous period of increase in the late 1990s. Fields reaching new highs in 2005 were: \u2022 Biological sciences (6,368) \u2022 Engineering (6,404) \u2022 Mathematics (1,203) \u2022 Computer sciences (1,136) Psychology and social sciences, in contrast, remained unchanged from 2004. For the broad non-S&E fields, the 2005 total of 15,380 represented a decline from the all-time high of 15,845 in 2004 (table 2). In 2005, a total of 19,564 doctorates were awarded to women-10,533 of these in science and engineering fields. The number of female S&E doctorate recipients has continued to increase overall, but their share of each field varies considerably by field of study (table 3).  1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 S&E Doctorates Hit All-time High in 2005 3 In S&E fields, the concentration of female doctorate recipients in 2005 is highest within psychology (68%), biological sciences (49%), and social sciences (45%) (figure 2). In the fields where women had the lowest representation there were increases between 1996 and 2005.
