The gradual deterioration of the brain cells results in disability of performing daily routine tasks. The treatment for this disease is still not mature enough. However, its early diagnosis may allow restraining the spread of disease. For early detection of Alzheimer's through brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an automated detection and classification system needs to be developed that can detect and classify the subject having dementia. These systems also need not only to classify dementia patients but to also identify the four progressing stages of dementia. The proposed system works on an efficient technique of utilizing transfer learning to classify the images by fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional network, AlexNet. The architecture is trained and tested over the pre-processed segmented (Grey Matter, White Matter, and Cerebral Spinal Fluid) and un-segmented images for both binary and multi-class classification. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated over Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset.

However, early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has also been reported in subjects of ages 40 to 50 years. According to one estimation, about 5 million people in the United States are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and with this rate, the number will be tripled by 2050 [3] .\nIn this era of research and development, Alzheimer's disease still lacks a distinctive treatment [4, 5] .

The technique segmented the input images into GM, White Matter (WM), and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) as part of the pre-processing step. The technique utilized GM as a ROI to build the similarity matrices, through which the statistical features were extracted. Extracted features, along with the clinical data, were classified into AD and normal. Wang et al. [5] proposed a classification method for the test subjects based on the estimation of the 3D displacement field. Feature reduction was applied over the extracted features using feature selection techniques, such as Bhattacharya distance, student t-test, and Welch's t-test. They then used the selected features to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, classifying the test data with an accuracy of 93.05%.\nBeheshti et al. in a previous study [1] devised a method to establish the significance of the volume reduction of GM. The method worked on the detection of shrinkage of GM both locally and globally using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The regions that showed a significant reduction in the GM region were used for the segmentation of Volumes of Interest (VOI). VOIs were then used for the extraction of features and were optimized through a genetic algorithm. The optimized features were classified using SVM with an accuracy of 84.17%. Similarly, in a previous study [3] regions showing significant volume reduction in GM were selected as VOIs. They utilized the voxel values from the VOIs as the raw features that undergo feature reduction using feature ranking techniques. The selected features were then classified using SVM with an accuracy of 92.48%. Ramaniharan proposed an analysis of the variation in the shape of the corpus callosum followed by the segmentation of T1-weighted MRI scans [22] . It worked on the extraction of morphological features using the Laplace Beltrami eigenvalue shape descriptor. Reduced features based on the ranking of information gain were made part of the feature space, which was then classified using SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Out of the two classification algorithms, KNN outperformed SVM with an accuracy of 93.7%.\nGuerrero proposed a feature extraction framework based on significant inter-subject variability [23] . ROIs were derived using a sparse regression model sampled for variable selection. An overall classification accuracy of 71% was achieved. Plocharski proposed a feature model based on the sulcal medical surface that classified Alzheimer's patients against normal ones [24] . The features used were obtained from distinct patients and were classified with an accuracy of 87.9%. Ahmed et al. utilized circular harmonic functions (CHF), extracting local features from the regions of the hippocampus and posterior cingulate of the brain [25] . The classification of these extracted local features gave an overall accuracy of 62.07%. Use of deep learning was proposed by Sarraf in a previous study [17] using CNN. The CNN was utilized accompanied by auto-encoders, showing promising results with an accuracy of 98.4%."}, {"section_title": "Multi-Class Classification Techniques", "text": "A hybrid feature vector was formed incorporating cortical thickness along with the texture and shape of the hippocampus region [25] .

The methodology was tested over the images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database over a multi-class classification problem giving an overall accuracy of 62.7%. Another multi-class classification technique was also proposed using the integrated features from the GM, WM, and CSF segments of the brain [26] . The extracted segments were then used to extract the statistical and textural features, classifying the samples as Alzheimer's Disease AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or normal. The samples were obtained through ADNI [27] database and were classified with an accuracy of 79.8%. Looking at the techniques utilized in the literature, work has been done in both the binary and multi-class classification of Alzheimer. The techniques achieved promising results over the MRI images, however, they utilized conventional machine learning techniques for the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). A novel approach is proposed to accurately classify the 3D views of the brain MRI images using transfer learning."}, {"section_title": "Deep-Learning-Based Alzheimer's Detection", "text": "In recent works, the use of deep learning methods has been significantly increased due to their high performance in comparison to conventional techniques. In a previous study [28] , a hybrid method was devised comprising of extracted patches from an autoencoder in a combination of convolutional layers. An improvement was made in another study [29] by utilizing the 3D convolution. Autoencoders in the form of a stack led by a SoftMax layer were utilized in a previous study [12] for classification. The popular CNN architectures, such as LeNet, along with the first inception model were employed in a previous study [17] . Because of our smart selection of training data with the use of transfer learning, the use of a fractional number of training samples resulted in comparable accuracy with those being explored in medical imaging. A comparative analysis has been drawn in a previous study [30] providing an in-depth result of training a model from scratch versus fine-tuning. The analysis showed that in most of the cases, the latter performed better than the prior. Fine-tuned CNN has been utilized over multiple medical imaging problems, such as localizing planes in ultra-sound images [31] , classification of interstitial lung diseases [20] , and retrieval of missing plane views in cardiac images [32] . The use of transfer learning in the medical domain, as discussed above, proves its significance in achieving high accuracy in AD detection.\nThe existing work focuses on binary classification to identify a patient with Alzheimer's disease.

A typical CNN is comprised of three basic layers, given as the convolution layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer. The convolution layer is the core building layer of a CNN and is responsible for most of the computational work done. As its name indicates, it performs the convolution operation or filtration over the input, forwarding the response to the next layer. The applied filter acts as a feature identifier, filtering the entire input and forming a feature map. In between the consecutive convolution there is the pooling layer, used to spatially reduce the spatial representation and the computational space. The pooling layer performs the pooling operation on each of the sliced inputs, reducing the computational cost for the next convolution layer. The application of convolution and pooling layers results in the extraction and reduction of features from the input images. The final output equal to the number of classes is generated by applying the fully connected layer. A CNN is a stacked version of all these layers forming a CNN architecture. Each CNN follows the same architecture, however, with a few variations. In this work, we have utilized the AlexNet pre-trained architecture for Alzheimer's detection [34] ."}, {"section_title": "Transfer Learning Parameters", "text": "The transfer learning concept is commonly used in deep learning applications. The transfer learning approach is helpful if we have a small training dataset for parameter learning. We take a trained network, e.g., AlexNet as a starting point to learn a new task. AlexNet is trained on a large dataset of ImageNet with a large number of labeled images. We transfer the pre-trained parameters of internal layers of AlexNet (all layers except last three layers) and we replace the three fully connected layers of AlexNet with the softmax layer, fully connected layer, and output classification layer. A domain D consists of two components: feature space represented by X, and its respective marginal probability P(X) [35] , where X = {x1, x2, \u2026, xn} and n is the number of input images. Mathematically, a domain can be represented as\nFor two different domains, their respective feature space along with their marginal probabilities would also be different.

Mathematically, this is given as\nThe predictive function f(.) is learned during the training process of features X labeled as Y and is used to predict the testing data. In our proposed method of utilizing a pre-trained network of AlexNet, we experience the case where there is one source domain Ds and one target domain Dt. The source domain data is denoted as A domain D consists of two components: feature space represented by X, and its respective marginal probability P(X) [35] , where X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n } and n is the number of input images.

In our proposed methodology the source and the target domain are dissimilar, causing the components to be dissimilar as well, implying either X s X t or P(X s ) P(X t ). As for the tasks T, the label y t and y s are also not equal. AlexNet is a pre-trained CNN over the natural images dataset ImageNet forming the source Domain D s . The CNN architecture of AlexNet contains in excess of 60 million parameters. Taking in such huge numbers of parameters from just a thousand training images in a straightforward manner is dangerous. The key idea of this work is that the inside layers of the CNN can extract generic features of images, which can be pre-prepared in one domain D s (the source errand, here ImageNet) and then these parameters can be re-utilized for classification of a new task D t (Alzheimer's classification)."}, {"section_title": "Modified Network Architecture", "text": "We use the pre-trained architecture AlexNet.

In order to achieve the transfer learning, we extract all the layers of AlexNet (except last three layers) as transfer layers and replace the last three layers of AlexNet with modified SoftMax layers, fully connected layers, and an output classification layer, so that they learn the class specific features of the Alzheimer's dataset.\nThe first 5 layers are trained using AlexNet (ImageNet) and remain fixed, while Alzheimer's datasets are used to train the remaining adaptation layers.

A pixel-based operation is performed mapping each input pixel value to its corresponding output intensity value.

The extracted evaluation metrics, as discussed in the previous section, are listed below in Table 3 .\nFrom the statistical analysis of the classification accuracies and estimation errors, it has been observed that the system performed at its best for multi-class classification of un-segmented images. It can be deduced from the results that the cumulative information of GM, WM, and CSF proved to be distinctive enough for the better classification of the AD. The un-segmented images as inputs reduced the computational complexity by two-thirds and resulted in high accuracy of 92.8%. The learning time for each classification scenario is given in Table 3 . These learning times are highly dependent on machine specifications. Alzheimer's detection and classification are of high significance for both binary and multi-class problem among researchers. Work has been done in both binary and multi-class classification of Alzheimer's, as given in the related work section. A comparative analysis of the proposed methodology has been made with the existing techniques that handle multiclass classification. Considering the techniques proposed in the past, high accuracy has been achieved in classifying the test subjects as having Alzheimer's or not. However, transfer learning has never been used to test the accuracy of the system, which serves as a novel approach towards Alzheimer's classification. With high accuracy achieved in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in a test subject, detection of the level of progression is of high significance. The spread of disease allows the treatment required for the patient to be determined. A few instances of implementation can be seen in the past, however, none of these used the proposed methods.\nA hybrid feature vector of textural and clinical data was utilized by Tooba at al. for multi-class classification of Alzheimer's in the sample, using MRI scans. The technique achieved an overall accuracy of 79.8% for multi-class classification. Similarly, another hybrid feature vector was also classified, formed by the combination of structural and morphological features. S\u00f8rensen et al. classified the hybrid feature vector for multi-class classification, resulting in an accuracy of 62.7%. In comparison to the techniques discussed above, our proposed method of utilizing AlexNet architecture for transfer learning achieved the highest accuracy of 92.8%, as shown in Table 4 .

In this work, we proposed an efficient and automated system based on a transfer learning classification model of Alzheimer's disease for both binary and multi-class problems (Alzheimer's stage detection). The algorithm utilized a pre-trained network, AlexNet, and fine-tuned the CNN for our proposed problem. The proposed model was fine-tuned over both segmented and un-segmented 3D views of human brain MRI scans. The MRI scans were segmented into characteristic components of GM, WM, and CSF. The re-trained CNN was then validated using the testing data, giving overall accuracies of 89.6% and 92.8% for binary and multi-class problems, respectively. It was observed that the unsegmented images carried enough information to be accurately classified in comparison to the segmented scans. In our future work, we will analyze the accuracy of the system by fine-tuning all of the convolutional layers and will explore the effectiveness of other state-of-the-art CNN architectures.
