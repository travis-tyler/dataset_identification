[{"section_title": "Data Tables", "text": "U.S. gross domestic product and R&D: 1953-2015 Gross domestic product, total R&D, ratio of R&D to gross domestic product U.     b The R&D expenditures of FFRDCs are chiefly federally funded; the small remainder ($381 million of the $17.9 billion total in 2014) reflects funding from state or local government, businesses, other nonprofit organizations, and other sources (see table 6 for further detail on this nonfederal funding). Prior to 2001, the data did not distinguish federal and nonfederal funding for FFRDC R&D and are reported as all federal funding. In 1953-54, federal funding for business R&D did not separate out industry-administered FFRDCS, and the data for federal funding to business for these years include the funding to these FFRDCs. Also in 1953-54, federal funding for other nonprofit organizations did not separate out nonprofit-administered FFRDCs, and the data for federal funding to other nonprofit organizations for these years include the funding to these FFRDCs. c State intramural R&D performance includes state agency and department employees and also services performed by others in support of internal R&D projects; also includes funding from both federal and nonfederal government sources (see table 6 for further detail). Data on state government intramural R&D became available starting in 2006. d R&D performed in the domestic United States by all companies with 5 employees or more, publicly or privately held. In 2008 and later years, the data on business R&D come from the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) annual Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). BRDIS distinguishes R&D performed and paid for by the company from R&D performed by the company but paid for by one or more others (i.e., the federal government, state or local government, domestic companies, foreign companies, foreign governments, other organizations inside or outside the United States). Prior to 2008, the data distinguished only federally and nonfederally funded business R&D; for these years, the own domestic funding data column includes all nonfederal sources of funding. Business R&D performance in the United States paid for by foreign business includes funding from parent or unaffiliated businesses outside the United States ($17.2 billion in 2014) and funding from U.S. businesses' foreign subsidiaries ($5.3 billion in 2014). Business R&D performance funded by other sources includes U.S. state government, foreign government, and all other sources in the United States and abroad. e Before 2003, higher education R&D covered only science and engineering (S&E) fields; in 2003 and later years, R&D in non-S&E fields is also included. (Non-S&E R&D was $1.4 billion in 2003 and $3.4 billion in 2014.) In 1998 and later years, the higher education R&D data have been adjusted to eliminate double counting of R&D funds passed through from one academic institution to another. (In FY 1998, the total of pass-through funds reported was $479 million, $421 million of which were federal dollars. In FY 2014, total pass-through was $3.169 billion, with $2.835 billion federal.) The nonfederal government funding category includes support from state and local government. The other nonprofit funding category includes support from nonprofit organizations and other sources not elsewhere classified. (In 2014, $4.063 billion was from nonprofit organizations, and $1.944 billion was from these unclassified other sources.) f The data on other nonprofit R&D funded by the federal government come from NSF's annual Federal Funds for R&D Survey. That funded by nonfederal government is included in the ONP category. The 1998-2015 data for other components funded by businesses and by the nonprofit sector itself are estimated, based on parameters from the 1996-97 Survey of R&D Funding and Performance by Nonprofit Organizations. g Some data for 2014 are preliminary and may later be revised. h The data for 2015 are estimates and will later be revised. NOTES: Detail may not add to total due to rounding. Constant-dollar estimates are derived from unrounded data. For trend comparisons, use only the historical data reported in this table because some back-year data may have been revised. Except for the nonprofit sector, data are based on annual reports by performers in NSF's annual R&D expenditure surveys: Business R&D and Innovation Survey, Higher Education R&D Survey, Survey of Federal Funds for R&D, FFRDC R&D Expenditures Survey, and Survey of State Government R&D. R&D expenditures by business performers-and also, before 2001, industry-administered FFRDCs-are collected on a calendar year basis. Expenditures for other performers are calendar year approximations based on fiscal year data. For federal performers in 1977 and afterward, the approximation equals 75% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 25% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. Prior to 1977, the federal fiscal year began on 1 July, not 1 October, and the approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year. The fiscal year for higher education performers and state government performers generally begins 1 July, and the calendar year approximation is 50% of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 50% of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year.

FFRDCs are R&D-performing organizations administered by an industrial firm, a university, a nonprofit institution, or a consortium but that have funding exclusively or substantially from the federal government. An FFRDC is operated to provide R&D capability to serve an agency's mission objectives or, in some cases, to provide major facilities at universities for research and training purposes. Since FY 2001, NCSES's FFRDC Research and Development Survey (known previously as the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at FFRDCs) has provided annual data (by federal fiscal year) on the R&D expenditures (with additional detail) of all the nation's FFRDCs (https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyffrdc/). Prior to FY 2001, R&D expenditure data for the FFRDCs were collected as part of the major performer surveys: the Survey of R&D Expenditures at Universities and Colleges (for university-administered FFRDCs), the Survey of Industrial R&D (for industryadministered FFRDCs), and the Federal Funds Survey (for nonprofit-administered FFRDCs)."}, {"section_title": "Nonfederal Government", "text": "The category of nonfederal government R&D performance included in National Patterns is the intramural R&D of state governments (i.e., the R&D performance of state agency and department employees and also the services performed by others in support of internal R&D projects).

Furthermore, preliminary or otherwise estimated values may be used (and later revised) where final data from one or more of the surveys are not yet available but can reasonably be calculated. Key features of the methodology include the following. \u2022 Data from BRDIS are reported on a calendar year basis and are incorporated directly in the National Patterns totals. Data from the Federal Funds Survey and the FFRDC Research and Development Survey are reported on a federal fiscal year basis (1 October-30 September the next year) and are adjusted to the calendar year for National Patterns integration. The data from the HERD Survey are reported on an academic fiscal year basis (typically, 1 July-30 June the next year) and converted to calendar year. Data from the Survey of State Government R&D are reported according to each state's fiscal year and also are converted to calendar year (presuming that 1 July-30 June the next year is typical). \u2022 For 1998 and later years, the R&D data for higher education have been adjusted to eliminate double counting of funds passed through from one academic institution to another. For example, in FY 1998, a total of $479 million in pass-through funds were reported out of $25.9 billion of all academic R&D expenditures that year. Comparable figures for FY 2014 are $3.2 billion in double-counted pass-through funds out of $64.7 billion in higher education R&D. \u2022 The data for higher education prior to 2003 cover only science and engineering (S&E) fields; in 2003 and later years, R&D in non-S&E fields is also included. Non-S&E R&D was $1.4 billion in FY 2003 and $3.4 billion in FY 2014. Similarly, social science R&D was not included as part of business R&D until the 2008 data year, when it was $0.8 billion of the $290.7 billion business R&D total. \u2022 The method for estimating type of R&D (i.e., basic research, applied research, experimental development) for the business sector was revised for 1998 and later years. This change resulted in a net decrease in the proportion of business R&D classified as basic research."}]
