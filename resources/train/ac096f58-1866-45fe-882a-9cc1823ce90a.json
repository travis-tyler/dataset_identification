These were originally collected for a variety of operational and research missions by: U.S. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (primarily the U.S. Navy) and Department of Commerce; State and local government agencies; universities and research institutions; and private industry. NODC data holdings extend back over one hundred years, and the volume is expected to grow exponentially as new ocean observing systems are deployed [2.] Through NODC archive and access services these ocean data are being used to answer questions about climate change, ocean phenomena, management of coastal and marine resources, marine transportation, recreation, national security, and natural disasters. Another significant user community is academia where these data and information products help teach new generations of students about the oceans. Requests for oceanographic data and information have increased each year since the Center was established in 1961. Figure 1. NODC Organizational Chart (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-About/orgchart.html) As of January 2015, the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) merged with the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) to form the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

To date, over 35,000 images have been digitized and reside in the online NOAA Photo Library. This number will continue growing as long as there are environmental problems to study and solve, as long as the citizens of the United States are threatened by violent weather, as long as mariners need nautical charts, and as long as creatures of the sea need our protection to survive.

Poised to build on a rich legacy of undersea exploration, discovery, and research, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) builds from the merger of two unique NOAA programs -NOAA's Undersea Research Program (NURP) and the Office of Ocean Exploration (OE). The office will provide NOAA and the Nation with a unique capability to discover and investigate new ocean areas and phenomena, conduct the basic research required to capitalize on discoveries, and to seamlessly disseminate data and information-rich products to a multitude of users. In response to recommendations within the Report of the President's Panel on Ocean Exploration (2001, .pdf, 2.54 MB) for NOAA to establish a broad-based data management task force, The National Oceanographic Data Center led the formation of an Integrated Product Team (IPT). The Team took form in partnership with OE, other NOAA and non-NOAA partners, and has provided a framework for exploration data management since 2002. This resulted in the development of several Data Management tools, some of which provide extensible functions to other applications.\" Online access: http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/SatelliteData/ \"The primary goal of the NODC satellite group is to provide scientific stewardship of satellite-derived oceanographic datasets and analyses.
