[{"section_title": "", "text": "The economic well-being of farm households and the parity of well-being between farm and nonfarm households have been of enormous interest to agricultural policy makers since the 1930s. As the well-being of farm households improved over time in comparison to nonfarm households, the goals of agricultural policy have been to provide financial support for agricultural production, increase farm income and well-being, and provide a safety net for farmers. For example, provisions of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (also referred as the 2002 Farm Bill) give income support to farmers who grow any of the eight program crops. Another provision of the 2002 Farm Bill offers further help to young and beginning farmers and ranchers to establish their farm businesses by increasing access to credit and conservation opportunities. The presumption has been that providing support to farm households would increase their economic well-being so that it would become comparable to that of their nonfarm peers. Comparing the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households is complicated because of their diversity. Many farm households today have complex organization and structure and engage in both farm and off-farm activities. While farming is a major source of business income for some households, it is a Ani L.

The author would like to thank Robert Thompson and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and Robert Dubman and Mark Schleusener for their assistance in accessing the ARMS data. lifestyle choice for others who derive most of their income off the farm. Nonfarm households also differ along several important dimensions, one of which is whether they engage in entrepreneurial/business activities. Because households are heterogeneous with respect to their degree of involvement in business activities, these differences need to be accounted for when farm and nonfarm households are compared. Economic well-being also depends on the life-cycle stage of the households. It is expected that both farm and nonfarm households will have a hump-shaped distribution, with lower income and wealth for younger and older households than that for middle aged households. However, it is not clear whether young farm households have significantly lower wellbeing or more unequally distributed income and wealth compared to their older farm peers and their young nonfarm peers. Examining these trends has important implications for farm policy, which currently provides special assistance for young farmers. The objective of this study is to undertake a comprehensive comparison of the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using two national, representative surveys. The major contribution of this study is the consideration of two important dimensions of heterogeneity: the degree of involvement in business activities and differences across life-cycle stages for the households. Households' economic well-being will be examined and compared in terms of levels and distribution among households using several methods: parametric and nonparametric tests, regression analyses, and inequality measures. The results from this study will reveal important insights into the parity of well-being between farm and nonfarm families."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Issues and Previous Studies", "text": "Economists and policy makers have long been interested in measuring the economic wellbeing of the population, both within the United States and across countries. Several measures have been proposed to quantify the economic well-being of families such as income, earnings, wealth, and consumption expenditures (Rodriguez et al. 2002). In the agricultural sector, income and wealth have frequently been used to measure economic well-being (Carlin and Reinsel 1973;El-Osta and Morehart 2002;Mishra et al. 2002). An analysis of economic well-being includes considerations of both the average levels and the distribution of income and wealth across families. Previous studies have examined either the well-being of all households in the United States or the well-being of farm families. Only a few studies have compared farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data sets, and their analyses were limited in scope (Hopkins and Morehart 2004;Mishra et al. 2002). This study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the comparative economic well-being between farm and nonfarm households, based on both the degree of involvement in business activities and the life-cycle stages of the households, in addition to testing for significant differences in well-being among different groups of households. An important dimension of heterogeneity among households is their involvement in entrepreneurial/business activities. Entrepreneurs are usually defined as people who are self-employed or who own a business (Gentry and Hubbard 2004). The difference between the two groups is that households that own businesses have made capital investments similar to farm households, whereas self-employed individuals may have only invested their human capital in their entrepreneurial activities. Because the goal is to compare farm and nonfarm households, nonfarm entrepreneurs are considered as those households that own a business rather than those who are self-employed. Previous research has shown that the income and wealth of nonfarm households differ significantly based on their involvement with business activities. Several reasons have been offered for these differences, such as liquidity constraints associated with investing in a business and/or different savings behavior for business owners and wage earners (Gentry and Hubbard 2004;Hurst and Lusardi 2004;Quadrini 2000). Farm households also differ based on their degree of involvement with farming. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed three farm typology groups: rural residence farms (limited-resource, retirement, and residential/lifestyle), intermediate farms (those with sales less than $250,000 and whose operators report farming as their major business), and commercial farms (those with sales greater than $250,000). Although rural residence farms by definition own a farm business, the average rural residence farm household reports a negative farm income, where the farm business detracts from the total household income. Because rural residence farm households derive their income from offfarm sources, the hypothesis tested in this study is that their well-being (and in particular income) will not be significantly different from that of wage-earning nonfarm households who do not own a business. On the other hand, since commercial farms derive the majority of their income from their farm businesses, it is hypothesized that their well-being will be comparable to that of nonfarm households operating businesses in different sectors of the economy. Another important dimension of heterogeneity among households is based on their life-cycle stages. The life-cycle hypothesis predicts that both income and wealth exhibit a hump-shaped form, where income and wealth increase until retirement and then decline after retirement. The life-cycle hypothesis cannot be tested with cross-sectional data, as is the case in this study, because age and cohort effects cannot be disentangled from a single cross section of data (Alessie, Lusardi, and Aldershof 1997;Jappelli 1999). However, while cross-sectional data cannot measure changes in households' well-being as they age over time, these data can be used to document differences in wellbeing across households at various stages in the life cycle in a given year. Several studies have found that even in a cross-sectional context, households at various stages of the life cycle differ with respect to their well-being, consumer debt choices, and portfolio allocation of wealth (Baek and Hong 2004;Milligan 2005;Poterba and Samwick 1997). Thus, this study considers differences in economic well-being across young, middle-aged, and old households in a cross-sectional context. Such cross-sectional differences in well-being will provide insights for farm policy because limited government support is particularly targeted for young and beginning farmers."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "Comparisons of the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households are conducted in terms of income and net worth. Because of household heterogeneity, analyses are also conducted for subgroups of households based on their involvement in business activities and their life-cycle stages. Several methods are used to compare the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households: parametric and nonparametric tests, regression analyses, and inequality measures."}, {"section_title": "Parametric and Nonparametric Tests", "text": "Parametric and nonparametric tests are used to analyze whether income and net worth are similar for various groups of farm and nonfarm households. Because income and net worth have nonsymmetric distributions, this study considers comparisons of both means and medians among the different groups of households. Parametric tests for comparing means assume that the variables are normally distributed. However, when the sample sizes are large, as is the case here, the sampling distribution of the mean can be approximated by the normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem. In this study, t-tests are used to compare the means of income and wealth between household groups, using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparison groups. The Bonferroni corrections is a conservative approach, which sets the overall significance level \u2423 for all k comparisons, by adjusting the significance level of each pairwise comparison to \u2423/k. Nonparametric tests have less restrictive assumptions than parametric tests, namely, nonparametric tests do not assume normality. However, these techniques rely upon the ranks of the individual observations rather than the absolute numeric values, which can lead to loss of information. The nonparametric tests are commonly referred as tests comparing the medians of the groups. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U (also called rank sum) test has the following test statistic: where n 1 and n 2 are the two sample sizes, and R 1 is the sum of the ranks in sample 1. The Kruskal-Wallis is a multisample generalization of the two-sample Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated as: where n is the overall sample size and R j is the sum of the ranks for the jth sample. The sampling distribution of H is approximately 2 with m-1 degrees of freedom, where m is the number of groups being compared. Both parametric tests for comparing means and nonparametric tests for comparing medians are used to test for significant differences in economic well-being between farm and nonfarm households.\nParametric and nonparametric tests are conducted for the three types of farm households and the two types of nonfarm households to test whether there are significant differences between farm and nonfarm households based on their involvement with business activities. Table 4 shows the differences in mean income and wealth among the five groups of households and denotes whether or not these differences are significant. The results show that business-owning nonfarm households and commercial farm households have a significantly higher well-being than nonfarm households without businesses and rural residence and intermediate farm households, in terms of both mean income and net worth. The mean income and net worth for commercial farms and entrepreneurial nonfarm households are not significantly different from each other. Generally, the results show that higher involvement in business activities is associated with higher average economic well-being. Nonfarm households without businesses on average have significantly lower income and wealth than other groups, with the exception of having similar mean income to intermediate farms. These findings provide evidence that in terms of average economic well-being, commercial farms are comparable to entrepreneurial nonfarm households. While nonentrepreneurial nonfarm households have similar average income to intermediate farms, they have lower net worth than rural residence or intermediate farms. Table 5 provides results for the nonparametric comparisons of economic well-being across household groups. These tests show  differences in the median values of income and wealth for farm and nonfarm households, where the actual values are replaced by rankings. The results follow similar trends as with the mean comparisons, except that all differences turn out to be significant across groups. Overall, the results show that entrepreneurial nonfarm households and commercial farms have higher mean and median economic wellbeing than households that are less involved with business activities. These trends are also confirmed when government payments are removed from farm households' income. Even though incomes without government assistance for farm households are lower, the same findings are still present: the mean income without government payments for commercial farms is still comparable to that of nonfarm households with businesses, and the mean income of nonentrepreneurial nonfarm households is similar to that of intermediate farms."}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "Regression analysis is often used to test for differences across life-cycle stages where these life-cycle stages are represented with indicator variables. In this study, regression analysis is used to test whether the youngest households have a significantly lower well-being than their older peers. The advantage of regression analysis is that other control variables that are assumed to influence economic well-being may also be included. Education and family size are assumed to affect income and wealth, and are therefore included as control variables. The regression models are estimated for all farm and nonfarm households and also for subgroups of households based on their business activities.\nRegression analysis is used to test for differences in economic well-being across life-cycle stages. The different stages of the life cycle (ages 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and >65) are represented with dummy variables. Because policy makers are particularly concerned about the well-being of young farmers, the youngest age group is excluded from the regression model so that these households can be compared with the rest of the households. Regression analysis has the advantage of including other control variables that are likely to influence economic well-being, such as the household head's education level and the number of people in the household. In comparison to the youngest age group, older nonfarm households generally exhibit higher incomes and net worth (tables 6 and 7). These findings are also found for different groups based on involvement in business activities, except for commercial farms. The results show that older commercial farm households have a higher wealth but not significantly higher income in comparison to their younger peers. The lack of variation in income across age groups for commercial farms may be an indication of substantial managerial skills that are needed to operate a commercial farm. Education and household size are associated with higher income and wealth for nonfarm households. However, household size does not affect the wealth of farm households and the income of intermediate and commercial farms. In summary, the regression results show that both farm and nonfarm households exhibit life-cycle trends for income and wealth, except that significant life-cycle variations in income are not observed for commercial farm households. In other words, the results show that young commercial farm households do not have lower incomes than their older counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Inequality Measures", "text": "Farm and nonfarm households may have similar average well-being but the distribution of income and wealth among households may be different. The degrees of inequality in the income and wealth distributions are measured using Gini coefficients. A Gini coefficient of 0 shows a perfectly equal distribution of income and wealth among households. On the other hand, a Gini coefficient of 1 shows extreme inequality where one household holds all income or net worth. A difference of 0.01 in Gini coefficients is generally considered statistically significant (Rodriquez et al. 2002). The Gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula: where the households are ranked in ascending order of y i , and\u0233 i and n i are the mean and the number of observations of group i, respectively. Gini coefficients are calculated for groups of households based on their involvement with business activities and their lifecycle stages, and the results are compared for farm and nonfarm households.\nComparisons of the average income and wealth of farm and nonfarm households have limitations. While some groups of households may have the same average well-being as others, the distribution of well-being among the households in the group may be quite different. Such considerations are important because policy makers are particularly concerned about income and wealth equity among families and the redistribution of resources in the economy. Gini coefficients are calculated to measure the degree of income and wealth inequality among households (tables 8 and 9). A Gini coefficient of zero represents complete equality among families, while a coefficient of 1 represents complete inequality where one household holds all of the income or wealth in the economy. The results show that income is less equally distributed than wealth for farm households, with a Gini coefficient for income of 0.5832 and a Gini coefficient for wealth of 0.5164. On the other hand, nonfarm households have incomes that are more equally distributed than net worth, with Gini coefficients for income and wealth of 0.5388 and 0.8080, respectively. Generally, income inequality is similar for farm and nonfarm households, while nonfarm households exhibit greater inequality of wealth. Income inequalities differ based on the households' involvement in business activities. The Gini coefficients for income inequality are similar for rural residence farms and nonentrepreneurial nonfarm households (0.4975 and 0.4777), and these are lower than the Gini coefficients of 0.6042 for intermediate farms, 0.7348 for commercial farms, and 0.6111 for entrepreneurial nonfarm households. In other words, the groups of households that are more involved in entrepreneurial activities tend to have a higher level of income inequality. On the other hand, households that rely heavily on wage earning jobs for their income tend to have more equally distributed incomes  than their entrepreneurial peers. One explanation for this result may be the importance of management skills for the success of business for entrepreneurial households, which may contribute to the larger disparity among observed incomes. Therefore, intermediate farm households are similar to nonfarm households without businesses in terms of average levels of income, whereas rural residence households are similar to nonentrepreneurial nonfarm households in terms of the distribution of income among households. Similarly, commercial farms are similar to entrepreneurial nonfarm households based on both average income and the distribution of income among households. While income inequalities differ based on the level of involvement with business activities, wealth inequality is relatively similar for the three types of farms. The Gini coefficients for the distribution of net worth across farm households are 0.4865 for rural residence farms, 0.4779 for intermediate farms, and 0.5167 for commercial farms. The two types of nonfarm households have Gini coefficients for wealth of 0.7648 for nonentrepreneurial households and 0.7553 for entrepreneurial households. Therefore, although nonfarm households tend to have more unequally distributed wealth than farm households, wealth inequality among the two types of nonfarm households does not depend on the level of entrepreneurial activities. The life-cycle stages of the households also affect the inequality in income and wealth, but both farm and nonfarm households exhibit similar trends. The oldest two groups of households typically have the highest income inequality. Wealth inequalities are generally highest for the youngest groups of households,   with the exception of entrepreneurial nonfarm households. Overall, these findings indicate that income inequality is similar for farm and nonfarm households, while wealth is less equally distributed among nonfarm households. Income inequality differs based on the level of entrepreneurship, with higher income inequalities for both farm and nonfarm households that are more involved with business activities. However, wealth inequality is not affected by the level of entrepreneurship. The life-cycle patterns of inequalities are similar across households, with income inequality being highest for the oldest households while wealth inequality is highest for the youngest households."}, {"section_title": "Data and Results", "text": "This study uses data from two national surveys: the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which is conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is conducted triennially by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The 19,468 households included in the 2004 ARMS data represent 2,060,822 farm households in the United States. The 2004 SCF data include information for 4,519 households, with 45 of these households reporting that they operate a farm business. The farm households in the SCF are excluded from the analysis, leaving 4,474 nonfarm households representing 111,380,760 nonfarm households in the United States. Farm and nonfarm households are further divided according to their involvement with business activities. Based on the USDA's farm typologies, the farm households are grouped into 6,566 rural residence farms, 5,569 intermediate farms, and 7,333 commercial farms. The nonfarm households include 3,134 nonentrepreneurial households that do not own businesses and 1,340 entrepreneurial households with businesses. Farm and nonfarm households are also divided into groups based on their stage in the life cycle. For this study, five groups are chosen based on the age of the household head: <34 years, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and >65 years old. Reports summarizing the ARMS data primarily use these age categories (Mishra et al. 2002). Reports summarizing the SCF data usually use an additional group with household heads older than seventy-five years, but for consistency the last two SCF age categories are combined to match the definitions of the farm households' age groups (Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore 2003;Bucks, Kennickell, and Moore 2006). The classification of households by their life-cycle stages produces reasonable sample sizes in each group. Economic well-being is represented by the total household income and net worth (wealth) of the farm and nonfarm households. Tables 1  and 2 show the mean and median income and wealth for farm and nonfarm households. The average income of $81,596 for farm households is higher than the average income for nonfarm households ($70,645). Farm households have also accumulated higher average net worth ($739,953) than nonfarm households ($443,101). Economic well-being differs depending on the households' business activities. The average income for rural residence farms ($75,337) is somewhat higher than the average income of intermediate farms ($64,888), but is much lower than the average income of commercial farms ($192,108). The average wealth is $594,068 for rural residence farms, $806,621 for intermediate farms, and $1,786,667 for commercial farms, with a higher net worth associated with more involvement in business activities. Economic well-being is also higher for nonfarm households that own businesses, with an average income of $164,705 and net worth of $1,651,380. In comparison, nonfarm households without businesses have an average income of $56,878 and wealth of $266,257. When median instead of mean values for income and net worth are considered, similar trends are observed. Farm households have a higher median income of $53,651 and median net worth of $456,914 than nonfarm households with a median income of $43,129 and a median net worth of $443,101. The median values also vary based on involvement with business activities: rural residence and intermediate farm households have lower median income and net worth than those of commercial farms. Nonfarm households without businesses also have lower median income and net worth than those of entrepreneurial nonfarm households. Another source of heterogeneity among households is their stage in the life cycle. Overall, farm and nonfarm household income shows the typical life-cycle pattern of higher income for middle-aged groups and lower incomes for the youngest and oldest age groups. However, some of these income trends, particularly for the youngest and the oldest households, differ based on the households' involvement with business activities. The pattern of lower income for the oldest individuals is not present for intermediate and commercial farms. In addition, the life-cycle pattern of the youngest households having lower incomes than their peers is not present for the commercial farm households. Therefore, these findings indicate that young commercial farm households are not disadvantaged in comparison to their peers in terms of their average income. The wealth of rural residence farms and nonfarm households without businesses shows the well-known hump-shaped life-cycle distribution where net worth is highest for households who are in their preretirement years. However, the wealth of intermediate and commercial farms and entrepreneurial nonfarm households is incrementally higher across the life-cycle stages, without showing a decline for the oldest households. Net worth of the youngest households is lower than the rest of the households. An alternative classification of households based on the organization of the business is also considered to check for robustness of the findings in this study. 1 Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for farm and nonfarm households that own businesses, which are established as sole proprietorships. When these two groups of farm and nonfarm households are compared, 1 Another alternative classification can be considered where the entrepreneurial nonfarm households are divided into two groups with gross sales from the business of less than or more than $250,000 (to match the definition of commercial farms). The low-sales nonfarm households have similar incomes but lower wealth than intermediate farms, while high-sales nonfarm households have significantly higher income and wealth than those of commercial farms. nonfarm sole proprietors have a higher average income of $87,068 than the average income of farm sole proprietors ($77,260). The average net worth is similar for farm sole proprietors ($683,318) and nonfarm sole proprietors ($702,053). In addition, the same trends of lifecycle patterns are found across the two groups, with nonfarm households generally following a stronger pattern of life cycle with more variation across groups. These findings indicate that when alternative groups of households are considered based on the organization of the business, the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households is also comparable. Government payments directly increase farm households' income, and increase their net worth as they are capitalized into land values and as they increase savings and investments. The contribution of government payments to total household income is relatively easy to separate from other sources of income. However, the capitalization of government payments into farm wealth over time is difficult to determine and is beyond the scope of this study. The average farm household received $4,803 in government payments in 2004. Government assistance increases with the involvement in business activities: rural residence farms received on average $1, 263 "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "This study compares the economic well-being of farm and nonfarm households using national, representative data from the USDA's 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey and the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances. Because of the heterogeneity of households, the analyses are performed for all households as well as for subgroups of households based on their involvement in business activities and their lifecycle stages. The study uses several methods to compare households: parametric and nonparametric tests, regression analysis, and inequality measures. Income and wealth comparisons between farm and nonfarm households reveal several interesting results. On average, farm house-holds seem to have higher economic well-being in terms of income and net worth than nonfarm households, but several types of household groups based on their involvement in business activities have similar well-being. The parametric and nonparametric tests show that the income of intermediate farms is generally similar to that of wage-earning nonfarm households, while commercial farms have similar economic well-being to that of businessowning nonfarm households. Higher involvement with business activities is associated with higher economic well-being for both farm and nonfarm households. The economic well-being of households also differs based on their life-cycle stages. Regression analysis shows that young commercial farm households have significantly lower wealth but not significantly lower incomes compared to their older peers, whereas other young groups of households have both significantly lower income and wealth than their older counterparts. Overall, farm and nonfarm households have similar life-cycle patterns for income and wealth, even though nonfarm households exhibit more variation across different age groups. Income and wealth inequalities among households are examined using Gini coefficients. Results show that income is less equally distributed than wealth for farm households whereas income is more equally distributed than wealth for nonfarm households. Also, income inequalities are similar for farm and nonfarm households, while wealth inequalities are higher for nonfarm households. Income inequality among households is larger for both farm and nonfarm households that are more involved with business activities. However, wealth inequality does not seem to differ based on the business activities of the households."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Farm Policy", "text": "The insights from this study have important implications for the Farm Bill discussions concerning the economic well-being of farm households and the parity of well-being between farm and nonfarm households. As of 2004, farm households do not seem disadvantaged compared to nonfarm households in terms of both the average income and wealth levels and the distribution of income and wealth among households. These findings suggest that previous and current assistance to agriculture has been successful in raising the well-being of farm households to levels comparable to those of nonfarm households. The well-being of young and beginning farmers has been of interest to policy makers. The 2002 Farm Bill provided special assistance for young and beginning farmers in terms of credit assistance and conservation opportunities, even though the financial support for beginning farmer programs was a small fraction of the government assistance for commodity programs. The evidence from this study suggests that young commercial farm households do not seem income disadvantaged in comparison to their peers, while young rural residence and intermediate farm households have lower incomes than their older counterparts. The large wealth accumulations of young commercial households may suggest that they inherit a considerable portion of their assets. A possible explanation of the finding that young commercial households do not have lower incomes may be that they are getting better training in management, including financial management, marketing, and risk management. Much of the current policy work compares the economic well-being of farm households to that of the average nonfarm household, without consideration of the degree of involvement in business activities. Commercial farmers have management skills and large capital investments in their businesses and therefore it is not appropriate to compare their incomes, which include returns on capital investment and returns to management, to the salary income of households without businesses. This study also shows that rural residence and intermediate farm households are generally simi-lar to wage-earning nonfarm households, while commercial farm households are similar to nonfarm households with businesses. Results from this study show that even without government assistance, farm households would have similar incomes to those of nonfarm households. These trends would also hold for different groups of households based on their involvement in business activities. Further studies may explore the effectiveness of government assistance in increasing the wealth of farm households. In order to do that, the accumulation of previous government subsidies into farm wealth through savings, investments, or through increased farmland values will have to be assessed. The findings of this study are based on crosssectional data from two national surveys for 2004. 2 Conclusions based on cross-sectional data have to be interpreted with caution. One of the goals of the Farm Bill is to provide a safety net for farmers when they experience loss of income. While the results in this study show that farm and nonfarm households had similar economic well-being in 2004, income for farm households may be more volatile over time, which may necessitate government support to establish a safety net for farm households.
