[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-It is a grand challenge to reveal the causal effects of DNA variants in complex phenotypes. Although statistical techniques can establish correlations between genotypes and phenotypes in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), they often fail when the variant is rare. The emerging Network-based Association Studies aim to address this shortcoming in statistical analysis, but are mainly applied to coding variations. Increasing evidences suggest that non-coding variants play critical roles in the etiology of complex diseases. However, few computational tools are available to study the effect of rare non-coding variants on phenotypes. Here we have developed a multiscale modeling variant-to-function-to-network framework VariFunNet to address these challenges. VariFunNet first predict the functional variations of molecular interactions, which result from the noncoding variants. Then we incorporate the genes associated with the functional variation into a tissue-specific gene network, and identify subnetworks that transmit the functional variation to molecular phenotypes. Finally, we quantify the functional implication of the subnetwork, and prioritize the association of the non-coding variants with the phenotype. We have applied VariFunNet to investigating the causal effect of rare non-coding variants on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among top 21 ranked causal non-coding variants, 16 of them are directly supported by existing evidences. The remaining 5 novel variants dysregulate multiple downstream biological processes, all of which are associated with the pathology of AD. Furthermore, we propose potential new drug targets that may modulate diverse pathways responsible for AD. These findings may shed new light on discovering new biomarkers and therapies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD. Our results suggest that multiscale modeling is a potentially powerful approach to studying causal genotype-phenotype associations."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The existing methods for genotype-phenotype association are mainly based on statistical or machine learning techniques. However, the power of these methods drops significantly when sample size is small or variants are rare [1, 2] . Furthermore, these approaches work as a black box without explicitly incorporating the information of biological mechanism. As a result, it is not as straightforward to interpret the causal association of non-coding region variants with phenotypes as coding region variants. Besides, limited analysis has been performed on multi-variants that work as a system. It is believed that occurrence of genetic diseases could be caused not only by individual primary variants in coding regions but also by modest effects of multi coding and non-coding variants collectively. Small effects of non-coding variants on regulatory functions could be ignored if analysis is not performed on systematic level. Systematic analysis and multi-scale modeling of coding variants by integrating tissue-specific gene-gene interactions or protein-protein interactions is proven fruitful [3] [4] [5] [6] .\nIn this paper, we have developed a multiscale modeling framework to establish causal functional impact of non-coding variants on the biological network through integrating heterogeneous data from GWAS, protein-DNA/RNA interaction, protein-protein interaction, and gene expression profile, and combining statistical and machine learning method, regulatory variants studies, and biological network analysis. We applied our pipeline to study the functional roles of non-coding variants and associated regulatory genes that are identified in Alzheimer Disease (AD). The appearance of GWAS and Next Generation Sequencing provide another tool for the identification of the genetic factors associated with AD. More than 20 genes have previously been proposed to be associated with AD [7] . Our method was validated by its ability to identify known risk genes, such as APOE, TOMMO40 and EGFR [7] . In addition, novel non-coding variants that may cause the dysregulation of genes such as CUX1, KHDRBS1, CNOT4, and SRSF10 were also identified as potential AD associated factors. Their down-stream regulated pathways have strong associations with AD, as supported by existing evidences. Furthermore, we propose potential new drug targets, particularly NTRK3 and CAMK2B, which may modulate diverse pathways responsible for the pathology of AD. Thus, our systematic biology approach that incorporates multi-scale models, from protein-DNA interactions in transcription level, protein-RNA interactions in translation level to gene network robustness at the system level, may shed new light on the functional roles of non-coding variants in AD in particular, and other multi-genic diseases in general."}, {"section_title": "II.

ADNI is the result from efforts of many co-investigators in a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. Approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals were followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI were followed for 3 years and 200 people with early AD were followed for 2 years. Our study utilized ADNI1 GWAS genetic sequencing data and AD patients' clinical data. More updated information could be found at www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI."}, {"section_title": "B. The functional analysis of SNPs", "text": "54 SNPs were imputed to ANNOVAR [10, 11] , with which SNPs position information in genes were annotated and flanking genes were indicated if it is in intergenic regions. Sequences upstream and downstream of these SNPs were retrieved from UCSC Genome Browser with hg19 as reference genome [12] . Each sequence's length is 50nt. Regulatory analysis was performed with DeepBind software [13] , with which binding scores of retrieved sequences with TF and RBP were predicted. 515 TF and 120 RBP human species were included in binding study. Each SNP's two alleles differential binding scores of interactions with each regulatory protein, TF or RBP, were calculated. Then for each regulatory protein, two tailed student t-test ( g ) was performed on 53 differential binding scores that are corresponding to 53 SNPs ( 52 degrees of freedom)."}, {"section_title": "C. Analysis of gene network", "text": "The gene network of brain tissue was retrieved from Genome-scale Integrated Analysis of gene Networks (GIANT) [14] . We employed full gene network in brain, which consisted of 25689 genes, to conduct our analysis. GIANT network were based on gene-gene functional association. Gene-gene edges weights are proportional to confidence of gene-gene functional relationship and are ranged from 0 to 1.\nThe differential expressed genes of AD patients and normal controls came from Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) [15] and Common Significance Subnetworks Analysis [16] on gene expression datasets of healthy elders and AD downloaded from NCBI GEO Datasets-record of GSE5281. The dysregulated genes in these two subnetworks, including inflammation response subnetwork and calcium ion mechanism subnetwork, were involved into differentially expressed gene list. Besides, SPIA found dysregulated genes in KEGG AD pathway in hippocampus (HIP), middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PC). They also recognized perturbed genes in GABAergic synaptic pathway and glutamatergic synaptic pathway, which are two important neurotransmission system [15] , in MTG, and in cytokinecytokine receptor interactions, which are key components in inflammation process [17] , in PC. These dysregulated genes were also combined into the differentially expressed gene list.\nTo identify pathways that link the genes associated with SNPs with the differentially expressed genes, we first map these genes onto the brain tissue-specific gene network. Then network-based approach Prize-Collection Steiner Tree (PCST) algorithm was applied to identify the subnetwork that connects genes."}, {"section_title": "D.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Majority of SNPs were positioned on non-coding regions", "text": "Quantitative trait association study was conducted on 620,901 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using PLINK [19] (Figure 1 ) on a well-established dataset from ADNI [8, 9] . We used participants' MMSE scores on the firstvisit as the phenotypes. We selected top 54 SNPs, whose Bonferroni adjusted p-values were less than 1.0 and Benjamini & Yekutieli adjusted False Discovery Rate (FDR) values were less than 0.173. To uncover the functional roles of these 54 SNPs, we positioned them to human genome with ANNOVAR [10, 11] . This gene-based annotation was referred to Human Genome version 19 (hg19) . Surprisingly, it turned out that 53 out of 54 SNPs are located in non-coding regions. This imposed a challenge to understand the functional impact of these SNPs because of very limited knowledge about the function of non-coding regions SNPs. We then proposed two ways to better understand their functions. Firstly, the flanking genes of SNPs were identified. The function of the flanking gene may shed light on the functional roles of these noncoding SNPs. Non-coding regions variants had no straightforward effect on expressed proteins sequence or structure, however they could be associated with proteins or transcripts expression level. In another word, they could vary individuals' phenotypes through their regulatory functions, especially by the cis-regulation. Secondly, transcription factor (TF) and RNA binding protein (RBP) could bind with noncoding region DNA or RNA and then either promote or inhibit proteins and transcripts expressions. TF and RBP could also collectively regulate multiple transcripts expressions or protein expressions and thus give rise to phenotype variants."}, {"section_title": "B. Identification and characterization of flanking genes", "text": "As proposed above, the flanking genes may provide a way to understand the mechanism of non-coding SNPs. ANNOVAR was used to find the flanking genes of these SNPs. In this way, totally 47 flanking genes were allocated. The most significantly associated SNP overlapped an intronic region of the most well studied AD related gene APOE. Thus, our strategy was supported by existing findings.\nThe second way that we proposed to study non-coding regions SNPs was to discover related TF and RBP through protein-DNA or protein-RNA interactions. TF and RBP could affect phenotype through interactions with multiple SNPs. The binding specificity of the interaction was predicted with DeepBind [13] . This software has been shown to outperform the widely used binding site prediction software, position weight matrices1 (PWMs) [13, 20] . The upstream and downstream DNA sequences of these 53 SNPs were generated using UCSC Genome Browser [12] . DeepBind was then used to generate scores for binding specificity of DNA sequences with 515 TFs. Scores differences for two different variants of each SNP were calculated. Two-tailed t-tests were performed on the score distribution of each SNP, and 27 statistical significant TFs were selected. Another 13 TFs were selected because binding scores differences of them with at least one of the 53 SNPs were higher than 4. These 40 TFs were then listed together."}, {"section_title": "C. Interpret selected genes with genetic network in system level", "text": "To better characterize the causal association of each selected SNP with AD, we integrated them into a GIANT [14] . Our method utilized PCST algorithm to find an optimal path from a gene that is associated with a SNP (source gene) to up-or down-regulated genes (terminal genes). 420 genes were used as terminal genes [15, 16, 21] . Each selected SNPassociated gene was used as source gene for the PCST. In the GIANT network, nodes denote all the identified genes in brain tissues. Each edge connects two functional related genes. The weight of each edge denotes the confidence for the functional relationship between two genes. The PCST algorithm can be used to identify a subtree that minimizes the sum of the total costs of edges included in the subtree plus the prizes of nodes not included in the subtree. In order to make the PCST work efficiently, we modified the network by deleting the edges whose weight is less than 0.3 (the edge weights ranges from 0.0 to 1.0). We mapped 1.0 minus edges weights from GIANT as the edge costs in our network in order to prioritize the edge that has high weight. We also assigned the prize of terminal node to be a fairly high value in order to contain as many terminal genes in the subtree as possible. The rest nodes have prize of 0.0. PCST could find out all the terminal genes that are related with source gene and exclude other genes from this subtree. Then the sums of total costs of edges included in the subtree plus the prizes of nodes not included in these subtrees were compared and ranked (Table 1) . Lower sum value could demonstrate closer relationship of source gene with AD. Generated PCST trees were visualized with Cytoscape [22] (Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "D. Literature support of ranked genes", "text": "We manually inspected the association of top 21 ranked genes. 16 out of them in sorted gene list were found to be related to AD in the literature. For instance, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to be potential drug target for \u03b2-amyloid peptides induced AD [23] . HFE has significant effects on iron and cholesterol metabolism, while both of these processes perform important roles in brain and are related to AD [24] . PVRL2 can mediate infection of herpes simplex. viruses (HSV), a virus found to be a risk factor for AD [25, 26] . GATA-2 activates transcription of Neuroglobin, which is implicated to reduce AD severity [27] . There is still a controversy about the effect of TOMM40 on AD, but TOMM40, as a mitochondrial transmembrane protein, is believed to be a risk gene in mitochondrial dysfunction in AD [28] [29] [30] . Other genes which are not listed here also has literature evidence for their relationship with AD. Figure 2 ). Generated Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree for GATA2. Source gene GATA2 was labeled in the center. Black nodes denotes the terminal genes. Orange nodes denotes rest genes in the paths from source gene to terminal genes.

Novel SNPs that are associated with AD", "text": "Five top-21 ranked SNPs that were linked to genes RMBS3, CUX1, KHDRBS1, CNOT4, and SRSF10 did not have direct evidences about their roles in AD. However, RMBS3 is shown to directly regulate SMAD2/3 [31] . It is also reported that TGF\u03b2-SMAD2/3 signaling inhibition is one potential therapy for AD patients [32] . Thus RMBS3 can be associated with AD through regulating TGF\u03b2-SMAD2/3 signaling. Besides, TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway is enriched when using Gene set overrepresentation analysis (GSOA) with a q-values of 0.0205. The GSOA is also on the PCST subtree of other four discovered genes, including CUX1, KHDRBS1, CNOT4, and SRSF10, using ConsensusPathDB [18] . In the CNOT4 PCST subtree, the most significantly enriched pathways are HIF-1-alpha transcription factor network, which is related to hypoxia [33] , and circadian clock gene expression [34] . Increasing evidence suggests that both hypoxia and the disturbance of circadian cycle facilitate the pathogenesis of AD [35] . In the CUX1 PCST subtree, EGFR1 and FGF signaling pathway were two most significant enriched pathways. The modulation of EGFR [23] and FGF [36] have been reported to be potential therapy for the AD. The most significant pathways in KHDRBS1 PCST subtree were related to mRNA processing and splicing. In the SRSF10 PCST subtree, small nuclear ribonucleo proteins (snRNP) assembly that is related to mRNA splicing and metabolism of non-coding RNA, as well as E-cadherin adherens junction stabilization and expansion that are important for cell-cell adhension were the most significant enrichment. In summary, all five novel noncoding associations proposed in this study are supported by existing evidences."}, {"section_title": "F. Potential drug targets for the treatment of AD", "text": "We combine all pathways that are identified by the PCST into a sub-network that links genetic variants to molecular phenotypes of AD. The AD sub-network includes 1,326 genes and 6,289 directed edges. The node degree distribution in the AD sub-network follows a power-law distribution. Thus the AD sub-network has the robust-yet-fragile property of common biological network. Using the AD sub-network, it is possible for us to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of AD. Our rationale is that the potential drug target should maximally reduce the robustness of the AD subnetwork [37] . . We quantify the impact of node inhibition on the network robustness using Natural Connectivity [38] . The Natural Connectivity corresponds to an \"average\" eigenvalue of a graph. Natural Connectivity has clear physical and structural meaning that can be tied to several connectivity properties of networks. In particular, it explicitly characterizes the redundancy and feedback of alternative paths in the network by quantifying the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths. It has been shown that the Natural Connectivity can more accurately quantify the network robustness than other connect metrics such as node degree and betweenness etc [39] . We calculate the impact of node inhibition on the Natural Connectivity using MIoBI algorithm [39] . The top 20 genes ranked by the MIoBI score are listed in Table 2 . Interestingly, three protein kinases NTRK3, CAMK2B, and PARKAR1A are ranked at top 1, 3, and 12, respectively. These protein kinases are well known druggable targets. The association of NTRK3 with neurological disorders has been revealed recently [40] . CAMK2B is a tau kinase, playing a fundamental role in neurodegeneration and memory impairment in AD [41] . The role of PRKAR1A in AD is unknown. Further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis. Another interesting potential druggable target is GPCR protein GLP1R. It has been shown that GLP1R agonist reduces AD-associated tau hyperphosphorylation [42] . Due to heavy investments in the kinase and GPCR drug discovery, it is possible for us to repurpose FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of AD. Furthermore, as AD is a multi-genic complex disease, the conventional one-drug-one-target approach is less likely to be successful. Polypharmacology may be required to develop efficient AD therapies [43] . Protein kinases and GPCRs are excellent candidates for the targeted polypharmacology [44] . Table 2 .
