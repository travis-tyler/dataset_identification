[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There are many assessment tools in social sciences to measure a variable. However, it is important to find the most reliable and valid tool for the study objective (Atilgan 2015) . This scale can either be developed when needed or adapted from another language. Secer (2015) described scale adaption studies as the use of a valid and reliable scale, which was developed in a foreign language, in a different language and culture by conducting its validity and reliability analyses.\nIn the relevant literature, the first scale adaptation was made by Lewis M. Terman in 1916. Terman adapted the Intelligence Test, which was developed in French by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in 1905, and changed the name to the Measurement of Intelligence for the American Culture (Tsagari and Floros, 2013) . Nowadays, there is a growing need to compare the success of students from different countries (Deniz 2007; Sireci 1995) . One of the main goals of comparing is to share educational practice and promote growth and improvement, i.e., to learn from each other. There have been many studies comparing students' academic success in different cultures since 1970s. In 1995, for instance, 40 countries participated in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, and the scale was adapted to 30 languages (de Vijver and Hambleton, 1996) . In 2015, fourthand eighth-grade students from 57 countries participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) , and the test was adapted to 43 languages (Deniz 2007; Ebbs and Korsnakova, 2015; Polat, Gonen, Parlak, Yildirim, and Ozgurluk, 2015) . The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is one of the internationally accepted largest-scale of standardized assessment tool for 15-year olds. PISA was used for 72 countries in 2015 to evaluate students' skills and knowledge (the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] "}, {"section_title": "2017). J. Educ. Sci Environ Health", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The Primary Stages Followed in Scale Adaptation Studies", "text": "Preparation Stage: In this stage, the researcher determines the need for scale adaptation (Akbas and Korkmaz 2007) , decides which scale to translate, obtains the permissions for the adaptation study, and forms the translation team (Gudmundsson 2009; Secer 2013) .\nLanguage Validity: This stage includes translating the scale items and directions from the source language to the target language, examining and comparing these translations, making a backward translation, giving its first form to the translated scale, performing an application for language validity, performing statistical analyses for language validity, and giving its form to the scale of which the language validity is constructed (Geisinger 1994; Gudmundsson 2009; Savasir 1994; Seker and Gencdogan 2006) .\nEnsuring cultural and linguistic equivalency is the most important process in scale adaptation studies (Cha et al. 2007; Deniz 2007; Secer 2015; Savasir 1994) because the translation team including field experts having a good command of both languages is the most efficient factor to make the adaptation study successful. According to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing which was develop from AERA, APA and NCME the validity and reliability of a test should be tested by applying it to a group comprising of linguists when it is translated from one language to another language or dialect (Hambleton 2009; Tsagari and Floros 2013) .\nAccording to Tsagari and Floros (2013) , popular translation methods in test adaptations are forward translation, which means translating test from the source language to the target language, and backward translation, which means translating the scale -which is already translated to the target language-back to the source language (Grisay 2000; Savasir 1994 ). Cha, Kim and Erlen (2007) stated that backward translation is the most important step in scale adaptation studies. Independent linguists should work on the translation in these two translation processes. However, Tsagari and Floros (2013) believe that these adaptation studies are challenging in any circumstances since there is a possibility for the linguists who make the translation to make subjective decisions, and ignore some points even if they speak the source language. Therefore, Maxwell (1996) and Sava\u015fir (1994) stated that a good translator should have an excellent knowledge of both the source and adaptation languages, have enough experience to recognize the cultural structures of both languages as well as the sample group to which the scale is to be adapted, and skills for test development.\nPilot Study: This stage comprises of obtaining official permissions for a pilot study, carrying out the pilot study, and, performing validity and reliability analyses after the pilot study (Geisinger 1994; Gudmundsson 2009; Savasir 1994; Seker and Gencdogan 2006) .\nIt is required to obtain official permissions for the sample group to which the application will be performed in order to conduct the pilot study of the adapted form of the scale. After receiving the necessary permissions, the pilot study is conducted and the obtained data are analyzed using the SPSS, AMOS or LISREL software. To determine the sample size, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value is calculated. KMO values higher than 0.60 show that the sample size is suitable (Buyukozturk 2009 ). Barlett's test is used to determine whether data are suitable for factor analysis, and they will be if the test result is significant (Secer 2013) . For item analysis of the test, differences between items mean scores of 27% sub above groups are calculated using an unrelated t-test (B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zt\u00fcrk 2009 ).\nFor the validity analyses; content, structure and criterion validity are calculated. Content validity is calculated in the original form; thus, it is not necessary to calculate it again in adaptation studies. In the content validity step, a table of specifications is created for matching between target behaviors and items of the measurement tool. Field experts examine the table of specifications and report their opinions for the content validity. The inter-rater reliability level is expected to be 90-100% (Buyukozturk 2009; Turgut and Baykul 2012) . Criterion validity is divided into two: concurrent validity and predictive validity (Turgut and Baykul 2012) . Two types of factor analyses are performed for construct validity of the scale in the measurement tool development and adaptation stage:\nExploratory Factor Analysis (EFA): This is generally used for scale development. Its purpose is to determine the implicit structure of the scale (Secer 2015) . This analysis is performed to test the appropriateness of scale items to the predefined theoretical structure. It is used to determine the number of sub dimensions in which the scale items can be included. Moreover, this analysis is important for the determination of the relationship between scale items (Secer 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA):", "text": "This analysis is used for scale adaptation and scale development studies. Its purpose is to confirm the implicit structure which is determined using the EFA. It is used to determine which structures are identified by a series of items. In scale adaptation studies, it ensures the control of the model fit between factorial structures of the original version and the translated version (Secer 2015) . While adapting a scale, some researchers prefer to perform a CFA only rather than performing both analyses (EFA and CFA) together. However, It is necessary to perform the CFA to determine whether there is a difference in the factorial structure of the two scales, if it is to be adequately adapted to a new language and culture. In addition to enabling researchers to test the hypotheses for factor structure and model fit, it provides more informative analytic options.\nFor reliability calculations; internal consistency coefficient, split-half reliability, and test-retest calculations are conducted. Reliability is used in the meaning of consistency during developing and adapting a measurement tool. Consistency is receiving similar or the same results when measurements are repeated (Buyukozturk 2009 ). Kuder and Cronbach's alpha internal consistency value (Atilgan 2015) are used as evidence for the content validity. The KR-20 is used in the scoring of two categories. KR-20 statistics are calculated when variance is determined. Item difficulty statistics should be known for this calculation. It is performed in one-dimension scales. If there are raw scores, then it is calculated. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient is calculated in likert-type scales with three or more points (Gomleksiz and Erkan 2010).\nAs reliability estimation techniques; test-retest, equivalent forms, and test-split test methods are preferred. The test-retest method is explained with the Pearson product-moment correlation which is obtained as a result of administering a test to the same group periodically (Atilgan 2015) . For the equivalent (alternative/parallel) forms method two equivalent forms, which are developed to measure the same characteristic, are administered to the same group at the same or different times, and the consistency between scales are calculated by applying the Pearson product-moment correlation on the results (Buyukozturk 2009 ). The test-split test method (equivalent splits -split-half) , is important for calculating the consistency between test scores. It is appropriate for onedimension tests. Items in the test split in equivalent halves as odd-even or first half-last half (Atilgan 2015) . The Pearson product-moment correlation is calculated using scores obtained from both halves of the test. The obtained value is accepted as the reliability of either one of the halves. The reliability for the entire scale is calculated using the Spearman-Brown formula (Atilgan 2015) . If test items show a heterogeneous distribution in terms of the measured characteristic, it will be appropriate to determine reliability using the test-split test method rather than using an internal consistency coefficient (Gomleksiz and Erkan 2010)."}, {"section_title": "The Studies Conducted in Turkey", "text": "By using thematic content analysis (meta-synthesis), Gul and Sozbilir (2015) analyzed 22 scale-development studies in science and mathematics education field, which were published between the years 2000 and 2013 in six primary academic journals in Turkey focusing on educational sciences, and selected based on the predetermined criteria. They found that attitude scale was the most commonly developed type of scale, and these studies were mainly conducted in mathematics education field. Of the validity analyses, researchers mainly worked on construct validity, while confirmatory and exploratory analyses were studied at a moderate level. Gul and Sozbilir (2015) explained that they analyzed validity of the 22 scale-development articles based on criterion validity which was found only in one article, content validity which was calculated more than half of the articles, face validity was calculated only in five articles. In addition in terms of construct validity the researchers found that only eight articles was used discriminant validity while there was no information about convergent validity. It was also determined that internal consistency methods were the favorite of researchers among reliability studies. Guvendir and Ozkan (2015) examined studies which were conducted on scale development and adaptation in Turkey between the years of 2006 and 2014, and they aimed to determine stages used in scale development and adaptation processes. The researchers selected a total of 59 articles on scale adaptation and development, and these studies comprised the study sample. The study found that two or more translators worked in the adaptation studies, and the directions of the original scale were not translated in any of the articles. Only one article consulted assessment experts, and few studies calculated equivalent split-half reliability.\nBoztunc-Ozturk, Eroglu and Kelecioglu (2015) examined scale adaptation studies which were conducted in the education field between the years of 2005 and 2014. A total of 108 article studies matching the determined criteria comprised the study sample. In the data analysis, the study used the \"Control Form for the Scale Adaptation Process\" form developed by the researchers. According to the study results, all studies used the J. Educ. Sci Environ Health backward translation method, and the language equivalency calculation used only the adapted form, while the original scale was used in none of the studies. For construct validity, an EFA and CFA were used together. None of the studies examined the criterion validity of the scale. As an internal consistency coefficient, the Cronbach's alpha value was calculated. According to the construct validity results, the adapted scales showed similarity with the original scale, and no new items were suggested to replace the excluded items.\nDelice and Ergene (2015) examined scale development and adaptation studies, which were conducted in Turkey in mathematics education field between the years of 2005 and 2014, according to certain criteria. The study sample included 35 scale development and 18 scale adaptation studies. That study found that only two-thirds of these studies mentioned whether there was a need for a scale adaptation study. More than half of these studies did not mention that necessary permissions were obtained for the adaptation of the scale. The researchers made certain that the translation team created for the adaptation included only individuals that spoke the target language. It was determined that researchers were not careful enough to form their groups of experts that were sufficiently informed about both source and target languages and cultures as well as the characteristics of the scale to be adapted. All studies calculated the Cronbach's alpha value. It was found that the calculated Cronbach's alpha values were in compliance with the original scales. Some studies did not report their reliability analysis results (internal consistency coefficients). It was also reported that the sample size used in some studies was not big enough, while Delice and Ergene (2015) suggested that five to 25 subjects need for per variable. Costello and Osborne (2005) suggest a ratio of 10/1 as a minimum but recommend a ratio of 20/1 subject to variable\" (p.7).\nCum and Koc (2013) examined scale development and adaptation studies which were conducted in the psychology and educational sciences field between the years of 2005 and 2013. The study sample included a total of 50 articles: 29 scale development and 21 scale adaptation studies. As a result of the study, it was determined that half of the adaptation studies reported data by following the accurate steps. These adaptation studies did not provide information about the decision to adapt the scale, half of them did not mention whether they obtained permission for adaptation, while none of the studies gave information about structural equivalency related to culture, and a majority of them changed the factor structure of the scale and removed too many items. Although the translators had sufficient skills, only three studies employed evaluation and assessment experts. Also, all of these studies conducted reliability analysis. Also, all studies used the Cronbach's alpha method, equivalent splits and test-retest methods. Most of the studies used the EFA. In the adaptation studies, it was not reported that the CFA was used. It was determined that none of these studies conducted a statistical analysis to determine language equivalency.\nAccording to Hambleton et al. (2009) , there will be more scale adaptation studies conducted in the future due to the popularization of using the same scales in the international arena, the necessity of tests that fit international assessment and evaluation criteria, and the interest in cross-cultural studies. Scale adaptations are advantageous in financial and temporal grounds. There is no dominantly accepted method in the relevant literature related to scale adaptation studies. This situation improved in 2000s as a result of the developments in measurement and evaluation techniques (SPSS, LISREL, etc.) (Hambleton et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Aim of the Study", "text": "With regard to scale adaptation studies in the field of science education in Turkey, only five study done focusing only papers published in short period of time in limited number of journals.

Therefore, aim of this study was to examine scale adaptation studies in Turkey in sciences education area considering content and methodology, and to determine the stages commonly used in the scale adaptation process using the meta-synthesis method.

Firstly, \"scale information\" were revealed in all of the analyzed studies. Areas of the scales, publishing dates, types, number of items included and general reliability coefficients were determined. Then, sample analyses were performed on the analyzed articles. In this way, sample size and sample type were determined. Finally, the method followed by each study was analyzed after the pilot study.\nThis study found that adaptation studies are mostly conducted in the self-efficacy area. As it was reported in the studies of Karaca et al. (2008) , Boztunc -Ozturk, Eroglu and Kelecioglu (2015), Delice and Ergene (2015) and Gul and Sozbilir (2015b) , this study found that the internal consistency coefficients were calculated in all examined studies. It was seen that the likert type was used significantly more than the dicothomic scales. While the Cronbach's alpha value was calculated for reliability in the likert-type scales, the dichotomous scales calculated KR-20/21 for reliability (Secer 2015) . In four studies determined as dichotomous, two calculated the KR-20 and Cronbach's alpha together although the KR-20 value should be calculated as a reliability coefficient. However, the other two studies only calculated the Cronbach's alpha value, but did not calculate the KR-20 value. This showed that some researchers did not have sufficient statistical information on internal consistency calculations. This study determined that there were no significant differences between the internal consistency coefficients of the original scale and the adapted scale. It was found that some items were excluded from the scale as a result of the adaptation study, while no items were added to the scales in the adaptation studies. These findings are mainly consistent with the studies of Boztunc-Ozturk et al. (2015) .\nThis study showed that pre-service physical sciences teachers were selected as a sample level in the adaptation studies, and no sample at the primary school level was used. Moreover, it was found that the sample size was at least 7 times or bigger than the number of items. It was determined that the researchers exercised due diligence regarding this issue. However, Delice and Ergene (2015) reported that some studies which they analyzed had a deficient sample size while it is supposed to be five times bigger than the number of items.\nAccording to the analysis performed by the publishing date, it was found that the first adaptation study was conducted in the field of physical sciences in 2012. In Turkey, teacher training programs were reformed as a 4-year program by the Council of Higher Education (YOK) in 1989. Gazi and Ege Universities' Education Faculties began to train physical sciences teachers in 1992. Between the years of 1992 and 1998, these faculties trained physical science teachers according to the curricula that they prepared. In the 1998 -1999 academic year, courses and their content followed in the faculties of education were reviewed, and the prepared physical science teaching curricula was sent to other faculties (Kizilcaoglu 2006; Meric and Tezcan 2005) . Therefore, scale adaptation and development studies in the field of physical sciences education began to be conducted after the 2000s. While only 2 adaptations of articles were conducted before 2004, there were no adaptation scales in 2006. In 2013 and 2015, the number of adaptations of article studies increased dramatically.\nAs a result of the analysis, which was performed to determine the stages followed in adaptation studies, this study found that these studies gathered under three main headings of \"preparation for the adaptation study\", \"language validity\" and \"pilot study\". The \"preparation for the adaptation study\" stage includes determining the needs, selecting the scale to be translated, obtaining the necessary permissions and forming the translation team. This study determined that all analyzed studies had steps of determining the needs, selecting the scale and forming the translation team. However, some studies did not obtain permission from the developers of the original scale. Similarly, Cum and Koc (2013) reported in their studies that half of the researchers did not obtain permission for adaptation of the scale.\nThe literature has stated that the most important issue is \"validity of language\" while adapting the scale (Delice and Ergene 2015; Tsagari and Floros 2013) . Backward translation, the most important step in determining the validity of the language, and the examination of an expert team who makes this translation have been frequently emphasized in the literature (Cha et al. 2007; Grisay 2000; Maxwell 1996; Tsagari and Floros 2013) . This study determined that the analyzed adaptation studies did not mention this stage sufficiently, it was discussed superficially, and even 14 adaptation studies (30% of the adaptation studies) did not give detailed information about the backward translation. The fact that the pilot study stage, which is required to be performed on a group having a command of both two languages and cultures for the validity of the language, was determined in only 20 of the adaptation studies (43% of the analyzed studies) is an indicator that in Turkey, researchers do not give due importance and sensitivity to the validity of the language. Savasir (1994) reported that less than half of the 33 scale adaptation studies published in the Journal of Psychology and the Turkish Journal of Psychiatry did not give information about the translation; other studies mentioned this issue only briefly. Cum and Koc (2013) , J. Educ. Sci Environ Health Delice and Ergene (2015) , Guvendir and Ozkan (2015) examined adaptation studies and found that the studies did not form an expert group having a command of both languages and cultures for the validity of the language. Being largely in agreement with the study of Guvendir and Ozkan (2015) , the present study determined that no researcher adapted the instructions to the target language.\nThe last stage of the adaptation studies, the \"pilot study\", was available in all analyzed studies. This study concluded that all studies did not obtain relevant official permissions for the pilot study. Similarly, Delice and Ergene (2015) reported that more than half of the adaptation studies did not obtain necessary permissions. While it is commonly preferred by the researchers to perform only the CFA analyses in scale adaptation studies, there are studies in the literature where both analysis methods were preferred (Atilgan 2015) . At the end of this study, being largely in agreement with the studies of Boztunc-Ozturk et al. (2015) , it was determined that researchers preferred to use the EFA and CFA methods together. Guvendir and Ozkan (2015) , Cum and Koc (2013) found in their studies that the researchers preferred the EFA method to the CFA method. A study of Boztunc-Ozturk et al. (2014) determined that adaptation studies generally did not examine the scale validity. Similarly, the present study also found that the researchers calculated the construct validity, but did not perform the analyses required for the scale validity. It was observed that more than half of the studies gave the adapted scale together with the article.\nSimilarly; Tavsancil, Guler and Ayan (2014) examined adaptation studies conducted in the field of education in Turkey. They determined that most of the followed steps had wrong and incomplete information. Cum and Koc (2013) also examined adaptation studies and reported that the followed steps in these studies were inappropriate. Therefore, researchers who will conduct an adaptation study should have basic statistical skills, and studies should be conducted according to test development stages which are nationally/internationally determined. These will help future adaptation studies be more productive.\nLimitations of this study include focusing on only scale adaptation studies in the field of science education published in the journals and excluding Master and PhD Theses. Especially in Turkey, becoming very popular to develop or adapt a scale for Master and PhD theses. Therefore, future studies could be focus on detailed examinations of these theses in terms of scale adaptation and scale development studies in the field of science, mathematics and technology education."}]
