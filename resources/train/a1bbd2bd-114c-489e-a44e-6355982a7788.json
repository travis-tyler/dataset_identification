[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives Parental beliefs about child television viewing may affect the way parents regulate child television viewing. Despite this, little research has focused on the development of measures of parental beliefs about child television viewing, particularly among ethnic minority parents and parents of young children. This study's objective was to develop and test a culturally-based measure of parental beliefs about television viewing in low-income Mexican American mothers of preschoolers. Methods Using a cross-sectional study design, 22 items reflecting parental beliefs about influences of TV on children were developed and assessed for psychometric properties in a sample of 312 low-income Mexican American mothers of preschoolers. Results Using exploratory factor analysis, we identified four factors reflecting four domains of parental beliefs: positive general beliefs, positive sleep-related beliefs, positive functional beliefs, and negative general beliefs. Internal reliabilities were acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.70-0.89) for all factors except negative general beliefs (Cronbach's alpha = 0.61). Positive sleep-related beliefs and Positive Functional Beliefs were correlated with children's average daily hours of TV (r = 0.16, p < .01; r = 0.22, p < .001, respectively) and with mother's average daily hours of TV (r = 0.14, p < .05; r = 0.22, p < .001, respectively), providing initial support for construct validity. Conclusions for Practice The Beliefs about Child TV viewing scale measures four domains of parental beliefs regarding child TV viewing, and has good initial reliability and validity for three factors. Future use will allow investigators to conduct more in-depth evaluations on the influence of parental beliefs on the way parents shape their child's use of the TV."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "influence of parental beliefs on the way parents shape their child's use of the TV."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Ethnic disparities in child screen media use exist (Rideout and Saphir 2013; Rideout et al. 2011) . Young Latino children in low-income families view over 30 min more television (TV) daily than similarly-aged, low-income, non-Latino white children (Rideout and Saphir 2013) . Among screen devices, the TV, which is viewed daily by most children, is the main screen device used by young children (Rideout and Saphir 2013) . TV viewing accounts for over half of the average 2 h a preschooler uses screen media daily (Rideout and Saphir 2013) . Time spent viewing TV is associated with such outcomes as obesity, attention problems, and inadequate sleep in young children (Christakis et al. 2004; Braithwaite et al. 2013; Owens et al. 1999 ; Thompson and Christakis 2005) . Higher viewing amounts in Latino children may contribute to the higher prevalence of some screen-related outcomes, such as obesity (Ogden et al. 2012) . Latino children are at high risk for obesity in early childhood (Ogden et al. 2012 ). Interventions addressing screen use in this population are critical to reducing disparities in screen-related outcomes.\nParents shape the way their children use television. For example, parents restrict the amount of TV viewing time and/or the content their child watches (Rideout et al. 2003) . Health behavior theories, including the Information, Motivation, Behavioral skills model and Health Belief model (Janz and Becker 1984; Fisher and Fisher 2002) , suggest that parental beliefs about the impact of TV may shape parental decisions to regulate or encourage children's TV use. There is some empirical evidence to support this (Dorr et al. 1989; Austin et al. 1999; Barkin et al. 2006; Johnson et al. 2015) . For example, parents who believe that TV programs teach good things are more likely to instruct children about TV content (Austin et al. 1999) . Others have found that parents with more negative attitudes toward television are more likely to have rules regarding total television time, yet such attitudes are not related to rules about program content ( Vandewater et al. 2005) .\nDespite the importance of parental influences on young children's TV viewing, there is a surprising lack of systematic scale development or psychometric evaluation in this area. This is particularly true for measures appropriate for low-income Latino parents. Indeed, to our knowledge, the Parental Beliefs about TV Viewing (POETV) is the sole existing scale reporting the development and psychometric properties of a measure of parental beliefs about child TV viewing. Published after data collection for this study was complete, the POETV was developed for parents of school-age (6-12 years old) children and evaluated in a multi-ethnic sample (O'Connor et al. 2014) . Given evidence that beliefs and parenting practices regarding TV vary by child age, the development of a measure of beliefs specific to parents of children under 5 is warranted (Chen et al. 2013; Vandewater et al. 2007 ). The lack of careful development and psychometric assessment of measures of parental beliefs regarding the influence of TV on children has greatly hindered understanding in this area. Because TV viewing habits are established early in life, a measure of beliefs in parents of young children holds the potential to offer an understanding of motivators of parental behaviors aiming to shape TV use in these early years (Certain and Kahn 2002) .\nThe objective of this study was to use a culturally-based approach to develop a measure of beliefs about the effect of TV viewing on preschool children from low-income Mexican American families. We focus specifically on Mexican Americans because, amongst Latinos, country of origin, which is related to varying health beliefs and behaviors, must be considered (Marin and Marin 1991; Thompson et al. 2013 Thompson et al. , 2010 Harwood et al. 2002) . Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup of Latinos, representing 65% of Latinos (Motel and Patten 2012) . Because 16% of all children in the US are Mexican American, this work has the potential to impact a large group of children (Murphey et al. 2016; Racial and Ethnic Composition 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to develop and test a measure of maternal beliefs about television viewing in low-income Mexican American mothers of preschoolers.

The clinics were chosen because a large percent of the population they served were low-income Latino families. A research assistant approached individuals in the waiting room of these clinics and introduced the study. Eligible participants were Spanish-and/or English-speaking female primary caregivers of Mexican descent with a child 3-5 years of age and a TV at home. Because over 98% of the participants reported that they were the biologic mother to the focal child, we refer to participants in this study as mothers. For participants with > 1 eligible child, a focal child was chosen at random. Approval of this study was obtained from the university institutional review board."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Research assistants (RAs) were trained in all aspects of the study, including conducting the interview in a standardized way. Participants were screened for eligibility at the clinic, consented, and then enrolled by phone. RAs orally administered survey items in a 1 h phone interview. Oral administration was chosen to avoid literacy issues, which are common in low-income populations (30). Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools (Harris et al. 2009 ). Participants were instructed when answering the belief items that they were to think of their focal preschool aged child who was 3-5 years old and to remember that there were no right or wrong answers. Participant remuneration was a gift card to a major retailer ($25)."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "In addition to the 22 belief items, data were collected on demographic factors and television use. Demographic items included focal child age and sex, maternal age, number of years of education, cohabitation status (yes/no), number of other children in the home (excluding the focal child), employment status (yes/no), hours of employment each week, childcare, and acculturation level. Maternal employment was categorized as not employed, part-time employment (\u2264 25 h/week), and full-time employment (> 25 h/week). Acculturation was measured using an adapted version of the Spanish and English language use subscales of the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Latinos (Marin and Gamba 1996) (These 2 subscales contained 5 items with responses ranging from never(1) to always(5). Responses in each subscale were averaged. Higher scores represent greater acculturation in the specific domain (English or Spanish).\nTo evaluate construct validity, we asked mothers about average daily hours of TV viewing by the focal child, mother, and father. Child average daily hours of TV viewing was measured with 2 items about typical weekday and weekend viewing adapted from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B 2015) . Responses for weekday and weekend amounts were weighted by 5 and 2 respectively, then summed and divided by 7. Because parents were not the focus of the study, single items were used to capture parent average daily hours of TV viewing. Additionally, an adapted item from the Zero to Six (Rideout et al. 2003 ) study asked the average daily hours the TV was on in the home even if no one was watching it. Responses > 24 h/day were considered implausible and dropped (child viewing: n = 1, TV on in home: n = 1)."}, {"section_title": "Analyses", "text": "Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess the underlying factor structure of the 22 items, using maximum likelihood estimation and promax (oblique) rotation. Promax rotation was chosen because some level of correlation among factors was anticipated (Tabachnick and Fidell 2007) . Given the problems associated with commonly used criteria for factor selection in EFA (e.g., the Kaiser criterion), we chose maximum likelihood estimation because, even in an EFA framework, it allows for the calculation of more formal model goodness-of-fit indices to evaluate the performance of the model at an overall level and relative to alternative models (Fabrigar et al. 1999; Preacher et al. 2013) . Model fit indices included the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and Chi square difference tests (Fabrigar et al. 1999) . RMSEA values under 0.05 are considered desirable and those under 0.08 considered acceptable (Hu and Bentler 1999) . Models were also compared to one another using Chi square difference tests. Models with 1-4 factors were evaluated; in addition to RMSEA and Chi square values, the final model was selected based on model convergence, model interpretability, and the observed scree plot. Four items that were worded in the opposite direction of the majority of the items were reverse coded prior to EFA modeling. Once the final factor structure was chosen, the internal consistency reliability of the items loading on each factor was examined using Cronbach's alpha. Composite subscale scores were then created by calculating the mean of the items in a given factor; higher scores reflected stronger endorsement of the belief. Subscales scores were examined in relation to demographic variables using Pearson's correlation coefficients. To assess construct validity, subscales were also examined in relation to the amount of child TV viewing, parental TV viewing, and time the TV is on in the home using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Mplus Version 7.2 was used for the exploratory factor analysis and SAS Version 9.4 was used for all other analyses."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Demographic characteristics of the 312 participants are shown in Table 1 . Participants were on average 31 years old (SD = 6.4) and 72.4% cohabited with a partner. Focal children were on average 3.9 years old (SD = 0.79) and the majority (51.3%) were not in any type of childcare."}, {"section_title": "Exploratory Factor Analysis", "text": "Based on the model selection criteria, a 4-factor model emerged as the best fit to the data. The RMSEA value improved with the inclusion of additional factors, decreasing from 0.091 (95% CI 0.084-0.098) for the one-factor model, to a good-fitting value of 0.054 (95% CI 0.044-0.063) for the 4-factor model. Furthermore, based on a Chi square difference test, the 4-factor model fit significantly better than the 3-factor model (\u0394\u03c7 2 = 93.82, p < .001), which fit better than the 2-factor model. Examination of the scree plot also supported the 4-factor model. Table 2 depicts the rotated factor loadings for the 4-factor solution, with the highest loading for each item presented in bold. Factor 1 was comprised of 7 items related to favorable outcomes of child TV viewing and positive beliefs about food and drink TV commercials; this factor was subsequently labeled \"positive general beliefs.\" Factor 2, labeled \"positive sleep-related beliefs\", was comprised of 3 items related to TV viewing and sleep. Factor 3, comprised of 6 items measuring beliefs about the functional use of the TV for purposes of managing child behavior (e.g. keep child calm or quiet), was labeled \"positive functional beliefs.\" Factor 4 was comprised of 4 items assessing beliefs about negative outcomes related to child TV viewing and was labeled \"negative general beliefs\" Based on a factor loading cut-off of 0.35, 2 of the 22 items did not load strongly on any factor (Kline 2000) and were therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. Table 3 depicts the Cronbach's alpha values and mean scores of the final 4 subscales and the inter-correlations. Alpha values for the first 3 subscales were good (\u03b1 = 0.70-0.89), while the internal consistency of the 4th subscale, negative general beliefs, was low (\u03b1 = 0.61). The potential subscale means ranged from 1 to 4, with higher means representing stronger endorsement of the belief. Means for the first 3 subscales ranged from 1.84 to 2.67. The mean for the negative general beliefs subscale was 3.28. Examination of the correlations among the 4 subscales showed moderate to high correlations between the first 3 subscales, but low correlations of these with the fourth subscale.\nCorrelations Tables 4 and 5 show the relationship of the subscales to demographic and behavioral variables, respectively.\nMaternal education level was negatively associated with positive general beliefs and positive sleep-related beliefs, but positively correlated with negative general beliefs. Cohabitating was negatively associated with negative general beliefs. Number of other children in the home, excluding the focal child, and maternal employment were not associated with any of the subscales. The acculturation scales were only correlated with negative general beliefs. English language acculturation was positively correlated and Spanish language acculturation was negatively correlated with negative general beliefs. The three subscales representing different domains of positive beliefs were related to several of the TV viewing behavior variables, with greater endorsement of positive beliefs in each domain related to increased amounts of television viewing. Positive sleep-related beliefs and positive functional beliefs were positively correlated with average daily hours of child TV viewing. All of the three positive beliefs domains were positively correlated with higher mother and father average daily hours of viewing, with the exception of positive sleep-related beliefs and father TV viewing, which were unrelated. In contrast, the negative general beliefs subscale was not related to any of the viewing behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The Beliefs about Child Television Viewing (B-TV) scale is a 20-item measure representing the most comprehensive measure of beliefs about TV viewing in mothers of preschoolers to date. This work, focused on low-income Mexican American families, adds to the very limited existing literature in this area. A 4-factor model emerged as the best model fit. Use of this measure will aid in our understanding of the role of parental beliefs in shaping child viewing habits. Its importance is underscored by the urgent need for effective interventions to ensure that children, especially those at highest risk, have healthy media habits. Use of this scale could help interventionists to target maternal beliefs influencing child viewing behaviors in this population. The first subscale, positive general beliefs, focuses on TV viewing in general and the content of TV commercials. Few studies have evaluated parental beliefs about TV commercials (Austin et al. 1999; Buijzen and Valkenburg 2005) , and to our knowledge none have evaluated beliefs on this topic in this subgroup of parents. Interestingly, we found that positive beliefs about food and drink TV commercials group with other positive beliefs, such as children learning important things from television programs. However, increasing evidence points to food and drink commercials as a potential mechanism for the relationship between TV viewing and childhood obesity (McGinnis et al. 2006) . Hence further work identifying parental attitudes about TV commercials and their relationship to parenting practices in this domain would be of value.\nPositive sleep-related beliefs represents beliefs about the benefits of TV viewing in association with sleep. As expected, greater endorsement of this subscale was correlated with increased child TV time. Growing evidence points to the negative impact of aspects of TV viewing (e.g. total amount, use before bedtime) on sleep duration and quality (Cain and Gradisar 2010) . Parents often struggle with their preschoolers' sleep problems, such as establishing healthy sleep habits (Kataria et al. 1987) . Further work is needed to understand the exact media habits leading to poor sleep and ways to support parents regarding their children's sleep. For example, parents may need help in not using screen-time as a way to manage child behaviors before bed. This subscale will be useful for evaluating the influence of parental sleeprelated beliefs on child media use and sleep habits in this population.\nThe positive functional beliefs subscale represents beliefs about the utility of TV viewing for behavioral management. Much press has been given to the use of TV viewing for 'babysitting' a child; items in this subscale represent the wide range of ways parents may utilize child TV viewing to manage child behavior. As expected, this subscale was associated with TV viewing in the home. Future research applying this subscale can examine whether parental endorsement of these beliefs is associated with child behavior issues. One could posit that as children enter into their toddler and preschool years and behavioral issues arise, contextual factors such as limited economic resources or parents working multiple jobs could influence parental beliefs about the functional value of television watching for managing child behaviors. Further research in this area is needed.\nNegative general beliefs focuses on poor outcomes associated with TV viewing. Results from our qualitative work demonstrated the high level of concern low-income Mexican American mothers have about TV content for this age group. Concern specifically focused on content that teaches children bad behaviors/language (Thompson et al. 2015) . Notably, this subscale was not related to viewing amounts, which is interesting given that 2 items relate to outcomes from excessive viewing. It may be that negative beliefs about TV viewing are more strongly related to content rather than time, a possibility supported by work showing that parents of preschoolers are more likely to have rules about TV content rather than about time (Vandewater et al. 2005) . Further research should evaluate whether, in this population, this subscale is associated with parental restrictions on content and the actual type of content children view in order to understand the influence of these beliefs on parent and child behavior.\nMaternal education was associated with three of the scales. Increasing maternal education levels were associated with less endorsement of the positive general beliefs and positive sleep-related beliefs subscales and higher endorsement of the negative general beliefs. However, maternal education was not associated with positive functional beliefs. Interestingly, none of the demographic factors were associated with positive functional beliefs. This may suggest a broader endorsement of this belief across groups within this population.\nThe strengths of this study include our focus on one ethnic group in order to capture the beliefs of this group. For many years, scholars of Latino health have emphasized the importance of the developing measures for use in this population (Marin and Marin 1991; Rogler 1989) . It is important to note that the findings of this study cannot be generalized beyond low-income Mexican American mothers of preschoolers in the southwestern US. Whether these beliefs apply to this population in other geographic regions should be evaluated, as well as whether they apply to other racial/ethnic groups. We employed culturally-based methods, yet it is possible that these beliefs are relevant to other cultures and parents of non-preschool aged children. Limitations of this study include that this is the first use of these items and further evaluation is needed to evaluate construct validity and to establish test-retest reliability. Also, the negative general beliefs subscale has a low reliability, hence future work could further explore parental negative beliefs in order to expand the number of items representing this domain. Given that the negative general beliefs subscale did not correlate with reported TV viewing amounts, future study could also evaluate its relationship with content viewed. Finally, the oral administration of survey items may have increased social desirability bias (Chang and Krosnick 2010) .\nThis measure captures positive and negative maternal beliefs about child TV viewing and the results support the initial validity and reliability of 3 of the subscales. This is the first measure of parental beliefs about TV viewing for parents of preschoolers and the first to focus on measuring beliefs on this topic in low-income Latina mothers. A culturally-based approach was utilized to capture the influence of the sociocultural context. Given widespread media use across groups of children, future work should also focus on other cultural groups and use approaches similar to ours to develop additional measures of beliefs about TV viewing. This could include evaluating how the items presented here apply in other populations."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "The lack of well-developed measures of parental beliefs about TV viewing has hindered knowledge regarding how such beliefs influence parenting practices regarding TV, and ultimately child viewing habits. Health behavior theory and existing evidence indicate that changes in attitudes and beliefs are critical components of behavior change and therefore may need to be addressed in interventions focused on changing child TV viewing (Janz and Becker 1984; Fisher and Fisher 2002) . The Beliefs about Child TV Viewing scale (B-TV) offers investigators a way to understand the role of parental beliefs in shaping child TV viewing habits, specifically in low-income Mexican American parents of preschoolers. In these initial findings, 3 of the 4 scales had good reliability. Further work on this measure is needed to extend knowledge on reliability and validity. This measure has potential to identify parental beliefs which could be targeted in interventions aiming to support the development of healthy media habits in young children in low-income Mexican American families. For example, if functional beliefs are associated with screen-related parenting practices, then addressing these beliefs may be an important aspect of changing parenting practices. Identifying potential targets to be addressed in interventions supporting the development of healthy media habits in young children is critical to the design of future intervention efforts."}]
