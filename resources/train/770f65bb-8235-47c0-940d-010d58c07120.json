[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Low-lying barrier islands are vulnerable to extreme morphologic change over short timescales as a result of storm events. Dune elevations regulate storm impacts (Sallenger, 2000;Stockdon et al., 2007;Long et al., 2014), which can be classified into four regimes: swash, collision, overwash and inundation (Sallenger, 2000). In the swash regime, water levels are confined to the foreshore, which causes minor sand erosion on the beach. In the collision regime, wave runup collides with the base of the dune, resulting in erosion of the dune face with sand transported offshore. As water levels continue to increase, wave runup can overtop the dune crest, causing erosion (typically a 30-85% reduction in elevation (Long et al., 2014)) with landward sand deposition. If water levels are high enough, the island will become inundated, which can induce water level gradients between the ocean and the bay that drive flow and sediment transport, and often result in breaches (Long et al., 2014;Sherwood et al., 2014;Harter and Figlus, 2017). As coastal populations grow, predicting the response of coastlines is essential for guiding mitigation of future hazards. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between storms and coastal landscapes (Grzegorzewski et al., 2011). The process-based numerical model XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) is capable of predicting the morphologic response of barrier islands to specific storm events with high skill (Sherwood et al., 2014;Roelvink et al., 2009;McCall et al., 2010;Lindemer et al., 2010). Model performance depends on spatial and temporal model resolution (Lindemer et al., 2010), the accuracy of initial conditions (i.e., bathymetry/topography) (Lindemer et al., 2010), hydrodynamic forcing (Sherwood et al., 2014;Harter and Figlus, 2017;McCall et al., 2010), and the parameterization of physical processes (McCall et al., 2010;Elsayed and Oumeraci, 2017). McCall et al. (2010) determined that XBeach tends to overestimate erosion and overwash due to inaccurate calculations of sediment transport rates during sheet flow conditions. Therefore, a sheet flow sediment transport limiter was introduced to serve as a proxy for unknown factors that control resistance to erosion (McCall et al., 2010). Elsayed and Oumeraci (2017) further attributed the overestimation of erosion to the effect of wave nonlinearity on sediment transport as well as excess shear stress required to initiate sediment particle motion. The authors' explored how to better quantify the relationship between net flow due to wave skewness/asymmetry and beach slope, and account for grain stabilization. Lindemer et al. (2010) and Harter and Figlus (2017) acknowledged that the overestimation of overwash in their model simulations could be a result of not incorporating variable bed friction to capture the effects of vegetation or infrastructure; bed friction causes loss of fluid kinetic energy which slows surge propagation rates and attenuates overland surge amplitudes (Resio and Westerink, 2008;Garzon and Ferreira, 2016). In a preliminary study, De Vet et al. (2015) showed that applying a higher frictional coefficient to vegetated areas of a barrier island based on satellite imagery reduced the amount of dune erosion and overwash that XBeach predicted. However, there is a need for more thorough analysis to determine how to properly assign variable bed friction across topographic features on the scale of barrier islands in XBeach and confirm the model's ability to account for the effects of different land cover types (wetland, developed, forest, etc.) (Harter and Figlus, 2017). This study primarily examines the influence of variable bed friction on morphologic change during two storm events using a 2DH (twodimensional in the horizontal plane) XBeach model. Dauphin Island, AL was selected as the study area due to its variability in land cover and elevation, its substantial morphologic response during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Morton, 2008), and the availability of data to initialize models and evaluate performance. To minimize error and isolate the effects of variable bed friction, the model was initialized using the best available lidar data and was forced with high-resolution wave and water level time-series that accurately describe storm characteristics. Three scenarios of bed friction were implemented to assess morphodynamic sensitivity during the two storms and the need for an existing sheet flow sediment transport limiter. Model accuracy was determined through a qualitative and quantitative comparison of observed and modeled bed level change and breach development for each scenario. The results from the sensitivity study were also used to evaluate the influence of errors in the pre-storm topography and the combined effects of variable bed friction and cross-island water level gradients on storm-driven morphodynamics."}, {"section_title": "Study domain", "text": "Dauphin Island, AL is a 25 km long, low-lying barrier island located between the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi Sound (Fig. 1). The wider eastern end of the island features higher dune elevations (2.5-3 m on average) and contains homes and infrastructure, including 2400 property owners and 1400 permanent residents (Five E's Unlimited, 2007). At the widest part of the eastern end, high dunes are backed by a maritime forest. The central and western segments of Dauphin Island are a narrow (minimum width of 169 m) Holocene sand spit backed by marshes (Morton, 2008). Dune elevations are generally less than 1.5 m, making this area susceptible to overwash during storm events. Historically, the middle of the island breached during tropical storm events dating back to 1851 and as recent as Hurricane Katrina (2005), which formed a breach approximately 2 km wide (Morton, 2008) (Fig. 6a)."}, {"section_title": "Modeling approach", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model description", "text": "XBeach is a two-dimensional depth-averaged modeling software that resolves coupled short wave energy, flow and infragravity wave propagation, sediment transport and bed level change (Roelvink et al., 2009). The model code solves the nonlinear shallow water equations and incorporates time-varying wave action balance and roller energy balance. Sediment transport is calculated with a depth-averaged advection-diffusion equation (Galappatti and Vreugdenhil, 1985), in which an equilibrium sediment concentration determines increases or decreases in sediment concentration in the water column (Soulsby, 1997). The equilibrium sediment concentration is calculated with the Soulsby-van Rijn sediment transport formulation (Soulsby, 1997), which is not strictly valid for sheet flow conditions that may occur during the initial phases of dune overwash (Roelvink et al., 2009). Therefore, steady flow velocities are limited with an upper-bound Shields parameter (smax \u00bc 1.0) for the start of sheet flow (McCall et al., 2010). XBeach incorporates bed friction associated with mean currents and long waves using the Ruessink et al. (2001) bed shear stress (\u03c4 b ) formulation:  where \u03c1 is the density of water, u E and v E are the Eulerian east-west and north-south velocities, respectively (the short-wave-averaged velocity observed at a fixed point), u rms is the root-mean square velocity and c f is the dimensionless friction coefficient calculated from the Chezy coefficient (C): The Chezy coefficient is related to the Manning coefficient (n) based on local flood depth (h): The model is capable of simulating morphologic change from the swash, collision, overwash and inundation storm-impact regimes (Sallenger, 2000). Swash dynamics are resolved through a 2DH description of infragravity waves (i.e., frequency less than 0.04 hz (Herbers et al., 1995)), which allows water levels to vary on the shoreface. In the swash and collision regimes, mass seaward flux from waves and rollers is directed offshore in the form of depth-averaged return flow; this allows for continuous erosion of the dune face with offshore deposition. In the collision regime, sediment is transported from the dry dune face to the wet swash through an avalanching algorithm that is triggered by infragravity swash runup paired with a specified critical wet-slope. In the overwash regime, wave-group forcing in combination with a momentum-conserving wetting and drying algorithm results in a landward flux of momentum which lowers dune elevations and transports sediment onshore in overwash fans. In the inundation regime, breaches are resolved from sediment transport induced by dynamic channel flow and avalanche-triggered bank erosion (Roelvink et al., 2009). Further details on hydrodynamic and sediment transport formulations can be found in Roelvink et al. (2009) and McCall et al. (2010)."}, {"section_title": "Model setup", "text": "The domain for the XBeach model encompasses all of Dauphin Island and extends approximately 6 km offshore, 3.5 km onshore of the backbarrier shoreline, 3.5 km to the west and 2 km to the east of the island's extent (Fig. 2). Grid resolution is 25 m alongshore and varies according to depth in the cross-shore with a minimum of 3 m resolution across the subaerial island. The model grid was set up in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. Bathymetric elevations were derived from a 3 m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Mobile Bay (Danielson et al., 2013) that used digital soundings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and water-penetrating lidar sources from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) and the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS). The vertical accuracy of the DEM ranges from 0.06 to 0.20 m in root mean square error (RMSE) (Danielson et al., 2013). Topographic elevations were derived from lidar data obtained via NOAA Digital Coast, Coastal Topographic Lidar (http://coast.noaa.gov/ digitalcoast/). For the Hurricane Ivan (2004) simulations, lidar surveys collected in 1998 and 2001 were merged and interpolated using a natural neighbor method (Sibson, 1981) into a 3 m resolution DEM. For the Hurricane Katrina (2005) simulations, a lidar survey from 2004 (post-Ivan) was interpolated using natural neighbor into a 3 m resolution DEM. Vertical accuracy for each lidar survey is 0.15 m (National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, 2000, 2004;U.S. Geological Survey, 2009). Since the lidar surveys were not collected immediately before each storm, errors may be introduced in the model; however, these were the best available data. Bed friction coefficients are determined based on flow velocity, topographic conditions (depth and cross-sectional area) and physical characteristics (heights, widths) of obstacles that impede flow (Chow, 1959;Arcement and Schneider, 1989). In inundation modeling, friction across floodplains can be described with a single value (Horritt and Bates, 2002) or spatially varying values based on land cover (Van der Sande et al., 2003). Spatially varying friction coefficients can be parameterized using remotely sensed land use/land cover (LULC) maps, where each LULC class is assigned a bed friction coefficient that is interpolated onto the model grid and incorporated into model computations (Bunya et al., 2010;Westerink et al., 2008;Dietrich et al., 2011a;Bilskie et al., 2016). To examine the morphodynamic sensitivity of XBeach to variable bed friction, three scenarios were implemented. The first scenario applied a constant Chezy coefficient of 55 m 1/2 /s across land and water; this is the default setting in XBeach. The second scenario applied depth-dependent Chezy coefficients to open-water using a Manning's n of 0.022 (Dietrich et al., 2011a) (Eq. 3) and a constant Chezy coefficient of 33 m 1/2 /s to land areas; 33 m 1/2 /s is equivalent to a bare land Manning's n of 0.03 (Dietrich et al., 2011a), assuming a flood depth of 1 m over land (Medeiros et al., 2012), which is a reasonable base value for the purpose of this research. The third scenario applied depth-dependent Chezy coefficients to open-water and spatially varying coefficients to land based on 2001 LULC data obtained from the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccapregional/) with 30 m resolution. Land cover types along Dauphin Island vary from bare land across the Gulf side of the island, estuarine emergent wetland on the western back-barrier, developed land on the eastern back-barrier and evergreen forest on the eastern end ( Fig. 3). Although the C-CAP data precedes hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, it is unlikely that island-scale spatial trends in land cover would significantly change over four years since there were no major storms that affected the island. Manning's n coefficients for each LULC class were obtained from Dietrich et al. (2011a). (Table 1), interpolated onto the XBeach grid, then converted to Chezy coefficients assuming a flood depth of 1 m at land cells. The resulting friction grid was smoothed to avoid abrupt jumps in the friction value. Other model parameters used to calibrate short wave hydrodynamics, flow, sediment transport and bed update were set to default values following McCall et al. (2010)."}, {"section_title": "Boundary conditions", "text": "Boundary conditions in the form of time-series water level and wave spectra were extracted from an ADCIRC\u00feSWAN model (Dietrich et al., 2011b;Luettich et al., 1992) that computes water surface elevations, depth-integrated velocities and wave radiation stresses. The 5.5 million node hydrodynamic model, herein referred to as NGOM3 (Bilskie et al., 2016), spans the Western North Atlantic Tidal model domain with model resolution down to 20 m along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast from Louisiana through the Florida panhandle. The model was extensively validated with respect to astronomic tides as well as waves and water levels for hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Katrina and Isaac.

Simulated time-series water surface elevations were compared to observations from the NOAA tide gauge at Dauphin Island (8 735 180) and showed agreement in the rate of inundation, peak surge magnitude and timing, and recession for both storms (see Bilskie et al. (2016) for details). Similarly, simulated wave heights, period and direction showed agreement with National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements (see Bilskie et al. (2016) for details). Further details on mesh development, astronomic tide and meteorological forcing, and model performance can be found in Bilskie et al. (2016). Hurricane Ivan made landfall as a Category 3 storm at 06:50 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) 16 September, west of Gulf Shores, AL (Stewart, 2004). Within the XBeach domain, the NGOM3 simulated peak surge was 2.12 m southeast of Dauphin Island. In XBeach, time-varying water level boundary conditions can be applied at the four corners of the grid to describe alongshore variability or can be applied uniformly across the onshore and offshore boundaries. To avoid model instabilities due to higher surge heights at the southeast corner where the lateral grid boundary is in close proximity to land, water levels were forced uniformly across the onshore and offshore grid boundaries. Plots of NGOM3-simulated maximum water elevations (Bilskie et al., 2016) showed a cross-shore water level gradient at the middle of the grid, with higher water levels seaward of the island. To account for this water-level gradient, hourly water levels from 08:00 UTC 14 September to 21:00 UTC 16 September were extracted from NGOM3 at the middle of the onshore and offshore XBeach grid boundaries. Hourly significant wave height, mean wave direction, and peak wave period were extracted from NGOM3 at the middle of the offshore XBeach grid boundary and used to generate a time-series of JONSWAP spectra (with the default peak enhancement factor of 3.3) that was applied uniformly along the offshore boundary. Almost a year after Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a strong Category 3 storm at 11:00 UTC 29 August near Buras, LA (Knabb et al., 2005). Within the study domain, NGOM3-simulated peak surge was 3.35 m northwest of Dauphin Island. On the landward side of the island, an alongshore gradient in maximum water elevations extended across the XBeach domain, varying from 3.35 m at the northwest corner to 2.18 m at the northeast corner of the grid (Bilskie et al., 2016). To account for the alongshore gradient in peak water levels, hourly water levels from 23:00 UTC 27 August to 12:00 UTC 30 August were extracted from NGOM3 at the four corners of the XBeach grid. Model instabilities at the east lateral boundary were not of concern since the highest surge in the domain was located west of the island where the lateral boundary was sufficiently far from land. Wave conditions from NGOM3 were applied to the offshore boundary of the XBeach model as in the Ivan simulation."}, {"section_title": "Model accuracy", "text": "To determine the model accuracy for each friction scenario, simulated post-storm bed elevations were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a post-Ivan lidar survey (with 0.15 m vertical accuracy) collected on September 19, 2004 and a post-Katrina lidar survey (with 0.075 m vertical accuracy) collected between October and December 2005; each lidar survey was interpolated onto the model grid. The mean error between the observed and modeled bed elevation was calculated to describe the bias: where N is the number of data points covered by the post-storm lidar measurements, and zb is the bed level. The RMSE between the modeled and observed bed level change (dzb) was also calculated: The bias gives the same weight to all errors whereas the RMSE includes both mean and random errors, and gives errors with larger absolute values more weight than errors with smaller absolute values. Lastly, R 2 values for the modeled versus observed post-storm bed levels were calculated. Since the pre-Ivan and post-Katrina lidar data were not classified as bare-earth, whereas the post-Ivan lidar data was bare-earth, accuracy metrics were calculated only for the west end of the island where lidar returns from maritime forest canopies and houses would not affect the morphologic change comparison. To provide insight on the influence of friction across different morphologically active areas of the island, each metric was calculated across the entire west end (Gulf shoreline to backbarrier shoreline where the shoreline defined as the 0 m contour), within the backshore (Gulf shoreline to dune toe), within the foredune (dune toe to dune crest) and within the backbarrier (dune crest to the backbarrier shoreline) ( Table 2). Dune toe and dune crest locations were obtained from Doran et al. (2017)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison of friction scenarios: Hurricane Ivan", "text": "The observed and modeled post-storm bed elevations for Hurricane Ivan are shown in Fig. 4, and differences in pre-and post-storm bed elevations are shown in Fig. 5. Observed post-Ivan elevations indicate that the middle of the island was fragmented with several small breaches (at most 198 m wide) whereas the east and west ends remained intact. In comparison, modeled elevations from the default scenario resulted in a 2505 m wide breach in the middle of the island, a 348 m breach on the western end, and several smaller breaches on the eastern end. There was extensive overwash and dune erosion across the island with sand deposition landward on the backbarrier and seaward in the nearshore. The net loss in the subaerial island volume was 3495599 m 3 (14.7%). In the constant land scenario, there were three breaches in the middle of the island ranging from 75 to 100 m wide, as well as a few narrow breaches on the eastern end. Compared to the default scenario, there was less erosion across the subaerial island (net volume loss of 1708505 m 3 or 7.2%) and less overwash deposition on the backbarrier and in the nearshore. In the spatially varying scenario, patterns of erosion and deposition were similar to the constant land scenario except there were five breaches in the middle of the island that ranged from 100 to 375 m wide and no breaches on the eastern end. There was less erosion across the subaerial island (net volume loss of 22246065 m 3 or 6.7%) and less overwash deposition on the backbarrier and in the nearshore than in the default and constant land scenarios. The additional breaches in the middle of the island were likely a result of the spatial patterns of the LULC data; unlike the west and east ends, the middle of the island was void of vegetation and development (and therefore was assigned lower friction coefficients), which made it more susceptible to higher velocity flows and transport. As evident in the qualitative comparison, the default scenario resulted in the least accurate post-storm bed elevation with a bias of \u00c00.05 m, a RMSE of 0.65 m and a R 2 of 0.31. Despite an improvement in the prediction of breach locations, the spatially varying friction resulted in an almost equal improvement in accuracy of post-storm bed elevations as the constant land friction (bias of 0.17 m, RMSE of 0.53 m and R 2 of 0.41 in the constant land scenario, and bias of 0.12 m, RMSE of 0.53 m and R 2 of 0.42 in the spatially varying scenario). For both scenarios, the largest improvements in modeled bed elevations were in the backbarrier, rather than within the foredune or backshore; this was because higher friction coefficients across land reduced cross-barrier flows and overwash deposition."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of friction scenarios: Hurricane Katrina", "text": "Results from the Hurricane Ivan simulations showed a similar improvement in accuracy when using a constant friction coefficient across land versus spatially varying coefficients. However, Hurricane Katrina was a stronger storm with higher water levels that occurred after Ivan had lowered dune elevations, which resulted in more overwash and breaching. For this reason, the simulated post-Katrina bed elevations illustrated a greater impact from frictional effects due to land cover. Fig. 6 shows the observed and modeled post-Katrina bed elevations for each friction scenario and Fig. 7 shows differences in pre-and post-storm elevations. Observed post-storm elevations show that Katrina caused a 2040 m breach in the middle of the island, as well as several overwash fans on the west and east ends. In the default scenario, the breach at the middle of the island was 3500 m wide, and several large breaches developed on the west and east ends, ranging from 300 m to 1700 m in width. Sand was deposited seaward of the breaches and there was extensive dune erosion across the remainder of the island; the net loss in the subaerial island volume was 4560921 m 3 or 22.7%. The constant land scenario resulted in a 2500 m wide breach in the middle of the island, and many other breaches ranging from 50 m to 1290 m wide on the east and west ends. There was less erosion on the subaerial island (net volume loss of 3140875 m 3 or 15.6%) and less deposition on the backbarrier and in the nearshore than in the default scenario. In the spatially varying scenario, there was a 2550 m breach in the middle of the island, as well as two breaches that were 50 m and 190 m wide on the west end. The remainder of the island remained intact, and there was less erosion and overwash deposition than in the constant land and default scenarios (net loss in subaerial island volume of 1791573 m 3 or 8.9%). Similar to the Ivan scenarios, the default scenario resulted in the least accurate post-storm bed elevations with a bias of \u00c00.77 m, a RMSE of 1.06 m and a R 2 of 0.17. In the constant land scenario, the bias, RMSE, and R 2 improved to \u00c00.62 m, 0.87 m, and 0.17, respectively. There was a greater improvement in bed level accuracy with spatially varying friction than in the Ivan scenarios, with a bias of \u00c00.48 m, RMSE of 0.73 m and R 2 of 0.19. Accounting for higher friction due to land cover type improved backbarrier and foredune elevations the most, as a result of slower flows and less cross-barrier transport. Although the model overestimated erosion, the spatially varying scenario captured spatial trends in morphologic change most accurately, including the location and size of breaches."}, {"section_title": "Application of sheet flow limiter", "text": "Since the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that spatially varying friction influences the amount of erosion and overwash, two additional simulations were performed in which the sheet flow sediment transport limiter (smax (Roelvink et al., 2009)) was disabled in XBeach for each storm to see if accounting for spatially varying bed friction could negate the need for the limiter. When smax was disabled, the only differences in post-storm bed levels were at the locations of breaches (Fig. 8). For Ivan at the middle breach, post-storm elevations in the foreshore were 0.34-0.59 m lower when smax was disabled as a result of increased overwash; elsewhere, there were no significant differences in bed elevations. Similarly for Katrina at the west and middle breaches, post-storm elevations in the foreshore were 0.14-1.03 m lower when smax was disabled as a result of more overwash. However for both storms, disabling smax did not alter the overall model skill, illustrating that the smax parameter may not be needed if bed friction is adequately described, especially when water levels generally remain below the dune crest elevation and overwash and breaching are minimal."}, {"section_title": "Time-varying geomorphic impacts of Ivan and Katrina", "text": "Differences in the pre-and post-storm bed elevations showed sand deposition on the backbarrier and in the nearshore for both storms (Figs. 5 and 7). To observe the geomorphic impact of each storm in more detail, three cross-shore transects located at the west end, the middle and the east end of the island (as indicated in Fig. 2) were plotted from the spatially varying scenario for each storm (Figs. 9 and 10). For each transect, water level and bed level elevations were extracted before each storm (0 h into the simulation), during the rising limb (31 h into the simulation for Ivan, 27 h into the simulation for Katrina), during the peak of the storm (43 h into the simulation for Ivan, 41 h into the simulation for Katrina), during the recession of the storm (44 h into the simulation for Ivan, 43 h into the simulation for Katrina) and at the end of the storm (62 h into the simulation, 61 h into the simulation for Katrina). During the rising limb of Ivan, the dunes at all three transects were in the collision regime and sand was eroded from the dune face and deposited in the nearshore. As water levels reached a maximum, the dune crests at the west and middle transects were overtopped, causing overwash with landward sand deposition. At the east transect, peak water levels were not high enough to overtop the dune so sand continued to erode from the dune face and was deposited in the nearshore. During surge recession, wind patterns caused seaward-directed water level gradients (i.e., higher water levels landward of the island). This caused sand to be transported seaward across the island and deposited in the nearshore at all three transects; at the middle transect, the dune breached. During the rising limb of Katrina, water levels were lower than the dune crests at the west and east transect, causing dune collision with sand deposition in the nearshore. At the middle transect, there was overwash as a result of the low pre-storm dune elevation. During peak water levels, the west and east transects experienced overwash, and the middle  transect breached with sand deposition landward. Similar to Ivan, during surge recession, seaward-directed water level gradients as a result of wind patterns caused additional dune erosion at the east transect and breaching at the west transect with sand transported and deposited seaward in the nearshore. The breach in the middle continued to deepen and sand was deposited seaward."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of this study show, for the first time in a comprehensive way, that implementing spatially varying bed friction at the barrier island scale influences the ability of XBeach to accurately simulate the stormdriven morphologic response of barrier islands. Assigning higher friction coefficients to areas with backbarrier marshes and development reduced the amount of cross-barrier sediment transport. Although the difference in accuracy between the constant land and spatially varying scenarios for Ivan was within the error of the lidar measurements, spatially varying friction was necessary to prevent breaching on the eastern end consistent with observations and reduce the net loss in the subaerial island volume. Spatially varying friction had more of an impact on morphologic change for Katrina than Ivan as a result of higher surge heights and lower pre-storm dune elevations, which caused more of the island to be in the overwash and inundation regimes. For less intense storms with lower surge heights and less overwash, applying a constant friction coefficient across land may be sufficient for improving model results. Rather than tuning the model (i.e., adjusting bed friction using automated optimization algorithms to improve model results (Medeiros et al., 2012)), spatially varying friction coefficients based on LULC data were used to realistically describe the physical system, which permits more accurate calculations that account for the effects of land cover on flow dynamics. Although the resolution of the C-CAP data was coarse in comparison with the cross-shore model grid resolution, it was similar to the alongshore resolution and proved to be sufficient for improving model accuracy, especially when higher surge heights caused extensive overwash and inundation. Future research could examine model sensitivity to small scale vegetation such as stem density (Jadhav et al., 2013). Additionally, there is a need for new methods to reduce uncertainties in LULC data due to variability within land cover classes, misclassification errors and errors in the establishment of appropriate roughness parameters for each land cover type (Medeiros et al., 2012). The simulated post-storm bed elevations were more accurate for Ivan than Katrina. Although post-Katrina bed-level changes were overpredicted (i.e., lower than observed), the simulated morphologic patterns of breaching and overwash generally matched observations. The overestimation of erosion in the Katrina simulations could be a result of errors in the initial topographic elevations, which were derived from a lidar survey collected three days after Ivan made landfall and eleven months before Katrina occurred. In this time, the dunes would have started to recover. This is similar to the conclusions of Lindemer et al. (2010), which attributed errors in simulated post-storm bed level elevation to the time between the lidar survey used for initial conditions and date of the storm's landfall. Furthermore, the post-Katrina lidar survey was collected sometime between two to four months after landfall, and may not accurately represent the immediate post-storm elevations. Errors in the modeled post-Katrina bed level could also have resulted from using 2001 CCAP data to parameterize spatially varying friction coefficients, which did not account for any changes in land cover post Ivan. A final scenario was performed to determine the influence of the post-Ivan elevations on morphologic change during Katrina. In this scenario, the pre-Ivan model elevations were used as initial conditions with the Katrina hydrodynamic forcing. Modeled post-storm bed elevations were within \u00b10.50 m of the original Katrina simulation, with the larger differences at the locations of the breaches (Fig. 11). Although the middle of the island still breached, the breach was not as wide as in the Katrina simulation (1731 m versus 2550 m wide) and the west end did not breach at all, illustrating that erosion and fragmentation during Ivan made the island more vulnerable to breaching during Katrina. Friction was not the only physical process influencing morphology change. During both storms, water level gradients controlled the direction of sediment transport across the island. Higher water levels landward of the island during recession resulted in seaward-directed flows and sediment transport, which ultimately breached the middle of the island. This is consistent with the findings of Sherwood et al. (2014) and Harter and Figlus (2017), which showed that storm-surge ebb flows were capable of producing seaward cross-barrier transport that resulted in channel formation and deposition in the nearshore. The simulations show that this process still occurs in the presence of spatially varying bed friction, which previous studies have not used."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study examined the influence of variations in bed friction due to land cover type on storm-driven barrier island morphodynamics. A 2DH XBeach model was used to simulate the morphodynamic response of Dauphin Island to hurricanes Ivan and Katrina using three bed friction scenarios: a constant Chezy coefficient of 55 m 1/2 /s across land and water, a constant Chezy coefficient of 33 m 1/2 /s across land and depthdependent Chezy coefficients across water, and spatially varying Chezy coefficients based on LULC data across land with depth-dependent Chezy coefficients across water. To assess the accuracy of each scenario, modeled post-storm bed elevations were qualitatively and quantitatively compared with post-storm lidar data. Results showed that assigning spatially varying friction coefficients to account for large-scale variations in vegetation and development reduced cross-barrier sediment transport and more accurately captured storm-driven morphologic change. Spatially varying friction had more of an impact on morphology for Katrina than Ivan as a result of higher surge heights, which caused more of the island to be in the overwash and inundation regimes. Differences in simulations with the sheet flow sediment transport limiter disabled indicated that the limiter may not be needed if bed friction is adequately described, especially when water levels generally remain below the dune crest elevation and overwash and breaching are minimal. The modeled post-Katrina bed elevations were lower than observed, most likely as a result of using a post-Ivan lidar survey as initial conditions, which did not account for post-storm recovery (e.g., dune growth) in the 11 months before Katrina occurred. The influence of the post-Ivan elevations on morphologic change during Katrina was further demonstrated with a scenario in which pre-Ivan elevations were used as initial conditions with Fig. 11. (a) Modeled post-Katrina bed elevation in hypothetical scenario where Katrina occurred before Ivan and (c) difference in modeled post-Katrina bed elevations between spatially varying scenario and hypothetical scenario; positive differences indicate lower bed levels in the spatially varying scenario. Katrina hydrodynamic forcing. Results indicated that lowered dune elevations from Ivan made the island more vulnerable to breaching during Katrina. Model output from the spatially varying friction scenarios was also used to examine hydrodynamic and morphodynamic interactions. Morphologic change during both storms was also influenced by water level gradients which controlled the direction of sediment transport across the island. During recession of both storms, higher water levels landward of the island caused seaward-directed flows and transport, with sand deposition in the nearshore. Overall, the results of this study improve the understanding of the influence of variations in land cover type, surge level gradients and prestorm topography on morphologic change. The methodology used herein to parameterize spatially varying friction coefficients based on LULC data can be translated to other study areas. Future XBeach studies should implement spatially varying bed friction at the barrier island scale to improve predictions of storm-driven barrier island morphology."}]
