The tidal marshes, mudflats, and shallow bays of coastal estuaries link marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats, and provide economic and recreational benefits to local communities. Climate change effects such as sea-level rise are altering these habitats, but we know little about how these areas will change over the next 50-100 years. Our study examined the effects of sea-level rise on nine tidal marshes in Washington and Oregon between 2012 and 2015, with the goal of providing scientific data to support future coastal planning and conservation. We compiled physical and biological data, including coastal topography, tidal inundation, vegetation structure, as well as recent and historical sediment accretion rates, to assess and model how sea-level rise may alter these ecosystems in the future. Multiple factors, including initial elevation, marsh productivity, sediment availability, and rates of sea-level rise, affected marsh persistence. Under a low sealevel rise scenario, all marshes remained vegetated with little change in the present configuration of communities of marsh plants or gradually increased proportions of middle-, high-, or transition-elevation zones of marsh vegetation. However, at most sites, mid sea-level rise projections led to loss of habitat of middle and high marshes and a gain of low marshes. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, marshes at most sites eventually converted to intertidal mudflats. Two sites (Grays Harbor and Willapa) seemed to have the most resilience to a high rate of rise in sea-level, persisting as low marsh until at least 2110. Our main model finding is that most tidal marsh study sites are resilient to sea-level rise over the next 50-70 years, but that sea-level rise will eventually outpace marsh accretion and drown most habitats of high and middle marshes by 2110."}, {"section_title": "Section 2-Technical Summary", "text": "Coastal land managers are faced with many challenges and uncertainties in planning adaptive strategies for conserving estuarine habitats under future climate change scenarios. Projected effects of climate change on coastal environments include sea-level rise (SLR), changes in freshwater delivery, saltwater intrusion, erosion, shifting mudflat profiles, and changing water temperature and ocean acidity. Climate change research often is conducted on isolated ecosystems where interactions among adjacent habitats are not fully considered. However, nearshore habitats such as shallow bays, mudflats, and tidal marshes are intricately linked transitional ecotones between the marine and terrestrial environment. These habitats are particularly sensitive to climate change because of potential shifts in coastal inundation, salinity, storms, and other environmental factors. Integration of physical and ecological response models that project changes to tidal marsh ecosystems and habitats is required to assess the vulnerability of coastal climate change. Using a detailed approach that links baseline data to mechanistic modeling, we assessed the vulnerability of tidal marsh habitats at nine sites along the Pacific Northwest coastline. Our overarching questions were: 1. How do tidal marsh site characteristics vary across estuaries? 2. Does tidal marsh susceptibility to SLR vary along a latitudinal gradient and between estuaries? We addressed these questions with three specific objectives: 1. Measure topographical and ecological characteristics (for example, elevation, tidal range, vegetation composition) for tidal marsh and intertidal mudflats, 2. Model SLR vulnerability of these habitats, and 3. Examine spatial variability of these projected changes along the latitudinal gradient of the Washington and Oregon coasts. Our data collected between 2012 and 2015 show differences in baseline topography, vegetation, soil characteristics, salinity, and tidal datums among sites. Vulnerability to SLR was dependent on projections of future SLR rates, initial elevation, sediment accretion potential, and site productivity. Low SLR had little effect or a positive effect (increased proportions of middleand high-elevation marsh zones) on the spatial extent or composition of future tidal marshes. However, middle-to-high SLR scenarios changed the composition of tidal marshes (high-and middle-elevation marsh zones usually became low-elevation marsh zones) or resulted in loss of vegetated marsh areas to intertidal mudflats. Sites responded differentially in terms of the timing and extent of habitat change over the coming century. Our research products include site-specific baseline data for managers and scientists, habitat vulnerability assessments at a local scale, and a region-wide comparison of tidal marsh vulnerability to SLR. Our findings are timely for managers and policy makers who need to develop future adaptation plans for estuarine habitats to sustain coastal wetland ecosystem functions and services such as fish and wildlife habitat provision and flood protection."}, {"section_title": "Section 3-Purpose and Objectives", "text": "Climate change threatens the persistence and diversity of coastal ecosystems by altering physical and biological systems (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). Effects on coastal environments include increased inundation from SLR and storms, saltwater intrusion, erosion, shifting beach and mudflat profiles, and changes in water temperature and acidification (Scavia and others, 2002;Huppert and others, 2009;National Research Council, 2012). Recent estimates of global SLR by the year 2100 range from 57 to 110 cm (Jevrejeva and others, 2012), 75 to 190 cm (Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009), and 54 to 71 cm (Slangen and others, 2014). In the Pacific Northwest, SLR rates are projected to be between 12 and 143 cm (National Research Council, 2012). Along the Pacific coast of the United States, local variations in SLR rates are affected by global-scale ice-sheet dynamics, North American glacial rebound, regional tectonics, local freshwater flow, and ocean circulation patterns (National Research Council, 2012). Coastal ecosystems also face other non-climate stressors, including continued urbanization and land-use change, habitat fragmentation, altered hydrology, pollution, and introduction of non-native species (Gedan and others, 2009). These other stressors may exacerbate climate change effects on coastal ecosystem persistence, productivity, and biodiversity (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Projections of future global climate conditions and SLR provide insufficient information on local ecosystem change, which is needed to inform management. To obtain reliable estimates of effects at smaller spatial scales (often the most relevant to on-the-ground management decisions), it is necessary to collect fine-scale information on environmental conditions to help inform ecosystem management and identify habitats most vulnerable to climate-induced change ( fig. 1). To understand climate effects on coastal ecosystems from site to regional scales, we established the Coastal Ecosystem Response to Climate Change (CERCC) program. To assess the scope of physical and biological climate-induced change to this region, we established a network of sites along the full latitudinal gradient of the Pacific Northwest coastline, providing insight into how variation in tide range, SLR, water temperature and salinity, and other climate variables affect the vulnerability of these critical coastal habitats. Nine sites were distributed in Washington and Oregon tidal marshes from Puget Sound to southern Oregon. The CERCC program also includes seven sites along the California coast that are not included in this report ( fig. 2). The program is led by the U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center, with co-leads at Oregon State University, the University of California at Los Angeles, and local and regional management agencies.  Regional and local understanding of SLR effects will be essential in developing comprehensive vulnerability assessments for key management concerns and the development of climate adaptation strategies. Our research is relevant to several ongoing federal research priorities. For instance, our work addresses the priority goals established in \"Rising to the Urgent Challenge-Strategic Plan for Responding to Accelerating Climate Change,\" developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish their strategic climate change plan and to assist managers with development of adaptation and planning strategies (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2010). Additionally, our research helps meet one of the priority objectives in the U.S. Department of the Interior (National Fish, Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Partnership, 2012), developed as a collaborative effort mandated by Congress (P.I. Thorne, oral commun., coastal development team member, June 2012). Our data provides information needed to increase preparedness of resource managers (for example, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] National Estuarine Research Reserve [NERR], and State wildlife agencies) who address restoration and management of lands and species. This research is a key priority topic for the North Pacific and California Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) in their strategic plans. Additionally, the CERCC program addresses the USGS Science Strategy (http://www.usgs.gov/start_with_science/), which includes anticipating ecosystem change and assessing consequences of climate change and its effects."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "At the State level, Washington and Oregon have highlighted coastal ecosystems as important areas susceptible to climate change and have prioritized research to assist in adaptation planning for resource management and ecosystem services.

Our CERCC network is a research model that potentially can be transferred to other coastal regions throughout the United States. The overarching goal of our research was to use site-specific data to develop local and regional climate change models that inform management of tidal wetlands along the Pacific Northwest coast.

At sites with RTK GPS network coverage (Padilla, Port Susan, Nisqually, Siletz, Bull Island, and Bandon), rover positions were received in real time from the Leica Smartnet system using a CDMA modem (http://www.leica-geosystems.us/en/index.htm). At sites without network coverage (Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Willapa), rover positions were received in real time from a Leica GS10 antenna base station by radio link. At sites where we used the base station, we adjusted all elevation measurements using an OPUS correction (www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS). We used the WGS 84 ellipsoid model for vertical and horizontal positioning and referenced positions to a local National Geodetic Survey benchmark or a benchmark established by a surveyor (fig. 4). Average measured vertical errors at benchmarks were 1-9 cm throughout the study, comparable to the stated error of the GPS (table 1). To measure topographic variation at each site, we surveyed marsh-surface elevation along transects perpendicular to the major tidal sediment source, with a survey point taken every 12.5 m; 50 m separated transect lines (appendix figs. A1-I1). We used the Geoid09 model to calculate orthometric heights from ellipsoid measurements (in meters, North American Vertical Datum of 1988 [NAVD 88]) and projected all points to North American Datum of 1983 [NAD 83] UTM zone 10 using Leica GeoOffice v7.0.1 (Leica Geosystems Incorporated, Norcross, Georgia).

We used elevation models as the baseline conditions for subsequent analyses, including tidal inundation patterns, SLR response modeling, and mapping of sites by specific elevation (flooding) zones. In this report, we present elevation data as both local orthometric heights (NAVD 88) and local mean higher high water (MHHW), based on computation of site-specific MHHW from water-level data. For comparison of results among sites with different tidal ranges, we also standardized elevations to local tide range, using the z* metric, where z*=(z-mean tide level or MTL)/(MHHW-MTL), as described in Swanson and others (2014). The lowest extent of tidal marsh generally occurs at approximately z* = 0.0 (MTL) while z*=1.0 (local MHHW) is approximately equal to the middle-high marsh boundary.

Total plant cover in a plot could exceed 100 percent because of vegetation layering. Vascular plant nomenclature generally follows Baldwin and others (2012) and Cook and others (2013)."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation Zones", "text": "To consistently delineate habitat elevation zones for analyses and mapping across all study sites we used long-term NOAA tide gauges and local vegetation data to determine patterns of flooding extent and vegetation limits with elevation across the Pacific Northwest. We defined subtidal habitat as all vegetated or unvegetated areas below local mean lower low water (MLLW), which is the average of the lower low water height of each tidal day. Intertidal mudflat comprised the zone between MLLW and the lowest measured extent of tidal marsh vegetation at each site (typically about at MTL). Higher in the intertidal zone, we defined four vegetated marsh zones based on long-term inundation data (low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, and transitional marsh). To delineate elevation zones within vegetated tidal marsh, we compiled high-tide data from 2004 to 2013 at three NOAA tidal stations along the U.S. West Coast: Charleston, Oregon; Toke Point, Willapa Bay, Washington; and Seattle, Washington (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) to assess the average inundation frequency in the upper intertidal zone. Using these time series, we determined the percentage of high tides during the 10-year period that reached a given elevation (z*). We defined low marsh as the range of elevations from the lowest extent of vegetation at a site to the elevation reached by at least one daily high tide on average. Middle marsh comprised habitat flooded by 50-25 percent of all high tides (inundated between once daily and once every 2 days), and high marsh included elevations flooded by 3-25 percent of all high tides (flooding at least twice per month, but less than once every other day, on average). We defined transition-zone marsh as habitat flooded by 0.14-3 percent of all high tides (inundated at least once annually, but no more than twice per month, on average). We computed z* values for the boundaries between zones (subtidal, mudflat, low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, transition marsh, and upland) from tidal data at each long-term NOAA station. At each site in the study, we used the z* values calculated from a nearby NOAA station (for example, Bandon was paired with Charleston NOAA records) and the local tidal datums to determine the local NAVD 88 and MHHW elevations that corresponded with each z* value defining zone boundaries. We used Charleston data for all Oregon sites, Toke Point data for outer-coast Washington sites, and Seattle data for all sites in Puget Sound."}, {"section_title": "Water Monitoring", "text": "To determine inundation patterns and to calculate site-specific tidal datums, we deployed water-level data loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Limited, Georgetown, Ontario, and Model U-20-001-01-Ti, Onset Computer Corporation , Bourne, Massachusetts) at all sites, beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2015.( fig. 6). Each site had one or two loggers (n=16; table 3). We placed loggers at the mouth and upper reaches of second-order tidal channels to record high tides and to determine seasonal inundation patterns. Water loggers collected water-level readings every 6 minutes starting on the date of deployment and continuing to the present (2015). We used data from the lowest elevation logger at each site to develop local hydrographs and inundation rates. We surveyed loggers with RTK GPS at the time of deployment and at each data download that occurred quarterly, to correct for any vertical movement. We corrected all raw water-level data with local time series of barometric pressure. For Solinst loggers, we deployed independent barometric loggers (Model 3001, Solinst Canada Limited, Georgetown, Ontario); for Hobo water-level loggers, we used barometric pressure from local airports (distance <10 mi).  To determine tidal-channel salinities, we deployed one conductivity logger at each site next to the lower elevation water-level logger (Odyssey conductivity/temperature logger, Dataflow Systems Pty Limited, Christchurch, New Zealand). We converted specific conductance values obtained with the Odyssey loggers to practical salinity units using the equation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (1983). We used water-level data to estimate local tidal datums for all sites using procedures outlined in the NOAA Tidal Datums Handbook (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2003). We only calculated local MHW and MHHW because the loggers were positioned in the intertidal zone, which is relatively high in the tidal frame, and, therefore, did not record MLW or MLLW and could not be used to compute these lower datums. We estimated mean tide level (MTL) for each site by using NOAA VDATUM 3.4 software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov/), except at Bandon where we used MTL directly from historical NOAA data. Many results in this report are reported relative to local MHHW calculated from local water data.\nWater-level loggers deployed within marsh channels recorded variation in water levels and salinity starting 2012 and continuing through 2015. Loggers often did not record lower parts of the tidal curve because of their location in tidal marsh channels, which frequently drain at lower tides. From peak water levels, we calculated site-specific tidal datums (mean high water [MHW] and MHHW) and information on the highest observed water level (HOWL) during the time series (table 8). Our site-specific tidal datum calculations generally closely matched tidal datums computed at nearby NOAA stations (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). Differences likely reflect site-specific tidal and bathymetric conditions in local estuarine hydrology. We collected salinity data at all sites; however, because of equipment recalls and failure, we do not have salinity data for the duration of the study. We report weekly maximum salinities because many of our salinity loggers were not submerged during the entire tidal cycle at all sites, except for Grays Harbor, owing to recalled loggers and loggers being washed away during storm events. We observed a high level of variation in salinity between and within sites ( fig. 20). Variation in salinity during the study period was highest at site Siletz, ranging from 0.8 to 32 practical salinity units (PSU). Willapa was the freshest system, ranging from 12 to 15 PSU, and had very little temporal variation. Variation in salinity was high at most sites from September through December. Salinity was less than 35 PSU for all sites throughout most of the year; however, the salinities were highest in August. Detailed site-specific results are shown in appendixes A-I. Table 8.

The RTK GPS enabled high-resolution elevations of the water surface. The rover positions were received from the Leica Smartnet system (www.lecia-geosystems.com) or base station and were referenced to the same benchmark used in the elevation surveys (table 1). We mounted a variable-frequency transducer on the front of the boat and connected it to the sounder; the sounder worked in areas greater than 10 cm of water. We recorded 20 depth readings and 1 GPS location each second along transects spaced 100 m apart perpendicular to the nearby salt marsh. We calibrated the system before use with a bar-check plate and adjusted the sound velocity for salinity and temperature differences.

Sediment cores were 50 cm deep and 5 cm in diameter. In the laboratory, we cut cores into 1-cm sections to process for bulk density, porosity, and organic matter composition using loss on ignition in a muffle furnace at 550 \u00baC for 8 hr (Heiri and others, 2001). We used cesium-137 ( 137 Cs) isotope dating techniques to determine accumulation rates in deep soil cores. Atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1964 resulted in the spread of 137 Cs across the globe, creating a reliable marker horizon in soils (Ritchie and McHenry, 1990). We used a gamma spectrometer at the Oregon State University Radiation Center to detect 137 Cs activity, measured in picocuries in 1-cm core samples for 24 hr.

Each cohort in the model represents the total organic and inorganic matter added to the soil column each year. WARMER calculates elevation changes relative to mean sea level (MSL) based on projected changes in relative sea level, subsidence, inorganic sediment accumulation, aboveground and belowground organic matter productivity, compaction, and decay for a representative marsh area ( fig. 9). Each cohort provides the mass of inorganic and organic matter accumulated at the surface in a single year as well as any subsequent belowground organic matter productivity (root growth) minus decay. Cohort density, a function of mineral, organic, and water content, is calculated at each time step to account for the decay of organic material and auto-compaction of the soil column.

Sediment accretion, M s , at a given elevation, z, is equal to where f(z) is dimensionless inundation frequency as a function of elevation (z), and S is the annual sediment accumulation rate in [(g/cm 2 )/yr] (figs. 10-11).

Following Swanson and others (2014), we modeled decomposition as a three-tiered process where the youngest organic material, less than 1 year old, decomposed at the fastest rate; organic matter 1-2 years old decayed at a moderate rate; and organic matter greater than 2 years old decayed at the slowest rate. Decomposition also decreased exponentially with depth. We determined the percentage of refractory (insoluble) organic material from the organic content measured in the sediment cores. We used constants to parameterize the decomposition functions from Deverel and others (2008) "}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "text": "For each site, we ran WARMER at 37 initial elevations (every 10 cm from 0 to 360 cm, NAVD 88). A 200-year spin-up period for each model run was used to build an initial soil core. A constant rate of sea-level rise was chosen so that the modeled elevation after 200 years was equal to the initial elevation. After the spin-up period, sea level rose according to the scenario (+12, 63, or 142 cm by 2110).

Individual sites varied significantly in median elevation relative to MHHW, with the highest at Grays Harbor and Padilla, and the lowest at Port Susan (figs. 14-17). Relative to MHHW, mean elevation at all sites was significantly different except for pair-wise comparisons between Padilla, Grays Harbor, and Siletz, as well as Nisqually and Bull Island (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], Tukey pairwise comparison, F=496.4, P<0.01; fig.  15). Overall, the topographic range was large at most sites, indicating that a range of habitat types was present ( fig. 18). Siletz, however, had a relatively more constrained elevation profile because it mostly consisted of high tidal marsh. Topographic profiles were significantly different at all sites (36 pair-wise Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; all P<0.03; fig. 16). We used long-term patterns of regional flooding extent and local DEMs to delineate habitats or vegetation zones. Padilla and Siletz were comprised mostly of high and middle tidal marsh vegetation communities. Nisqually and Willapa also were primarily comprised of high and middle tidal marsh, but had low marsh adjacent to open water. Skokomish, Grays Harbor, and Bandon were comprised mostly of middle marsh, with patches of high marsh occurring toward the inland edges of each site and low marsh present immediately adjacent to open water. Port Susan and Bull Island were comprised of primarily low marsh ( fig. 18). Detailed sitespecific results are shown in appendixes A-I.

Common species included Carex lyngbyei, Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus, and Potentilla anserina. The frequency of several common species varied markedly across the sites (fig. 21). Distichlis spicata dominated the flora at five of the nine sites, but was relatively uncommon at Port Susan and Grays Harbor. Deschampsia cespitosa, a middle-to-high marsh tussock-forming species, was frequent at the three Oregon sites and at Willapa, but was much less common in Puget Sound marshes. The high marsh rush, Juncus balticus, was most frequent at site Siletz and absent or rare at sites Willapa and Padilla. The occurrence of Carex lyngbyei varied regionally, ranging from greater than 75-percent frequency at Bull Island to near absence at Padilla (it did not occur in any surveyed plots, but a few plants were observed at the upland margin of the site in late 2014). Detailed site-specific results are shown in appendixes A-I. We delineated marsh zones using long-term NOAA tidal data, combined with our sitespecific elevation and water-level data, and examined plant abundance in these major zones across the sites. At many sites, plant composition tended to vary by zone, but not necessarily in consistent ways across the region (appendix tables A2-I2). For instance, at Bandon, Deschampsia cespitosa was the most abundant high and middle marsh species (with Distichilis spicata most abundant in low marsh), whereas S. perennis was the most abundant plant in low marsh at Grays Harbor (Carex spp. dominated the middle marsh and high marsh). Vertical zonation of plant assemblages was less pronounced at other sites, including Nisqually where Distichlis spicata had the highest mean cover in low and middle marsh zones.. Low marsh habitat was common at Bull Island, Willapa, Nisqually, and Port Susan. Common species in this zone included Sarcocornia perennis, Distichlis spicata, Carex lyngbyei, and Triglochin maritima. Middle tidal marsh was present at all the sites and was particularly common at Skokomish. Common species included all of the aforementioned taxa and Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus balticus and Agrostis stolonifera. High marsh was only common at Bandon, Siletz, Willapa, Grays Harbor and Padilla. Common high marsh species included many species found in other zones, but also included Potentilla anserine and Atriplex prostrata. Transition zone habitat (defined as wetland flooding at least once per year but no more than once per month) was limited at most of our study sites. Zonation of individual species per site is indicated in the respective appendixes (appendix figs. B5, C5, D5, E5, F5, G4 H5, and I5). Our data suggest that most Pacific Northwest vegetation communities are dominated by native species. The major exception is creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), a likely nonnative species, which can be locally common at many sites in the region. At Siletz, A. stolonifera was the most frequently occurring taxon (found in 84 percent of all surveyed plots) and had a mean cover of 59 percent across the site (appendix table G1). Despite this high abundance, Siletz still supported relatively high native plant diversity. Agrostis stolonifera was relatively uncommon at Willapa, Nisqually, Skokomish, and Padilla. Atriplex prostrata, another non-native species, occurred commonly across sites in the region, but never attained greater than 6 percent cover at any site. Marsh vegetation at Bull Island in Coos Bay was among the least invaded (it had only one non-native species, A. stolonifera, at 6 percent mean cover). Willapa Bay also was relatively uninvaded, with only three non-native species in relatively low abundance: A. stolonifera (3 percent mean cover), A. prostrata (0.2 percent mean cover), and Cotula coronopifolia (0.1 percent). Aside from A. stolonifera and A. prostrata, most non-native species occurred only infrequently at the sites we studied. Other non-native species included curly dock (Rumex crispus), trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), thistles (Cirsium arvense and C. vulgare), tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus), and velvet grass (Holcus lanatus). Small patches of non-native cordgrass (Spartina) hybrid and common reed (Phragmites australis) were observed in Grays Harbor in late 2014, but were not found in any surveyed plots during 2012. Total plant richness varied by site in the Pacific Northwest (table 9). For instance, at the Oregon sites, more than twice as many vascular plants were located at Bandon compared to Bull Island in nearby Coos Bay despite similar sample sizes. At the plot level, Bandon, Siletz, Nisqually, and Skokomish had the highest plant richness ( fig. 22). Each of these sites is affected relatively heavily by freshwater flow (Nisqually and Skokomish are located next to major river deltas), suggesting the role of freshwater in affecting overall richness. Padilla and Bull Island were the least diverse sites at the plot level, averaging less than three species per plot. Relatively high evenness among common species and the presence of many rare taxa seem to contribute to the high diversity of tidal wetland plant assemblages in the Pacific Northwest. Unlike many California marshes, Pacific Northwest marshes support several dominant species. For instance, at Bandon, nine species occurred in at least 20 percent of plots at the site (appendix table I1). Similarly, at Nisqually and Siletz, eight species occurred in at least 20 percent of plots (appendix tables D1 and G1). However, rare taxa also contribute to the high richness of Pacific Northwest marshes. At Bandon, 30 taxa occurred in less than 5 percent of the plots.

"}, {"section_title": "WARMER SLR modeling", "text": "Application of the WARMER model to our site-specific DEMs under three SLR scenarios showed changes in mean marsh elevation at all sites by the year 2110 ( fig. 23). The SLR projections used in the models had a large effect on final site elevation by 2110. Padilla, Port Susan, Skokomish, Nisqually, Grays Harbor, Willapa, Siletz, Bull Island and Bandon persisted as tidal marsh with similar vegetation composition under the National Research Council (NRC) low (+12 cm/100 yr) SLR rate, with mean elevation increasing or remaining unchanged over the coming century, indicating tidal marsh resiliency to low SLR rates ( fig. 24). However, there was a decline in mean site elevation under middle (+63 cm/100 yr) and high (+142 cm/100 yr) SLR scenarios, with acceleration of marsh loss between 2050 and 2110. Projected mean marsh elevations at Skokomish and Bandon remained unchanged under low SLR scenarios, but mean site elevation declined under mid and high SLR scenarios. Bandon was the only site to have mean elevation below MTL in 2110 under the high SLR scenario. Mean site elevation at all other sites was above local MTL. Detailed site-specific results are shown in appendixes A-I. WARMER results also showed state changes in vegetation zones and their spatial distribution ( fig. 25; appendix figs. A8, A10, B10, B12, C10, C12, D10, D12, E10, E12, F10, F12, G9, G11, H10, H12, I10, I12) under mid-SLR scenarios for most sites. For instance, at Willapa, which has a relatively high proportion of high marsh, habitat composition was projected to remain relatively similar to present conditions until 2050. By 2090, however, virtually all high marsh was projected to transition to middle and low marsh vegetation zones. Projected changes at Nisqually were similar to changes at Willapa. A mixture of high, middle and low marsh remains until 2090, but the site is modeled to be 86 percent low marsh by 2110. At Grays Harbor, we projected that elevation would increase throughout the coming century under the mid-SLR scenario. High marsh habitat expands between 2010 and 2080, with 72 percent of the marsh comprising high marsh habitat in 2110. The entire site was projected to remain vegetated throughout the modeled period, which is similar to Padilla, Nisqually, Willapa, Siletz, and Bull Island. In contrast, Port Susan, Skokomish, and Bandon begin to transition to unvegetated mudflat toward the end of 2110. Under the NRC high SLR scenario, during the coming century, all study sites in the Pacific Northwest are projected to undergo substantial changes in elevation profiles that are expected to result in changes in the composition of tidal marsh plant communities and available habitat ( fig. 26). At all study sites except Grays Harbor, Willapa, and Siletz, high marsh is essentially lost between about 2040 and 2060. These three sites lose high marsh by 2080-2090. WARMER projections suggest that all sites will lose all middle marsh by 2110 except Grays Harbor. The WARMER projections suggest that under high SLR scenarios, Grays Harbor and Willapa will be mainly comprised of low marsh by 2110; the rest of the sites will be comprised largely of unvegetated mudflat ( fig. 26). Detailed site-specific results are shown in appendixes A-I.    "}, {"section_title": "Section 6-Analysis and Findings", "text": "Our SLR modeling results suggests that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes are at risk of transitioning to unvegetated mudflat under the NRC mid and high SLR scenarios; however, there is substantial variation in vulnerability across sites (figs. 24-26). At all sites under mid and high SLR rates, most high and middle marsh habitat will not persist within current marsh areas, suggesting a change in vegetation communities across estuaries. Low marsh persists at a few sites under the highest SLR scenario (mainly at Willapa and Grays Harbor). Differences in initial starting marsh elevation and net accretion rates resulted in different model projections. Sites with high net accretion rates and initial elevations, such as Willapa, were projected to maintain low marsh over the next century regardless of the SLR rate. Alternatively, sites with low net accretion rates, such as Nisqually and Skokomish, are projected to transition to unvegetated tidal flats. Under low and mid SLR scenarios, model projections of marsh elevation are more optimistic, with most sites maintaining elevation profiles similar to their current conditions (figs. 24 and 25). Some sites are projected to remain vegetated, but transition to low marsh. The likelihood of these lower SLR scenarios being realized, however, is diminishing as new data from the Arctic and Antarctic suggest that previous research may have underestimated the rate of polar ice sheet melting and its contributions to global SLR (Enderlin and others, 2014;McMillian and others, 2014). Projections of global SLR that incorporate these new findings have not yet been produced for the Pacific coast. A sufficient sediment supply for accretion is critical for the maintenance of tidal marshes under accelerating SLR. Modifications to estuaries that reduce sediment supply can inhibit the potential for marsh accretion. For example, upstream dams can severely limit the amount of suspended sediment that is available for marsh accretion in estuaries (Weston, 2014). High measured accretion rates at Port Susan may be attributed to the undammed Stillaguamish River, especially when compared to the dammed Nisqually River. Both sites are within Puget Sound and have similar plant communities; however, the model projections for each site are very different. Similarly, land use practices (for example, extensive logging) near southern Willapa Bay may be responsible for the elevated net accretion rates observed. A better understanding of the effects of both proximate (net accretion rates, sediment supply) and land-use changes on projections of future tidal marsh elevation is important for developing management plans for accelerating SLR. To inform management decision making, we conducted a preliminary analysis to discern which model parameters have the greatest influence on elevation change (table 10). A boosted regression tree analysis used model parameters across each site to explain variance in elevation change after 100 modeled years. The results showed that the total amount of SLR is the primary driving force in marsh sustainability. Additionally, the results indicated that not only is the magnitude of SLR over the next century important, but the acceleration of SLR in the latter onehalf of the century also is critical for understanding marsh sustainability. SLR, initial elevation, and inorganic sediment accumulation are all dominant factors that determine tidal marsh sustainability. Initial tidal marsh elevation (0-360 cm in 10-cm increments) had the second greatest relative effect on the final output of the elevation model. For example, the higher the starting elevation, the greater of the likelihood that the tidal marsh would keep pace with SLR. Together, organic matter accumulation rates (maximum) and inorganic sediment accumulation (at 0 cm MSL) explained about 23 percent of variance in the final model output, with inorganic matter accumulation rates having a greater effect on final elevation than organic sediment contributions. SLR, initial elevation, sediment accumulation, and organic matter input accounted for 95 percent of the influence in projected elevation change. Tidal range, refractory carbon, and soil porosity (the difference between porosity at the top and bottom of the soil cores) had a negligible influence on model results, together accounting for 5 percent of the variance. The factors that resource managers may have the ability to manage (initial elevation and sediment accumulation rate) accounted for about 50 percent of the total variance. Table 10. Relative influence of major model parameters in elevation change by 2110.

We documented site-specific differences in elevation, vegetation composition, mineral and organic matter accretion, and water-level and salinity characteristics. Using deep core data, we determined that Pacific Northwest tidal marshes had variable historical accretion rates, which also varied between high and low marsh zones. Integrating the elevation, vegetation, and accretion data into elevation modeling (WARMER) under the National Research Council sealevel rise (SLR) scenarios, we determined that tidal marsh persistence is likely to vary between estuaries and is dependent on the SLR scenarios. Under low SLR rates, tidal marsh persisted at all sites, but mid and high SLR rates threatened the persistence of vegetated marsh at most of the sites over the coming century. The timing and degree of projected effects varied among sites. Under mid SLR projections, all sites lost high marsh habitat by 2110, and most became entirely low marsh habitat. Under mid SLR scenarios, Bull Island and Siletz in Oregon were the most vulnerable areas in the study, with loss of all vegetated marsh habitat by 2110. However, all other study sites also became relatively lower in elevation, tending to transition to low marsh habitat over the next 50-100 years. Changes in tidal marsh composition with SLR may affect various wetland-dependent organisms. For instance, changes in relative elevation across these marshes are expected to result in changes in plant community composition because of existing patterns of plant zonation along inundation gradients. Loss of middle and high marsh habitat across the region could have negative effects on terrestrial wildlife that use less frequently inundated tidal marsh for cover, foraging, and nesting. For example, common marsh inhabitants such as passerines and rails will probably lose mid-high marsh nesting and foraging habitats. However, corresponding gains in low marsh and mudflat may increase habitat available for marine algae, estuarine fish, shellfish species, and foraging areas for migratory shorebirds, and waterfowl. Future sediment supply and marsh productivity are likely to be key determinants of future tidal marsh persistence in the Pacific Northwest. In more than one-half of our study sites, the high SLR scenario resulted in transition from tidal marsh to mudflat habitat, suggesting that historical rates of net accretion are less than what is needed to keep pace with rising sea levels. Our preliminary findings suggest that the persistence of Washington and Oregon tidal marshes over the coming century is threatened if mid and high projections of coastal SLR are realized. However, more data are needed on these important ecosystems to fully determine their vulnerability to SLR, including understanding of variation in contemporary accretion rates within estuaries, elevation-productivity relationships for dominant vegetation species, and how surrounding land-use practices may impede or allow the migration of wetlands upslope. Additionally, integrating marsh transgression processes into modeling can help identify areas where marsh migration upslope could occur, which could prevent complete loss of marshes. To promote habitat persistence (especially in transitional, high, and middle marsh habitat), it may be necessary to take one or more proactive management steps to ensure habitat persistence. For instance, protecting and restoring habitat adjacent to current tidal marshes may ensure that marshes are able to migrate into upland areas. Management of watershed practices may help downstream marshes obtain adequate sediment supply. Management options for marsh elevation augmentation and adapting marshes to SLR needs further exploration. This project was successful in evaluating SLR vulnerability across a range of estuary types in the Pacific Northwest. Our results inform local and regional perspectives on potential tidal marsh vulnerability to SLR. We successfully partnered with local and regional resource managers to help provide information to inform their climate-change planning process. Recommended next steps for this research program include: \u2022 Incorporation of marsh migration processes into coastal modeling; \u2022 Additional research on processes inherent in marsh accretion potential, including organic matter contributions and suspended sediment availability; \u2022 Understanding of changes in marsh function owing to SLR, including vegetation responses to inundation \u2022 Assessment of delivery of suspended sediment to river-dominated estuaries and how this contributes seasonally to tidal marsh accretion and with storms; \u2022 Linking of intertidal mudflat processes with tidal marsh accretion rates; \u2022 Model expansion to other nearshore habitat types; \u2022 Better assessment of migratory bird use of these habitats and how that may change in the future; \u2022 Development of vulnerability assessments for key management resources; and \u2022 Integration of site-specific results with landscape-scale sea-level rise modeling to assess estuary-wide effects. Success of a regional project such as the Coastal Ecosystem Response to Climate Change network requires local manager and stakeholder engagement. Tidal marsh SLR response results were translated into vegetation zones to make the information more accessible to managers and their decision making processes. This project was successful in SLR modeling for tidal marsh ecosystems; however, better integration with adjacent habitats (for example, mudflats and uplands) would improve the scope of the results to the broader estuarine environment. Additionally, although our project was successful in projecting changes to habitat types (marsh vegetation zones), we did not address one of our stated project objectives-to link those changes directly to bird ecology."}]
