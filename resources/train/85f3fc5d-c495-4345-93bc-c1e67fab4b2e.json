[{"section_title": "T", "text": "he inseparability of mental and physical health has led to a variety of clinical models that integrate behavioral health providers into primary care (Butler et al., 2008; Collins, Hewson, Munger, & Wade, 2010; Kwan & Nease, 2013) . For example, some models incorporate care managers who often focus on mental health conditions such as depression (L. M. Dickinson et al., 2005; Un\u00fctzer et al., 2002) , while others have behavioral health providers addressing a range of mental health conditions at the point of care (Blount, DeGirolamo, & Mariani, 2006; Brown Levey, Miller, & deGruy, 2012; Miller, Mendenhall, & Malik, 2009; Robinson & Reiter, 2007) . Increasing recognition of the value of these integrated models to patient outcomes is enhancing support for implementation in several health systems. For example, the integrated model employed by the Veterans Health Administration allows an estimated 75% of patients with a mental health condition to have their needs addressed in primary care (Pomerantz et al., 2010) .\nIntegrated care is not widely available yet, and our fragmented, dual systems leave people short of receiving what is possible in a comprehensive and integrated system (Brown Levey et al., 2012; Hogan, 2003; Kwan & Nease, 2013) . Primary care and behavioral health integration aligns with the goals of the Triple Aim (improving the patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing health care costs; Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008) and other national health care priorities (e.g., the patient-centered medical home; Croghan & Brown, 2010 ; W. P. Dickinson & Miller, 2010; Miller & Patel, 2011; Miller, Talen, & Patel, 2013) , increasing the policy imperative for finding ways to make such care more available."}, {"section_title": "Identifying Opportunities for Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care", "text": "Despite increasing awareness of these vanguard practices, little is known at the state and national levels about (a) the number and location of primary care practices with integrated behavioral health, (b) where the potential for collaboration exists through provider proximity, or (c) where integration cannot occur due to the absence of one or the other type of provider. The latter problem is particularly common. For example, when Cunningham (2009) surveyed 6,600 primary care physicians about their ability to access mental health services, he found that two thirds of those surveyed could not gain access to mental health services for their patients, often because of shortages of behavioral health care providers. Studies have shown that even where these relationships exist, there are systemic barriers to sustaining collaboration.\nThe Cunningham study also identified health insurance obstacles and lack of health care coverage as barriers to accessing mental health and collaboration. We were most interested in understanding where there was proximity potential for collaboration since colocation is essential to integration. We sought to create a nationallevel snapshot of colocation to provide a geographic inventory of where integration efforts are more likely and where this primary problem of proximity remains a barrier.\nIdentifying opportunities for integrating behavioral health and primary care on a national scale is challenged by disconnected workforce data for these two provider groups. The physician workforce and the behavioral health workforce have separate educational pathways, specialty organizations, licensing and certifying bodies, and regulatory mechanisms. The American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile provides specialty and practice location information on physicians by compiling data from multiple sources. According to the Masterfile, more than 246,000 physicians with a primary care specialty were classified as working in direct patient care in 2010. The Masterfile overestimates the number of active primary care physicians by including some retired physicians, primary care-trained hospitalists, medical residents, and emergency department physicians. After discounting for these physicians, an estimate of 209,000 primary care physicians is likely more accurate (Petterson et al., 2012) .\nThe AMA Masterfile is similarly helpful for enumerating and locating psychiatrists, but there is no equivalent master file for the much larger pool of other behavioral health providers. This is an important problem because the role of psychologists and social workers has become increasingly common and the presence of psychiatrists has decreased (Miller & Druss, 2013; Scheffler & Kirby, 2003; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2012) . About 15 years ago there were nearly twice as many psychologists as psychiatrists and about twice as many clinical social workers as psychologists in the behavioral health workforce (Ivey, Scheffler, & Zazzali, 1998) . Additionally, there were roughly as many other types of master's-level behavioral health professionals (e.g., marriage and family therapists, substance abuse counselors) as master'slevel social workers (Cummings, 1995) . The number of clinically trained doctoral psychologists has doubled from 45,000 in 1983 to an estimated 93,000 in 2012 (American Psychological Association, 1996; American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies, n.d.)."}, {"section_title": "Geography and Mental Health Services", "text": "While the behavioral health workforce has grown substantially in the past few decades, its geographic distribution has not aligned with the distribution of the U.S. population, leaving many parts of the country underserved (Robiner, 2006) .

Baldwin et al. (2006) examined mental health licensing and survey data in Washington state and found that urban areas had more than three times the number of psychiatrists (full time equivalents) than rural areas. This is not unique to Washington state, nor is it a new development. Reports from 1999 research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service found that the distribution of the psychiatric workforce has remained predominately urban with a modest shift away from the largest urban areas (Scheffler & Kirby, 2003) . Other authors have noted the challenge of recruiting and retaining behavioral health professionals in rural areas. (Ivey et al., 1998) .

At this level of precision, there is a 1.1-m buffer around a particular point, meaning that we are effectively identifying practices that share the same building (with fourdigits, there is a 11.1-m buffer, which could include neighboring buildings).

Psychologists made up nearly one fifth of the behavioral health workforce, and there were approximately 4.3 psychiatrists, social workers, or marriage and family therapists for every psychologist (see Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows the number of psychologists per 100,000 persons by county in the United States. The results confirm prior findings of significant geographic maldistribution in the behavioral health workforce. In general, psychologists are concentrated in the West, the Northeast, and several states in the Midwest. With the exception of south Florida, the South in general and states along the Gulf of Mexico in particular have fewer psychologists per capita than the rest of the country. The map also indicates significant intrastate variation. Within the same state, counties can have as few as none to as many as 303 psychologists per 100,000 persons.

At the other extreme, we find a mixture of southern states among states with fewer psychologists.

Medicare should purge the NPI of retired providers and should flag those not providing care or only doing so part time.

The NPPES database offers potential for new insights into where opportunities are limited for integration due to workforce shortages or nonproximity of providers. These areas will require different infrastructure and policy solutions involving issues such as workforce policy, telehealth, shared behavioral health models (as with the Vermont Blueprint for Health), academic health center extension services, or even clinic conversion to a Federally Qualified Health Center or a Rural Health Clinic in order to obtain additional staffing resources."}, {"section_title": "Policy Implications", "text": "While there is growing evidence of the benefits of integrated efforts, in many cases health care policy has not changed to accommodate this new delivery model (Kathol, Butler, McAlpine, & Kane, 2010) .

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration could partner with the Health Resources and Services Administration, which administers the NHSC, to make behavioral services providers a higher priority.

There are several payment demonstrations underway that include capitated or per-member-per-month payments, rather than or in addition to fee-for-service payments, to support the delivery of important services to a primary care patient panel.

Informing policy to advance effective integration in primary care practices will require a simultaneous understanding of the evidence base and gaps in the evidence where research can occur.\n\u2022 The NPPES database is valuable for its capacity to identify the distribution of behavioral health and primary care clinicians, but it has important limitations that could be overcome with better management of these data and by combination with other data. There exists a need to transform the NPPES capacity into an actual, functional tool to support rational workforce planning. Similar to the UDS Mapping software used by the Health Resources and Services Administration (UDS Mapper, n.d.), this tool could help inform states and communities of where providers are located and of opportunities for possible integration. In order to better assist the expanding role of primary care in health care, psychologists could also use these tools to assess areas that need additional coverage and study them. For example, the maps clearly show locations where there are no psychologists or other behavioral health providers. These geographic areas still have behavioral health need regardless of how small the population (e.g., RUCC 8, 9), which is consistent with the literature on behavioral health workforce development and expansion (Baldwin et al., 2006; Ivey et al., 1998) . The University of New Mexico Health Extension Rural Offices program monitors many types of health providers in every county, provides resources to shore up areas of greatest need, and organizes its workforce training to fill these gaps over time (The University of New Mexico, n.d.).

The NPPES database is valuable for its capacity to identify the distributions of behavioral health and primary care clinicians and assess where colocation is occurring. Behavioral health colocation is a prerequisite for integration of behavioral health in primary care, and such colocation exists in many places where integration could be enabled promptly with attention to training, education, and workforce issues, payment reform, and further research and analysis. The journey to integration through colocated practice is not presently feasible in some locations because of an absentee workforce and because it requires attention to capacity building in both the behavioral health and primary care physician workforce arenas. The NPPES database provides an opportunity to simultaneously analyze the distributions of behavioral health and primary care clinicians and, for the first time, show where in the United States behavioral health and primary care are actually colocated."}]
