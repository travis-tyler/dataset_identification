Of the students who attended 4-year institutions, first-generation students were much more likely to attend public comprehensive institutions instead of research universities than those with at least one parent who had a bachelor's degree (41 percent versus 26 percent). More than one-quarter (27 percent) of first-generation students attended part time, and these students were much more likely to work full time compared to students whose parents had a college degree. By the end of the 1997 98 academic year, a larger proportion of firstgeneration students (25 percent) had chosen business/management as their major field of study, compared with their non-first-generation counterparts (17 percent). In general, first-generation students had lower first-year GPAs than students whose parents had a college degree (2.6 versus 2.8), and were more likely to have taken at least one remedial course during their first year of postsecondary education (21 percent versus 10 percent). This difference persisted even after controlling for the rigor of students' high school coursework and college entrance examination scores. Among students who substantially exceeded the core New Basics in high school, first-generation students were more likely to have taken at least one remedial course during their first year of postsecondary education than students whose parents had a college degree (15 percent versus 6 percent). Moreover, among students whose college entrance examination scores were in the lowest quartile, 38 percent of first-generation students had taken at least one remedial course during their first year, compared with 29 percent of students whose parents had a college degree. However, among students who took rigorous high school courses or scored in the top quartile on their college entrance examinations, first-generation students had first-year college GPAs and remedial coursetaking patterns that were not significantly different from their non-first-generation peers.

Among those students who took a rigorous high school curriculum, first-generation students and students whose parents completed college had similar rates of postsecondary departure without return (5 percent and 3 percent).

Finally, this study examined overall rates of persistence and attainment in spring 1998, 3 years after initial enrollment. Students whose parents had a bachelor's degree were more likely than their first-generation peers to have attained a degree or to still be enrolled 3 years after entering a 4-year institution (88 percent versus 73 percent).

These findings hold true even when other related variables are held constant. That is, even after controlling for variables such as academic preparation and postsecondary achievement, parents' education continued to be a significant factor in determining whether students persisted, were enrolled at their initial institution 3 years after entering, or stayed on the persistence track. Students whose parents attained a bachelor's degree were more likely than first-generation students to remain enrolled at their initial 4-year institution.

At the same time, after holding all other variables constant, students who took rigorous coursework in high school significantly increased their chances of staying on the persistence track to a bachelor's degree.

Between 1972 and 1998, the percentage of 16to 24-year-old high school graduates immediately entering college increased from 49 to 66 percent (U.S. Department of Education 2000). For some high school students, especially those whose parents have less education, the transition to college requires more consideration, because it offers both, opportunity and risk. Among these students are those who are the first members of their immediate families to enroll in postsecondary education, often referred to as \"firstgeneration students.\" First-generation students exhibit different college enrollment behaviors than their counterparts whose parents have more education (Levine and Nidiffer 1996;Nufiez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Terenzini et al. 1996). A recent analysis of data from the Third Follow-up of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88/94) supports this finding. Among students who were highly proficient in mathematics in 8th grade (as measured by a NELS proficiency test), first-generation students were less likely than their peers whose parents held college degrees to have completed advanced mathematics classes in high school; similarly, among those who were qualified for college, first-generation students were less likely than non-first-generation students to enroll in 4-year institutions (Horn end Nufiez 2000). These differences persisted even when controlling for demographic characteristics, acadennc preparation, and college planning activities. First-generation status is also negatively associated with persistence and attainment in postsecondary education. Persistence of beginning postsecondary students is affected by a variety of factors, including income, race/ethnicity, delayed entry, and financial aid. While financial aid in the form of grants appears to lower the probability of low-income and minority students' dropping out of college (U.S. General Accounting Office 1994Office , 1995, among undergraduates who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96, low-income students were less likely than their Introduction Although first-generation students appear less likely than non-first-generation students to complete a degree, recent research suggests that a college degree is key in helping firstgeneration students improve their economic status. The 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Study (B&B:93194) data showed that, among first-generation students who completed a 4-year degree, those in the labor market 1 year after completing their degrees had similar occupations and salaries to their non-first-generation peers (Nuriez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998). The purpose of this study is to build on this earlier work by examining whether firstgeneration students who were otherwise equally prepared academicallyas demonstrated by their coursetaking in high school and college entrance examination scorespersist in college at a rate similar to that of students whose parents went to college. Though Nufiez and Cuccaro-Alamin (1998) found that first-generation students were less likely than their counterparts to persist in college, they were not able to control for key indicators, such as academic preparatiOn in secondary education. Consequently, it was not possible to determine whether differences in persistence were a function of students' academic preparation for postsecondary work. Using newly available data, this study adds to this research by investigating how first-generation and nonTfirstgeneration students differ in their academic preparation for college. By controlling for academic preparation when examining rates of persistence and attainment in postsecondary education, this report provides a better understanding of the unique circumstances of first-generation students and the conditions that promote educational success."}, {"section_title": "Report Organization", "text": "This report examines the academic preparation and postsecondary persistence of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students, comparing first-generation students with those whose parents either have some college education or attained a bachelor's degree.

In addition, this study examined persistence behavior by noting the number of enrollment spells a student took since entering a 4-year institution in 1995-96. Retention at initial institution is composed of the following three values: Student still enrolled in or attained a degree at the initial institution (including students who stopped out and later returned to their initial institution).

To address these questions, the analysis used two measures of academic performance: college grade-point average (GPA) and the number of remedial courses that students took during their first year of college. As shown in table 8, first-generation students and students whose parents had some college earned lower overall GPAs than did students whose parents completed college (2.6 each versus 2.8 points). Also, first-generation students were more likely than students whose parents had a college degree to have taken one or more remedial courses during their first year in college (21 percent versus 10 percent) (table 9)."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Academic Rigor of High School Courses", "text": "The rigor of students' high school curriculum was strongly associated with their first-year GPA. As overall rigor in the curriculum increased so did students' GPA; on average, students whose high school coursework did not exceed the core New Basics curriculum had a lower GPA than did those who took rigorous coursework (2.5 points versus 3.1 points) (table 8). This finding suggests that those students wh6 took difficult courses in high school were better prepared for the academic rigors of college.  In addition, among students whose secondary curriculum did not exceed the core New Basics or only somewhat exceeded it, first-generation students had a lower GPA than students whose parents had a college education. Among students whose secondary curriculum somewhat exceeded the core New Basics, first-generation students had a 2.5 GPA, while students whose parents had completed college had a GPA of 2.8. The differences between first-generation students and those whose parents earned a degree, however, were not observed among students whose secondary curriculum was rigorous or substantially exceeded the core New Basics. As with students' first-year GPA, the rigor of students' high school curriculum was related to the number of remedial courses taken during the first year of postsecondary education (table  9). Overall, as the rigor of the secondary curriculum rigor increased, the proportion of students who took one or more remedial courses decreased from 21 percent to 3 percent. Among students who somewhat or substantially exceeded the core New Basics in high school, first-generation students were more likely than students whose parents finished college to have taken one or more remedial courses during their first year of postsecondary education. For example, 15 percent of first-generation students whose secondary curriculum substantially exceeded the core New Basics took one or more remedial courses, compared with 6 percent Of their counterparts whose parents had completed college.

Students with higher college entrance examination scores tended also to have higher first-year 'GPAs (table 8). For example, on average, first-generation students who scored 790 points or lower on the SAT/ACT earned lower grades in the first year of college than their counterparts who scored at least 1100 points on the college entrance examination (2.2 GPA versus 3.1 GPA). Taking this relationship between high school achievement and postsecondary performance into account, there was little variation between the two groups. That is, after controlling for entrance examination scores, no significant differences were found between the GPAs of firstgeneration and non-first-generation students. In addition, though a seemingly large proportion of all students took remedial courses during their first year of postsecondary education (15 percent), this was related to their entrance examination scores. As college entrance examination scores increased, the percentage of students taking one or more remedial classes during their first year of postsecondary education decreased from 35 percent to 2 percent (table 10). Students' scores on entrance examinations were also related to differences between firstgeneration and non-first-generation students in remedial coursetaking. Among those in the lowest quartile, first-generation students were more likely than students whose parents had earned a bachelor's degree (but not those whose parents had some college education) to have taken one or more remedial classes during their first year of postsecondary education (38 percent versus 29 percent and 36 percent, respectively).

This negative trend was especially evident for students who began at 4-year public and private, not-for-profit institutions (Nutiez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998). The current analysis extends this previous research by investigating the possible source of variation between the groups: that is, does this difference remain after controlling for high school academic preparation and college entrance examination scores? To address this question, this analysis looks at the following dimensions of persistence and attainment: 1) number of enrollment spells, 2) retention at the initial 4-year institution, 3) persistence track to a bachelor's degree, and 4) attainment or last academic year of enrollment through 1998."}, {"section_title": "Number of Enrollment Spells", "text": "An \"enrollment spell\" is a period of continuous enrollment at one or more institutions.

In this analysis, the number of enrollment spells was calculated as of the First Follow-up survey, which took place in spring 1998 about 3 years after the beginning postsecondary students initially enrolled. Enrollment spell is an important indicator of persistence and attainment because breaks in enrollment continuity will increase the time required to complete a program of study (Berkner, McCormick, and Cuccaro-Alamin 1996). First-generation students were more likely than their peers whose parents completed college to have two or more enrollment spells (15 percent versus 10 percent) (table 11).

After controlling for academic preparation, first-generation students who did not take a rigorous curriculum in high school were less likely than students whose parents completed college to be enrolled 3 years after entering a 47year institution (65 percent versus 85 percent). However, among students who were more preparedthat is, students whose high school curriculum was rigorousno differences in persistence were found according to students' parental level of education. For example, a large majority of both first-generation students (88 percent) and students whose parents completed c011ege (94 percent) were still enrolled in June 1998. In addition, students' college entrance examination scores were related to who left college and who stayed enrolled (table 18). The higher their college examination score, the less likely students were to leave postsecondary education during the first 2 years of college: 74 percent of students in the lowest quartile of examination scores were still working toward or had attained a degree in spring 1998, whereas 85 percent to 92 percent of their peers with higher scores reported the same. After controlling for academic preparation, first-generation students scoring in the lowest quartile were more likely than students whose parents had completed college to have left postsecondary education during the second academic year (1996-97). However, among students who scored in the highest quartile, first-generation students were as likely as students whose parents completed college to be enrolled. 9The results show a slightly higher proportion of first-generation students had attained a degree by June 1998, compared with students whose parents had a bachelor's degree (5 percent versus 3 percent). This is probably due to the fact that first-generation students transferred down more often and then earned an associate's or vocational certificate from a 2-year institution."}, {"section_title": "5 4", "text": "Persistence and Attainment Beyond New Basics II 84.4 6.9 77.5 3.4 8.5 3.6 Rigorous 89.5 2.6 86.9 1.6 8.9 0.0 NOTE: Details may not sum to 100 due to rounding.

Similar to the previous regression model, other variables associated with higher rates of persistence included having higher first-year GPAs, enrolling full time versus part time, and not working or only working part time versus working full time while enrolled.

Consequently, first-generation students are less likely to enroll in 4-year institutions and, if they do, are less likely to persist in college. To understand the roots of these outcomes, this study examined how acadeinic preparation in high school affects the differences in outcomes of first-generation students and non-first-generation students. First and foremost, students who took rigorous coursework in high school were very likely to persist in 4-year postsecondary institutions. In addition, rigorous academic preparation in high school seemed to play a substantial role in narrowing the gap in postsecondary outcomes between first-generation students and their peers whose parents graduated college. At the same time, results from the multivariate analysis showed that parents' levels of education were associated with rates of students' retention and persistence in college, even when controlling for measures of academic preparedness. First-generation students were less likely than their peers whose parents had a bachelor's degree to be enrolled at their initial institution 3 years later and to stay on the persistence track to a bachelor's degree. Nevertheless, regardless of postsecondary achievement, parents' education, and other background characteristic variables, students' level of academic preparedness remains an important predictor of retention and persistence in college. Students who took rigorous coursework in high school significantly increased their chances of either being enrolled at their initial institution 3 years later or making a lateral transfer to a comparable institution and of attaining a college. degree. Overall, these results indicate that providing first-generation students the opportunity to take rigorous coursework in high school will increase their chances of succeeding in college."}, {"section_title": "63", "text": "Appendix AGlossary Average score on Advanced Placement exams taken Indicates the average score on all Advanced Placerne 100 to show finer gradations of average scores (range divided by 100.
