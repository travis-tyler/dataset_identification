[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Deposition of amyloid-b (Ab) in the cerebral cortex is thought to be a pivotal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis with a significant genetic contribution. Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical Ab load until now. We employed florbetapir ( 18 F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Ab levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical Ab load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P \u00bc 5.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 14 ) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P \u00bc 2.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 ) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical Ab levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with Ab deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with Ab burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Cortical deposition of amyloid-b (Ab) peptide is thought to be a crucial early step in the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1 The presence of cortical neuritic plaques, consisting of Ab fibrils surrounded by degenerating neuronal processes, is a hallmark feature for the pathologic diagnosis of AD. 2 Ab plaques have also been identified in individuals meeting clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 3 and have exhibited subtle relationships with cognition among older individuals without dementia or MCI symptoms. 4 In addition, pathogenic mutations in genes related to Ab processing, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 and -2 (PSEN1, PSEN2) genes, have been discovered in patients with the rare, autosomal dominant form of AD. 5 As a result, Ab accumulation is increasingly proposed as a major antecedent, ultimately leading to incident AD. 6 The fundamental biological influences on brain Ab levels are not yet fully understood. The strongest known genetic risk factor for AD is the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele; 7 in vitro and murine studies have proposed plausible links between the encoded ApoE e4 isoform and aberrant Ab mechanisms. 8 However, APOE e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for development of AD pathology, suggesting that the biology underlying Ab accumulation involves contributions from other genes and pathways, as well as the environment.\nThe ongoing search for genetic modulators of brain Ab deposition in humans has been bolstered by advances in imaging methods for noninvasive detection of fibrillar Ab in vivo. Whereas existing genetic studies of brain Ab have focused on candidate genes due to moderate sample sizes, the enhanced half-life of recently developed 18 F-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) imaging Ab tracers such as florbetapir (also known as or Amyvid) allows for more widespread evaluation to facilitate the acquisition of larger cohorts for analysis. 9 Importantly, florbetapir PET data has demonstrated strong relationships with pathologically verified assessments of fibrillar Ab burden, 10, 11 and thus represents a novel and robust quantitative phenotype that can be assessed in samples with heightened power for the discovery of genes influencing Ab neuropathology.\nWe used quantitative florbetapir PET data from 555 participants enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cortical Ab burden in humans. We hypothesized that GWAS would confirm the association of APOE as well as identify other genetic modulators of brain Ab deposition."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "This report utilized data from ADNI 12 (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/), a multisite longitudinal study that was launched in 2004 as a public-private partnership. The initial phase (ADNI-1) enrolled individuals aged 55-90 years who were recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada, and followed at 6-12-month intervals for 2-3 years. These individuals included B200 healthy controls (HC), 400 patients with late MCI (LMCI) and 200 patients clinically diagnosed with probable AD. Subsequent phases (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2) have extended follow-up for existing participants and have enrolled additional individuals, including those meeting criteria for early MCI (EMCI). All participants provided written informed consent and study protocols were approved by each site's institutional review board.

Participants were administered a bolus injection of B370 MBq florbetapir intravenously. Fifty minutes later, a 20-min continuous cranial PET scan was initiated. Images were reconstructed immediately following the scan using iterative algorithms, and repeat scans were acquired if motion artifact was detected. Preprocessing of the scans was performed as previously described. 13 Briefly, image frames were averaged, aligned to a standard space (AC-PC), resampled to a standard image and voxel size, smoothed to a uniform resolution, and normalized to an atlas-based bilateral and symmetric cerebellar reference region. This cerebellar reference region consisted largely, but not exclusively, of gray matter and was expected to exhibit nonspecific binding, ultimately resulting in standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images. These preprocessed scans were downloaded from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/) for 621 participants. For each scan, mean regional SUVR values were extracted for the frontal, parietal, temporal, limbic and occipital lobes using the MarsBaR toolbox implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/). The average SUVR for these five regions was then calculated to represent a global cortical measure of Ab deposition to be used as a quantitative phenotype for GWAS. Overall, 19 participants (eleven HC, six MCI, two AD) were excluded due to missing scan data or failed processing, leaving data for 602 individuals available for further analysis."}, {"section_title": "Genotyping and imputation", "text": "A blood draw for genomic DNA extraction was obtained at the screening or baseline visit for all study participants. 14 Genotyping on these samples was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) using the Human610-Quad BeadChip (for subjects initially enrolled during ADNI-1) or the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip (for subjects initially enrolled in ADNI-GO or ADNI-2). In addition, the two SNPs characterizing APOE e2/e3/e4 status (rs429358 and rs7412) were genotyped separately as previously described 14 and merged with the array data sets. All genotype data underwent stringent quality control procedures 14 (sample exclusion for call rate o95% or failed identity or gender check, and SNP exclusion for call rate o95%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test P o1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 6 or minor allele frequency o1%) using PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/Bpurcell/plink/), version 1.07. 15 In addition, to limit the possible effects of population stratification, multidimensional clustering analysis was used to select only participants with non-hispanic Caucasian (CEU or TSI) ancestry based on HapMap3 reference populations. Overall, one individual was excluded due to a failed gender check and 42 individuals were excluded based on ancestry.\nNext, haplotype patterns from the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel were used to impute genotypes for markers not directly assayed. Prior to imputation, the orientation of all genotyped markers in relation to the plus-strand alignment of the reference panel genome (NCBI build 37 coordinates) was verified and monomorphic variants from the reference panel were excluded. Minimac 16 was used to impute samples within groups based on the genotyping platform employed (Illumina 610-Quad or OmniExpress). Following imputation, SNPs with r 2 o0.5 between imputed and assayed genotypes were removed. 17 The remaining array SNPs demonstrated 499.9% concordance between imputed and assayed genotypes. The independently imputed data sets were then merged to generate a common set of 410 million SNPs for the full ADNI sample. Following quality control (SNP call rate o95%, Hardy-Weinberg P o1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 6 ) and frequency filtering (minor allele frequency o5%), 6 108 668 SNPs were included in the GWAS. Of the 602 participants with Ab PET data, 559 individuals were included in the resulting genetic data set. Among these individuals, four pairs exhibited significant relatedness (PLINK identity by descent PI_HAT 40.5), and therefore one individual from each pair was randomly selected for exclusion (two HC, one EMCI, one LMCI), leaving 555 participants for the final GWAS sample."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "For the GWAS, linear regression was performed using PLINK to determine the association of each SNP to global cortical Ab levels. An additive genetic model was specified and age, gender and diagnosis (through a set of binary dummy variables indicating HC, EMCI, LMCI or AD) were applied as covariates. To account for multiple comparisons, we employed a conservative threshold for genome-wide significant association (P o5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 ) based on a Bonferroni correction of one million independent tests. 18 Haploview 19 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/) was used to generate Manhattan and Q-Q plots, and SNAP 20 (http:// www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/) was used to obtain regional association plots for selected loci. Post-hoc analyses, including hierarchical linear regression, effect size calculations, and exploratory correlation and interaction studies using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons were performed using IBM SPSS statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (Armonk, NY, USA)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "This study analyzed data from 555 ADNI participants with nonhispanic Caucasian ancestry. Participants were diagnosed at the time of the PET scan as HC, EMCI, LMCI or AD. EMCI subjects met clinical criteria for amnestic MCI, 21 but exhibited milder (between 1.0 and 1.5 s.d's below age-associated norms) memory impairment ( Table 1 ). In this sample, the EMCI group was younger than the other groups (Po0.001). All groups displayed comparable levels of education but the LMCI group included fewer female participants compared to the HC group (w 2 P \u00bc 0.029).\nThe GWAS results did not indicate evidence of spurious inflation of association test statistics (l \u00bc 1.00) due to population stratification or other confounding factors (Figure 1 ). Loci on two chromosomes exhibited genome-wide significant association (P o5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 ) to cortical Ab levels ( Figure 2 ). As expected, the peak association originated on chromosome 19 from rs429358 (P \u00bc 5.45 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 14 ), which codes for the APOE e4 allele. 7 Other SNPs within APOE and in the region of its adjacent genes APOC1, TOMM40 and PVRL2 also displayed significant association to cortical Ab levels in the primary GWAS model (Figures 2 and 3a) ; however, their association signals disappeared (P 40.05) when APOE e4 status (absence \u00bc 0, presence \u00bc 1) was included as a covariate.\nMultiple SNPs on chromosome 3 near BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) also displayed genome-wide significant association to cortical Ab load ( Figure 2 ). The peak association signal at this locus originated from rs509208 (P \u00bc 2.69 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 ), which is B450 kb AV-45 amyloid PET GWAS implicates APOE and BCHE VK Ramanan et al upstream (5 0 ) of BCHE (Figure 3b ). This association remained strong with the inclusion of APOE e4 status as a covariate (P \u00bc 1.94 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 7 ). Several additional loci exhibited suggestive association (P o5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 6 ) to cortical Ab levels (Figure 2 and Supplementary  Table 1 ). These loci included SNPs within or near the cell adhesion genes of ITGA6 (integrin, alpha 6; chromosome 2) and ITGA1 (integrin, alpha 1; chromosome 5) as well as SNPs near the insulinsignaling pathway gene PIK3R1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1; chromosome 5), among others. The association signals at these loci were not reduced after the inclusion of APOE e4 allele status as a covariate (data not shown).\nFollowing the GWAS, we performed post-hoc analyses to further assess the impact of the APOE and BCHE loci on Ab burden. Whereas both the APOE e4 allele and the minor allele (G) of rs509208 conferred increases in cortical Ab levels (Figures 4a   and b ), there was no evidence of epistasis modeled as an interaction between these factors (P \u00bc 0.871). Instead, these factors appeared to exert independent and additive effects on Ab burden (Figure 4c) , with comparable effect size associated with the presence of at least one copy of the minor allele at rs509208 whether APOE e4 allele status was included as a covariate (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.50) or not (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.52). Exploratory analyses did not reveal significant interactions (P40.05) of the APOE or BCHE risk loci with age, diagnosis, education or gender.\nFinally, we performed hierarchical linear regression to assess the variance in Ab levels uniquely explained by these genetic factors (DR 2 ). Age, gender and diagnosis were entered as the first block in the model, and collectively accounted for 2.7% of the variance in cortical Ab levels in this sample. APOE e4 allele status ( \u00fe / \u00c0 ) and BCHE rs509208 allele status ( \u00fe / \u00c0 ) were included in the second block for stepwise entry into the model. APOE e4 was found to explain an additional 10.7% of the variance, whereas BCHE rs509208 accounted for 4.3% of variance over and above that explained by the previously entered variables."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Using florbetapir PET and GWAS, this study confirmed the association of APOE, and identified a novel and independent association of BCHE to cerebral Ab deposition. Together, the risk variants at these loci explained 15% of the variation in cortical Ab levels, a substantial effect for two genes in a study of complex disease of this size. Additional loci, including both new genes and others previously studied in relation to AD, also displayed suggestive association to Ab burden and provided further targets for follow-up.\nFlorbetapir PET allows for noninvasive detection of brain Ab plaques, 10,11 a hallmark pathologic feature of AD. It also serves as a quantitative endophenotype that can provide increased statistical power for discovery using GWAS compared to case-control designs. 22 Although the heritability of Ab deposition, a dynamic process captured by PET at one time point, is unknown and not a direct proxy for AD heritability, implicated markers using this approach may be more closely related to underlying processes having an impact on disease risk and progression. 23 For late-onset AD, the largest known genetic risk factor is the APOE e4 allele. Extensive prior studies have suggested a number of mechanistic roles for APOE e4 on Ab burden, including hindering clearance of soluble Ab from the brain, 24 favoring Ab aggregation into fibrils 25 and promoting neurodegeneration by directing toxic Ab oligomers to synapses. 26 Among the genes neighboring APOE, we found no significant associations with Ab burden after including APOE e4 status as a covariate. Whereas this suggests that these genes did not exhibit independent effects on Ab deposition, the extensive linkage disequilibrium structure around APOE makes this difficult to determine definitively. BCHE has previously been proposed as an AD risk gene. 27 BCHE is known to be enriched within Ab plaques in post-mortem human AD brains, 28 and its increased presence has been suggested as a critical factor in the formation of the neuritic plaques of dementia. 29 The most commonly studied BCHE SNP is the K-variant (rs1803274), which is B500 kb downstream of, and not in linkage disequilibrium with, rs509208. The BCHE K-variant has demonstrated synergistic effects with APOE e4 on the incidence of pathologically confirmed late-onset AD 27 and on risk of progression from MCI to AD. 30 Nevertheless, the present study is the first to implicate genetic variation at the BCHE locus in brain Ab burden in humans and represents the largest reported effect for this gene on an AD-related phenotype.\nThere are several mechanisms which might explain the effect of BCHE on Ab plaque burden. Genetic variation at BCHE has been associated with increased cortical BCHE activity in autopsy tissue from elderly individuals with dementia. 31 Increased enzyme activity, leading to decreased acetylcholine levels, may disrupt synaptic functioning, glial cell activation and myelin maintenance to favor Ab-plaque formation and neurodegeneration. 32 Indeed, cholinesterase inhibitors are presently first-line symptomatic therapies for AD, 33 and drugs such as rivastigmine which inhibit BCHE are suggested to have potential disease-modifying effects in certain individuals compared to exclusive acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. 34 Alternatively, through non-enzymatic functions, BCHE may promote Ab fibrillogenesis from soluble precursors 35 or may interact with Ab and ApoE to alter the cerebrospinal fluid environment, 36, 37 and to render developing plaques more resistant to clearance. 38 Interestingly, BCHE activity has been associated with insulin resistance, 39 and rs509208 in particular has been associated in a separate GWAS with diabetes-related traits, 40 suggesting a broader role of the BCHE locus in disorders characterized by amyloidogenic protein accumulation.\nAlthough rs509208 is B450 kb upstream (5 0 ) of BCHE and not within conventional gene boundaries, the next closest genes (ZBBX, SERPINI2) are nearly 1 Mb in the opposite direction ( Supplementary Figure 3) . Of note, SNPs as far as 800 kb upstream of BCHE have previously demonstrated genome-wide significant association with serum BCHE activity in a population sample of nearly 9000 individuals from several Australian twin and family studies. 41 These SNPs included a peak signal 250 kb from the gene (rs2034445) and other non-independent signals from SNPs in high Figure 3 . Regional association plots for the loci exhibiting genomewide significant association to cortical Ab burden. Magnified association plots are displayed for the regions around (a) rs429358 within APOE and, (b) rs509208 at the BCHE locus. SNPs are plotted based on their GWAS \u00c0 log 10 P-values (left vertical axis) and their genomic position (NCBI build 36). Genes in these regions are labeled with arrows denoting their 5 0 -to-3 0 orientation, and the red color scale of r 2 values is used to label SNPs based on their degree of linkage disequilibrium with the annotated peak SNP. Recombination rates calculated from 1000 Genomes Project reference data are also displayed in a blue line corresponding to the right vertical axis. Figure 2 . Manhattan plot of observed \u00c0 log 10 P-values from the GWAS of cortical Ab load. More than six million SNPs were tested for association to global cortical Ab burden under an additive genetic model, applying age, gender and diagnosis as covariates. Genome-wide significant associations (exceeding the threshold represented by the red line) were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE and its neighboring genes, and on chromosome 3 at the BCHE locus. Suggestive associations (exceeding the threshold represented by the blue line) were identified on five additional chromosomes. Annotations are provided for genome-wide significant associations and for the top three suggestive associations.\nlinkage disequilibrium with rs509208 (for example, rs6443374 and rs13314077), suggesting that variants upstream of the gene may exert regulatory effects on BCHE expression with consequences to the activity of its encoded enzyme. Converging evidence in genomics indicate that this kind of regulation is quite common and may involve mechanisms influencing chromatin structure, transcription-factor binding and splicing-component recognition sequences, among others. 42 Molecular characterization in brain tissue and cell cultures will be important to determine the complex functional architecture of the BCHE locus, and the genes and other DNA elements surrounding it.\nThe current study has several limitations. Although this represents the largest genetic study of Ab PET, the sample size has limited power for a GWAS. With a larger sample, the suggestive loci we highlighted might have achieved genomewide significance. Among these included ITGA6 that encodes a component of a receptor complex proposed to mediate the proinflammatory interaction of microglia with Ab fibrils, 43 PIK3R1 that may contribute to the disruptions in insulin signaling in the AD brain, 44 and other genes with potential relationships to AD pathogenesis. Similarly, given the novelty of the present Ab PET GWAS data set, a comparable replication sample is not yet available.\nIn addition, the ADNI cohort represents a sample typical of a clinical trial for MCI/AD and the analyses here were restricted to non-hispanic Caucasians. The extent to which the present findings can be generalized to other populations and to the community setting of MCI/AD individuals remains to be determined. Future multicenter and international collaborations are expected to yield larger samples with greater power for analyses of potential interactions of genetic risk factors with each other and with clinical variables such as gender, ethnicity, family history, age of onset and rate of disease progression, which could not be appropriately addressed with presently available data. Florbetapir also does not bind soluble forms of Ab, 45 which may exhibit dynamic relationships with deposited, fibrillar Ab to drive neurodegeneration in AD. 1 Finally, whereas this study employed imputed (probabilistically predicted) genotype data to provide deep coverage of the genome, higher-density genotyping arrays and sequencing will eventually provide direct assays for a similar number of variants.\nDespite these limitations, the present findings point to several intriguing extensions for follow-up. First, GWAS of longitudinal change in florbetapir PET Ab burden is likely to elucidate additional genes modulating the rate of progression of AD neuropathology. Complementary analytical strategies, including pathway-and epistasis-based approaches, may also reveal functional influences on Ab deposition that are not easily observed through standard GWAS methodologies. In addition, whole-genome sequencing will dramatically enhance the granularity of coverage for GWAS-implicated loci and could be particularly valuable for discovering additional novel loci, rare variants, copy number variants and DNA regulatory elements. Finally, the approval for widespread use of both florbetapir PET imaging and BCHE inhibitors creates a unique opportunity to prospectively assess the effects of these drugs on Ab deposition Figure 4 . APOE e4 and rs509208 (BCHE) appear to exhibit-independent, additive effects on cortical Ab levels. Mean cortical Ab levels (adjusted for age, gender and diagnosis)\u00b1s.e.'s are displayed based on (a) the number of APOE e4 allele copies and, (b) rs509208 genotype. Presence of at least one copy of the e4 allele was significantly associated with increased Ab burden (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.71), as was presence of at least one copy of the minor allele (G) of rs509208 (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.52). These loci appeared to exert additive effects on Ab levels (panel c): subjects having both risk factors exhibited significantly greater Ab burden than subjects having either factor in isolation, and no significant epistasis modeled as an interaction was identified.\nAV-45 amyloid PET GWAS implicates APOE and BCHE VK Ramanan et al over time, particularly among individuals at early stages in the AD spectrum where clinical efficacy would likely be most valuable.\nThis study highlights the power of pairing targeted molecular imaging with genome-wide analytical strategies to elucidate mechanisms underlying AD pathophysiology. The association of the BCHE locus to Ab deposition merits further investigation and may have significant implications for risk stratification, biomarker interpretation and therapeutic development."}]
