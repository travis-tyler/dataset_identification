The population of students in the United States who are English Language Learners has increased by 4.4 million students, or 0.5% over the last 10 years [1] . This population has steadily increased over the last decade and is projected to continue to grow. Specifically in reference to Texas, the [2] reported that the enrollment of English Language Learners increased by 269,091, or 37.8%, between the 2005-2006 and the 2015-2016 school years. In the 2005-2006 school year, 15.7% of the population were identified as English Language Learners whereas during the 2015-2016 school 18.5 % of the students were identified English Language Learners. Given this increase in the English Language Learner population in Texas in recent years, educational leaders need to know how to address their unique academic needs. Though non-native English speakers have been present in public schools for decades, with the addition of standardized testing and accountability, a strong emphasis has been focused on all students meeting expectations.\nIn a recent National Assessment of Educational Progress report, [3] analyzed the results from the 2005 mathematics and reading assessments given to a random sample of Grade 4 and 8 students in the United States. In this national sample, English Language Learners had statistically significantly lower mathematics and reading assessments than their peers in Grade 4. These achievement gaps increased from Grade 4 to Grade 8 for English Language Learners. More recently, [4] analyzed data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress exams for students in Grade 4 and Grade 8. In their investigation, they compared the reading and mathematics performance of English Language Learners to their native-English speaking peers from 2003 through 2011. In their analyses, native-English speaking boys and girls had statistically significantly higher reading and mathematics test scores than t their English Language Learner peers. Similar to previous research, [4] established that the achievement gaps in reading and in mathematics was steady or slightly widening over the time period in their study.\nWith reference to student gender, [5] reviewed data on 8,503 participants in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort. These data were derived from a national longitudinal study with a sample of over 20,000 participants who were in kindergarten during the 1998-1999 school year. [5] documented that girls had an initial score higher than boys and a greater growth rate in reading than boys. Other researchers [e.g., 6, 7, 8] have also provided evidence that girls outperform boys in reading. Due to the early advantages that girls have, they continue to outperform boys throughout their educational careers. Concerning mathematics, boys outperform girls in the later grades [5] .\nIn a statewide Texas investigation, [9] explored the extent to which achievement gaps persisted in Texas for Grade 5 students in reading and mathematics over a 16-year period from 1993 until 2009. During that time span, the Texas Education Agency transitioned from the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills to the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, thus resulting in some years not having compatible tests. Even so, in all instances, English Language Learners had statistically significantly lower average reading and mathematics test scores than Hispanic non-English Language Learners. Despite the school reform efforts implemented because of the mandates of No Child Left Behind Act, students who were English Language Learners continue to obtain lower test scores than their White peers. Part of this separation of achievement is due to the \"White flight\" or decreased enrollment of Whites in public schools [10, p. 560 ). This movement of White students to public school has increased the achievement gap within the public and private schools [11, 10] .\nIn an empirical statewide analysis in Texas, [12] examined gender differences in college readiness in reading, in mathematics, and in both subject areas. They analyzed data from the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Test (ACT) for the 2005-2006 and the 2006-2007 school years. In their Texas statewide investigation, they documented that girls had statistically significantly better college readiness skills in reading and in both subjects, whereas boys had statistically significantly better mathematics college readiness skills. In their study, slightly more than one third, 38.76%, of boys were college-ready reading, compared to over half, 51.01%, of girls who were collegeready in reading. Statistically significant differences were also determined by [12] between boys and girls in their percentages of taking the SAT or ACT. In their investigation, 66.7% of girls took the ACT or SAT compared to a smaller percentage, 59.7%, of boys who took the ACT or the SAT.\nIn a similar study in Texas, [13] compared the science passing rates of boys and girls. They used the Texas state-mandated science assessment for students in Grades 5, 8, and 11 for three consecutive school years. In each of the three grade levels and in each of the three school years, boys had statistically significantly higher passing rates on the science exam than did girls. Given that the need for science related jobs has increased, it is imperative to address the gender gap to ensure equality for all [14] . In another recent study conducted in Texas, [15] analyzed data on the 2012-2013 through the 2014-2015 State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness Reading tests for Grade 3 boys and girls. [15] established that girls had statistically significantly higher reading scores than boys in each of the three school years. Grade 3 girls outscored boys on each of the three Reading Reporting Categories and on the Level II Final Satisfactory Performance Standard in all four school years. Effect sizes for her statistically significant results ranged from trivial to moderate.\nIn a similar study in Texas, [16] examined the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness Mathematics and Science scores for Grade 8 boys and girls for four consecutive school years. Congruent with previous researchers, boys statistically significantly outperformed girls in both mathematics and in science, with one exception, where in one school year, boys and girls had similar mathematics scores. With the underrepresentation of girls in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers, changes to the practices of teachers and educational leaders is needed [14] .\nSpecifically in reference to English Language Learners, [17] collected narrative language samples over a 3-year period, including six samples between kindergarten and second grade. [17] documented that girls outperformed boys in their growth rates across outcome measures throughout the duration of the study. This disparity was present in both English and in Spanish, and could contribute to the achievement gap between boys and girls.\nWith the student population in the United States changing to include a higher percentage of students whose primary language is not English, further research on this population and their academic performance is essential. Given the previous research on the existence of gender differences in student academic achievement, the degree to which those findings would be generalizable to English Language Learners specifically is not known. As such, empirical research into whether achievement gaps might be present between English Language Learner boys and English Language Learner girls could provide useful information. In the literature on gender differences that was discussed previously, comparisons were made between boys and girls in their reading, mathematics, and science performance. These authors, however, did not address gender differences within groups of student such as English Language Learners. That is, to what degree do English Language Learner boys and English Language Learner girls differ in their academic achievement?\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the degree to which differences were present between Grade 3 English Language Learner boys and girls in their reading performance. Of particular interest in this multiyear analysis was the degree to which English Language Learner boys and girls differed in their reading achievement on the Texas state-mandated reading assessment. Through examining three years of Texas statewide data, the extent to which a trend was present in the reading performance of Texas Grade 3 English Language Learner boys and girls was ascertained.\nThe following research questions were addressed in this multiyear analysis: (a) What is the difference between Grade The first five research questions were repeated for the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 school years whereas the last two research questions were comparisons across these three school years. As such, a total of 17 research questions was present in this empirical investigation."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "For this investigation, the research design that was present was a causalcomparative investigation [18] . Archival data were analyzed in this multiyear investigation. A causal-comparative research design was present because the independent variable of gender is not alterable and the dependent variables of student reading scores had already occurred. When archival data are analyzed, neither the independent variable nor the dependent variables can be manipulated [18] ."}, {"section_title": "Participation and Instrumentation", "text": "Participants in this study were Grade 3 English Language Learner boys and girls who completed the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness Reading assessments during the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and/or 2014-2015 school year. English Language Learners are students who are \"in the process of acquiring English and has another language as the first native language\" (Chapter 89.1203 of 19). During the 2011-2012 school year, Texas changed the mandatory standardized achievement test from the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills to the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. With this change, Texas changed from assessing students on basic skills to assessing students on the application of the knowledge and skills [20] . Students are assessed in reading in Grades 3 through 8.\nOn each assessment, test creators use the blueprint to determine which Texas Essential Knowledge and Standards are tested each year. Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills are further delineated into Readiness Standards and Supporting Standards. Readiness Standards vary for each grade level and content area but are most critical for students to be successful in the current grade level and to be prepared for the next course [21] . Supporting Standards are concepts and content that are newly introduced in the current grade level and prepare students for the next grade level but not critical for students to master the current grade level [21] .\nThe Texas Education Agency defines reading skills across three reporting categories of the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness Reading exam in Grade 3. Students' ability to demonstrate basic reading understanding across genres (i.e., fiction, poetry, drama, literary non-fiction, expository, persuasive) by determining \"the meaning of grade-level academic words in English, using context to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words, and comparing and contrasting themes or moral lessons\" is assessed in Reporting Category 1 [22, 2011, para. 3). In Reporting Category 2, students must demonstrate the ability \"to comprehend and analyze literary texts (i.e., fiction, poetry, Asian J. Interdicip. Res. 141-155 | 145 drama, literary nonfiction) for elements such as foreshadowing, character development, sensory detail, and figurative language\" [22, para. 4). For Reporting Category 3, students must be able \"to comprehend and analyze informational texts (i.e., expository, persuasive) by demonstrating the ability to summarize the main idea and supporting details, analyze organizational patterns and text features, and make logical connections between ideas and across texts\" [22, para. 5).\nTo that end, questions remain regarding the degree of literacy students have and the extent to which disparities exist by economic status.\nThe Texas Education Agency has created three levels of performance: Level 1: Unsatisfactory Academic Performance, Level 2: Satisfactory Academic Performance, and Level 3: Advanced Academic Performance [20] . As the STAAR exam was new, the Texas Education Agency gradually increased the performance standard (i.e., Phase-in 1, Phase-in 2, Final Satisfactory). To ensure score validities and score reliabilities, the Texas Technical Advisory Committee conducted numerous studies. External studies were compared to the SAT and ACT as well as vertical scale studies that allowed a comparison of student performance across grades within a content area [20] . Readers are directed to the Texas Education Agency website for further information regarding score validities and score reliabilities for the STAAR Reading assessments."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "To determine whether a difference was present in the Level II Phase-in 1, Phase-in 2, and Final Satisfactory performance standards for English Language Learners boys and girls, Pearson chi-square procedures were performed. This statistical procedure was most appropriate to use because both the independent variable of gender and the STAAR Reading test dependent variables (i.e., met or did not meet standard) were categorical in nature and constituted frequency data. As such, the optimal inferential statistical procedure was the Pearson chi-square. Given that the sample size was greater than five per cell, its underlying assumptions were met."}, {"section_title": "Research Question One Results", "text": "Concerning the Level II Phase-in 1 Satisfactory Performance Standard of English Language Learner boys and girls, the result for the 2012-2013 school year was statistically significant, \u03c7 2 (1) = 473.12, p < .001.
