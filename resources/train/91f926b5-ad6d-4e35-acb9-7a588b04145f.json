It is one of the most common forms of dementia; patients with AD suffer from a degradation of cognitive abilities over time. In the advanced cases, patients struggle with activities of daily life, ultimately resulting in an inability to manage even self-care. In this disease, nerve cells and tissues of the human brain are affected. Initially, the cortical cell layer, which helps in planning, thinking, and remembering, and the hippocampus, which plays a key role in the creation of new memories, are affected. Although vulnerability to AD increases in those over the age of 65 years, this disease is not solely associated with old age [1] . Studies have estimated that more than 90 million people will be affected by AD by 2050 [2] . In recent years, despite considerable research to discover treatments for AD and halt or delay its progression, outcomes have not been very promising [1] . Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) is a widely used test to examine neurological diseases. It is a non-invasive medical test in which a strong magnetic field and radio wave pulses are used to capture detailed images of organs, soft tissues, and bone in the body. Images with different characteristics can be obtained by changing the strength of the magnetic fields (1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla, etc.). One of the benefits of sMRI is the ability to produce different contrasts in the images by varying the magnetic fields and radio waves. Different types of tissues, such as white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM), are highlighted with different contrasts. As such, sMRI can be employed to diagnose and study AD because the geometric characteristics of GM and WM, such as their size or shape, can vary over time in AD patients. Figure 1 shows three sMRI planes (taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)) [3] , which are described as follows:\n\u2022 Axial Plane: \"slices\" taken from above (transverse view).\n\u2022 Sagittal Plane: \"slices\" taken perpendicular to the axial plane, with distinct left and right sides (lateral view).\n\u2022 Coronal Plane: \"slices\" taken perpendicular to the sagittal plane, with distinct frontal and posterior images (frontal view).\nThe central slices of different planes from OASIS dataset are shown in Fig. 1 -(a), (b) and (c). The GM and WM in the Fig. 1 are tissues of the brain that are affected by the AD [2] . The hippocampus is also an important brain region for evaluating AD.\nIn this paper, we propose an AD diagnosis framework with a data permutation scheme on AlexNet. In order to overcome problems of lower accuracy when a deep learning scheme (such as AlexNet) is used, a framework including a data permutation scheme with data combining sMRI slices, outlier removal, and entropy-based slice selection is proposed. Our contributions in this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a framework for sMRI classification for AD diagnosis using AlexNet.\n\u2022 Outlier and noisy pixels in sMRI scans are removed based on the decile of the histogram.\n\u2022 Multiple slices with more valuable information are selected for training based on image entropy.\nCopyright c 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers The proposed method is verified in both the OASIS and ADNI datasets and shows a significantly improved classification accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The related works are described in Sect. 2. The proposed method is described in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the experimental results. Finally, the conclusions of the proposed work are presented in Sect. 5."}, {"section_title": "Related Works", "text": "The SVM and feedforward neural networks, which are considered to be classical machine learning based methods, have been successfully applied to structural sMRI based diagnoses for AD [4] , [5] . Plant et al. [4] propose a novel data mining framework, with the combination of three different classifiers, including SVM, Bayesian statistics and voting feature intervals (VFI), in order to derive a quantitative index of pattern matching to predict the transition from MCI to AD. The highest classification accuracies in terms of discriminating AD and NC were achieved using a feature selection algorithm. In this work, a classification accuracy of 92% was achieved on a non-publicly available database. Another similar method was proposed by Jha et al. [5] , in which a dual-tree complex wavelet transform was used to extract features, and a feed-forward neural network was used to classify sMRI scans. A comparative analysis of their results with other classical methods was also presented [5] , and a classification accuracy of 90.06% was achieved, using the OASIS dataset. Zhang et al. [6] proposed a framework for the diagnosis of AD, in which three steps, including landmark definition, landmark detection, and AD/NC classification, were performed. In the landmark definition (which included local morphological features such as histogram features, oriented energies, and local minima in the p-values map), statistically significant differences in the training images for AD and NC were recognized. The landmark detection step included a pre-trained model, which was proposed to detect AD landmarks in each test image automatically and effectively. In the classification step, a linear SVM classifier, trained with landmark-based morphological features from the training images, was applied to classify test images as either NC or AD. The proposed scheme achieved an 83.1% detection rate on the ADNI dataset. Varma et al. [7] proposed a preprocessing scheme called Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). As a next step, features of image textures were extracted using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Finally, classification was performed using SVM. The overall accuracy of the scheme was 77.1% on the OASIS dataset. Zhang and Wang [8] estimated the displacement field (DF) between an AD brain and a normal brain. The DF was used to identify features, which were reduced by principal component analysis (PCA), and finally classified by three different variants of SVM. This method has an accuracy of 88.27% on the OASIS dataset. Zhang et al. [9] used principal component analysis (PCA) to generate an eigenbrain, which was fed into the SVM to discriminate AD from NC. It achieved an accuracy of 92.36% on the OASIS dataset.\nThe deep learning-based methods showed significantly improved performances compared to the classical learning based ones, for the diagnosis of AD. Gupta et al. [10] , proposed a deep learning-based classification framework. A sparse auto-encoder, trained to determine initial weights, which were then used in a convolution neural network (CNN) to classify AD, was proposed. The proposed scheme demonstrated a classification accuracy of 93.80% for AD in the ADNI dataset. The method was further improved by using 3D convolution [11] . This method showed an accuracy of 95.39% with a binary classification of AD and NC, and an 89.47% accuracy when discriminating AD, NC, and MCI. Liu et al. [12] proposed a learning structure with two primary components, stacked sparse auto-encoders and a softmax regression layer. The auto-encoders obtain deep representations of the original input. The softmax regression layer classified instances by selecting the highest predicted probabilities of each label. The multiple modalities (sMRI and DTI) were used for AD classification in [13] , where the left and right lobes of the hippocampus are considered as an input of CNN base classifier. In [14] , a cross-model transfer learning was proposed. The model is first trained on sMRI and fine-tuned on DTI modality. The hippocampus are used as a biomarker in this method. Aderghal at al. [15] proposed a separate CNN base classifier for each plane of sMRI brain data. The median based three 2D slices of hippocampus region are considered as an input and majority voting rule is used for final decision. In [16] , authors proposed a method in which the Gray Matter (GM) images of brain have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. The final predication is determined by a voting scheme on an ensemble of deep belief networks. A summary of the primary contributions of the machine-based strategies to the diagnosis of AD are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 , most of the recent AD classifiers employs either traditional classifier models (such as SVM) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a single layer or trained a new network with limited dataset. The conventional methods have used a combination of a feature extractor and a SVM classifier [4] - [9] , [17] or deep learning-based approaches [11] - [18] . They have been verified primarily on the OASIS or ADNI datasets. It has been reported in recent studies that deep learning-based methods outperform the classical methods in classification accuracies. Improvements of the deep learning-based methods are attributed to the optimized feature extraction compared to classical methods, in which features are extracted from a dataset and then fed to a classifier such as SVM where the decision of classification is performed. However, the deep learning models employed in AD classification [10] - [12] only use one layer of CNN which reduces the system capability to learn complex boundaries. The methods in [13] - [16] utilized sub portion of the brain for Alzheimer's classification. The framework proposed for the AD diagnosis uses five layers of CNN with AlexNet [23] . These layers extract a higher degree of features from the sMRI data and help fully connected (FC) layers in achieving a higher decision accuracy. The initial layers extract the edges and corners as features, while textures or patterns are extracted as the features of the deeper layers. In addition to the benefits of AlexNet, the proposed data permutation scheme helps to significantly improve performance accuracy. The conventional methods using CNN show lower accuracy results due to the reduced number of CNN layers and the lack of a data permutation scheme, while the scheme proposed use the full benefits of deep learning architecture with AlexNet, as well as an efficient data utilization scheme, thus resulting in higher accuracies.\nThe initial work in the AD diagnosis using sMRI was based on machine learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) [4] . Although the accuracy of these diagnoses was acceptable, further improvements were achieved with the help of deep learning tools, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [20] , sparse autoencoder [21] and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [17] . It has been reported that deep learning-based methods outperform statistical machine learning methods in the diagnosis of AD. However, certain limitations in the deep learningbased methods remain, some of which are listed below.\n\u2022 Large datasets are required for proper training and improved accuracy.\n\u2022 There is a lack of labelled data and a scarcity of relevant datasets, especially in the medical imaging field.\n\u2022 Overfitting and underfitting problems can occur.\n\u2022 Computationally expensive training is involved in deep learning networks, especially with large datasets.\n\u2022 Lack of annotated data, highly expensive data annotation by trained physicians, and limitations on crossinstitutional use due to ethical reasons and security issues regarding patient information.\nTo overcome such limitations and to achieve the full benefits of deep learning approaches, certain alternatives can be used. Transfer learning is one of the best alternatives to fine-tune the deep learning network [22] . In transfer learning, training is performed using larger amounts of training data so that the pre-training model can be improved. The pre-training model is then fine-tuned with the target data and finally applied to the test data. Fine-tuning a model with transfer learning is usually much faster and easier than training a network with randomly initialized weights. This can allow for the rapid development of a model for target data with a smaller number of training images. AlexNet is a popular pre-training model which offers a substantial framework to overcome limitations of traditional training systems. AlexNet is primarily known for winning the ImageNet [24] large-scale visual recognition challenges (ILSVRC) in 2012 [25] . The competition used 1.2 million high-resolution training images, 50,000 validation images, and 150,000 testing images. One thousand different categories needed to be identified for these images. The efficient management of complex classification threads in the AlexNet allows it to be viewed as a suitable alternative to solve complex deep learning problems. Here, AlexNet, with some modifications for our application, is used to classify sMRI scans from AD patients. Due to the high-performance of AlexNet, it shows promising classification accuracies with limited sMRI datasets for training (as well as noisy sMRI data and selection issues in 3D sMRI scans), even when AlexNet is used alone for AD diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dataset", "text": "To evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method, two widely used datasets, OASIS [3] and ADNI1 [26] were used. The sMRIs from OASIS are divided into two categories: cross-sectional and longitudinal. The cross-sectional category includes single sMRI scans of 416 subjects with ages between 18 and 96, whereas multiple scans over a period of time for each subject are included in the longitudinal category. The longitudinal dataset is used to examine the development of AD over time. Thus, the cross-sectional data was used for classification in the experiments. The ADNI dataset was used as a second dataset for the classification experiments. In the ADNI dataset, patients Table 2 Demographics of datasets are divided in three groups: AD, MCI, and NC. Patients with MCI are classified separately from AD, as they have a slight decline in cognitive abilities, including thinking and memory. Patients with MCI are at greater risk of transitioning to AD, or any other type of dementia. The ADNI dataset has complete sMRI scans for 843 subjects with different scanner intensity fields (1.5T and 3T). Details of the OASIS and ADNI datasets are shown in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Proposed Method", "text": "Deep learning for sMRI classification requires a large amount of data for training. The scarcity of data in medical diagnostic applications can result in notable limitations of performance, and classification accuracy can also be significantly reduced [27] . In addition, the presence of noisy or outlier pixels in the sMRI scans, due to various scanning conditions, may also result in a reduction of the classification accuracy. It has been noted that the relative importance of different slices in a sMRI scan can be very diverse, which indicates that the diversity in the level of information in individual slices of a sMRI scan can also have an impact on the overall accuracy of the system. For instance, slices located in the center of the scan tend to have more discriminant information in AD classification because the slices include more cortical and hippocampal regions, which are crucially important regions in AD diagnosis. For this reason, it is important to build a more appropriate dataset for AD classification under such sMRI dataset conditions. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations and to ensure a higher classification accuracy, we propose a data permutation scheme including data combination, outlier removal and slice selection methods, which increases the amount of sMRI data for training. Ultimately, this leads to a significant improvement in the classification accuracy. A pre-trained deep learning model, specifically \"AlexNet\" [23] , is used in the proposed method.\nIt is well known that the pre-trained AlexNet performs well in faster training and improves classification accuracy with relatively small datasets. AlexNet has a total of eight layers for training. Five layers are used for convolution with sub-pooling layers, and three are used as fully connected layers [21] . The different number of kernels of different of sizes are used in each convolution layer as shown in Fig. 2 . The proposed architecture of the modified AlexNet that was used in the AD classification system can be seen in Fig. 2 . In the proposed method, the output of the classifier is manipulated to identify two categories (AD vs NC) for binary decision and three categories (AD vs NC vs MCI) for ternary classifications, as shown in Fig. 2 .\nAlthough AlexNet is known as a high-performance pre-trained deep learning architecture, it does not show high accuracy for AD classification with a limited training dataset. There are a number of slices in each sMRI scan and each slice has different levels of information in terms of discriminating power. If we build the dataset for training the AlexNet by efficiently selecting sMRI slices in the different orientations, the classification performance could be significantly increased. In the method described here, a data permutation scheme with outlier removal and entropy-based slice selection for the training of AlexNet is proposed. It is known that limited training data is likely to cause an overfitting problem in machine learning applications [28] . Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient number of sMRI scans of patients due to security issues related to personal information. Hence, it is necessary to efficiently utilize the limited sMRI datasets for deep learning. Data permutation allows for the generation of more training data in order to expand datasets. This not only prevents overfitting in deep learning but also makes the model more robust. Figure 3 shows the overall framework of the proposed method. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the proposed framework largely consists of three sequential steps as follows. First, all planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) are used in the training dataset, rather than individual planes. These three twodimensional planes are obtained from the 3D sMRI by permutation. Second, outlier pixels for the slices are removed on the histogram. The range of pixel intensities is divided into 10 sub-parts and the pixels belong to the first and last decile are removed. To use more informative slices for training in the AD classification, entropy-based slice selection using the histograms, with the outliers removed, is performed. Finally, AlexNet is fine-tuned using the dataset augmented by the proposed method. Key characteristic of our method is that all planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) of the sMRI scan are used for training, instead of using individual planes. Combining all of the planes in training improves the overall performance, which is well demonstrated in Sect. 4. In addition, multiple slices for each plane in the training dataset are used for the AlexNet training. In this stage, our key idea is to use image entropy for appropriate slice selection for the training datasets. In general, it is known that the entropy of an image represents the information of the image and can be calculated based on the histogram (i.e., probability density function of pixels) [31] . In our analysis, the slices with higher entropy values have more brain tissue area and hippocampus located at relative medium position in each MRI plane, while bone and skull are mainly observed for slices with lower entropy values, which are located at the edge of scan. However, image entropy might be misleading if many noisy pixels in the sMRI are included. Therefore, the entropy values of the images for slice selection are calculated after the noisy pixels are removed. Noisy pixels are primarily due to scanner variation, where artifacts and outlier pixel intensities can be introduced due to extremely high or low pixel intensity [29] . Figure 4 shows intensity histograms of the original sMRIs from the different planes and slices. As shown in Fig. 4 , a significant portion of the pixels occur around zero intensity, which is where most noisy pixels are observed. In addition, noisy pixels are also located in the tail of the histogram \nwhere -(d), -(f) respectively. The red bars in Fig. 5-(a) , -(c) and -(e) represent the outlier intensity. Once the outlier pixels are removed, the entropy values are computed to select the more informative slice as the training data. For an image (a single slice), the entropy can be calculated after normalize the outlier-removed histograms shown in Fig. 5-(b) , -(d) and -(f). The entropy provides a measure of information in a slice. Hence, if the slices are sorted in terms of entropy, the slices with the higher entropy values can be considered as the most informative images. The entropy of an individual image is calculated as\nThe H k is the entropy of the k-th slice, p i,k is the probability of occurrence value of the i-th pixel intensity in the k-th slice and is computed as"}, {"section_title": "of pixels at i-th intensity Total # of pixels in the k-th slice", "text": "The probability in (3) can be obtained from the histogram used for noisy and outlier pixel removal as described above. Using highly informative images for training improves the system robustness, which is verified in Sect. 4. It can be observed that the images with higher entropy have more areas of tissue. To demonstrate this observation, Fig. 6 shows images of different slices in the axial plane of a sMRI scan. More brain tissue areas are observed in the 70-th, 88-th, and 100-th slices with medium indices, which are located at a central position in the sMRI scan, compared to in slices with lower or higher indices. In contrary, in slices with lower and higher indices [ Fig. 6 (a)-(c) ], the sMRI slices have a greater proportion of bone and skull, compared to slices that are located in relatively medium positions [ Fig. 6 (d)-(f) ]; this indicates that for AD classification, the first, 40-th, and 130-th slices are less informative than the 70-th, 88-th, and 100-th slices. Figure 7 shows the histograms of slices with different locations. The Fig. 7 (a) -(c) represents histograms of slices at the border of the sMRI scan (start or end, i.e., first, 40-th, and 130-th slices), while Fig. 7 (d)-(f) shows histograms of the central slices (70-th, 88-th, and 100-th slices). The entropy values for each slice are also shown in Fig. 7 . The slices at the center of the sMRI scan have higher entropy compared to the slices at the edge of the scan. To improve the overall classification performance, more informative slices (with the maximum area of brain tissue) in terms of entropy values were selected to train AlexNet.\nwhere Q is l number of the most informative slices selected based on entropy and s n is the total number of slices in each plane of sMRI. In the proposed method, the value of l is set to 10."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The experiments were performed using an Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU. The Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (Sgdm) algorithm was used to find optimal parameters, with a momentum value of 0.9. An initial learning rate value of 10 \u22124 , a mini batch size of 128 and split ratio for the training and test data of 0.8 were set for the experiment. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision metrics were used as evaluation metrics and are defined as (5)- (8) where TP is the true positive value and represents the number of cases (or subjects) correctly identified as AD, FP is the false positive value and represents the number of cases incorrectly identified as AD, TN is the true negative value and represents the number of cases correctly identified as NC, FN is the false negative value and represents the number of cases incorrectly identified as NC.\nIt should be noted that in all experiments, we adopted \"hold-out cross-validation\" approach [30] for the evaluation and comparison of classification results [i.e., evaluation metric scores defined from (5) to (8)]. In our evaluation, by using random partition with a particular split ratio [30] , we constructed a training image set, as well as a test image set. The classification results from 10 independent runs of the aforementioned random partition were averaged. This guarantees stable evaluation and comparison between different classification methods. Table 3 shows the classification performance of the proposed method. An accuracy of 95.35% is achieved on the OASIS dataset, for which binary classification was performed, for AD and NC. The number of training and testing images, each corresponding to 9,984 and 2,496, respectively, were randomly constructed using a split ratio of 0.8. The values for the sensitivity, precision, and specificity of the proposed method were 90.44%, 96.91%, and 90.39%, respectively, on the OASIS dataset. For the ADNI dataset, evaluating images with magnetic field intensities of 1.5T and 3T, classification accuracies were 97.78% and 98.53%, respectively, for the binary classification. For the ternary classification (AD, MCI, and NC), the accuracy achieved was 95.19% and 96.73% on the 1.5T and 3T scans, respectively. The number of training and testing images for the 1.5T and 3T datasets were 49,020 and 12,255, and 8,397 and 2,099, respectively, via a random partition with split ratio of 0.8. The performance of the proposed method on the ADNI dataset with respect to sensitivity, precision, and specificity was 96.32%, 99.4%, and 97.78%, respectively, for the binary classification, and 95.77%, 98.69%, and 95.19%, respectively, for the ternary classification, with the 1.5T magnetic strength. The sensitivity, precision, and specificity values with the 3T magnetic strength on the ADNI dataset were 96.68%, 99.40%, and Table 3 Classification results of the proposed algorithm on the OASIS and ADNI datasets. Note that all evaluation metric scores reported here were averaged over 10 independent runs of \"hold-out crossvalidation\" [30] . In the rest of the paper, if not stated otherwise, this evaluation approach was used in all of the following classification results. 97.78% for the binary classification, and 97.67%, 99.06%, and 96.73%, for the ternary classification, respectively.\nIn order to investigate the impact of the outlier removal and entropy-based slice selection described in Sect. 3, an experiment was performed only with AlexNet, and was simply performed without the proposed outlier removal and entropy-based slice selection. Table 4 shows the experimental results with AlexNet alone. First, additional slices using the combined planes (all plane used as an input to the AlexNet) for training led to slightly better accuracy (an increase of about 2%), compared with using individual planes, as shown in Table 4 . An accuracy of 81.33% was achieved with the combined planes, while an average accuracy of 79.65% was achieved when individual planes were used for training, which indicates that combining all planes in the proposed method for training helped to increase the classification accuracy. Secondly, if the outlier removal and entropy-based selection scheme is not used with AlexNet, the accuracy of the classification was significantly degraded, as shown in the first, second, third, and fourth rows of the accuracy column in Table 4 . As shown in Table 4 , the overall proposed scheme with the data combination, outlier removal and entropy-based slice selection shows a significantly higher classification accuracy, up to \u223c15%, compared to those obtained using only AlexNet. From the results of Table 4 , it is noted that a simple utilization of a deep learning approach such as AlexNet does not lead to high performance in classification accuracy if the additional scheme with data permutation is not applied.\nThe Fig. 8 shows the performance both with and without outlier removal in the proposed method. As described in Sect. 3, ten slices are selected based on the entropy values of the outlier-removed slices for each orientation and fed into AlexNet. As shown in Fig. 8 , the accuracy with outlier removal is improved from 92.58% to 95.35% on the OASIS dataset. The selection of slices after removing the outlier pixels resulted in an improved accuracy of the model.\nComparison in classification accuracy between the proposed method and eight state-of-the-art methods are shown in Table 5 . Note that for a fair and stable comparison, classification accuracies obtained for our method were obtained using \"hold-out cross-validation\" with a split ratio of 0.8 [30] . We can see that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches in classification accuracy on both the OASIS and ADNI datasets. The proposed method shows higher (better) classification accuracies ranging from 3% to 18%, compared to the previous methods developed by Varma [7] , Yudong [8] , Jha [5] and Zhang [9] on OASIS dataset. In addition, performance improvements ranging from 3%-15% are achieved compared to the methods proposed by Zhang [6] , Liu [12] , Gupta [10] , Payan [11] , Alexander [13] , Aderghal [14] , Aderghal [15] and Ortiz [16] on ADNI dataset. The overall improvement of the proposed method relative to other conventional methods is shown in Fig. 9 , in terms of the error rates percentage (%), which can be calculated by subtracting the accuracy from one hundred percent, and which represents the fraction of samples that were misclassified. In Fig. 9 , misclassification error rates for the conventional methods and the method proposed here are illustrated with black bars. As shown in Fig. 9 (a)-(b) , the error rate of the proposed method is significantly reduced, on both the OASIS and ADNI datasets, respectively. The error reduction rates (red bars) are also illustrated in Fig. 9 . Compared to Varma [7] , the error reduction rate of the proposed method is about 80%, which is significantly higher than the other conventional methods on the OASIS dataset, while there was a 93% improvement for the proposed system with respect to Alexander [13] on the ADNI dataset. From the Table 5 and Fig. 9 , we conclude that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy and misclassification error.\nFrom the above experimental results, it can be concluded that the proposed approach with combined use of \"AlexNet\" and \"the data permutation\" outperforms the classical machine learning methods in AD classification because of spatial correlation features generated by using localized convolution kernels in CNN and more informative slice selection that train AlexNet more effectively. Since image features extracted from the sMRI scans are fed into different classifiers in classical machine learning schemes, they show limited performance in classification accuracy. Methods for AD classification [11] , [12] , [18] are based on a deep neural network approach and use a single layer of CNN or trains a new model with limited data. In spite of using the CNN structure [11] , [12] , [18] , they also show lower accuracy in AD classification. In contrast, the proposed method uses five layers of CNN for determining optimal features. The multiple CNN layers in the proposed model extract complicated pattern features from the sMRI scans, which allows improved accuracy in the diagnosis of AD.\nThe methods used [13] - [17] only hippocampus, sub portion of brain as an input whenever other areas of brain also important for determination of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the use of deep learning in the proposed method, the data permutation scheme, including the combination of multiple orientation slices, outlier removal, and entropybased slice selection, contributes to greatly enhance the accuracy in the AD classification."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, a novel data permutation method is proposed, which improves the AD classification performance of AlexNet.
