While the 1986 cohort was the largest since 1976, the number still falls decidedly short of the peak reached in 1973, when 33,755 research doctorates were earned. Moreover, the U.S.-citizen component of the class of 1986 continued a decline that began in the 1970s. Selected statistics from the 1986 Survey of Earned Doctorates are highlighted in this report, as are trend data on Ph.D.s from the comprehensive Doctorate Records File (DRF). Frequently requested data--trends in broad field data and tic demographic characteristics of Ph.D.s--are presented here. Also featured are data on sources of support in graduate school, time-to-degree completion, and postgraduation plans of these new Ph.D.s. The report's special section focuses on within-field differences; the seven broad fields are broken out into 30 cluster fields to examine once again recipients' demographic variables, sources of supper's', time-to-degree, and postgraduation plans. Reporting only at the broad field level may miss interesting comparisons that emerge from a finer level of disaggregation; at the worst, it may overlook countertrends. As an example of the former, teasing out the data uncovered similarities among doctorates in the clusters of chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical engineering--similarities that may have gone unnoticed had the discussion been generalized to broad fields of physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering. Additionally, the traditional clustering of health sciences within life sciences obscures dissimilarities between health scientists and other natural scientists, and the clustering of economics within social sciences obscures the strong similarities between economists and natural scientists. Finally, reporting only the recent increase in the broad field of physical sciences would have eclipsed the rather sizeable decrease occurring in the mathematics cluster. Last year's special section focused on women and minority U.S. doctorate recipients. There have been few changes in their distributions from 1985 to 1986. The largest increase was in the proportion of women among American doctorates; they rose from 39.1 to 40.9 percent in 1986. The percentage of U.S. black recipients showed the greatest decline, from 4.0 to 3.6 percent, the smallest percentage of U.S. blacks since 1974. "}, {"section_title": "TRENDS IN THE NUMBER OF DOCTORATES", "text": "The 31,770 research doctorates earned in 1986 topped the number earned in any other year of the 1977-1986 decade. In that 10-year period, the number of degrees was remarkably stable year to year, and the 1986 figure is but 1.8 percent higher than in 1985. Nonetheless, this small change represents the widest variance from the decade's average of 31,277 Ph.D.s per annum. When the frame of reference is enlarged to look at trends since 1960, the stability of the past decade is even more remarkable (see Table A, below, and Figure 1, page 3). In the late 1950s, the number of doctorate recipients grew annually by 5 percent. In the 1960s, the rate of growth in doctorate degrees doubled, then tripled. In the early 1970s, the growth rate slowed, reached the 1973 peak, then reversed direction in 1974 and finally sabilized in 1977. When the total number of degrees is disaggregated into seven broad fields, the decade's pattern of stability virtually disappears (see Table B, page 4). Doctorates in the natural sciences and engineering increased, with engineering in particular experiencing rapid growth. Doctorates in humanities declined the most, falling 36 percent since 1973. The numbers of doctorates in education and in social sciences also dropped: both fields had their peaks in 1976, and in 1986 they had fewer recipients by 14.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively. "}, {"section_title": "I 4", "text": "Citizenshi: Status In the last 25 years, the citizenship composition of the doctorate cohort changed significantly (see Table C, page 6). The most dramatic changes were in the proportions of U.S. citizens and temporary visa-holders: U.S. citizens declined from 85.6 percent in 1962 to 72.3 percent in 1986, whereas temporary residents increased from 10.8 to 16.6 percent of the doctorates. (The proportion of permanent residents increased slightly from 2.4 to 4.5 percent. The remaining 6.6 percent of doctorates did not report their citizenship status.) Most of the shift occurred in the last 10 years. While the number of temporary visa-holders increased in all fields, the growth was most pronounced among engineers and physical scientists. The temporary status of doctorate recipients may be an issue for long-range planning because relatively fewer of these recipients remain in the U.S. after completion of their degrees and because their particular status is at times dependent on the state of this nation's international relations and immigration policies. The percentage of temporary residents who reported on the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) that they intended to remain in the U.S. following graduation was much lower than that of U.S. citizens and permanent residents (35.6 percent versus 92.4 and 74.5 percent). However, because these figures were derived from that component of the cohort who reported definite postgraduation plans (about two-thirds of the recipients), data on the final thiri would be helpful to illuminate whether temporary visa-holders leave th. U.S. following tkzeipt of the doctorate degree. Additional information on the location of postdoctoral activity of the other third of recipients is available through the biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), whose most recelit data are from 1985. The third of 1983 SED respondents who did not report postgraduation location were matched against the 1985 SDR. (A two-year gap was chosen to allow for expiration of students' temporary visas.) The SDR data on recipients who did not report location on the SED survey show the following with a U.S. location: 97.8 percent of U.S. citizens, 96.5 percent of permanent visa-holders, and 51.3 percent of temporary visa-holders. Along with data from Table D  (page 7) and Appendix A, Table 5 (pages 56-57), the picture emerges that between one-half to two-thirds of temporary visa-holders do not remain in the U.S. following the receipt of the degree. Thus, the growth trends noted above in engineering and physical sciences may change to flat trends. To illustrate, in 1977 there were 4,379 Ph.D.s earned in the physical sciences; by 1986 the number had grown to 4,808. Of the 1977 group, 1,554 U.S. and permanent-resident physical scientists reported that they had definite employment commitments in the U.S. They were joined by 50 temporary visa-holders, bringing the total to 1,604. In 1986, the comparable numbers were 1,395 U.S. citizen: and permanent residents and 180 temporary visa-holders, a total of 1,575. The decline in the number of U.S. and permanent residents getting Ph.D.s does not seem to be tied to demographic trends. On the contrary, in the last 25 years changes in the size of the relevant population pool for doctorate recipients differNd considerably from changes in the numbers of new Ph.D.s. Because the median age at Ph.D. for U.S. and permanent residents was 33.8 years in 1986, a relevant population pool is the group of 25 -to 34-year-olds with 16 or more years of education, whose usual place of residence is the United States (this pool includes permanent visa-holders but not temporary ones).    1962 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 Year NOTES: Index year = 1962. Comparable U.S. population = 25-to 34-year-olds having 16 or more years  "}, {"section_title": "Male and Female Doctorate Recipients", "text": "In addition to changes in citizenship composition, the trends in degree production among men and women also diverged during the 1977-1986 period (see Table B, page 4, and Figure 3, page 9). In many fields, there was a reduction in the number of men earning Ph.D.s and a corresponding gain in the number of women. By 1986, women earned 35.4 percent of the doctorate degrees from U.S. universities. Despite their advance, however, women continued to be underrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering. While U.S. women have been entering these fields in greater numbers, their presence has been overshadowed by the concurrent growth in the number of foreign recipients. These cohorts of non-U.S. citizens, especially temporary visa-holders, are more predominantly male than their American counterparts, and they are tending to enter the science and engineering pool at a faster rate than U.S. women. A Ph.D. \"gap\" was created in the 1970s when the number of American male recipients declined; the gap was partially filled by American women, but to a greater extent it was filled by foreign citizens. Moreover, the gap-filling role played by these two groups was not played uniformly across these fields. One researcher has found a large, negative correlation (r = -.79) between the fraction of women and the fraction of foreign citizens in engineering and the three broad fields of science.3 U.S. women were closer to parity with U.S. men--at 40.9 percent-than were all women vis-a-vis all men. This finding held true in all of the seven broad fields; for example, among all engineers women were 6.7 percent, but among U.S. engineers women were 10.1 percent. Engineering was the single field in which both men and women increased their numbers over the decade; at the same time, women enhanced their proportion of engineering Ph.D.s from 2.8 percent in 1977 to 6.7 percent in 1986. Humanities was the single field in which the number of doctorates earned by both sexes declined. The reduction was smaller among women, however, and their downward trend was irregular: in fact, there were more women doctorates in humanities in 1986 than in the previous year. As a result of the sexes' differing rates of decline, the percentage of women humanists increased from 36.4 percent in 1977 to 45.2 percent in 1986. Education was the only one of the seven broad fields in which the number of women exceeded the number of men. (There were also more women than men in some non-major fields, to be discussed in the special section below.) In 1986, women earned 54.6 percent of the education doctorates. Nonetheless, the number of women was less than the peak reached in 1983, when women became the majority of these degree earners. In terms of types of education degrees, women received slightly more Ph.D.s than men (49.5 percent versus 47.4 percent) and slightly fewer Ed.D.s (47 percent versus 48.4 percent).    1976-1986. 9 Racial and Ethnic Status The racial composition of new Ph.D. cohorts also changed between 1977 and 1986. Table E (page 11) displays the number of doctorate recipients by gender, racial/ethnic group, and citizenship status, [1977][1978][1979][1980][1981][1982][1983][1984][1985][1986]. The smallest group getting Ph.D.s has consistently been American Indians; the largest has consistently been whites. In between, the order from low to high was: Hispanic, black, Asian. While the sequence of these groups has remained the same, their sizes have changed. Hispanics and, especially, Asians have increased their shares of doctorates earned; blacks and whites have decreased their shares. The groups also display differences in their field distributions, and Table F (page 12) shows those differences for U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients in 1986. The decline in numbers of black and white Ph.D.s occurred primarily within the T citizen stratum. The most significant decline was among U.S. blacks. The number of black American doctorates dropped from 1,116 to 820, a reduction of 26.5 percent, which was not evenly distributed between the sexes. The number of Ph.D.s awarded to T.J.S. black males decreased by more than half, whereas the number awarded to U.S. black women rose 15.5 percent. As evidenced in Table F, American blacks of both sexes tended to cluster in the field of education. In addition, the number of white American doctorates declined. Their 11 percent reduction was also a result of losses among male recipients, which were only partially offset by increases on the part of white women. On the other hand, important gains were made by other groups. Chief among them were Asians, especially those on temporary visas. In 1977, Asians earned 6.9 percent of the doctorates, and by 1986 they earned 12.8 percent. Also, by 1986 Asians had become the largest racial group (54.7 percent) of temporary-resident doctorates; whites had been the biggest group in 1977. In addition, Asian Americans also increased their participant share, from 1.4 percent of U.S.-citizen doctorates in 1977 to 2.3 percent in 1986. Table F shows that Asian Americans were largely concentrated in the life sciences. The number of Hispanic Ph.D.s also increased in every citizenship stratum, especially among the temporary-visa group. Hispanics earned 2.4 percent of the doctorates in 1977 and 3.6 percent in 1986. Much of the growth among the U.S. Hispanic group was attributable to a rise in the number of vvomem doctorates: by 1986, U.S. Hispanic women were at near parity with their male counterparts (47.3 percent). Like U.S. blacks, U.S. Hispanics tended to cluster in the education field. Finally, the numbers and proportions of American Indians went up over the decade, peaking at 100 in 1986 (virtually all are U.S. citizens, although occasionally cohorts will include Canadian and Latin American Indians). Because their numbers have always been quite low, even small variations can change the picture quite dramatically. For example, in 1985, 58.1 percent of American Indian recipients were women, but in 1986 the balance shifted, and 59 percent were men. Despite the irregular trend, it does appear that the number of American Indians receiving doctorates is gradually inc.reasing (0.2 percent in 1977; 0.3 percent in 1986).   6   23  20  7  26  9  Men  58   4   5   11   12   6   16   4  Women   41   4   1   12  8   1   10  5   Asian   ri   Total  Men   527  347   107   84   80   74   152   92   69   40   30   10   58  25   31   22  Women  180  23  6  60  29   20   33  9   Black  Total  820  25  14   64   163   70   421  63  Men  321   18  10  28  70  28   141   26  Women  499   7   4  36   93   42  280   37   Hispanic  Total  567   53  25  72  130   76   188  23  Men  299   41   22  39  75  38  68   16   Women  268   12   3   33  55   38   120  7   White  Total   20,538  2,714   1,224  3,958   4,081  2,496  4,820   1,246  Men  12,257  2,253  1,102  2,507  2,164   1,366   2,114   751  Women  8,281  461  122  1,451   1,916  1,130  2,706  495 Sources of Support in Graduate Schcn!"}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Since 1977, item 17 of the Survey of Earned Doctorates has asked recipients to designate their primary sources of support from a list of 26 sources categorized along four main lines: personal, university-related, federal, and \"other.\" Within these categories, there are different mechanisms. For example, personal or self-support may come from one's own earnings, spouse's earnings, family contributions, or loans. University support comes usually through research assistantships or teaching assistantships but may also be fellowships or work-study. Federal support comes through fellowships or traineeships from various agencies, such as NSF, NIH, and the Department of Education. In the \"other\" category are a variety of sources, such as Ford Foundation fellowships and business support. This last category accounts for the smallest proportion of the total primary financial support, about 6 percent. Doctorate recipients evidenced different patterns of financial support among the seven broad fields. In addition, the patterns shifted somewhat over time, the most significant change being an erosion of federal support (see Table G). A decade ago, 16.1 percent of new recipients reported that the federal government was their primary supporter. In the 1980s, however, the government began to shrink its role in supporting doctorate recipients, and almost all the agencies, except NSF and the Defense Department, pulled back on the number of students they supported. Thus, by 1986, only 7.2 percent of the recipients reported the federal government as their major support source. As a consequence, the number of recipients relying on either self-support or university-related support :7-Teased, and field differences widened. In 1977, a majority of doctorate recipients in physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences--and a plurality in the humanities--reported the university as their major support source. In addition, 17.4 percent of these Ph.D.s reported federal funding as their major support. However, as federal support began to dry up, the pattern changed. Table G shows that by 1985, a larger share of physical scientists and engineers relied on university support, but i.i ::ontrast, a larger share of life scientists and humanists reported personal sources of support. Moreover, the plurality of humanists, no longer supported by the university, instead relied on self-support. The decline in federal support also occurred among social scientists (22.6 percent reported federal funding in 1977, versus 6.7 percent in 1986). In the earlier year, social scientists were evenly split between their reliance on self-support and university-related support; each source was reported by 35.8 percent of new doctorates. By 1986, the loss in federal support was countered by a 13.9-point growth in the self-supporting share, while the share relying on university support rose by only 2.6 points. In the remaining broad fields of education and professional fields, recipients reported personal sources by a wide margin in 1977 and by a still wider margin in 1986. The 9.1 percent that had primary reliance on federal support in 1977 had dwindled to 2.7 percent by 1986. For education doctorates, the decline in federal support coincided with a decline in the rate of university-related sources, which resulted in a greater share depending on self-support (from 66.2 percent in 1977 to 79.0 percent in 1986)."}, {"section_title": "Median Time-to-Degree", "text": "The time it takes to earn a doctorate degree, measured from the date of the first baccalaureate, steadily increased over the 1976-1986 period. At the earlier year, the median total time-to-degree was 8.6 years. In 1986, it was 10.4 years. Additional variation was observed when the data were disaggregated by field. For example, recipients in the natural sciences and engineering completed their degrees more quickly than the doctorates in other fields, with physical scientists taking the shortest total completion time--7.3 years in 1986. The recipients with the longest total time-to-degree were educators--a median 15.7 years in 1986, more than double the completion time for physical scientists. Figure 4, page 15, depicts the rising trends, the hierarchy of fields, and the differences across fields. Alternatively, time-lapse can be measured in terms of years registered for the Ph.D. (see Figure 5, page 15). Like total time, registered time-lapse also increased over the 1976-1986 period, but its increase was much less--from 6.0 to 6.8 years overall. In parallel fashion, registered time increased in each of the seven broad fields. However, the hierarchy of low to high was different from that for total time. (The reader should be advised to note the differences in scaling on the y-axes of Figures 4 and 5 to avoid misleading comparisons of slopes.) Recipients with the shortest registered completion time were engineers--5.9 years in 1986. Recipients with the longest registered time were humanists--8.2 years in 1986. The difference between total time and registered time was perhaps most pronounced in the field of education. For educators, the median total time-to-degree in 1986 was 15.7 years, but the median registered time was only half that--7.8 years. This difference reflects the practice of many education doctorates to work for a number of years after earning a baccalaureate and before beginning their doctorate program.   Status and Type of Postgraduation Plans As discussed above, the Survey of Earned Doctorates is administered at about the time that recipients complete all of their degre, requirements. It is at that time, then, that the answer to item 19 applies--i.e., \"What is the status of your current postgraduate plans?\" The new Ph.D.s can designate that they are reti .. 'ng to predoctorate employment or have made another commitment; these responses ah, categorized as \"definite.\" Conversely, recipients may specify that they are negotiating with an organization(s), are seeking a position but have no specific prospects, or \"other\"; these selections are characterized as \"seeking.\" The trend in status of plans has been generally stable since 1976 (although the special section, Field Differences, takes a longer view and shows marked changes occurring in the late 1960s to early 1970s). As seen in Table H (page 17) 67.6 percent of new doctorates had definite plans in 1976, not markedly different from the 66.3 percent in 1986. Where variation occurred was among fields. The field with the biggest share of recipients with definite plans in 1986 was professional and other (72.4 percent). This figure is lower than in 1976, when 77.0 perceat had definite plans. The field with the lowest percentage with definite plans was humanities (57.2 percent). In contrast to the reduction observed for professional degree-earners, the humanists' figure is higher than in 1976, when the parallel percentage was 54.9 percent. Recipients were also asked to specify whether their postgraduation plans involved employment or study, and here is where a more noticeable change took place. In 1976, 76.7 percent of new Ph.D.s planned to be employed. By 1986, that figure had declined to 69.0 percent. Correspondingly, study plans were reported by 16.6 percent of respondents in 1976 and by 22.0 percent in 1986. (The remaining recipients did not report their plans.) Again, Table H displays field differences. The highest share of doctorates planning employment after graduation has consistently been in the field of education; in 1986, the figure was 89.0 percent. The greatest percentage planning postdoctoral study was in life sciences; the figure i.. 1986 was 51.9 Percent. Life sciences was also the field in which the great;st shift occurred between employment and study plans. (See the special section for within-field differences and more extended trend data )"}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Study Decisions", "text": "While most of the items on the survey questionnaire pertained to objective data, two asked for subjective responses. First, item 21A asked recipients with postdoctoral study plans, \"What was the most important reason for taking a postdoctoral appointment?\" Second, for recipients who considered further study but who chose employment, item 22D asked, \"Why did you decide against the postdoctoral?\" As it turned out, the proportion of recipients taking postdoctorates varied widely from field to field, but the reasons for or against postdoctoral study clustered around certain responses. To bee with, few recipients outside the science and engineering fields-8 percent or less--had postdoctoral study plans, in part because few such opportunities exist in fields where R&D funding is low. For this reason, the tables showing postdoctoral study decisions (Tables I and J, pages 19 and 20) break the science fields outmore finely than the other broad fields. The field with the greatest percentage of doctorates wita study plans was biosciences, particularly biochemistry (66.1 percent and 78.5 percent, respectively). Men and women were about as likely to have planned postdoctoral study in these fields. The next highest percentages were in chemistry and physics/astronomy, where approximately half of the recipients had study plans.  The most typical reason respondents provided for deciding to take a study appointment was to obtain aC.ditional research experience in their doctoral field (see Table I). Between 40 and 70 percent of the respondents in every field--including the nonsciences--chose this as the most important reason. For many scientists, the complex nature of research has required the acquisition of specialized skills,4 so the explanation of wanting additional experience makes sense. In most of the natural sciences, the second most frequently reported reason was the opportunity to work with a particular scientist or research group; this consideration is also relevant to the development of specialized knowledge. Together, these two reasons were cited by 73.3 percent of the doctorate recipients who planned postdoctoral study in 1986. On the other hand, the second most frequent reason reported by both chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D.s was to switch into a different field of research. (In addition, more than a third of these recipients who had definite employment commitments also switched out of their degree subfield, although most commitments were made within the same broad field.) Finally, for both social scientists and humanists, the second most frequent reason provided for choosing a postdoctorate was that they could not obtain a desired type of employment position. (Earlier discussion on trends in numbers of doctorates noted that the number of recipients had been declining recently in both of these fields; the absence of desirable employment may be a factor in this decline.) Of the recipients who made employment plans, a fraction reported that they had seriously considered pursuing postdoctoral study but had decided against it (19.7 percent; see Table J). In every field the most frequent reason for deciding against the postdoctorate was that respondents had more attractive employment opportunities (40.6 percent overall). While this consideration seems to contradict the need to obtain more specialized skills, note that it is based on a minority of recipients who said that they had considered undertaking postdoctoral study. As for the second most frequent reason against an appointment, recipients in two-thirds of the fields stated that no postdoctorals were available; mathematicians, more than any other Ph.Ds, reported such unavailability (37.5 percent). Inadequate stipends were also frequently reported as deterrents. Only computer scientists (20 percent) and chemists (15.8 percent) reported their second most frequent reason as little or no benefit being derived from a postdoctoral appointment. In the case of computer scientists, this finding was not surprising, given the low proportion who wanted postdoctorals (11.3 percent). In the case of chemists, however, nearly half (47.2 percent) had planned for postdoctoral study, so deciding against further study on the basis that it would provide little or no benefit was not expected. Note also that Appendix A, Table 2, pages 48-53, shows the percentage of recipients with definite study plans, by field and sex, and that Appendix A, Table 5, pages 56-57, shows the percentage by race and citizenship. Overall, men were more likely than women 14.9 *Item 21A asked respondents with postdoctoral study plans to check one of the following as the most important reason for taking a postdoctoral: -\"To obtain additional research experience in my doctoral field\" -\"To work with a particular scientist or research group\" -\"To switch into a different field of research\" \"Could not obtain the desired type of employment position\" -\"Other reason\" *Item 22D asked those with employment plans if they seriously considered postdoctoral study; and, if yes, why did they decide against the postdoctoral: -\"No postdoctoral appointment available\" -\"Felt that I would derive little or no benefit from a postdoctoral appointment\" -\"Postdoctoral available but stipend inadequate\" -\"Had more attractive employment opportunity\" \"Other\" 20 31. ."}, {"section_title": "FIELD DIFFERENCES", "text": "Thus far, differences among the seven broad fields have been touched on in terms of their demographic composition, sources of support, time-to-degree, and postgraduation plans. In this section, these broad fields are broken into 30 selected \"cluster\" fields: 20 in the sciences and 10 in the non-sciences. Demographic trends, time-to-degree patterns, and trends in postgraduation plans are here reviewed for each of these clusters starting in 1958, the year the Survey of Earned Doctorates began. In addition, comparisons of 1977 and 1986 data on major sources of support are made."}, {"section_title": "Demographic Trends", "text": "Appendix Table C, pages 66-71, displays the demographic trends at 2-year intervals beginning in 1958. Doctorate production overall grew in the first half of this period, peaking in 1973. Thereafter, production declined for a short while, rebounded, and then leveled off. By 1986, the number of recipients overall was nearly 6 percent lower than in 1973, yet different production trends emerged when the data were disaggregated by cluster field and demographic characteristic. For example, in 1986 the number of Ph.D.s in physical sciences was 8 percent less than in 1973, and the number in mathematics (which is under the physical sciences umbrella) was 40 percent less. As noted above, the relevance of new numbers is dependent on the size of the existing field as well as the demand for replacement. Demographic disparities were also observed within fields. For example, women in the humanities approached parity with men in 1986, when they earned 45.2 percent of the Ph.D.s. However, within-field differences were more than apparent: women received only 20.2 percent of the new doctorates in philosophy, versus 58.4 percent in English and American language and literature. Another type of difference was within engineering, in which the average percentage of temporary residents was 40.6 percent. Nonetheless, the proportion of temporary visa-holders ranged from a low of 36.8 percent in chemical engineering to a high of 48.8 percent in civil engineering. Finally, broad field data can also be compared with within-field differences. One such interesting comparison is between the percentage of blacks earning Ph.D.s in the sciences and engineering (2.7 percent in 1986) with the percentage earning doctorates in science teaching fields (12.8 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Physical Sciences", "text": "Size of cohort. Among the physical sciences, recent trends in size of cohort appeared similar to the overall pattern described above. The growth evidenced in the 1980s, however, disguised the fact that the cluster field of mathematics never steamed the decline that began in the 1970s. The 730 mathematics doctorates earned in 1986 were other aoctorate field, whereas whites were the least concentrated. The largest share of Asiaas and the smallest share of whites were in chemical engineering. As in physical sciences, blacks were underrepresented. The highest proportion of black engineers--3.5 percent--was in civil engineering. Citizenship. Whereas the 1986 class of engineers was nearly the size of the 1971 cohort, a crucial difference was that only 40 percent of the 1986 cohort were U.S. citizens, compared with 75 percent of the 1971 cohort. In civil engineering, the presence of U.S. citizens was particularly low--31.5 percent. Mechanical engineering was also low in the number of U.S. citizens (38.2 percent). The subfield with the highest share of Americans was chemical engineering--46 percent; this subfield also had the highest percentage of women, which recalls the large, negative correlation observed between women and foreign citizens, discussed earlier (page 8).\nStatus of plans. Most fields experienced a decline in definite commitments between 1968 and 1974, and physical sciences was no different. However, between 1974 and 1986, two clusters increased their percemages with definite plans: mathematics and physics/astronomy. Chemists had the biggest share with definite plans in 1986 --71.6 percent. Type of plans. As shown earlier in the general section, postdoctoral study plans were unevenly distributed among the physical science clusters. Large shares of recipients in physics/astronomy (51.7 percent) and chemistry (47.2 percent) planned to obtain study appointments after graduation, primarily for additional research experience rather than because of job shortages (see Table I, page 19). On the other hand, computer scientists had a large share planning employment--79.2 percent--many of whom were going into the industrial sector (31.6 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Life Sciences", "text": "Size of cohort. The number of doctorates in the life sciences climbed to its highest level in 1985--5,759 doctorates--and was substantially the same in 1986, when there were 5,720 recipients. Nonetheless, the number of biological scientists had already peaked to date: microbiologists and t acteriologists peaked in 1970, biochemists in 1980, other bioscientists in 1982. Moreover, there were 100 fewer agriculture recipients in 1986 than in 1985. Health scientists increased, however, and peaked in 1986 with 772 Ph.D.s. Gender. In health sciences, women have dramatically increased their percentage, and their share is the largest of any cluster field, 62 percent. Women earned slightly over a third of the biological science doctorates, the second highest share of all the natural sciences. Race /ethnicity. American Indians earned 0.9 percent of the degrees in health sciences--their largest share of any Ph.D. The shares of blacks and Hispanics within agricultural sciences were relatively high and were the largest the groups had in any of the natural sciences-5.7 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively. Citizenship. Individuals earning degrees in the biological sciences were predominantly American --approximately 80 percent. This was the Americans' largest share of any of the natural science and engineering fields. In contrast with the other life science fields, nearly a third of agricultural Ph.D.s were temporary visa-holders.\nWhen life sciences were disaggregated, health sciences emerged as wholly different from the rest of the science doctorates. In 1977, health scientists comprised the only cluster field that had a plurality of recipients relying pnmarily on federal support. As federal funding closed off, however, self-support became the most frequently reported major source by 1986."}, {"section_title": "Social Sciences", "text": "Size of cohort. Degrees in social sciences peaked at 6,142 in 1981 but dropped 5 percent, to 5,841 doctorates, in 1986. Still, two clusters were larger than in 1981: economics (including econometrics) and clinical psychology (including counseling and school psychology). The political science/international relations cluster fell to its lowest number in 20 years--490, or nearly half the number of doctorates conferred in peak year 1972. Gender. The entire loss of political scientists was made up of male recipients, for the number of female political scientists increased, and their share rose from 10.3 percent in 1972 to 26.9 percent in 1986. Of all the social sciences, economics had, proportionately, the fewest women (19.3 percent). On the other hand, men and women were at parity in psychology, where the number of women increased while the number of men declined. Race /ethnicity. Psychology was also the specialty with the largest presence of white doctorates (about 90 percent). Blacks earned a greater percentage of degrees in political science and international relations than in any other field of science (7.7 percent). Citizenship. Of all the social sciences, economics had the largest presence of temporary residents--31.5 percent. The smallest share of non-U.S. citizens was in psychology, especially clinical psychology.\nAs discussed in the general section, natural scientists and engineers typically replaced federal support with university-related sources, but social scientists had a greater shift toward self-support. The exception to the rule was made by the economists who, like natural scientists, had a greater percentage of recipients shifting to university sources than to personal sources. Most affected by the turn to personal sources were the clinical psychologists, whose self-supporting percentage rose from 46.4 percent in 1977 to 66.8 percent in 1986. This kind of result was not as pronounced for other, generally more research-oriented psychologists, whose self-support rose from 36.4 to 48.6 percent.\nStatus of plans. The social science cluster with the greatest proportion having definite plans in 1986 was economics/econometrics (71.4 percent). The cluster with the lowest percentage of such plans was political science/international relations (57 percent). Type of plans. New doctorates in social sciences have typically had employment plans at the time they received their degrees, but the proportion has dropped from about 88 percent in 1958 to 75 percent in 1986. Economists, however, have substantially maintained the high 1958 rate--their employment plans declined only to 85.4 percent in 1986. Both in status and type of plans, economists tended to resemble natural scientists more than their colleagues in the social sciences. When psychology was disaggregated between the clinical disciplines and the other, generally more academic disciplines, interesting differences appeared. Ph.D.s in the clinical fields consistently had a greater frequency of employment plans than did the psychologists in the more research-oriented fields. Furthermore, the clinicians had different sectoral plans. In 1958, clinicians most frequently planned to work for the government; in 1986, they most often had plans to work in the \"other\" setting, which here refers to elementary and secondary schools. The other psychologists continued to plan to go into academe, although those plans had dropped substa daily, from 45 to 26 percent. Type of plans. While the percentage of humanists planning postgraduate study increased from 2.8 percent in 1958 to 7.9 percent in 1986, the more typical and traditional route for humanists has been to secure employment (81.5 percent had such plans in 1986). This is because there are very few study appointments available: of all the recipients who decided against postdoctoral study, humanists had the second largest share who found no appointment available. Furthermore, doctorates in the humanities, more than doctorates in any other field, by and large planned to go into academe. Doctorates in English had the largest percentage both with employment plans in 1986 (86 percent) and with plans for the academic sector (71.3 percent). Few humanities doctorates planned to work in industry; philosophers had the highest percentage going to the industrial sector, and that was only 7.7 percent. Historians were the most likely humanists to have postgraduate study plans (10.8 percent), most of which involved fellowships."}, {"section_title": "Humanities", "text": "Size of cohort. In 1986, there were 3,461 doctorate humanists. As mentioned earlier, this number represented a decline of 36 percent since the peak reached in 1973. The loss was even greater among doctorates in philosophy (38.8 percent), English and American language and literature (49 percent), foreign languages and literature (51.5 percent), and, especially, history (53.7 percent). The rest of the humanities disciplines did not face such heavy losses. In fact, at least one field grew larger: doctorates in music grew by 36 percent between 1973 and 1986. In addition, there was relative stability among some other large subfields such as linguistics, art history and criticism, and religion. Finally, the addition of theatre as a specialty in 1977 had a slight effect on increasing the number of doctorates conferred in humanities; the increase in 1986 was 2.6 percent. Gender. Women earned 45.2 percent of the humanities doctorates in 1986, approaching parity with men. But when data were disaggregated by cluster field, the pattern diverged. In languages and literature, the number of women exceeded men by nearly 3 to 2. Conversely, in history the ratio of men to women was 2 to 1; in philosophy, it was 4 to 1. These distributions are puzzling, and differences in labor markets among the subfields of humanities fuel the question. Data from a follow-up employment survey of humanities doctorates show that the subfields with the highest unemployment rates were modern languages and literature and classical languages and literature; with the lowest unemployment rates were American history and philosophy. Moreover, doctorates in 23 k' languages and literature had median annual salaries ranging from $32,600 to $34,100, whereas doctorates in history and philosophy had median salaries ranging from $36,100 to $37,300.5 The association of more favorable markets with a larger presence of men in a field would be interesting to pursue. Race /ethnicity. The highest proportion of Hispanics in any doctorate field was in the foreign languages and literature cluster: 18.2 percent, more than five times their overall share of 3.6 percent. Citizenship. Except in foreign languages and literature, the proportion of non-U.S. citizens was quite low. Humanities, like social sciences and education, seems not to attract foreign citizens.\nRecipients in certain subfields of humanities also evidenced differences from the general pattern of support for humanists. Typically, humanists replaced federal support with personal support. However, Ph.D.s in history, philosophy, and foreign languages reported greater percentages with support from university sources in 1986 than in 1977."}, {"section_title": "Education", "text": "Size of cohort. The number of doctorate recipients in education reached its peak at 7,725 in 1976 but fell by 14.5 percent to 6,602 recipients in 1986. Proportionately, most of the decline has been in the science teaching areas, which include science, social science, mathematics, agriculture, and nursing education. The peak in these science teaching specialties was reached in 1972; by 1986 they had declined by 51.3 percent. The decline does not neatly fit the pattern in the actual science fields, for while Ph.D.s in the social sciences and mathematics have indeed been decreasing, degrees in agriculture and nursing have not. Gender. In 1983, the number of women in education exceeded the number of men for the first time, and this phenomenon continued through 1986. Nonetheless, men continued to dominate in the subfield of education administration (see Appendix A, Table 1, page 43). Moreover, men retained their dominant position in science education, although that position appeared to be eroding: in 1986, the science education specialties were 56.7 percent male. Racelethnicity. In education overall. and in science teaching particularly, the proportion of degrees earned by blacks was larger than in any other field. Blacks earned 3.8 percent of all education doctorates in 1986 and 12.8 percent of the degrees in science teaching fields. Citizenship. Science teaching fields also attracted larger shares of non-U.S. citizens, especially temporary residents, than did the remaining fields of education (science teaching's share of temporary residents was 18.5 percent; other teaching, 8.8 percent; nonteaching, 6.0 percent).\nStatus of plans. Education doctorates generally had high percentages with definite commitments (72 percent). However, specialists in the non-science teaching fields had fewer such commitments than their counterparts in this broad field (60 percent). Type of plans. The percentage of educators with study plans was quite small, about 3.5 percent, because so few opportunities for study appointments exist for this field. The nonteaching concentrations and the science teaching fields had the highest proportions of new doctorates planning employment. This trend has been in place since 1958, with only a small erosion in the percentage with employment plans. Employment sectors diverged within the broad field of education. Doctorates in science teaching fields had the greatest percentage planning to enter academe. Far fewer in the nonteaching fields--which include the popular disciplines of education administration and curriculumfmstruc,onplanned academic employment, and over a third intended to work in the \"other\" sector--here, elementary or secondary schools."}, {"section_title": "Professional Fields", "text": "Size of cohort. 1986 was the peak year for doctorates in professional fields. While close to half of these 1,936 Ph.D.s were awarded in business and management, most of the growth was outside the business specialties. Still, the business cluster experienced continued growth, although at a slower rate than the rest of the professional fields. Gender. The share of women in business was 23 percent in 1986: not high, but quite a large increase compared with the approximately 3 percent share attained during the 1958-1972 period. In the other professional fields, women's share was much higher--43.7 percent. Race /ethnicity. Business, more than any field outside the natural sciences and engineering, attracted a large share of Asian degree-earners. Blacks and Hispanics, however, were underrepresented. Citizenship. Of the non-sciences, business and management had the largest share of temporary visa-holders (22.8 percent). The changes in male-female distribution that led to some disciplines becoming predominantly female are shown in Figure 6, below. This figure depicts the typical p. :ern of men's decrease am: women's increase in health sciences, psychology, and education as well as the less prevalent pattern--of decreasing numbers of degrees earned by either sexin languages and literature.

(\"Total time\" measures the period between earning the baccalaureate and earning the doctorate; \"registered time\" is limited to that period a recipient indicates he or she is enrolled in graduate school.) Upward trends are not inevitable progressions, however."}, {"section_title": "Total Time", "text": "Data from the entire survey show the following trend in total time: a gradual increase from 8.4 years in 1958 to 8.9 years in 1961, decreasing to a low of 7.9 years in 1970 and 1971, followed by a steady rise to 1986's median total time of 10.4 years (see Figure 8). Even when data were disaggregated, the phenomenon of lengthening time-lapse occurred in every field (see Table L, page 30). Nonetheless, some fields were more stable than others: doctorates in physics/astronomy, e.g., had the least variable time-lapse line. What is more, recipients in some cluster fields did not always resemble those of other clusters in the same broad field. For example, the time-lapse of health scientists was not in step with time-lapse variations in the other life sciences. Indeed, health scientists did not even follow time-to-degree patterns similar to those of natural scientists. When the 30 cluster fields were divided between the top 15 \"shorter-time\" and the remaining 15 \"longertime\" fields, all of the natural sciences and engineering except health sciences fell into the 15 \"shorter-time\" group. Second, economi( s did not fall into the \"longer-time\" group as did all of the other social-and non-science fields. As with demographic characteristics, both exceptions were further instances of health scientists resembling non-science doctorates and of economists resembling natural scientists in their degree processes. The three subfields with the shortest total time-to-degree (6.5, 6.8, and 7.3 years) were drawn from three different broad fields, but had a single discipline in common: chemistry. These three were chemistry (physical sciences), chemical engineering (engineering), and 11 5 1958 1962 1966 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986    biochemistry (life sciences). These three clusters were also characterized by having high percentages planning postgraduate study. At the other end of the spectrum, the three subfields with the longest time-lapse (14.6, 15.3, and 16.0 years) were all in education: other teaching fields, science teaching fields, and nonteaching fields. The longer time-lapse is due in part to the practice of these recipients not to be registered in school during much of the period between earning their baccalaureates and earning their doctorates."}, {"section_title": "Registered Time", "text": "As noted in the earlier section, recipients' registered time-to-degree was considerably less than their total time-to-degree (see Table M, page 32). Another difference was observed in the 1960s, in which total time-lapse declined, but registered time did not. Instead, it grew modestly: median registered time was 5.3 years in 1958 and 5.5 years in 1970. The fact that registered time was slowly increasing during the 1960s (except 1967-68) suggests that external forces, rather than programmatic changes, were influencing the decrease in total time. The post-Sputnik shift in federal priorities, with increases in R&D support, and the associated build-up of academic employment may have helped to accelerate recipients through the pipeline, by smoothing access and enhancing motivation. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the pattern of increasingly longer time-lapse was as true for registered time as it was for total time, although it was much lower: by 1986, registered time was a median 6.8 years. The steeper slope of total time's increase after 1970 also implies the influence of external forces on degree completion time. When measured in registered time, the subfields with the shortest time-lapse were in engineering and chemistry. Thi finding is consistent with the total time-lapse measure. However, the longest registered time-lapses were all in humanities --history and languages and literatureratf---than in education, which had the longest total time-to-degree."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": ".   In contrast with the decade-long stability in status of postgraduation plans, discussed above, the longer trend line of 1958 to 1986 indicates considerable change (see Figure 9). In 1958, 78.4 percent of recipients were either returning to their predoctorate employment or had made definite conunitmens to work or study; those still seeking or negotiating a position comprised 14.3 percent. The proportion with definite commitments rose in the early to mid-1960s to 83-84 percent, fell in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and then more or less leveled off to the present 66.4 percent. By 1986, the uncommitted share had risen to 24.7 percent. Clearly, the uncommitted share does not translate into an unemployment rate, although the seeking status does appear to result in higher unemployment in the short term. Data from the 1985 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR, described earlier on page 3) can be used to observe differences in unemployment rates between recipients with definite plans versus those who were still seeking a position. Respondents 6 The unsmployment rate is calculated 3S the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but seeking employment. Note that these rates are based on a survey of doctoral scientists, engineers, and humanists whose place of employment is the U.S.; rates for doctorates in education and professional fields or for the non-U.S. labor force may differ. Rates across fields are also quite variable, with humanists reporting higher rates of unemployment and engineers showing zero unemployment.

By 1986, 78.5 percent of biochemists--still triple the average--planned to pursue a postdoctoral study appointment (the majority of these were fellowships). The earlier discussion of postdoctoral study decisions centered on the need to acquire specialized skills, and biochemists were foremost in reporting their desire to switch fields. Moreover, they were the only group not to decide against postgraduate study because of the unavailability of an appointment. Finally, their definite plans for employment were the lowest of any group. The complexity of research and the availability of study appointments for biochemists, together with the seemingly low employment opportunities suggested, conjoin in attracting many persons in this field to postgraduate study."}, {"section_title": "47 Summary", "text": "Disaggregation of the data to the level of cluster fields allowed for comparisons that might otherwise go unobserved. For example, the robust numbers of physical science doctorates as is broad field eclipsed the rather dramatic decline in the number of mathematics degrees in the last 15 years. Moreover, the decline in humanities doctorates belied the relative stability in linguistics, religion, art history, and music. Demographic details also were highlighted. The near-parity of women with men in the humanities was contrasted with men's dominance in the subfields of history and philosophy. The paucity of blacks in the broad fields of science was contrasted with their high proportions in science teaching fields. The 11.5 percent of social science doctorates earned by temporary visa-holders was not evenly distributed: 31.5 percent of economics Ph.D.s were earned by temporary residents in 1986, whereas only 1.3 percent of the clinical psychology degrees went to temporary visa-holders. Support patterns and time-lapses showed considerable variation by field and cluster. The percentage of civil engineers relying on university support, for example, was 20 points lower than that of chemical engineers; the parallel percentage of clinical psychologists was 16 points lower than that of other psychologists. It was also seen that the lengthening of total time-to-degree completion does not inevitably follow an upward trend. In the 1960s, while registered time-to-degree increased medestly, total time-lapse declined, perhaps because of the external labor market pull coupled with federal investment during that period. Since 197.1, an upward slope in time-lapse has developed, both in registered and total time, but the slope of total time-lapse has been much steeper. Trends in postgraduation plans also invited comparisons. Apicultural and health scientists were quite unlike the biological scientists, with whom they are usually grouped. For example, they were much more likely than bioscientists not only to be self-supporting in graduate school but also to plan employment, especially academic employment, following graduation. Another interesting finding had to do with similarities in three clusters involving chemistry-related programs (chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical engineering). Recipients in these clusters were comparable in that they evidenced relatively high percentages of Ph.D.s opting for study appointments, and they had relatively high percentages of recipients with definite plans.

Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 19 and 20 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out at about the time the doctorate is received, these planned activities can be subject to change. However, comparisons with data from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients have shown these data to be a reasonable predictor of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate.8 Postgraduation plans of the doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), or \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown.\" The sum of these lines totals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 47.2 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 44.7 percent planned to be employed, and 8.1 percent did not report they postgraduation plans; these total 100.0 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdivided --showing that 21.8 percent cf all the chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 23.8 percent, research associateships; 0.6 percent, traineeships; and 1.1 percen , some other form of postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided; the percentages, listed by type of employer, show that a total of 44.7 percent planned employment. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who have definite postgraduation plans (item 19: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who are still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 19: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines, \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study,\" add to give the percentage having \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines, \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment,\" add to give the percentage having \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by work activity and by region of employment are based on those who have a definite employment commitment. They exclude those still seeking employment and those planning postdoctoral study as c.escribed above.  Table 3 are data reported from item 17 on all sources of financial support during the course of the individuals' graduate education. These data should be interpreted as follows: 166 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences reported financial support from National Science Foundation fellowships during graduate school. This number is 4.4 percent of the male physical sciences doctorates who answered the question, and it is 39.2 percent of the males in all fields who reported NSF fellowship support. Since students indicate multiple sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent.  In 1977 the item on racial/ethnic group in the survey questionnaire was revised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Surnma, y Report 1977. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to Asian in 1978. In 1980, two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race. However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minoritygroup category; and those whose responses were black as well as any other category were designated as black.)

The sections are as follows: This table highlights the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients in 30 selected fields in the period 1958-1986, during which the Survey of Earned Doctorates has been conducted. Line 1 of each cluster displays the number of doctorate recipients earned in that year. Line 2 shows the percentage of recipients who reported that they planned employment after graduation. Lines 3-6 break out the percentage of those planning employment (line 2) by employment sector. Employment sectors encompass the following: \"Academe\" includes 4-year colleges and universities, junior colleges, medical schools, and foreign universities. \"Government\" includes federal, state, local, and foreign governments. \"Business\" includes self -employment as well as business or industry. \"Other\" includes non-profit organizations and elementary/secondary schools and any other type of employer not listed on the questionnaire. Lines 7 and 8 break out the percentage of Ph.D.s who have definite employment from those who are seeking employment; together they equal line 2: \"Definite\" describes the status of those recipients who were returning to or continuing in predoctoral employment or who signed a contract or made a definite commitment (see questionnaire item 19). \"Seeking\" describes the status of recipients who were either negotiating with one or more organizations, were seeking a pc3ition, or \"other\" (see questionnaire item 19). Line 9 displays the percentage of recipients who reported that they planned postgraduate study. Lines 2 and 9 together total the percentage of recipients reporting plans, which ranges by field between 85 and 100 percent. Lines 10-12 break out the percentage of those planning study (line 9) by type of study appointment. Types of appointment include postdoctoral fellowship, postdoctoral research associateship, traineeship, and other study.
