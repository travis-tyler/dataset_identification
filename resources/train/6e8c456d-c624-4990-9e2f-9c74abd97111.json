When, who, and how often to test remain major topics of debate. Although prostate cancer is a major cause of death and disability, many argue that the benefits of PSA testing are moderate at best and that PSA testing results in the identification of many men with indolent disease (overdetection), which is too often compounded by unnecessary treatment without benefit (overtreatment). In addition, PSA testing often produces falsepositive results, which in turn may contribute to pa- The best evidence supports the use of serum PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer. DRE should not be used as a stand-alone test, but should be performed in those with an elevated serum PSA. DRE should be considered as a baseline test in all patients as it may identify high-risk cancers associated with \"normal\" serum PSA values. Testing above the age of 70 years of age should be done with caution and only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity as a large proportion may harbor cancer that would be unlikely to affect their life expectancy, and screening in this population would substantially increase rates of over-detection. However, a clinically significant number of men in this age group may present with high-risk cancers that pose a significant risk if left undetected until signs or symptoms develop. One could consider increasing the PSA threshold for biopsy in this group (i.e., >4 ng/mL). Very few men above the age of 75 years benefit from PSA testing. Finally, men at age 60 years with a serum PSA <1.0 ng/mL have a very low risk of metastases or death due to prostate cancer. Similarly, a cut point of 3.0 ng/mL at age 75 years has a similarly low risk of such outcomes. c The reported median PSA values for men aged 40-49 y range from 0.5-0.7 ng/mL, and the 75th percentile values range from 0.7-0.9 ng/mL. Therefore, the PSA value of 1.0 ng/mL selects for the upper range of PSA values. Men who have a PSA above the median for their age group are at a higher risk for prostate cancer and for the aggressive form of the disease. The higher above the median, the greater the risk. "}, {"section_title": "See", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Population-Based Screening Studies", "text": "Although many trials have been cited with regard to PSA testing, 2 studies are most relevant because of their topicality and randomized design. Unfortunately, these trials did not address the potential benefit of screening in men with high-risk factors, including African Ameritient anxiety and potential complications associated with unnecessary biopsies. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Prostate Cancer Early Detection were developed for the treatment of men who have elected to participate in an early detection program for prostate cancer after being informed of the risks and benefits of testing. The guidelines provide a set of sequential recommendations on screening and subsequent workup for maximizing the detection of the subset of prostate cancers that are potentially curable and, if left undetected, represent a risk to the patient. These NCCN Guidelines Insights highlight important revisions to the guideline.\nThe reduction in prostate cancer mortality must be balanced against the adverse effects of treatment, emphasizing the importance of selective treatment of men with prostate cancer identified by screening, such that many men can be managed on active surveillance. The level of PSA correlates with the risk of prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) demonstrated that 15% of men with a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL and a normal DRE had prostate cancer diagnosed on end-of-study biopsies. Approximately 30% to 35% of men with serum PSA between 4 to 10 ng/mL will be found to have cancer. Total PSA levels >10 ng/mL confer a greater than 67% likelihood of prostate cancer. Many factors may influence and better inform decisions on biopsy including PSA kinietics and/or velocity. Alternatively, risk calculators could be used in those men similar to cohorts where risk calculators have been developed. These tools combine factors including age, family history, ethnicity, DRE, and PSA to aid in the decision of whom to biopsy. They have not been tested in randomized clinical trials and which cut-point of risk would be associated with a reduction in prostate cancer mortality remains unknown. f Biomarkers that improve the specificity of detection are not recommended as firstline screening tests, but are reserved, for the most part, in selecting those who have undergone at least one negative biopsy for a repeat biopsy. However, there may be some patients who meet either PSA or DRE standards for biopsy, but for whom the patients and/or the physician wish to further define the probability of cancer before undergoing biopsy. A PHI >35, precent free PSA <10% and/or PCA3 score >35 are strongly suspicious for prostate cancer. NCCN Guidelines Insights CE can men. Also, many men in these studies underwent sextant prostate biopsies rather than extended core biopsies, which is the standard diagnostic technique currently used."}, {"section_title": "INDICATIONS FOR BIOPSY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer", "text": "The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) enrolled approximately 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years in 7 European countries, randomly assigned to either a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or a control group that did not receive such screening. 4, 5 During a median follow-up of 11 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 7.4% in the screening group versus 5.1% in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer were 0.79 for the screening arm compared with the control arm (95% CI, 0.68-0.91; P=.001). Over the long term, the number needed to screen and the additional number needed to treat to prevent 1 death from prostate cancer were 200 and 5, respectively. 3, 6 Modeling the ERSPC data, Heijnsdijk et al 3 estimated the number needed to screen was 98 and number needed to treat was 5 to save 1 life.\nThe G\u00f6teborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial was initiated in Sweden before and independently of the ERSPC, but some of its patients were reported as part of the ERSPC. 7 The G\u00d6teborg study randomized 20,000 men, aged 50 to 64 years, to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years or a control group not invited for testing. In men randomized to screening, 76% attended at least 1 test. PSA testing in the general population was very low at the beginning (3%) but increased over time.\nDuring a median follow-up of 14 years, the cumulative prostate cancer incidence was 12.7% in the screening group and 8.2% in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.50-1.80; P<.0001). The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39-0.82; P=.002) in the screening group compared with the control group. Overall, 293 men needed to be screened and 12 needed to be diagnosed to prevent 1 prostate cancer death at 14 years. Notably, a causespecific survival benefit was observed despite the fact that not all cancers were immediately treated. A total of 45% of men were assigned to active surveillance and 32% were managed with it. This suggests that early detection combined with selective treatment based on risk can lower mortality rates without uniform treatment of all cancers.\nSeveral explanations are possible for the more favorable results of the G\u00f6teborg trial compared with the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (discussed later) and ERSPC. First, the patients were younger and less likely to have incurable prostate cancer at first screening; second, there was less contamination of the control arm; third, a lower PSA threshold was used for recommending biopsy; and finally, men were screened more frequently than in ER-SPC and for a longer period than in PLCO. However, the G\u00f6teborg trial results should not be interpreted as belonging to an independent confirmatory study, because more than half of the patients were included in the main analysis of ERSPC."}, {"section_title": "PLCO Trial", "text": "The PLCO trial randomized 76,685 men aged 55 to 74 years at 10 US study centers to annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination (DRE) for 4 years or usual care. 8 After 13 years of follow-up, the incidence rate ratio for the screening arm compared with the control arm was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07 -1.17). The investigators did not find a statistically significant difference between the disease-specific mortality rates of the screening and control groups (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87-1.36). Because of the high rate of prescreening and the high contamination rate of 40% to 52% each year in the control group (ie, 74% in the usual care arm were screened at least once), the trial cannot be described as a trial of screening, but rather a comparison of different approaches to screening (ie, opportunistic vs systematic). The estimated mean number of screening PSA tests (DREs) in the control arm was 2.7 (1.1), compared with 5.0 (3.5) in the screened arm. Virtually the same percentage of men in the control and screening arms was screened during the study. In addition, the biopsy rate for patients with elevated serum PSA values was relatively low compared with rates in the European trials. However, it did show that yearly screening may be of limited value compared with less frequent testing. 9 In a subset analysis reported by Crawford et al, 10 a 44% decrease in the risk of prostate cancer-specific death was observed in men with no or minimal comorbidity assigned to screening compared with controls, and the numbers needed to screen and treat to prevent 1 death were 723 and 5, respectively. This benefit was not found among men with 1 or more significant comorbidities. These results suggest that screening is more useful among men in good health because of the lack of a competing cause for mortality. However, some in-NCCN Guidelines Insights "}, {"section_title": "Ages to Initiate and Stop Testing", "text": "Controversy exists surrounding the ideal age at which to begin testing for prostate cancer. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) looking at the impact of screening on prostate cancer mortality have focused primarily on men aged 55 to 69 years. The ERSPC and the G\u00f6te-borg trial reported decreased disease-specific mortality in men aged 55 to 69 and 50 to 64 years, respectively. 4, 5, 7 These results support baseline PSA testing in men aged 50 to 55 years, with the strongest evidence supporting testing at age 55 years. Many recommend earlier testing based on risk, including ethnicity (African American men), family history, and BRCA mutations.\nBecause younger men were not included in these screening studies, baseline testing at an earlier age has not been evaluated in RCTs. However, observational evidence suggests that baseline testing of men in their 40s and early 50s may have value for future risk stratification, although some would describe it as marginal. 12 A study by Lilja et al 13 assessed blood collected from 21,277 men in Sweden aged 33 to 50 years who were followed until 2006. Among the 1312 cases of prostate cancer and 3728 controls without prostate cancer, these investigators reported that a single PSA test before age 50 years predicted subsequent prostate cancer up to 30 years later, with a robust area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (0.75 for advanced prostate cancer). This suggests that one could perform early, baseline testing and then determine the frequency of testing based on risk.\nA recent report based on the same cohort clarified associations of age with long-term risk for metastases. 14 In this study, the risk of prostate cancer death was strongly correlated with baseline PSA level in men aged 45 to 49 years and 51 to 55 years; 44% of the deaths in the analytic cohort occurred in men in the highest tenth of the distribution of PSA level, suggesting that there may be a strong rationale for baseline testing in men younger than 55 years. Although many advocate earlier testing only in men thought to be at higher risk because of family history or ethnicity, as noted previously, a baseline serum PSA level is a stronger predictor of the future risk of the disease compared with either of these risk factors.\nMost panel members favored baseline, informed testing beginning at ages 45 to 50 years (although some felt that testing at age 40 years was most appropriate), annual to biannual follow-up in those above the 75th percentile for age-specific PSA level (\u22651.0 ng/mL), and retesting at age 50 years in those below this level. 15 Median PSA levels for men aged 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years are 0.7 ng/mL and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively."}, {"section_title": "16,17", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Testing in Elderly Men", "text": "Because the previously cited RCTs (ESRPC, PLCO, and G\u00f6teborg) observed benefits to testing only in men aged up to 70 years, several panel members favored stopping testing at age 70 years. However, other data would suggest a benefit to screening beyond 70 years. A study of 4561 men who underwent radical prostatectomy found that men older than 70 years were more likely to have a higher grade and stage of disease and worse survival compared with their younger counterparts. 18 Others have published similar findings. 19 To assess the appropriate ages for discontinuing screening, a microsimulation model 6 predicted that decreasing the stopping age from 74 to 69 years would lead to a 27% relative reduction in the probability of life saved, but an almost 50% reduction in the probability of overdiagnosis. It also assessed a strategy of screening men up to age 74 years while simultaneously increasing the PSA threshold for biopsy with increasing age. Compared with using a uniform cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL, this strategy reduced the rate of overdiagnosis by one-third while only slightly altering lives saved. Any strategy that reduces overdetection will have some impact on prostate cancer mortality rates. The goal of refined testing beyond age 70 years is to maximize the reduction in overdiagnosis and minimize the impact on cancerspecific mortality.\nTotal PSA at certain ages may predict future risk. Vickers et al 20 examined the relationship between baseline PSA level at age 60 years and the future risk of prostate cancer death or metastases, and found that those with a PSA level below the median (<1 ng/mL) were unlikely to develop clinically significant prostate cancer (0.5% risk of metastases and 0.2% risk of prostate cancer death). Similarly, in a study of 849 men in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, no men aged 75 to 80 years with a PSA level less than 3.0 ng/mL died of prostate cancer. 21 Moreover, the time to death or diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer was longer in men with a PSA level less than 3.0 ng/mL than in those with a PSA level greater than 3.0 ng/mL, suggesting that men aged 75 years or older with a PSA level less than 3.0 ng/mL are unlikely to die or experience aggressive NCCN Guidelines Insights CE prostate cancer throughout their remaining life and may safely discontinue screening.\nIn summary, one strategy to reduce overdiagnosis in the older population would be to discontinue screening at age 69 years; a second would be to continue screening up to age 74 years but increase the PSA threshold for biopsy among men aged 70 to 74 years; and a third would be to discontinue screening at age 75 years for men with a PSA level less than 3.0 ng/mL. Obviously, only men who have a life expectancy beyond 10 years should be screened at any age."}, {"section_title": "NCCN Recommendations", "text": "The panel uniformly recommends that baseline PSA testing be offered to healthy, well-informed men aged 50 to 70 years (see PROSD-2, page 1213). Most panelists believed that baseline testing should be available to men aged 45 to 49 years. The category 2B designation for this age group reflects the nonuniform consensus.\nThe panel recommends that PSA testing be individualized after age 70 years and that indication for biopsy be carefully evaluated (see PROSD-2, page 1213). This is also a category 2B recommendation because of nonuniform consensus. Testing in those older than 70 years should be performed with caution and only in very healthy men with little or no comorbidity, because a large proportion may harbor cancer that would be unlikely to affect their life expectancy, and routine screening in this population would substantially increase rates of overdetection. Alternately, some panel members pointed out that a clinically significant number of men in this age group may (>70 years) present with high-risk cancers that pose a clinically significant risk if left undetected until signs or symptoms develop. One could therefore consider increasing the PSA threshold for biopsy in this group to reduce overdiagnosis. The panel agreed that very few men older than 75 years benefit from PSA testing.\nNCCN panel members uniformly discouraged PSA testing in men unlikely to benefit from prostate cancer diagnosis based on age and/or comorbidity.\nThe panel recommends PSA testing every 1 to 2 years (see PROSD-2, page 1213). For men aged 45 to 49 years with serum PSA values of 1 ng/mL or less, additional testing may be deferred until age 50 years. For men with PSA levels exceeding 1.0 ng/mL, testing should be repeated at 1-to 2-year intervals.\nIndications for biopsy have been significantly simplified in the latest version of the NCCN Guidelines and include both a PSA cutpoint and use of multiple factors (see PROSD-3, page 1214). The panel uniformly recommends that transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy be considered in patients with a serum PSA level greater than 3.0 ng/mL. A suspicious DRE result, regardless of PSA level, is another indication for biopsy. This is a category 2B recommendation, because many panel members felt that DRE should not be used as a stand-alone test but rather should be performed in men with an elevated serum PSA level. All panel members agreed that a decision to perform a biopsy should not be based on a PSA cutpoint alone, but should incorporate other important clinical variables, including repeat PSA testing, age, health status, and patient preference. Some panel members also argued that additional factors, including family history, PSA kinetics, and ethnicity, should play a role in biopsy decision-making. Use of these factors to determine whether the patient should undergo biopsy is a category 2B recommendation.\nIf a biopsy is not performed for the conditions that suggest a high risk of prostate cancer, the patient should be reevaluated in 6 to 12 months. Consideration may be given to biomarkers that improve specificity such as percent free PSA, PHI, and PCA3 in select patients with PSA levels between 3 and 10 ng/mL, although these biomarkers are indicated more strongly in the consideration of a repeat biopsy after an initially benign result."}, {"section_title": "Frequency of Testing", "text": "A recent comparison of 2 centers in the ERSPC trial studied the impact of different screening intervals on the diagnosis of cancers in men aged 55 to 64 years. 22 The G\u00f6teborg arm randomized 4202 men to screening every 2 years, whereas the Rotterdam arm randomized 13,301 men to screening every 4 years, with a similar follow-up of 11 to 12 years. Compared with screening every 4 years, a significant 43% reduction was seen in the diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer (clinical stage \u2265T3a, N1, or M1; PSA level >20 ng/mL; Gleason score \u22658 at biopsy) for screening every 2 years. However, a 46% increase in the diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage T1c, Gleason score <6, and PSA level <10 ng/mL at biopsy) was seen with screening every 2 years.\nA study using microsimulation models of prostate cancer incidence and mortality predicted that a strategy using biennial screening intervals in men with average PSA levels and longer screening intervals (every 5 years) for those with low PSA levels (below median for age by decade) would be associated with a 2.27% risk of prostate cancer-related death compared with 2.86% with no screening. 6 In addition, compared with annual screening and using a biopsy threshold of 4.0 ng/mL, the biennial strategy also projected a relatively lower overdiagnosis rate of 2.4% (vs 3.3% for annual screening), a 59% reduction in total tests, and a 50% reduction in false-positive results.\nThese data therefore suggest that screening every 2 years may provide comparable survival to annual screening while allowing modest reductions in overdiagnosis and significant reductions in unnecessary testing. However, panel members did not uniformly agree on the recommendation for biannual screening. Some pointed out the logistical impracticality in testing every 2 years, because many men receive PSA testing during their annual checkup."}, {"section_title": "Indications for Biopsy", "text": "The previously cited RCTs used PSA thresholds to prompt a biopsy. PSA cutpoints for biopsy varied somewhat among centers and trials over time. Although a serum PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL has been used by many, a level of 3.0 ng/mL is supported by the trials and would more robustly limit the risk of overdetection. However, some panel members did not recommend limiting the option of biopsy to pre-specified PSA thresholds, noting that many other factors (eg, age, ethnicity, family history, PSA kinetics) should also inform the decision to perform a biopsy.\nSeveral panel members also noted that risk calculators could be used in appropriately selected men. These calculators have been developed to estimate an individual's risk for biopsy-detectable prostate cancer using multiple clinical factors. 27 However, these calculators have not been assessed in RCTs. Moreover, a specific cutpoint expressed as the probability of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer associated with a reduction in prostate cancer mortality remains to be elucidated."}, {"section_title": "Combinations of Biomarkers", "text": "The search continues for an optimal test that can accurately identify clinically significant prostate cancer.
