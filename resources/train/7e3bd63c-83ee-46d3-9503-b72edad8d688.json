[{"section_title": "", "text": "building Knowledge for Families and Communities in the 21st Century t he lives of children placed in out-of-home care as a result of abuse or neglect are severely disrupted. Children are generally removed from their homes only as a last resort when their or others' safety and well-being are at risk. These placements aim to alleviate distress and improve child wellbeing. However, it is often difficult for policy makers to fully understand variations in placement rates by location within their states. In this fact sheet, we show breakdowns by metropolitan status for the nation, regions, and states in hopes that the information will be useful as changes to and funding for the child welfare system are considered. Counties are classified according to the u.s. department of agriculture's rural-urban continuum codes. This approach contrasts placement rates in metropolitan areas, termed \"metropolitan/urban, \" with nonmetro counties adjacent to metropolitan areas, termed \"adjacent nonmetro, \" and those not adjacent to metropolitan areas, termed \"remote rural. \" 1 table 1 shows rates (per 1,000) of children and youth in outof-home care at any time in 2007 by place, state, and region. nationally and within each region, remote rural areas have higher rates of out-of-home placement. additionally, nearly half of the states have the highest placement rates in remote rural areas. There are several potential reasons for observed differences. larger populations of african american or latino children who tend to have higher placement rates may increase the overall risk of placement in the area, particularly in urban areas. 2 Higher poverty rates in some states or regions may increase the need for child welfare resources, including out-of-home placement. a scarcity of supportive services in rural areas or gaps in mental health services to address issues contributing to out-of-home placements may lead to higher placement rates in resource-poor areas. 3 Finally, differences in child welfare agencies' policies and procedures might result in differing placement rates across states and types of communities."}, {"section_title": "data", "text": "We used adoption and Foster Care reporting system (aFCars) data. 4 aFCars data are collected at regular intervals in every state and reflect all placements, providing \"24-hour substitute care for children outside their own homes. \" 5 state-level differences may contribute to variations in types of placements included in aFCars. about the authors Marybeth J.
