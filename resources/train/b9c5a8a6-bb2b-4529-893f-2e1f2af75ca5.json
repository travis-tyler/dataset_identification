[{"section_title": "", "text": "1. Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Background and rationale", "text": "Salt marshes are sites of intense biogeochemical activity (Nixon, 1980;Dame et al., 1986Dame et al., , 1990). Odum (1968) hypothesized that salt marshes in the southeastern United States produce more organic material that can be consumed or stored within the marsh, such that any excess is exported to the coastal ocean, thereby supporting its productivity. Even though Odum had no supporting data, his so called ''Outwelling Hypothesis'' became the focus of intensive study for the next two decades. Investigators have since examined the tidal fluxes of different forms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sediments and some metals in 41 salt marsh basins (Childers et al., 2000). Marsh basins along the east coast of the United States appear to generally export POC, DOC, DON, NH 4 and PO 4 (Dame, 1989), although in many cases the fluxes are not significantly different from zero. Interestingly most studies (Boon, 1972;Settlemyre and Gardner, 1977;Ward, 1981), with the exception of Vogel et al. (1996) and Murphy and Voulgaris (2006), also indicate that marsh basins export inorganic suspended sediments (ISS) despite the fact that geological studies show that during the late Holocene and recent transgression marsh basins have accumulated significant deposits of mud (Gardner and Porter, 2001). Given the uncertainties and ambiguities in presently available outwelling studies, there is still a need for further measurement of material fluxes and budgets in marsh basins. Furthermore, none of these studies encompass a large enough number of tidal cycles to reliably ascertain whether there are seasonal or diurnal patterns in the fluxes of any of the commonly measured constituents. Three intense outwelling studies previously conducted in the North Inlet (SC) basin ( Fig. 1) illustrate the ambiguities, uncertainties and questions that typically result from such studies. For the entire basin (32 km 2 ) Dame et al. (1986) found exports of POC (128 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), DOC (328 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), NH 4 (6.3 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), NN (0.9 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), TN (42.7 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), PO 4 (1.7 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), TP (3.1 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and total suspended sediment (2.2 kg m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) with maximum exports tending to occur in summer when average concentrations also reach peak values. No standard errors were published for any of these fluxes although it is stated that POC export occurred on 30 out of the 32 cycles measured. For the Bly Creek sub-basin (0.66 km 2 ) Dame et al. (1991) showed statistically insignificant imports of POC (38 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), NN (0.3 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), PN 2.8 (g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), TP (g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and inorganic suspended sediment (1.48 kg m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ). Significant exports were found for DOC (260 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and DON (14.6 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) but non-significant exports for NH 4 (0.8 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and PO 4 (0.2 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ). In a marsh flume study in the Bly Creek sub-basin Dame et al. (1991) observed that the vegetated marsh had significant imports for ISS (0.47 kg m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), POC (39 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), NH 4 (2.6 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), NN (0.60 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), PP (1.6 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), PO 4 (0.38 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and TP (2.16 g P m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and a non-significant import of PN (1.05 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ). The only exports were DOC (33.3 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and DON (9.0 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ), the latter of which was highly significant. As can be seen the direction and magnitude for the fluxes of many constituents are highly uncertain, due largely to insufficient sampling. Also the directions and magnitudes apparently change between the inlet, where exports dominate, and the remote landward portion of the basin, where imports dominate. Thus, Dame and Gardner (1993) speculated that in the early stages of ecological succession from forest to marsh, nutrients and sediments must be imported to support the much higher productivity of the marsh. Using the marsh flume flux results as empirical inputs to a tide-based (hypsographic) model, Childers et al. (1993) attempted to simulate daily changes in the North Inlet Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) nutrient concentration time series but found little correlation between model predictions observed changes. These results thus indicate that, despite the large effort expended in these studies, little can be said about seasonal patterns in fluxes, and even less about long-term or diurnal patterns. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether the water chemistry data collected at Oyster Landing as part of the North InleteWinyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve Site (NERRS) program can be used to determine fluxes of nutrients and sediments. Since this large database hopefully will expand indefinitely, it will not only add another basin to the outwelling literature but may also eventually provide high precision estimates of monthly flux patterns and perhaps even yield diurnal and long-term trends. Thus, we feel that it is now time to undertake this evaluation so that adjustments to the NERRS protocol can be made, if necessary, to optimize its utility for outwelling purposes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study area and NEERS measurements", "text": "The site of this study is a small, salt marsh sub-basin within the North InleteWinyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS/NOAA) near the University of South Carolina Marine Laboratory at North Inlet, South Carolina (Fig. 1). The North Inlet system consists of 32 km 2 of salt marsh drained by numerous meandering tidal creeks. It is typical of the marsheestuary systems located between Cape Hatteras and Cape Canaveral on the southeastern Atlantic coast (Kjerfve, 1986). The dominant marsh plant is Spartina alterniflora with Salicornia and Juncus at higher elevations along the marsh edge. The mean semidiurnal tide range is about 1.5 m with peak currents usually around 1.4 m s \u00c01 . However, on spring tides, currents occasionally exceed 2.3 m s \u00c01 (Kjerfve et al., 1981). With creek depths of only 3e8 m, the tidal range accounts for a significant fraction of the total water depth. As a result, 40% of the total water volume leaves the estuarine system with each ebb tide (Kjerfve, 1986). This leads to a hydrodynamic residence time of only 15 h (Kjerfve, 1986). The shallow depths and intense tidal turbulence also make the tidal creeks well-mixed and almost vertically homogeneous with respect to dissolved constituents (Kjerfve, 1986). Salinity usually falls between 30 and 34 ppt due to very low fresh water input, estimated between 1 and 5 m 3 s \u00c01 . After periods of intense rainfall, though, salinities can drop to 4 ppt in the landward reaches of the creeks. The Crab Haul Creek basin, which encompasses the Oyster Landing NERRS sampling site, is the landward-most marsh sub-basin at the North Inlet site ( Fig. 1) and was the focus of this study. This small tidal basin (1.1 km 2 ) is drained by a terminal tidal creek. Flanking the basin are forested, relic beach ridges that form the drainage divides between adjacent basins (Gardner and Bohn, 1980;Gardner and Porter, 2001). Extrapolation of the fresh water input given by Dame et al. (1991) for the adjacent Bly Creek basin to the Crab Haul Creek basin indicates an inflow of 2.7 \u00c2 10 6 m 3 yr \u00c01 via direct rainfall and surface plus groundwater runoff from the adjacent forest. This input is offset by a loss of 1.4 \u00c2 10 6 m 3 yr \u00c01 via evapotranspiration (Gardner and Reeves, 2002) leaving a net input of fresh water of about 1.3 \u00c2 10 6 m 3 yr \u00c01 . This is about 0.9% of the total tidal water that enters the basin each year (1.8 \u00c2 10 8 m 3 yr \u00c01 ). Detailed information pertaining to the soils and geomorphological history of the North Inlet basin can be found in Gardner and Bohn (1980), Gardner et al. (1992) and Gardner and Porter (2001). NERRS water quality and meteorological data measured half hourly at the Oyster Landing pier include water temperature, air temperature, salinity, DO, tide height, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, turbidity and precipitation. Also, beginning on 2 June 1993 and every 20 days thereafter, water samples have been collected at 2 h and 4 min intervals during two consecutive tidal cycles (26 h) using an ISCO automated water sampler with an intake at a depth of 0.5 m. Constituents measured in the 20-day water chemistry program include salinity (SAL), total nitrogen in the whole, unfiltered sample (TNW), total nitrogen in the filtered sample (TNF), dissolved ammonia (NH 4 ), dissolved nitrate \u00fe nitrite (NN), total unfiltered phosphorus (TPW), filtered phosphorus (TPF), dissolved phosphate (PO 4 ), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total suspended sediment (TSS) and inorganic suspended sediment (ISS). Chlorophyll-a is also measured but is not considered in this study because of the many gaps in this data set. From these primary chemical parameters one can estimate organic suspended sediment (OSS) by the difference between TSS and ISS, particulate N and P (PN and PP) from the difference between the unfiltered and filtered samples, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) by subtracting NH 4 and NN from TNF, and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) by subtracting PO 4 from TPF. Details pertaining to the methods used for the collection, analysis and quality control of the water chemistry samples can be found at http://links.baruch.sc.edu/Data/NERRW-CHEM/metadata/FGDC. NERRWCHEM.1993NERRWCHEM. -2001.Final.pdf. Briefly TNW, TNF, TPW, TPF were measured by alkaline persulfate oxidation to nitrate (followed by cadmium reduction to nitrite) or phosphate. The resulting nitrite and phosphate were measured in a Technicon AutoAnalyzer by conversion to a diazo dye or phosphomolybdate complex, respectively. NN and PO 4 in the filtered but unoxidized samples also were measured colorimetrically by means of the same complexes. NH 4 was also measured in the AutoAnalyzer using the Berthelot Reaction. DOC was combusted to carbon dioxide, which was measured in a Shimadzu TOC e 500 Organic Carbon Analyzer. TSS was measured gravimetrically following filtration onto pre-weighed glass fiber filters. ISS was measured by reweighing the filters after combustion in a muffle furnace at 450 C. Salinity was measured with a refractometer. Water chemistry data currently available for download from the North InleteWinyah Bay NERRS web site extend from 2 June 1993 through 2001. This study is restricted to the currently downloadable data, which consists of 154 sampler deployments covering 308 tidal cycles. As a result of sampler failure, no data are available for three of the deployments, leaving 151 events covering 302 tidal cycles for flux analysis."}, {"section_title": "Discharge measurements", "text": "The first step in calculating material fluxes from the concentration measurements in the NERRS water chemistry database was the creation of a storage curve for the Crab Haul Creek basin. A storage curve is a plot of cumulative basin water volume versus tide height (Miller and Gardner, 1981), which allows changes in basin volume (and thus discharges) to be estimated from changes in tide heights. To create a storage curve for the Crab Haul Creek basin, we calculated the discharge at half-hour intervals based on measurements of vertical velocity profiles at five cross-sectional locations during eight semidiurnal tidal cycles (between 20 June 1996 and 26 October 1996) at a transect 200 m seaward of the Oyster Landing pier (Fig. 1). Details pertaining to the measurements are given in Gardner et al. (2006). The velocityearea method was employed to calculate discharges from the half-hourly field data (Dingman, 1994). The discharge for a given half hour was then averaged with the discharge from the previous half hour to get an estimate of the time-averaged discharge for the half-hour interval between sets of velocity measurements. To obtain an estimate of the volume of water that entered or left the basin between sets of measurements, the time-averaged discharge was multiplied by the time elapsed between measurement sets (about 0.5 h)."}, {"section_title": "Storage curves", "text": "The cumulative basin water volumes for the flood and ebb portions of the tidal cycle were calculated by summing the water volumes entering or exiting the basin during each half hour. To obtain a storage curve for the flood tide the incremental volumes were summed from the starting low tide to high tide. For the ebb tide the incremental volumes were summed backwards from the ending low tide to the preceding high tide. Separate flood and ebb storage curves for each measured semidiurnal cycle were plotted with cumulative basin water volume on the ordinate versus manual tide height on the x-axis. The curves are logarithmic power functions with the following form: where V(m 3 ) is the basin volume, TH man (m) is the manually read tide height, and b and m are the intercept and regression coefficients, respectively and where 1.0 is added to the tide height to avoid negative or zero values in the log argument. The slope and intercept parameters for the storage equation (Eq(1)) were determined separately for the flood and ebb data by regression analyses on the eight sets of cumulative volume versus tide height data. Regression analyses were also performed on the eight sets of data as a whole (flood and ebb data combined). Since the flood and ebb regression parameters were not significantly different, the regression parameters based on the composite data were used to predict basin water volume for any given manual tide height ( Fig. 2). "}, {"section_title": "NERRS and NOAA tide data", "text": "Two different instrument systems were used to measure half-hourly time series of tide height, salinity and dissolved oxygen as part of the water quality program at the Oyster Landing pier. However, inspection of the tide records from the two sensors indicate that data gaps occurred on 21 of the 154 sampler deployments. More problematic is the fact that during intervals of overlap the difference between the two tide records is not constant and sometimes they do not agree as to the times of high and low tide, differing by as much as 2 h. In view of these problems we decided to hindcast the tide at Oyster Landing by predicting the tide at Oyster Landing using the harmonic WWW Tide/Current predictor at http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide and adding to this prediction the difference between the observed and predicted tides at Charleston Harbor, SC (NOAA station 8665530), the hourly record of which is free of gaps for the interval 2 June 1993 through 2001. Here we expected that the difference between the observed and predicted tides at Charleston Harbor is due largely to regional conditions of barometric pressure and wind stress and should thus be generally applicable to the North Inlet basin 90 km north of Charleston. Using a newly installed NOAA tide gauge at Oyster Landing for the interval 21 May 2001 to 11 July 2002 we found that 88% of the variation in the difference between the observed and predicted tides at Oyster Landing is explained by the variation in the difference between the observed and predicted tides at Charleston, indicating that farfield forcing has generally similar effects at both sites. We then used this method to correlate the predicted NOAA tide at Oyster Landing to the manual tide observations associated with the velocity measurements collected during the eight tidal cycles between 20 June 1996 and 26 October 1996. The results are shown in the inset on Fig. 2 where the manual tide is shown to be predicted with an R-square of 0.98 and an uncertainty of about 7 cm, which is substantially better than that cited for the Hydrolab/YSI system (30 cm) on the NERRS web site. The regression equation shown in the inset on Fig. 2 was then used to calculate manual tide heights for each of the NERRS water chemistry samples, and for times 1 min before and after each sample. The latter were then used in Eq. (1) (as shown on Fig. 2) to estimate changes in tidal volume, and thus discharges, associated with each sample. In making these estimates, the regional wind and barometric effects were estimated from the average of the difference between the observed and predicted Charleston Harbor tides for the nearest hours before and after the water sample times. This procedure for the regional effects was also used for the correlation shown in the inset on Fig. 2."}, {"section_title": "Flux calculations", "text": "For each NERRS water chemistry sample, estimates of the instantaneous fluxes of nutrients, sediments and salt were obtained by multiplying their instantaneous concentrations by the discharges estimated above. This method for estimating fluxes assumes that the single spatial measurement of concentrations obtained from the water sampler is representative of the spatially averaged concentration in the channel cross-section. To evaluate this assumption, 10e13 measurements of dissolved oxygen, salinity and temperature were made using the YSI sensors at multiple stations and depths (0.2 and 0.8 relative) across the channel at three stages of the tide; mid-flood, early ebb and mid-ebb (Erik Smith, personal communication). For mid-flood the spatial mean for DO was 7.85 (\u00fe/\u00c0 0.09) mg l \u00c01 versus 7.87 mg l \u00c01 at the Hydrolab sensor, where the number in the parentheses is the standard error. For early ebb the mean was 8.62 (\u00fe/\u00c0 0.04) mg l \u00c01 versus 8.75 mg l \u00c01 at the Hydrolab sensor. For mid-ebb the mean was 8.87 (\u00fe/\u00c0 0.14) mg l \u00c01 versus 8.86 mg l \u00c01 at the Hydrolab sensor. Similarly uniform results were obtained for salinity and temperature. These results suggest that the assumption of spatially uniform dissolved nutrients is probably reasonable. Since particulate species are subject to gravitational settling, this assumption may not hold for them."}, {"section_title": "Flux decomposition", "text": "To ascertain whether the methodology employed here might produce systematic errors in the mean fluxes of nutrients, sediments and salt, we decomposed the fluxes into their advective and dispersive components. Over a large number of tidal cycles the mean flux of salt should be zero, as there is no evidence that salt deposits are either forming or dissolving in the basin. However, since there is a slight excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration in the basin, we might expect to observe a small advective export of salt that is exactly equal to its dispersive import. Over any particular cycle, however, there will likely be an advective import or export of salt and/or other materials simply due to the inequality of the tide heights at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Accordingly we expected that on a cycle by cycle basis the advective fluxes of salt and other substances should be highly and directly correlated simply as a result of inequalities between starting and ending tide heights and therefore should not be interpreted as indicating production or consumption of these substances by the marsh basin. If, on the other hand, a significant positive correlation was to emerge between the dispersive fluxes of salt and the other constituents, then there would be reason to suspect that there may be systematic error in our methodology that biases the dispersive transport of these constituents. The decomposition is based on the net transport equation (Boon, 1972): F\u00f0t\u00dedt \u00bc 1=T ZZZ c\u00f0y; z; t\u00deu\u00f0y; z; t\u00dedy dz dt \u00f02\u00de where F(t) is the net tidal material flux, c is material concentration, u is water velocity normal to the cross-section, y, z and t are the width, depth and time coordinates, respectively, and T is the duration of a complete tidal cycle or multiple thereof. Taking into account the single depth material concentration readings we have: where the instantaneous water discharge (q) is: yielding: The concentration and discharge terms were decomposed according to: where c o and q o are the time-averaged components (means) of the concentration and discharge, and c T (t) and q T (t) are the time-varying deviations of the concentration and discharge from their tidal means, respectively (Kjerfve, 1986). The time-averaging action represents averaging over a complete tidal cycle or multiple cycles. Substitution of Eqs. 6and 7into Eq. (5) yields: where 1=T R F\u00f0t\u00dedt is the net longitudinal material flux, c o q o represents the advective material flux and 1=T R c T \u00f0t\u00deq T \u00f0t\u00dedt represents the dispersive material flux over any number (n) of tidal cycles (T ) (Kjerfve, 1986). For the remainder of this paper, net longitudinal material fluxes will be referred to simply as net fluxes. Eq. (9), as written, is applicable to conservative chemical constituents such as salt. However, for non-conservative constituents such as nutrients and sediments, Eq. (8) must be changed to: where R is a source/sink term accounting for the addition or removal of the constituent via chemical and biological reactions or settling/erosion. For salt the R term ideally is zero, for there are no reactions that add or remove salt from the water column. However, since discharge is calculated via a single storage curve, an apparent R term might arise if the input of fresh water by direct precipitation and upland runoff is not balanced by evapotranspiration. As noted above there is a small (compared to the tidal prism) excess of fresh water input over evapotranspiration which might dilute slightly the salinity of the ebb flow and thereby produce a slight apparent import of salt. For other constituents, however, the R term may be significant as a result of photosynthesis, respiration or settling/erosion. However, the null hypothesis of this study is that R is zero for all other constituents as well as for salt. Thus in the following flux calculations, R was not calculated separately but was included in the dispersive term. Therefore, should the dispersive term prove to be significant, it is likely that biological or chemical reaction rates are fast enough to change concentrations over a tidal cycle. The most interesting way to examine temporal variations in material fluxes is to calculate fluxes for each pair of tidal cycles in the water chemistry data set. From there the fluxes for individual tides could be grouped to examine seasonal or monthly variations. This time series of material fluxes was analyzed to test the ''Outwelling'' hypothesis at Crab Haul Creek as it pertains to nutrients and sediments. The salt fluxes were used to investigate the possibility of a bias in the method of flux calculation, as the mean salt flux should be zero or show a slight dispersive import that is balanced by an advective export. Mean advective and dispersive material fluxes and associated standard errors were calculated for the presently available 151 sampler deployments."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "As shown in Table 1 the long-term mean advective fluxes for all constituents are significantly less than zero, indicating export, and, with the exception of DOP, are significantly and directly correlated (not shown) with the advective flux of salt (R-square 0.37e0.86). On the other hand, the dispersive flux of salt shows a significant import, as would be expected in a basin receiving fresh water runoff from the surrounding uplands. However, the import of salt is only about 20% of that needed to balance its advective export. Furthermore, the dispersive salt flux is for the most part either only weakly (R-squares < 0.05) or inversely (R \u00bc \u00c00.28 to \u00c00.90), correlated with the dispersive fluxes of the other constituents. These results therefore indicate that the advective exports of nutrients and sediments are largely driven by the bias towards export in the advective salt flux whereas the dispersive fluxes of nutrients and sediments are either largely independent of the dispersive salt flux or inversely correlated with it. As noted in the Section 2 a net export of salt was not expected, as there are no sources of salt in the basin. The export of salt thus indicates that the methodology employed in this study is somewhat biased towards export and that the exports of nutrients and sediments therefore are artifacts produced by this bias. Accordingly we address the origin of this bias in the following paragraphs. As noted earlier, a basin, in which there are no sources or sinks for salt but which has an excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration, ideally should show a long-term net outflow of water and an advective export of salt that is exactly balanced by its dispersive import. For the Crab Haul Creek basin the excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration (1.3 \u00c2 10 6 m 3 yr \u00c01 ) should produce a mean net outflow of \u00c041 l s \u00c01 , which integrated over a tidal cycle is about 0.9% of the mean tidal prism. This volume of net outflow apparently was not large enough to produce a significant difference between the flood and ebb storage curves (Fig. 2). Were it larger, it might have generated an ebb storage curve distinctly above that for the flood and we would have had to use separate storage curves for flood and ebb. In any case this estimate of net outflow based on the fresh water hydrologic balance is an order of magnitude smaller than the long-term mean value of q o (\u00c0610 l s \u00c01 \u00fe/\u00c0 89 l s \u00c01 SE; Table 1) computed in our study. In principle, however, our methodology should have produced a mean value of q o equal to zero because the same storage curve was used for flood and ebb discharge estimates. Thus over a large number of tidal cycles inequalities in the starting and ending tide levels should largely cancel, leading to a mean value of q o that is not significantly different from zero. That such a result did not occur can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the tide is not symmetrical, having a flood duration that is 0.5e1.0 h longer than ebb. Thus during ebb, changes in tide elevation, and thus storage volumes, are generally greater in magnitude than during flood, leading to generally higher estimates of q(t) on ebb. Ideally the greater magnitudes of the q(t) estimates on ebb should be balanced by the greater number of estimates of q(t) on flood. Thus a bias towards net outflow could result if our sampling failed to accurately achieve this balance, particularly during the 2 h intervals before and after high tides when the greatest changes in storage volume take place. In order to identify the source of this bias we compared histograms of our instantaneous discharge estimates (2041 of them) with those generated by the same storage curve model but with high quality NOAA tide data collected at Oyster Landing between May 2001 and July 2002 (9972 hourly measurements). The NOAA data (which is continuous and starts and ends at low tide) gave a mean discharge of 0.02 l s \u00c01 (which is not significantly different than zero) versus our value of \u00c0610 (\u00fe/\u00c089) l s \u00c01 . This confirms our assertion that our storage model ideally should give a mean of zero even though there is asymmetry in the tide curve. For the NOAA data, 47.8% of the discharges occurred on ebb tide. For the NERRS sampling, however, 53.0% occurred on ebb tide, indicating that the NERRS protocol resulted in a significant over sampling of ebb flow. Indeed inspection of the data reveals that on the majority of deployments the first sample was taken on ebb tide rather than at slack low water (which would be ideal) or on rising tide. Accordingly, from the point of view of our methodology, no physical significance can be ascribed to our finding a value of q o less than zero. If it was in fact physically based, the advective export of salt should have been more or less balanced by a dispersive import. However, even though our methodology should not produce an advective export of salt under a regime of unbiased sampling, it nevertheless could produce a meaningful dispersive import. This is because fresh water runoff from adjacent uplands should produce on average a landward decrease in salinity. Thus on flood tide, deviations in salinity and discharge from their tidal means will both be positive, whereas on ebb tide they will both be negative, leading to an overall positive dispersive flux as is observed in our results. Whether this dispersive flux is accurate is, of course, another question. The reasonableness of our dispersive salt flux can be assessed by dividing it by the negative of the mean salinity. This gives an estimate of the mean discharge (\u00c0125 l s \u00c01 ; Table 1 in parentheses) that would produce an advective export of salt equal to its dispersive import. The corrected mean discharge is much closer to the value of \u00c041 l s \u00c01 extrapolated from the Bly Creek study. Given the great range in discharge over a tidal cycle, the corrected mean discharge is likely to have a standard error similar to that of the original (\u00fe/\u00c0 89 l s \u00c01 ; Table 1). If so, the corrected value is not likely to be significantly different from zero. Thus it is also unlikely that the corrected advective fluxes of nutrients and sediments (values in parentheses in the Means column of Table 1) are significantly different from zero. Accordingly, in the following paragraphs we restrict our presentation of the results to the dispersive fluxes, which we argue should be largely unaffected by a reduction in the mean discharge from \u00c0610 l s \u00c01 to \u00c0125 l s \u00c01 . Although it is unclear how one might recalculate the dispersive fluxes after such a correction, it is clear that the deviations in concentration would remain unchanged. If one were to simply add 485 l s \u00c01 to each discharge so as to raise the mean to \u00c0125 l s \u00c01 , it might change the sign as well as the magnitude of some of the discharges (and their deviations) near low tide but would have no effect on their sign and little effect on their magnitude at higher tidal stages when magnitudes are much greater than the magnitude of the tidal mean. Thus the estimated mean dispersive fluxes obtained here are not likely to be greatly different from those that would have been obtained had the sampling protocol been unbiased. As shown in Table 1 none of the particulate constituents have statistically significant dispersive fluxes, as all of them have means that lie within two standard errors from zero. On the other hand all of the dissolved constituents have significant fluxes, as their means lie beyond two standard errors from zero. Except for NN, all of the dissolved nutrients are exported from the basin. Although the dispersive flux of DOP is statistically significant, its physical significance is clouded by the fact that a large number of its concentration values turned out to be negative. This resulted largely from the fact that negative concentrations were determined on many of the filtered samples that were subjected to the persulfate digestion, indicating analytical problems with this procedure. The seasonal patterns of the concentrations and dispersive fluxes of nutrients and salt are shown on Figs. 3e5. The asterisks shown on these figures indicate months when the fluxes lay two or more standard errors from zero. Significant salt imports occur during July, August and September while nominal, but non-significant, exports during November, December and January (Fig. 3a). Salinity ranges from about 27 ppt in winter to about 33 ppt in summer due to dilution of coastal waters in winter by the seasonally high discharge of the major rivers draining the Atlantic watershed of the southeastern United States. During summer, rainfall is more localized in thunderstorms which can generate runoff from the nearby uplands but not cause widespread dilution of coastal waters. As a result, landward dispersive gradients in salinity can develop during summer in small marsh basins fringing the uplands. Significant dispersive exports of NH 4 , DON, and PO 4 tend to occur in summer when the concentrations of these constituents are generally higher than their annual means (Figs. 4 and 5a, respectively). Significant DOC exports also tend to occur in summer but there is no clear seasonal pattern in its concentration (Fig. 5b). The PO 4 flux seems to fluctuate between significant exports in summer and significant imports in winter, with the larger summer exports leading to an annual export (Table 1). There is also a suggestion that with more sampling a similar pattern may eventually emerge for NN and NH 4 (Figs. 3b and 4a)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To assess the reasonableness of the results obtained in this study, we converted the dispersive fluxes shown in Table 1 to annual unit area budgets for comparison with those reported by Dame (1989) and Dame et al. (1991) for the adjacent Bly Creek basin. These comparisons are presented in Table 2, which shows that the budgets for the two basins are in reasonably good agreement. The only disagreement as regards the sign of the budget is for PN, which in neither study has a mean flux that is significantly different from zero. The only constituents that have significant budgets in both basins are DOC and DON. The budgets for these two constituents in the Crab Haul Creek basin are about half as large as those in the Bly Creek basin. Based on the fact that the basin means for both constituents are separated by about three standard errors, it appears that these differences are significant. These differences perhaps can be explained by the fact that the Crab Haul Creek basin, being more landward, is in an earlier stage of ecological succession from forest into marsh and has a broad area of unchanneled high marsh in its distal end. It thus has a greater fraction of its area in marsh, as opposed to channel, than does the Bly Creek basin. The Bly Creek study (Dame et al., 1991) indicates that on a unit area basis the marsh flume exports substantially less DOC and DON than the basin as a whole (\u00c037 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 versus \u00c0270 g C m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 and 9.8 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 versus 11.8 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 respectively). Thus the greater fractional area of marsh in the Crab Haul Creek basin may be responsible for its lesser export of DOC and DON. Alternatively, if the storage curve (Fig. 2) underestimates discharges, differences such as those observed could result. It is also possible that the results obtained in the one-year Bly Creek study are not representative of the longterm means.   There is also a rough agreement in the seasonal patterns of concentrations and fluxes between the two basins. The concentrations and fluxes of PO 4 in both basins show higher concentrations and greater exports in summer. Greater exports of NH 4 and NN also tend to occur in summer in both basins but there is no seasonal pattern in the DON flux in the Bly Creek basin. On the other hand, the mean DON concentration in the Bly Creek basin is somewhat lower than that in the Crab Haul Creek basin (w20 mM versus 25 mM). Another discrepancy is that DOC export in the Bly Creek basin tended to occur in winter and early spring rather than in summer (compare Fig. 5b in this paper with Fig. 4 in Williams et al., 1992). Nonetheless the general agreement between the two basins as to the direction and magnitude of the annual budgets, together with the similar seasonal patterns in fluxes, indicates that the dispersive fluxes generated by the NERRS water chemistry data and our storage model provide valid information and constraints on biogeochemical processes operating in the Crab Haul Creek basin. Unfortunately the precision for determining particulate fluxes is not good enough to provide useful information about sedimentary processes operating in the basin. At this point the Crab Haul Creek results do not allow us to extend or contradict the conclusions reached by Dame et al. (1991) regarding the sources and biogeochemical processes governing material fluxes in the Bly Creek basin. Many of their conclusions, however, must be regarded as speculative as only the fluxes of DOC and DON were statistically significant in the Bly Creek basin. On the other hand, they had the benefit of flux results from the marsh and oyster reef flumes (as well as measurements of material inputs via rainfall and fresh water runoff) in reaching their conclusions regarding controls on basin fluxes. Thus from this assemblage of data they were able to show that for the overall basin an N export of 6515 kg yr \u00c01 is partly balanced by inputs of N via fresh water runoff and rainfall plus a net export of N (mainly in the form of DON) from the vegetated marsh, the total of which contribute 3976 kg N yr \u00c01 to the overall export, leaving a deficit of 2539 kg N yr \u00c01 . The net export of N from the vegetated marsh (2533 kg N yr \u00c01 ) falls in the range N fixation rates (450e3077 kg N yr \u00c01 ) estimated for the vegetated marsh (Whiting and Morris, 1986). Thus to balance the overall deficit requires either an additional 2500 kg yr \u00c01 of N fixation in the channel environment or the seepage of DON rich ground water from the channel bottom. Given the fact that the area of the vegetated marsh is roughly five times greater than that of the channel environment, the rate of N fixation in the channel environment would have to be on the order of 20 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 , which is about four times greater than the rate on the vegetated marsh (4.7 g N m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) implied by the measured net export from the marsh flume. Water column and benthic fixation in the channel at such a high rate seems unreasonable. On the other hand, if the rate of N fixation inferred from the marsh flume results are representative of the vegetated marsh in the Crab Haul Creek basin, it could support about 60% of the statistically significant exports of DON \u00fe NH 4 -NN as compared to only 30% of the export of TN from the Bly Creek basin. This further supports the reasonableness of our results and illustrates the need for accurate flux measurements in assessing nutrient budgets in marsh basins. Unlike C and N, the export of P cannot be supported by fixation, nor by the tiny inputs associated with rain and fresh water runoff (Dame et al., 1991). Thus taken at face value the export of TP from the Crab Haul Creek basin is unreasonable. As in the Bly Creek basin, one would expect P to be imported in particulate form and exported as PO 4 and perhaps as DOP. To the extent that P accumulates in accreting marsh sediments, the import of P should exceed its export. With continued sampling this may yet prove to be the case in the Crab Haul Creek basin. The emergence of such a pattern in the Crab Haul Creek basin, however, may also require improvements in the NERRS sampling and analyses protocols. In particular, the persulfate digestion procedure may not liberate P adsorbed or occluded in iron hydroxide coating minerals in the suspended sediment and should perhaps be replaced by hot acid hydrolysis. When buried in the anoxic environment of marsh soils, these forms of P become dissolved PO 4 in the marsh pore water. An interesting feature of the Bly Creek P flux is that the vegetated marsh imports PO 4 in an amount that is slightly greater than the PO 4 exported from the basin as a whole, a situation that also holds for NH 4 . Thus again one must wonder whether DON, NH 4 and PO 4 are supplied to the creek water column during its tidal residence in the basin by groundwater seepage from marsh sediments and/or by decomposition. With continued sampling the NERRS water chemistry database will become an increasingly valuable resource for addressing the questions outlined above. To enhance this value we suggest the following additions and modifications to the NERRS protocol. First, to increase the resolution of particulate fluxes and resolve diurnal effects, we recommend that the bihourly sampling at Oyster Landing be expanded to hourly sampling. Second, studies should be undertaken to verify the storage model used here to estimate discharges. This could be done by making a topographic map of the Crab Haul Creek basin from which a topography-based storage curve could be constructed. Comparison of the two curves might reveal whether significant sheet flow outside the channel occurs in the basin. In addition, a more accurate dischargebased storage curve could probably be obtained using spatially dense acoustic Doppler current measurements over a greater number of tidal cycles. Such a database could also be used to calibrate and validate a numerical model of tidal flow in the basin, which in turn might be a more accurate method for hindcasting discharges. In any case it is imperative that the high precision NOAA tide gauge at Oyster Landing be maintained in operational condition so that the tide need not be hindcasted. Third, the accuracy and precision of the suspended sediment concentrations could be improved by sampling at hourly rather than bihourly intervals. Finally, sequential extraction of P from the suspended sediment is needed to infer the biogeochemical mechanisms that support the export of PO 4 . The target fractions for such extraction should be the particulate organic fraction and that adsorbed on and occluded in mineral grains, as these are likely the largest and most biologically active fractions. Hopefully the fluxes of all of the NERRS water chemistry constituents will eventually achieve statistical significance at both annual and monthly levels. If this occurs, a powerful case could then be made to undertake studies in the Crab Haul Creek basin aimed at elucidating the biogeochemical processes governing these fluxes."}]
