Social researchers at Charles Sturt University (CSU) were commissioned to implement a survey of rural landholders across the North Central CMA region [ Figure 1] during 2014. The CSU team applied an approach developed by Professor Allan Curtis that gathers spatially-referenced data from landholders to address the specific needs of regional NRM practitioners. Surveys were addressed to a random sample of 1,900, of the approximately 23,000 owners of rural properties larger than 10 hectares, in the North Central CMA region. Eleven Councils provided access to their ratepayer lists, while three Councils conducted the mail out process. A response rate of 48% was achieved (794 completed surveys returned from an adjusted sample of 1,646). Tests for non-respondent bias based on comparisons with Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data using property size, gender, age and participation in Landcare suggest the survey respondents are representative of the wider cohort of rural landholders in the region. A key strength of this research approach is that information is gathered from a large, random sample of rural landholders (i.e. 1900 received surveys). No other research approach (e.g. public meetings, workshops, focus groups, interviews) can provide the North Central CMA with the same level of confidence in regards to reliable information from a large sample of rural landholders. "}, {"section_title": "Relationship between the executive summary and the technical report", "text": "The technical report is structured around the different survey topics, with summaries of those data for the region and, subsequently, for each of the 14 local government areas (LGA) and the three priority asset classes identified by the North Central CMA Regional Catchment Strategy (RCS) (i.e. wetlands, waterways and biodiversity). Those brief summaries are not repeated in this Executive Summary. Instead, we focus on providing the North Central CMA with key insights into how to use those data to more effectively engage rural landholders. We also explain the relationship of this technical report to other outputs of the research process, provide an overview of the research context and approach, and present a \"catchment profile\" using selected results [ Table 1]. The regional profile masks the diversity amongst rural landholders across the region [refer to Figure 5 for an example] but provides important context for our discussion about engagement. The technical report is a key research output but is only part of a suite of outputs intended for different audiences. The technical report provides a long-term record that North Central CMA staff and other NRM practitioners (e.g. those working in nongovernment organisations) can use when they are developing or implementing projects in the region. The technical report will be printed as a book and will be available as a pdf on the North Central CMA's website. Two additional mini-reports providing the results of additional analysis of the climate change and soils topics will support North Central CMA engagement with landholders around climate change and support the implementation of the North Central CMA soil health program. Workshops will be held with North Central CMA staff, Board members and Shire Councils to present and discuss research results. A summary brochure will be mailed to all survey respondents and posted on the North Central CMA's website."}, {"section_title": "The benefits of spatially-referenced survey data", "text": "The survey data are spatially-referenced (i.e. tied to each property location) and it is therefore possible, while protecting the identity of individuals, to combine data according to different geographies. As explained, the technical report provides summaries of those data for the region, each LGA and the three key assets. Working with the CSU researchers, the North Central CMA has the capacity to \"cut\" the survey data for any geography, simply by overlaying another layer using a Geographic Information System (GIS). For example, it would be possible to interrogate the data set to provide information about groundwater irrigators, either across the region or for a part of the region. At the request of the North Central CMA we have provided an example of the information that can be provided at the district-scale profile in the technical report [see section 6.4 of the report]. v A key goal for Victoria's CMAs is to improve the condition of specific environmental assets, including those that underpin profitable agriculture. This is a challenging mission. We live in an increasingly modified environment and NRM practitioners are often attempting to address \"wicked problems\" where the way forward and the end goal are often problematic; and CMAs have limited ability (agency) to accomplish their goals without the support of other stakeholders. Rural landholders are key stakeholders in regional NRM because they own most rural land in Victoria; their management actions directly influence the condition of soil, water and biodiversity assets; and in turn, the condition of those assets influences their livelihoods and well-being. Engaging rural landholders in practice change is complex and difficult, not least because the private benefits of action by rural landholders to address environmental degradation are often uncertain. There is also a potentially large set of factors (personal, societal) influencing their decisions and these vary according to each technology, each landholder, each farming context and over time (Curtis & Mendham, 2011). To address this challenge, researchers have drawn upon established theory (e.g. the Theory of Planned Behaviour) and considerable empirical research to identify key variables expected to influence rural landholder decisions. A key lesson is that there are important personal factors such as values, beliefs and personal norms that NRM practitioners cannot readily influence but that they need to understand if they are to effectively engage rural landholders. At the same time, we also know that interventions that focus on engaging and building human capital (e.g. knowledge or skills) and social capital (e.g. build trust, establish networks, create social norms), including through participation in field days and trials, involvement in short courses and group discussions, can lead to changes in land use and management. The 2014 survey included topics examining these sets of factors."}, {"section_title": "Research context: evaluation", "text": "The 2014 survey also gathered information to address the evaluation challenge faced by the North Central CMA. In this section we provide an explanation of that challenge and how the North Central CMA will be able to use the 2014 data as a benchmark. The North Central CMA and the CSU research team have committed to undertake a similar survey in 2019 that will provide a second data point for the evaluation of program outcomes. As a first step in the evaluation process, NRM program managers are expected to explain the \"logic\" of their programs. That is, they are asked to identify the chain of actions expected to achieve the condition target(s) they have identified as their objective(s). If the way forward can be clearly identified, program managers may identify a current best practice, or current recommended practice (CRP), to be implemented and then purchase that work or implement it themselves. For example, a key step to achieving a biodiversity objective might be to address a threatening process and the most effective way to do that could be to employ a contractor to carry out the work. However, program implementation is typically not that straightforward. If changes in human capital (e.g. knowledge or skills) and social capital (e.g. build trust, establish networks, create social norms) are key steps towards achieving practice change, measures to evaluate those intermediate objectives are required. For example, scientists and farmers may not know how to maintain soil health over the long-term in cropping systems. Program managers may decide that investing in platforms such as soil health groups that facilitate dialogue, learning and action by farmers may be the best approach. The 2014 survey included 17 items exploring the implementation of CRP. Some CRP items were cropping or grazing specific, while others had a biodiversity focus. Other survey topics included measures of human (e.g. knowledge of NRM) and social (e.g. participation in networks and other local organisations) capital expected to contribute to implementation of those CRP. From an evaluation perspective, the 2014 survey data will provide the benchmark to assess progress using data gathered in 2019 and beyond."}, {"section_title": "Engaging rural landholders", "text": "Our discussion in this section will focus on the different objectives the North Central CMA might have for engagement with rural landholders. For each of those objectives, we identify the key survey topic(s) and then provide some explanation and illustration of how survey data could be used by the North Central CMA staff and Board members. In broad terms, those engagement objectives could include: 1. Gathering information from landholders to inform North Central CMA priority setting (Issues topic) 2. Raising awareness of NRM and the role of the North Central CMA/ building community support for NRM (Sources of information; Values; Issues; Trust in North Central CMA; Involvement in local organisations) 3. Responding effectively to concerns about emerging issues, including the social acceptability of actions by the North Central CMA (Values; Beliefs; Attitudes; Issues; Trust in the North Central CMA; Involvement in local organisations) 4. Engaging landholders in North Central CMA projects to achieve sustainable agriculture and NRM objectives (Implementation of CRP; Confidence in CRP: Values; Beliefs; Attitudes; Personal and social norms; Occupational identity; Issues; Knowledge; Trust in the North Central CMA; Risk interpretation; Involvement in local organisations; Sources of information; Long-term plans)."}, {"section_title": "Informing priority setting", "text": "The survey included a section exploring the importance of a range of issues at the district (13 items) [ Figure 2] and property (7 items) scales [ Figure 3].

Those data can also be \"cut\" to provide more detailed insight into the key issues for rural landholders in different locations or with different social and farming attributes, including their occupation, age and membership of local organisations. The technical report provides the results of those analyses [see sections 5 and 6]. These data enable the North Central CMA to reflect on the extent the organisation's current priorities and resource allocation align with rural landholder concerns generally; and to more effectively engage with rural landholders in specific contexts by acknowledging or addressing the issues they are concerned about. A key finding is that most landholders are concerned about a mix of social, economic and environmental issues. Of course, concern about issues is a reflection of the extent key values are threatened. North Central CMA staff should look for opportunities to highlight the extent North Central CMA projects will underpin the important social, x economic and environmental values of rural landholders (see below), even if those values are not the focus of the funding body."}, {"section_title": "Raising awareness of NRM and the role of the North Central CMA across the region", "text": "For a variety of reasons the North Central CMA will seek to raise awareness of the organisation and of NRM amongst all or a particular cohort of rural landholders. Yes, most effort will be focused on landholders in priority areas (e.g. the three key environmental assets) but landscapes cannot be treated as separate components and priorities may change over time. For example, the North Central CMA is likely to want to establish itself as a credible, trustworthy organisation; build awareness of existing and emerging issues so that landholders will take appropriate action, including outside North Central CMA projects; and develop positive attitudes and social norms that will enhance long-term commitment to environmental stewardship. Survey results provide insights about each of these topics. Survey data on the sources of information for NRM suggests the North Central CMA has engaged a wide audience across the region. For example, 52% of respondents identified the North Central CMA as a source of information and that was similar for those who identified as Full-time Farmers (57%) and Part-time Farmers (50%), but was lower for Non-Farmers (39%). The North Central CMA was more frequently identified as a source of information than government departments (43%), Landcare (39%), agricultural consultants (23%) or environmental organisations (22%). More traditional mediums such as newspapers (76%), books/magazines/journals (70%), mailed brochures/leaflets/community newsletters (65%), and radio (54%) were identified as information sources more frequently than the internet (40%) or social media (6%). The importance of informal sources was highlighted by the high rating (71%) attributed to friends/neighbours/family. Information in the survey also suggests that the established local organisations will not engage the majority of rural landholders in the North Central CMA region. For example, 36% of respondents were members of Landcare, 15% were members of a commodity group and 8% were part of a soil health group. As is explained later, those are important platforms for dialogue, learning and action but may not be the best vehicles for wider rural landholder awareness campaigns. The survey also provides useful insights about the content or \"message\" for these types of engagement activities to be effective. For example, three of the highest rated values (those that guide our lives) focused on biospheric values, suggesting that at least twothirds of all respondents gave a high priority to the environment. This finding suggests that the North Central CMA can be confident that most rural landholders have values consistent with those that the North Central CMA is committed to. However, the highest rated (92%) value statement focused on the social value of Looking after my family and their needs, while Creating wealth and striving for a financially profitable business was rated as important by almost two-thirds of respondents, suggesting that any appeals to landholders should embrace these values and where possible, establish a clear link between environmental condition and human well-being. Working for the welfare of xi others was rated as important by half of the respondents suggesting that there is a substantial reservoir of community spirit amongst the respondents that can lead to volunteer activity. The survey also explored the importance of values that respondents attach to their properties. Those data support the results and interpretations in the previous paragraph, but provide some additional insights into the content of engagement activities or when the North Central CMA should consider engaging. For example, the majority (82%) of respondents said that the Ability to pass on a healthier environment for future generations was important. Over three-quarters of the respondents said their property was important because it was An attractive place/area to live. Over threequarters of respondents gave a high rating to the Productive value of the soil on my property. Interestingly, 60% of respondents said that their property was important because The opportunity to learn new things was important for them. The last point is consistent with research establishing that learning is a powerful force motivating landholder participation in local organisations. As explained, there appears to be a close alignment between the values of most respondents and the goals of the North Central CMA. That alignment also appears to be there, but not to the same extent, for most of the items assessing beliefs (what is true) and attitudes (what should happen). For example, 62% of respondents agreed (18% were unsure and 18% disagreed) that It is fair that the wider community asks landholders to manage their land in ways that will not cause foreseeable harm to the environment. That is, most rural landholders are prepared to acknowledge they have a duty of care to the environment. However, a small minority does not support the proposition that rural landholders have a duty of care for biodiversity. Similarly, most respondents indicated they thought there were limits to private property rights, but it seems there is a minority that believes private property rights are sovereign. For example, 14% of respondents agreed that Rural landholders should have the right to discharge water from their property, even if that action impacts on others; and 25% agreed that Landholders should have the right to harvest water that falls on their property, even if that action impacts on others. It is impossible to \"please everyone all the time\", but if the North Central CMA is proposing policies, plans or practices that may conflict with these minority views they need to consider the likely scale of opposition and focus on explaining the benefits of proposed interventions for widely held values. Indeed, survey data highlights the extent of qualified support (i.e. social acceptability) for willow removal and the application of environmental water. Only a third of respondents agreed with the statements exploring belief in the efficacy of these policies. However, many respondents selected the \"unsure\" and \"don't know\" response options (44% combined for willow removal; 49% combined for environmental water under Murray-Darling Basin Plan), suggesting there is scope to lift support for these policies if that is considered important. Again, appeals based around widely held values would appear to have the best chance of success. It would also make sense to identify those who are opposed to those interventions and explore the basis for their positions. Trust is an important element of the social capital of any organisation. Where trust in an organisation is high, partners will be more likely to accept advice, enter partnerships to xii develop and implement plans, forgive mistakes and provide positive recommendations to others. A partner's willingness to rely (i.e. trust) is influenced by their assessment of your trustworthiness (i.e. capability; benevolence; and integrity) and by their predisposition to trust. The survey gathered information about trust, trustworthiness and predisposition to trust. Those survey items focused on the management of waterways and wetlands and asked for assessments of trust and trustworthiness for the North Central CMA overall rather than for staff a respondent may be familiar with. There is no benchmark for these trust items, but what is clear is that respondents were more likely to agree than disagree that they could trust the North Central CMA to Provide useful advice about waterways and wetland management. Respondents were a little less positive about being able to Rely (trust) the North Central CMA to provide appropriate financial assistance for waterways and wetlands management. Given the large geographic area, somewhat limited financial resources of CMA and intent to focus on high priority assets it is not surprising that 39% and 53% of respondents selected the \"neutral\" and \"don't know\" response options. There is therefore opportunity for the North Central CMA to build trust. It seems over half of the survey respondents are not predisposed to trust in that 64% agreed that You can't be too careful when dealing with people; and 49% agreed that People are almost always interested only in their own welfare. This latent \"trust deficit\" suggests the North Central CMA needs to consider trust building as a critical goal for the organisation. If that objective is adopted, then activities across the organisation need to be considered in terms of the extent they will demonstrate capability (we do what we say we will do to a high standard); benevolence (we act in the best interests of our landholder partners); and integrity (we follow our values and as far as possible, we can demonstrate we are pursuing values we share with landholders)."}, {"section_title": "Responding to landholder concerns about emerging issues", "text": "From time-to-time the North Central CMA can expect that landholders will raise pressing issues, including as a result of changed seasonal conditions. For example, during drought some landholders may experience water quality issues as a result of irrigation by their neighbours or those upstream; be concerned about the impacts on livelihoods of environmental flows; or raise concerns about native vegetation growing in water courses with the potential to block waterways. During very wet seasons croppers may experience weed loads that prevent the use of low tillage practices or a new weed may appear in their district that has the potential to become established in paddocks and native vegetation. During flood events there may be damage to fencing that has been erected to protect fragile environments but is also used to contain stock within properties. Without going into each of these possible scenarios, information from the survey about the values, beliefs and attitudes of those or similar landholders, the extent they are engaged through Landcare or other local platforms, and their trust in the North Central CMA and predisposition to trust others should provide a solid foundation for North Central CMA staff to develop a way forward. xiii"}, {"section_title": "Engaging landholders in North Central CMA projects", "text": "In some situations North Central CMA project managers will be able to identify a CRP that they are confident will accomplish their objective. For example, a key step to achieving a waterway objective might be to address a series of erosion heads in a stream by creating rock spillways to dissipate energy; or to fence a waterway to control stock access to protect bank stability. However, program implementation is often not straight forward, either because the North Central CMA (or anyone else) will not know what to do (e.g. some soil health issues); the North Central CMA will not have sufficient resources to implement the scale of work needed and will have to rely on landholders to make a voluntary contribution (e.g. with some pest animal or weed control); and successful implementation often requires ongoing management and the North Central CMA may not have the resources (typically because of limits to project duration) to ensure that happens (e.g. with willow removal; blackberry control; fox control; fencing riparian areas to manage stock access). In each of these situations the North Central CMA will need to engage rural landholders if they are to achieve their immediate and longer-term objectives. Most of that effort is likely to occur with landholders occupying the three priority assets, but soil health is also a CMA priority and large areas of the catchment are under pasture or crops. Part of the pre-engagement or \"up-front thinking\" should include consideration of the extent of practice change needed to achieve condition targets and then, the extent all landholders need to be engaged. After those questions have been addressed, project managers should reflect on the social and farming characteristics of those landholders they will attempt to engage to make preliminary assessments of the social acceptability of their interventions and of ways to approach landholders. Again, survey data provides useful insights about the topics to be considered in that there were significant relationships between implementation of CRP and items exploring landholder values, beliefs, personal norms and attitudes. Analysis of survey data also confirmed the efficacy of many of the \"levers\" at the disposal of the North Central CMA. That is, there is evidence that investment in platforms (e.g. Landcare, commodity groups, soil health groups) and activities expected to enhance knowledge, skills and confidence in CRP (e.g. field days, property management planning, completing a short course) lead to the implementation of CRP. To the extent that most landholders are not engaged through these three local platforms, there may be scope for additional effort to recruit landholders. Results for the self-assessed knowledge topic also suggest there is a case for further investment in these \"levers\". For example, only 50% of respondents said they had \"sound knowledge\" (i.e. could explain that topic to another or had sufficient understanding to act) about The frequency and rate of fertiliser application to maintain soil productivity across the main soil types on your property; and only 47% said they had sound knowledge about Preparing a farm/property plan allocating land use according to land class. Survey data also suggests there may be limits to confidence in the efficacy of some CRP amongst respondents (refer above for willow removal), including fencing waterways and wetlands to manage stock access; establishing off-stream watering points; and intensive grazing rather than set stocking of paddocks adjacent to waterways and wetlands. xiv The relevance of occupational identity for North Central CMA staff engaging rural landholders was confirmed by analyses establishing significant relationships between 10 of the 17 CRP items and an occupational identity scale developed by Ms Theresa Groth, a CSU PhD candidate. On another survey item 52% selected the Full-time Farmer (FTF) option, 30% Part-time Farmer (PTF) and 18% the Non-Farmer (NF) option [ Figure 4]. Across the region the FTF cohort managed 84% of all land held by respondents, the PTF cohort managed 13%, and the NF cohort managed only 3%. The relative importance of those occupational groups varies across the region by LGA [ Figure 5] and importantly, by environmental asset. For example: \uf0a7 In the Wetlands asset FTF comprise 73%, PTF 16% and NF 12%. \uf0a7 In the Waterways asset FTF comprise 52%, PTF 38% and NF 10%. \uf0a7 In the Biodiversity asset FTF comprise 37%, PTF 31% and NF comprise 32% of landholders. So, each asset has a very different composition of landholders based on occupational identity. What are the implications for North Central CMA project staff? There are significant differences between the three landholder cohorts across a range of social and farming variables that staff engaging landholders should consider, including: their values, enterprise type, hours on property, extent of profitability (60% of PTF reported no on-property profit), knowledge of NRM, membership of local organisations such as Landcare and commodity groups, and their sources of information. While the three cohorts are similar in age, there is a gender difference in that NF were more likely (40%) to be women compared to PTF (16%) or FTF (9%). Those with a higher score on the occupational identity measure (i.e. have a stronger farmer identity) were more likely to place more importance on factors affecting production, be less concerned about any negative impacts of production (e.g. nutrient run-off), obtain greater pride from property activities and have planned for property succession. Those landholders with a lower occupational identity measure (i.e. have a weaker farmer identity) were more likely to place more importance on issues impacting the greater community (e.g. loss of Full-time farmer, n=402: 52% Part-time farmer, n=229: 30% Non-farmer, n=142: 18% biodiversity, impact of dams on run-off, climate change, water use, river health), and see their farming activities as a welcome break from their normal occupation. Interestingly, FTF were much more likely to report they had undertaken tree planting (74%) compared to PTF (55%) and NF (45%). Our view is that this difference reflects the more extensive participation of FTF in local organisations and more extensive contact with the North Central CMA and other organisations committed to revegetation. That finding is consistent with other evidence from social benchmarking surveys in Victoria and suggests that local organisations can establish networks and norms that support revegetation, even when some landholders may be less than enthusiastic proponents. However, the challenge is to ensure there is long-term commitment to active management of revegetated areas amongst those FTF. Data suggesting there is an ongoing need for investment in activities focused on property planning, improving knowledge/understanding and management skills related to soil health, and improving confidence in some CRP draws attention to the reality that much of this work will never end. In part that reflects the ongoing challenge of sustainability given the limits to current knowledge and the potential disruptive impacts of climate change. To the extent that there are trusted local organisations, then the North Central CMA may also want to work through them but should assess the extent they engage a sufficient proportion of landholders (to achieve a scale of implementation that will enable the North Central CMA to achieve condition targets in desired time). In our discussions with North Central CMA staff we have identified a core set of data that should be gathered by all projects when they engage rural landholders. Those data will enable North Central CMA staff to better understand who they are engaging and, as part of that process, to compare their participants with the wider cohort of landholders from the same geography/asset class who responded to the 2014 survey. xvi This research was commissioned by the North Central CMA to provide baseline data that would inform evaluation of the 2014 Regional Catchment Strategy (RCS). Additional financial and in-kind support was provided by CSU and the NCGRT. The principal data collection instrument was a survey mailed to a random sample of rural landholders in the North Central CMA region during 2014 [ Figure 6; Figure 7]. A response rate of 48% (794 completed surveys returned from an adjusted sample of 1646) was achieved. This research draws on a widely accepted methodology for catchment-scale social benchmarking (see Curtis, Byron, & MacKay, 2005). The methodology has been developed and refined through a series of studies across Australia, including in the Goulburn Broken Dryland region (Curtis et al., 2000), the Glenelg Hopkins region (Byron, Curtis, & MacKay, 2004), the Corangamite region (Curtis, Cooke, McDonald, & Mendham, 2006) and in the Wimmera region (Curtis & Byron, 2002;Curtis, McDonald, Mendham, & Sample, 2008;. Readers are advised that two additional reports drawing on survey data have/will be provided to the North Central CMA. These reports provide additional material on topics of particular interest to the North Central CMA: landholder belief in climate change; and landholder engagement in soil health groups.

Assigned values are those that individuals attach to specific physical goods, activities or services (Lockwood, 1999). 'Held' values are ideas or principles that people hold as important to them (Lockwood, 1999) and are generally highly abstract, generic and conceptual, but guide personal action (McIntyre, Moore, & Yuan, 2008). Value orientations are the position a person takes when a particular set of held values are more important to them than other held values (Axelrod, 1994). Individuals can hold more than one value orientation simultaneously (Lockwood, 1999;Stern, 2000). A number of theoretical approaches have been developed and applied to explain the relationship between values and behaviour. Values-Belief-Norm Theory (VBN) explains an individual's motivation for environmental behaviour. It is an important theory that underpins much contemporary social research, including the research we have drawn upon in this project. However, VBN theory may be a better predictor of environmental behaviour by the wider public than rural landholders who are subject to a much larger set of influences (Mazur, Rogers, & Curtis, 2013). VBN theory suggests that behaviour is derived from core elements of personality and belief structures. These inform people's specific beliefs about human-environmental interactions, consequences and an individual's responsibility for taking action. VBN theory proposes a chain of elements, with one component influencing the next. The elements of VBN theory include values, beliefs (awareness of consequences or does the condition of the asset affect yourself, others or the environment; ascribed responsibility beliefs; and general environmental concern), personal norms and behaviour (Stern, 2000). The development of VBN theory focused on values and beliefs about environmental consequences based on three broad value orientations: biospheric (concerns about the biosphere), altruistic (concern for others) and egoistic (concern for self). VBN theory hypothesises that environmental behaviour is more likely if the individual believes that there may be adverse consequences for something that they value highly (Stern, Dietz, & Kalof, 1993). To explore the influence of held values (guiding principles), the survey employed the 12 item scale developed by de Groot and Steg (2007) adapted from Schwartz's value typology that distinguishes between biospheric, egoistic and altruistic values (Schwartz, 1992(Schwartz, , 1994 [ Table 2]. Three items exploring respondents' personal norms relating to soil health were included in the survey [ Table 3]. A number of items exploring respondents' attitudes and beliefs were also included [ Table 4]. Assigned values relating to respondents' properties were assessed using items previously developed by the research team, including in the North Central region (Seymour, Curtis, Pannell, Allan, & Roberts, 2010) [ Table 5].

The survey included one item exploring this topic. Social acceptability refers to aggregate forms of public consent whereby judgements (often about the policies, programs and projects of government agencies) are shared and articulated by an identifiable and politically relevant segment of the population (Brunson 1996 cited in Shindler, Brunson, & Cheek, 2004). Those judgements are focused on the extent that the policy or practice in question is appropriate, preferred, desirable, supported or tolerated (Shindler et al., 2004). Measures of social acceptability can focus on specific policies or practices (i.e. a choice between different practices or scenarios) or involve an overall assessment of the policy or practice. We opted for an item providing an overall assessment of the social acceptability of the practice of willow removal [ Table 6]. The cost of willow removal is justified by improvements in the condition of river banks & river health"}, {"section_title": "Occupational identity", "text": "In Australia and the United States rural areas are becoming increasingly multifunctional, in that many regions are no longer dominated by agriculture but are shaped by a mix of production, consumption and conservation values (Abrams & Bliss, 2012;Holmes, 2006). There is evidence that landholders who make their living from agriculture adopt different NRM practices from those who are part-time farmers or non-farmers (Gosnell, Haggerty, & Byorth, 2007;Mendham & Curtis, 2010). These differences also appear in comparisons of newer and longer-term landholders. It seems that an important difference between new and longer term owners is related to a production or consumption orientation (Mendham, Curtis, & Millar, 2012). New owners are often more interested in the recreation and conservation values of their properties (Mendham et al., 2012). As the non-farmer cohort of rural landholders increases, it is expected that occupational identity will be an increasingly important factor affecting NRM (Gosnell et al., 2007;Mendham et al., 2012). As Ikutegbe, Gill, and Klepeis (2014) illustrated, most existing landholder classifications are based on proxy measures rather that direct measures of occupational identity. Those proxy measures typically include economic (property profit or income), social (group affiliation) and/or environmental (land management practices such as fencing waterways) (Jongeneel, Polman, & Slangen, 2008;Sorice, Kreuter, Wilcox, & Fox III, 2012). Moreover, as Emtage, Herbohn, and Harrison (2006) found, there has been limited attention given to the non-farming cohort of landholders in rural landscapes. Some quantitative studies have asked respondents to self-declare their occupation using either a tick-the-box or an open-ended question Race, Curtis, & Sample, 2012). This approach has intuitive appeal, is efficient in that the item(s) occupy a small space in a survey and has been shown to effectively distinguish farmers and non-farmer landholders (Groth, Curtis, Mendham, & Toman, 2014;Postmes, Haslam, & Jans, 2013). However, Groth et al. (2014) concluded that self-identification alone is likely to be inadequate for researchers seeking in-depth understanding of the nature and role of occupational identity in NRM. The 2014 social benchmarking survey in the North Central region is the first natural resources example of research in any country that addresses that challenge in a systematic way by applying the Collective Identity Construct that is widely accepted in psychology (see below).\nSocial researchers prefer multiple item scales over single-item measures of complex constructs such as occupational identity. Seventeen items from Ashmore's CIC [refer to section 2.4] were adapted for the social benchmarking survey [refer to Appendix 1 for a copy of the survey]. That is, the wording of each statement in the original CIC was altered to ensure that the item was appropriate for the NRM context in the North Central region. For example, one statement was modified from I am a typical group member to I consider myself to be a typical agricultural producer in this area. As part of survey pre-testing particular attention was given to the occupational identity collective identity construct (OI CIC) items and further revisions made to some items. Social researchers have a number of ways to test for scale reliability and validity. For a scale to be reliable, scale items should 'move' together in response to other variables. That is, the scale is a reliable measure of a construct (e.g. OI CIC) if all items in the scale are correlated in the same direction (i.e. positively or negatively) (DeVellis, 2003). Scale reliability is usually assessed by testing for item-to-item correlations and items that are not correlated and therefore do not enhance the reliability of the scale are subsequently removed. In this study, 12 of the 17 OI CIC items formed a reliable scale with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.875, which is above the minimum recommended (0.7) indicating that the scale is a reliable measure. In summary, five items were removed from the original CIC scale and the results of analyses using the abbreviated scale are reported. Scale validity is assessed in a variety of ways including content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. Given the limitations of space, those tests will not be reported here but will be part of Theresa Groth's doctoral thesis and subsequent journal papers. In brief, we are confident of scale validity given the scale is based on sound theory and has been applied in a range of research contexts with expected relationships between the scale and independent variables such as values. Almost all respondents completed every OI CIC scale item. For example, nine of the 12 scale items were completed by more than 96% of respondents. The three items asking respondents about farmer friendships, land area owned, and time spent on property were completed by between 89% and 93% of respondents. In this section we explore the application of occupational identity to distinguish landholders. A discussion of respondents' occupations, selection of occupational identity descriptor and OI CIC scale scores will follow. The relationship between the three items will be examined before a discussion of how occupational identity influences NRM by rural landholders in the North Central region."}, {"section_title": "Connection between occupational identity and the collective identity construct", "text": "An occupational identity (OI) is one in which its \"members' sense of identity is closely tied to its occupation\" (Carroll & Lee, 1990). Occupational identities are just one of many collective identities that individuals hold (Burke & Stets, 2009). Each individual has multilayered, complex and continually changing identities based on the social networks and positions they occupy, all of which are influenced by the particular social context (Burke & Stets, 2009). The Collective Identity Construct (CIC) (Ashmore, Deaux, & McLaughlin-Volpe, 2004) is based on identity theory and contains seven distinct dimensions that measure the relative strength of an individual's collective identity [ Table 7].

"}, {"section_title": "Trust and trustworthiness: waterways and wetlands management", "text": "Multiple benefits of building trust between communities and NRM agencies have been identified in the literature and there have been some attempts to distinguish between trust and trustworthiness (Sharp, 2010). Trust may be considered a unique form of a relationship that entails vulnerability to and uncertainty about another party's actions when one or both parties are dependent on the other to fulfil its interests (Earle, Siegrist, & Gutscher, 2007;Mollering, 2006;Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998;Sharp & Curtis, 2014). Research suggests that trust (i.e. willingness to rely on another) is based on positive expectations that the other party will fulfil its obligations in the relationship (i.e. trust is based on perceptions of trustworthiness) (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995;Rousseau et al., 1998). Therefore, trustworthiness is a quality of the person being trusted (i.e. the trustee). In contrast, trusting is something that the person doing the trusting (i.e. the trustor) does. Mayer et al. (1995) state that trustworthiness is comprised of three characteristics, including: \uf0a7 Ability: trustor perceptions of the trustee's knowledge, skills and competencies. \uf0a7 Benevolence: the extent to which a trustor believes that a trustee will act in the best interest of the trustor. \uf0a7 Integrity: the extent to which the trustor perceives the trustee as acting in accord with a set of values and norms shared with or acceptable to the trustor, or acts consistently with the values the trustee espouses. For NRM managers, distinguishing between trust and trustworthiness provides a better understanding of both the intentions of community members to rely on NRM agencies, as well as the characteristics of the agencies and their staff which contribute to trusting relationships in NRM (Sharp, Thwaites, Curtis, & Millar, 2013). In this survey we aimed to measure agency trustworthiness (ability, benevolence and integrity). Intention to trust was measured using two items which captured respondents' willingness to rely on the North Central CMA (Sharp, 2010). The North Central CMA indicated that waterways and wetlands management was the topic they wished to focus on for survey items exploring trust and trustworthiness and risk interpretation (see following section). The five survey items measuring trust and trustworthiness for waterways and wetlands management are provided in Table 9. We also included measures of respondents' predisposition to trust (Smith, Leahy, Anderson, & Davenport, 2013). Individuals' dispositional trust, or their general tendency to trust or distrust others, is a relatively stable personality characteristic that might affect the extent of trust placed in a NRM agency (Smith et al., 2013). Research suggests that this may depend on whether individuals have specific knowledge or experience with the agency. When individuals lack information and experience with the management agency, they may default to their disposition toward society as a whole (Leahy & Anderson, 2008) [ Table 10].  Table 10 Measures of dispositional trust"}, {"section_title": "Measures of dispositional trust", "text": "You can't be too careful when dealing with people People are almost always interested only in their own welfare One has to be alert or someone is likely to take advantage of you"}, {"section_title": "Risk interpretation: waterways and wetlands management", "text": "Risk interpretation influences the social acceptability of and compliance with rules and regulations. Understanding how stakeholders and the broader community perceive risk can assist policy makers more effectively engage stakeholders (Trettin & Musham, 2000). It can also assist in the establishment of more socially acceptable policies and programs (Shindler, Brunson, & Stankey, 2002). 'Lay' and 'expert' interpretations of risk often differ. For example, the public is generally more averse to very unlikely but highly catastrophic or irreversible events than they are to more likely, everyday events. In that way, lay assessments of risk can be seen to deviate from what a technical risk assessment might consider as being rational. Important influences on public perception of risk include: having personal control over the risk; familiarity with the hazard; perception of equitable sharing of risks and benefits; the opportunity to blame a person/institution for the creation of the risk; and beliefs and attitudes about the nature, consequences, history and justifiability of the risk (Slovic, 2000;Zinn & Taylor-Gooby, 2006). Differences between the way people perceive and respond to risks are critical to understanding how best to manage and communicate about risk (Slovic, 1999). Older forms of risk communication tended to define the public as na\u00efve. Risk communication was perceived as a one-way process conducted in order to increase the public's knowledge with the aim of counteracting irrational opinions (Gutteling & Kuttschreuter, 2002;Rowan, 1994). The end result of such approaches was often to reinforce public suspicion of the organisation or agency (Slovic, 1999). Newer models of risk communication emphasise the socially constructed nature of risk, the value of different forms of knowledge, and the need for greater levels of meaningful public participation in decision making (Slovic, 1999). Items exploring three dimensions of risk interpreation were developed for the waterways and wetlands management topic, including: the reversibility of the risk, distribution of benefits, and observability (McDaniels, Axelrod, Cavanagh, & Slovic, 1997) [ Table 11].  (Pannell et al., 2006). Empirical evidence indicates that farmers vary widely in their personal degree of risk aversion and this affects a landholder's tendency to adopt an innovation or practice (Abadi Ghadim & Pannell, 2003). We included three items from a general risk disposition scale to explore respondents' predisposition to risk (Ree M. Meertens & Ren\u00e9 Lion, 2008) [ Table 12].

Census information is not available below a 200 household aggregation. This level of aggregation reduces the usefulness of data, particularly when sub-regional contexts are so different, as for the North Central region. This project employed a mail survey to collect baseline socio-economic data to underpin investment in NRM by landholders and government through the North Central CMA RCS. Survey data will complement existing data sources, including the Australian Bureau of Statistic's Household and Farm censuses. A draft survey instrument was developed over a period of months with the North Central CMA project steering committee. The draft survey was then pretested at two workshops, one with four landholders in Kyneton on the 13 th of February 2014, and one with six landholders in Kerang on the 14 th of February 2014. These two locations were selected as they represented the different land use and ownership characteristics of the catchment."}, {"section_title": "Topics included in the mail survey", "text": "Private landholders manage large parts of most Victorian catchments. Effecting behavioural change in private landholders is a complex task. In a widely cited synthesis paper, Pannell et al. (2006) drew on their backgrounds in economics, psychology and sociology, and extensive research experience, to suggest a framework for exploring adoption that identifies four broad sets of factors, including: \uf0a7 Nature of the practice: trialability, observability, complexity, extent of re-skilling required, extent the practice fits with existing farming systems and lifestyle, cost and time for returns to accrue, and whether it is a substantial improvement on what already exists. \uf0a7 Personal characteristics of the landholder and their immediate family: occupation, education levels, knowledge, skills, length of experience in the area/as a land manager, extent they are risk takers, whether they are introverts/extroverts, level of income, stage of life, if there is to be farm family succession, and extent of their personal network. \uf0a7 Wider social context: prevailing norms, information flows through networks, the existence and activities of local organisations, and the level of trust in extension agents. \uf0a7 Nature of any intervention/learning process: regulation, market-based instrument, grant program, and group processes. Drawing on this framework and experience in successive surveys across Australian catchments, the CSU team, working with the North Central CMA steering committee, selected a number of topics to include in the survey that were likely to explain differences in the level of adoption of CRP. CRP are those behaviours that landholders have been encouraged to adopt (current best practice) to achieve desired sustainable agriculture and environmental outcomes. Topics included in the survey explore factors from each of the four sets of topics in the Pannell et al. (2006) framework. In collaboration with the North Central CMA, we identified the topics listed below for inclusion in the 2014 survey (a copy of the survey instrument is included as Appendix 1): \uf0a7 long-term plans for the property \uf0a7 issues of concern at property and district scales \uf0a7 beliefs and attitudes about roles and responsibilities of different NRM actors \uf0a7 attitudes about the management of wetlands \uf0a7 belief in climate change \uf0a7 trust in the North Central CMA \uf0a7 predisposition to risk and trust \uf0a7 values attached to the property and held values \uf0a7 knowledge of NRM processes and practices \uf0a7 confidence in CRP for improvement in resource condition \uf0a7 sources of information about NRM \uf0a7 land use and enterprise mix \uf0a7 implementation of CRP for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation \uf0a7 involvement in NRM programs \uf0a7 background social and farming topics (e.g. occupation, place of residence, property size, on and off-property work and income) Respondents were invited to include additional comments in the survey about any topics covered or other aspects of land and management in the North Central region.

There were 17 items exploring the adoption of CRP in the survey. Some items were cropping or grazing specific, while others applied to all or most landholders. Where relevant, items included a 'Not Applicable' option. Some items referred to the total time of property management while others asked about actions in the past five years or 12 months of property ownership [ Table 13]. "}, {"section_title": "The mail survey process", "text": "The survey design and mail out procedure employed a modified Dillman (1978) process that has been refined through the experience of successive catchment surveys in Australia. A detailed explanation is provided in Curtis et al. (2005). Dillman's Total Design Method provides specific advice about survey design and involves a series of survey mail outs and reminder cards over a period of three months to achieve response rates above those often accepted by researchers. Surveys were addressed to property owners identified from the Shire ratepayer lists. Eleven Councils provided access to their ratepayer lists, while three Councils conducted the mail out process on the research team's behalf. Using the Shire ratepayer lists the research team generated a random sample of approximately 2200 owners of properties greater than 10 hectares. Using GIS, each property was assigned to the LGA in which the centre of the property was located; and to the asset that any property boundary crossed. In a number of cases a property could be assigned to two assets. In these instances, the property was assigned to the asset with the smallest number of total properties assigned to that asset. Following the original random selection there were insufficient numbers for a statistically useful sample for a number of LGA and assets. An extra random sample was conducted to boost those numbers to a minimum of 75 respondents in each LGA or asset. Subsequent examination of the mailing list identified a number of multiple listings of the same owners and public land which were then removed. A total of 1939 surveys [Table 14; Table 15] were posted out from a total of 23,147 properties greater than ten hectares within the North Central CMA region. A response rate of 48% was achieved with 794 usable completed surveys returned. Thirty-one surveys were returned to sender; 145 people who received a survey declined to participate, citing various reasons (sold/leased out property, illness, too old, too busy, not in North Central CMA, property less than 10 ha, no faith in government, bush block); and 119 surveys were returned blank (respondents were asked to either call the 1800 number or return the blank survey if they did not wish to participate).  All data collection methods have their strengths and limitations. A survey is a costeffective way of gathering data from a large number of potential informants or stakeholders, and if carefully developed, can provide reliable information for analyses that produce useful and robust findings. Social scientists are often asked about the impact of non-responses on the reliability of findings from surveys. In the past the research team has aimed for a 60% response rate for surveys mailed to rural landholders in Australia. Our view is that a 60% response rate represents current \"best-practice\" and that with 60% of a substantial sample, non-responses are unlikely to significantly change results. Our recent experience suggests that it is unrealistic to aim much higher than 50% for a response rate for a survey to rural landholders. Of course, non-respondents may be different to respondents. Our experience where we have compared respondents to social benchmarking surveys to the wider population is that respondents are no different to the wider population of rural landholders in terms of median property size and Landcare participation (Curtis & Mendham, 2011). Our view is that there are many reasons for non-responses, and that non-respondents are unlikely to be a homogenous group and therefore, not that different to respondents. Researchers can attempt to address the potential issue of non-response bias by comparing respondents with the population their sample was drawn from or by comparing non-respondents with respondents. The former can be accomplished through comparisons based on a limited range of data. The latter can be accomplished by contacting non-respondents, typically by phone, and gathering a limited range of data included in the survey. Both approaches have their limitations in that population and household census data are for the entire population (rural and urban) and researchers need to focus on rural balance and on age cohorts that are comparable with the profile of rural landholders (i.e. not youth). Another complication is that many non-respondents will not respond to telephone calls. For this study, we have been able to compare survey respondents with the respondents to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Rural Environment and Agricultural Commodities Survey 2012-2013 (for mean age, gender and mean property size), and the 2011-12 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (for Landcare membership) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014a, 2014b) from within the North Central CMA region. Comparisons of the two groups indicated there were no significant differences on property size or the proportion of respondents who were male/female. However, a slightly higher proportion of North Central CMA survey respondents were a member of Landcare, and the North Central CMA survey respondents were slightly older than ABS respondents from within the North Central CMA region [see Table 16]. The ABS surveys had a $5,000 minimum Estimated Value of Agricultural Output as a pre-requisite for inclusion in that study. There was no similar prerequisite for inclusion in the North Central survey. The North Central survey was of all landholders who owned properties greater than 10 ha in size [see Table 17 and Table 18 for response rate by LGA and asset]. The North Central CMA survey asked respondents if they \"were a member of or involved with\" a local Landcare group, while the ABS survey asked respondents if they \"were a member\" of a Landcare group. We are confident the two groups are similar.

Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means and medians were used to summarise responses to all survey questions (\"not applicable\" and missing responses were removed from the analysis of means). For questions that required respondents to specify an amount (e.g. hectares of trees planted) zeros were excluded in the calculation of means and medians (hence, these were treated as a 'no' response). In these situations, the means and medians should be treated as the mean or median of those who had undertaken the practice. Multiple linear regression modelling and logistic regression modelling were used to better determine the extent that a number of independent variables contributed to a greater level (for CRP measured as a continuous variable) or the presence or absence (for CRP measured as yes/no) of adoption of CRP. The modelling was used to help identify the set of variables that best explained adoption of each CRP. The regression results and coefficients were checked to guard against multicollinearity (i.e. to prevent two variables essentially explaining the same thing being included in the analysis). Variables were entered in a stepwise modelling process using Akaikes (AIC) information criterion as the step criteria. The R\u00b2 value indicates the amount of variance explained by the model. An R\u00b2 value of 30% is considered useful in the social sciences where there is typically a large number of potentially influencing and intervening variables. For logistic regression modelling, the overall group membership (percentage of respondents who undertook or did not undertake the practice) correctly predicted by the model is also presented. This figure provides an indication of the usefulness of the model.

There also seems to be acceptance that land clearing since European settlement has negatively impacted on biodiversity. At the same time, it seems there is considerable uncertainty and concern about the efficacy of willow removal and environmental watering under the Murray Darling Basin Plan [see Table 24; Figure 11]. Over fifty percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the items measuring confidence in CRP, including soil testing, fencing to manage stock access, stubble retention, lime application, establishment of perennial pastures, watering stock offstream and rotational grazing. However, apart from the soil testing and fencing waterways/ wetlands items, about a quarter of all respondents were unsure about the efficacy of each CRP.

Some examples, such as farmer, teacher, accountant, investor and retiree were listed to prompt respondents. Ninety-one percent (n=726) of respondents provided their main occupation. The research team then recoded responses as either a farmer or non-farmer. Using this approach, 430 (59%) individuals were classified as a farmer and 296 (41%) as a non-farmer. \uf0a7 Self-declared identity: full-time, part-time and non-farmer Respondents were asked to choose from three terms (full-time farmer, part-time farmer, non-farmer) that best described themselves. Just over half of the respondents considered they were Full-time Farmers (FTF), about a third as Part-time Farmers (PTF) and nearly one-in-five respondents selected the term Non-Farmer (NF) [ Table 28; Figure  13]. When results from responses to the open-ended occupation question were compared to the results from the item where respondents were asked to select one of three descriptors (FTF, PTF and NF), we found that 98% (n=374) of FTF listed an occupation that is farming related. Seventy-five percent (n=155) of PTF listed an occupation that was not related to farming and 99% (n=130) of NF listed a non-farming related occupation. This result suggests that a classification that includes the part-time cohort (i.e. three cohorts) is more likely than a two-cohort classification to reflect the continuum/range in the strength or commitment to a farmer identity that can be expected to occur between FTF and NF. Having said that, it seems adding the PTF cohort doesn't provide a complete resolution of that issue in that 25% of those who selected the PTF descriptor had listed a farmer-related occupation and 75% listed a non-farmer occupation. We would have expected a split closer to 50%-50%. That result reinforces Full-time farmer, n=402: 52% Part-time farmer, n=229: 30% Non-farmer, n=142: 18% the rationale for exploring the efficacy of the OI CIC scale which provides an individual score for each respondent."}, {"section_title": "\uf0a7 CIC scale", "text": "Each of the 12 items included in the abbreviated OI CIC scale had a possible score of 0 to 5. The range of possible scores for the total OI CIC score is therefore between 0 and 60 (range 60). Respondents fell across the spectrum of possible scores [Table 27; Figure 14]. The observed overall median is 42 (n=754) which is above the mid-point of 30 and suggests over 80% of respondents have at least some association with a farmer identity. As expected, the median CIC scores for the three cohorts decreased from FTF (median 47, n=393) to PTF (median 37, n=224) to NF (median 17, n=134). Table 27 highlights the fact that less than 20% of the targeted population has minimal or no association with a farmer identity.

Males were the most common gender in every cohort but the proportion of females increased significantly from FTF to PTF to NF. There was no significant difference in the median age of respondents in each cohort. FTF owned the majority of land (84%, 357,000 ha), PTF owned 13% (54,000 ha) while NF owned 3% (12,000 ha). The median number of hours FTF spent working on their property each week was 60 while PTF spent just over half of a normal working week working on their property. Nonfarmers spent very small amounts of time working on their property. While FTF are unlikely to be engaged in off-property work, the median days of off-property work for respondents who identified as PTF and NF suggests they are working about 0.5 full-time equivalent off-property. Not surprisingly, the number of respondents who reported earning a profit from their on-property enterprises declined from FTF to PTF to NF. In this study, almost 20% of FTF and 60% of PTF indicated they did not earn a profit from their on-property activity. Full-time Farmers were more likely than PTF to be croppers, and very few NF were croppers. Half of the NF respondents indicated they had pastures and about a quarter indicated they had sheep enterprises and a smaller proportion reported beef enterprises. Interestingly, while about three quarters of respondents in each cohort reported native vegetation on their property and NF were more likely to be engaged in conservation covenanting; it was the FTF who were most likely to report they had been engaged in tree planting. Respondents were more likely to be members of Landcare rather than commodity or soil health groups. Full-time Farmers were the most likely to be members of the three categories of farming-related local organisations included in the survey and there were very small proportions of PTF and NF engaged through the commodity and soil health groups [ Table 28]. Respondents were spread across the North Central CMA region within 14 Local Government Areas (LGA). The breakdown of the LGA by occupation cohort is provided in Figure 15 and Figure 16. Figure 17 shows the CIC scores across the LGA of the North Central region. A larger number/darker colour signifies a stronger occupational identity as a farmer. A key finding is that in eight of the 14 LGA, PTF and NF comprise either 50% (one LGA) or more than half of all respondents. There is also a clear spatial pattern in the distribution of the cohorts across the LGA with FTF the majority of respondents in the northern LGA of Buloke and Gannawarra; PTF the majority in the Macedon Ranges LGA; while the highest percentage of NF are found in Mount Alexander, Greater Bendigo, and Hepburn LGA (about 35% are NF).   Table 29 provides a comparison of the information sources used by the different occupational cohorts. Most respondents in all cohorts reported using print material (e.g. newspapers, magazines, brochures) and friends, family or neighbours for information about NRM. On the other hand, few respondents indicated they used social media. As might be expected, FTF and PTF were more likely to use traditional farmer-related information sources such as extension staff, agricultural consultants, the VFF, field days and farmer groups; and NF were more likely to use social media (but not the internet). The North Central CMA was reported as an information source by about half of all FTF and PTF and by about 40% of NF [ Table 29]. \uf0a7 Extent identity as a farmer (using CIC scale) is related to different social characteristics of rural landholders"}, {"section_title": "Figure 15 Landholder occupation cohorts by Local Government Area in the North", "text": "In brief, there are a large number of significant relationships between CIC scale scores and topics expected to influence landholder's NRM behaviour. However, there is insufficient space in this report to provide detailed summaries, including tables of the results of analyses exploring relationships between the CIC scale scores and values, beliefs, personal norms, attitudes, knowledge and concern about issues. Those topics that are linked will be addressed in considerable detail in Theresa Groth's PhD thesis (available late 2015). In this section we provide a brief summary of some key results. As is indicated in Table 30, there was a statistically significant relationship for more than half of the items in each of the key topics listed above that are expected to influence the NRM behaviour of rural landholders. Those with a higher score on the CIC were more likely to place more importance on factors affecting production, be less concerned about any negative impacts of production (e.g. nutrient run-off), obtain greater pride from property activities and have planned for property succession. Those with a lower CIC score were more likely to place more importance on issues impacting the greater community (e.g. loss of biodiversity, impact of dams on run-off, climate change, water use, river health), and see their farming activities as a welcome break from normal occupation. The results of analyses presented in Table 31 indicate there were 10 items exploring the implementation of best-practice NRM (i.e. CRP) where there was a statistically significant positive relationship between CIC scores and the implementation of bestpractice. For instance, the CIC scores were different between those who answered 'yes' and 'no' to the following questions: 'Fenced waterways & wetlands to manage stock access' and 'Fenced waterways & wetlands to manage stock access with government support'. The results in Table 31 are based on pairwise comparisons. In a later section of the report we discuss findings from analyse using multiple regression to identify the key factors influencing landholder adoption of CRP.

Some topics apply to most rural landholders (e.g. managing ground cover to minimise soil erosion) but some topics are more relevant to landholders engaged in specific types of farm enterprise, such as cropping (e.g. frequency and rates of spraying to implement minimum tillage) or managing particular assets, such as waterways and wetlands. Comparisons across topics need to take this in to consideration. Self-assessment is an accepted approach to gather this information. Another option is to \"test\" respondents on their knowledge which can be unreliable when respondents are able to check references or simply Google for information. Respondents may also regard testing as insulting, leading to non-responses. For this survey, the response options were no knowledge (1), very little knowledge (2), some knowledge (3), sound knowledge (4), and very sound knowledge (could give a detailed explanation, 5). There were only three topics where more than 50% of respondents indicated they had sound knowledge: Strategies to maintain groundcover to prevent erosion; The frequency and rate of fertiliser application to maintain soil fertility; and How to establish introduced perennial pastures [Table 32]. One knowledge item relevant to the biodiversity asset was included in the survey. Analysis of the knowledge item for respondents with properties within the biodiversity asset is included in section 6 of the report. "}, {"section_title": "Belief about climate change", "text": "The survey included three items exploring respondent's belief in human induced climate change, including the extent it is human induced, irreversible (can be reversed) and will lead to dire consequences if no action is taken. Respondents were asked to respond to each statement by selecting from one of six response options: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree and don't know/not applicable. The response for strongly disagree and disagree have been combined (representing a 'denial' cohort), and responses for agree and strongly agree have been combined (representing a 'believer' cohort). We suggest the neutral category represent the 'sceptical' cohort. Over half of all survey respondents agreed with the statement that Human activities are influencing changes in climate (54%). Only 18% indicated they disagreed with this statement, suggesting that most rural landholders in the North Central region either accept that climate change is a reality, or at least a possibility (i.e. they are 'believers' or 'sceptics' rather than 'deniers') [ Table 33]. Over 80% of the survey respondents appeared to have a positive view about the possibility of there being sufficient time to act to address climate change. At the same time, about half (and probably most of those who 'believe' in climate change) are concerned about the consequences of not taking action. A separate report has been provided to the North Central CMA further exploring this topic. "}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of risks associated with cropping and grazing waterways and wetlands", "text": "Three items were included in the survey exploring respondent attitudes towards three dimensions of the risks associated with cropping and grazing waterways and wetlands: observability, reversability, and whether the benefits are equally distributed. Respondents were asked to respond to each statement by selecting from one of six response options: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree and don't know/not applicable. Responses for strongly disagree and disagree have been combined and responses for agree and strongly agree have been combined for presentation of data in the table. Most respondents agreed that any negative impacts of cropping and grazing on these environmental assets could be reversed. Indeed, only 5% of all respondents disagreed with this statement. About a quarter of all respondents agreed that damage to waterways and wetlands from cropping and grazing was not obvious. There appears to be concern amongst about a quarter of the respondents about the distribution of benefits and costs between those cropping and grazing wetlands and the wider public [Table 34]. There was no significant difference between respondents whose properties were located within the wetlands and waterways assets and the rest of the survey respondents on these items. Predisposition to risk was measured using three items. Most of the rural landholders responding to this survey appear to be risk averse in that almost 60% indicated they prefer to avoid risks and 44% indicated they disliked not knowing what is going to happen [ Table 35]. The survey included two items exploring rural landholder trust in the North Central CMA and three items exploring landholders' judgements about the trustworthiness of the North Central CMA [ Table 36]. The topic of interest was the management of waterways and wetlands. Respondents were asked to select from one of six response options: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree and don't know/ not applicable. The responses for strongly disagree and disagree have been combined and responses for agree and strongly agree have been combined for the presentation of data in the table. Respondents were more likely to agree than disagree that they could trust the North Central CMA to provide useful advice about waterways and wetlands management. About a third of all respondents indicated they held a neutral view about whether they could trust the North Central CMA on this topic, suggesting there is considerable potential to lift the trust rating. By comparison, only about a quarter of all respondents said they could trust the North Central CMA to provide appropriate financial assistance for waterways and wetlands management. About 40% of respondents indicated they held a neutral view [ Table 36]. There were very similar mean scores for the three items measuring different elements of trustworthiness. In brief, positive judgements outweighed negative assessments by more than two to one. About a third of all respondents selected a neutral option. There was a significant difference across the LGA on two items:  Table 37 and Table 38.   Predisposition to trust was assessed using three items. Respondents were asked to select from one of six response options: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree and don't know/ not applicable. The responses for strongly disagree and disagree have been combined and responses for agree and strongly agree have been combined for the presentation of data in the table. We have not previously employed these items in our social benchmarking studies so we have no benchmarks for comparison. However, it seems that most of the respondents in this survey are not strongly predisposed to trust others. For example, almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that You can't be too careful when dealing with people; more than half agreed that One must be alert to avoid being taken advantage of; and just under half agreed that People are almost always interested in their own welfare [Table  39]. These are somewhat surprising and may explain the lack of trust in the North Central CMA amongst substantial proportions of respondents across the two survey items [ Table 36].

For the first time the social benchmarking survey gathered information about the extent landholders had set aside areas for \"living/ recreation\" and 80% of respondents said they had done that for a median of 2 hectares [ Table 40]. "}, {"section_title": "Uptake of CRP", "text": "It is important to acknowledge that the objective of NRM is unlikely to be 100% uptake of CRP. Some properties will not be located in priority areas for NRM investment. It is also unlikely that CRP will need to be implemented on every property to achieve NRM condition targets for specific environmental assets. In some instances, the cost of action may outweigh the benefits expected. In any case, there are likely to be some examples where remedial action has already been implemented. It is also unlikely that NRM organisations will have sufficient resources to invest in supporting every landholder with a priority asset to implement CRP at any one time, or even over a period of some years. The key is that NRM organisations are able to make these decisions, including identifying the CRP to be implemented and the extent of implementation required over time to accomplish condition targets. The social benchmarking survey provides regional NRM organisations with the capacity to benchmark and then monitor the implementation of specific CRP (and the intermediate objectives expected to lead to implementation). There were 17 survey items exploring the implementation of CRP. Some items were cropping or grazing specific, while others applied to all or most landholders. Where relevant, items included a 'not applicable' option. Some items referred to the total time of property management while others asked about actions in the past five years or 12 months of property ownership. The percentage included in the below table is the percent for the 'yes' option (percent no and NA have not been included). In this section we begin by reporting the proportion of landholders implementing each practice. We then report on results of multiple and logistic regression analyses conducted to explore the 'best' combination of factors that influence implementation of each practice. Fencing to manage stock access to rivers/streams/wetlands was the CRP for which most respondents had received government support (51%). For all other CRP, more respondents indicated they had undertaken work without government assistance [Table 41].

Models have been included for practices where over 20% of respondents indicated they had undertaken the practice (models have not been included for fencing soaks and springs to manage stock access; permanent grassed waterways in drainage lines; established an irrigation tailwater reuse system; area where soil ameliorants applied; and prepared a habitat assessment for native plants). Pairwise comparisons between the CRP and remaining survey items were conducted. Results of those analyses informed the development of each model with significant, relevant items included in the modelling analysis. Where appropriate, survey items included a 'not applicable' response option and those selecting this option have been removed from the analysis for that particular CRP. Some of the relationships reported are negative relationships, and this has been identified where it is the case. A positive relationship indicates that as the amount of practice undertaken increases, so does the importance/likelihood/occurrence of the variable included in the model. For example, as the area of trees and shrubs increased, so did the likelihood that a respondent had attended field days, including those focused on native plants and animals; their concern about the negative impacts of climate change increased; their knowledge of the role of understorey plants increased; as did their farming identity. A negative relationship is observed in the model for the presence/absence of planting trees and shrubs (yes/no). Here, as the likelihood that a respondent had conducted the practice increased, the importance of their property as a place to escape the pressure of life decreased. This is likely related to a farmer identity. "}, {"section_title": "Social and farming variables", "text": "The median property size for survey respondents was 253 ha.

people should have the right to negotiate access with individual landholders to visit important cultural sites and whether Landholders should have the right to harvest water that falls on their property, even if that action impacts on others \uf0a7 Landholder agreement with a duty of care for the environment (It is fair that the wider community asks landholders to manage their land in ways that will not cause foreseeable harm to the environment) \uf0a7 Social acceptability of willow removal (The cost of willow removal is justified by improvements in the condition of river banks & river

o stubble retention (The benefits of stubble retention outweigh problems arising from the practice) o rotational grazing (Intensive grazing for short periods is usually better for the health of native vegetation along waterways and wetlands than set stocking) o establishing off-stream watering points (Improvements in bank stability and vegetation condition justify the costs of watering stock off-stream) \uf0a7 Adoption of CRP, including: planting trees and shrubs, prepared a nutrient budget, fencing waterways, and used controlled or rotational grazing In the following tables the mean
