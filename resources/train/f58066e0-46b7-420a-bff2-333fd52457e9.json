[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is a lethal malignancy that is familial or associated with genetic syndromes in 10% of cases. Gene-based surveillance strategies for at-risk individuals may improve clinical outcomes. However, familial PC (FPC) is plagued by genetic heterogeneity and the genetic basis for the majority of FPC remains elusive, hampering the development of gene-based surveillance programs. The study was powered to identify genes with a cumulative pathogenic variant prevalence of at least 3%, which includes the most prevalent PC susceptibility gene, BRCA2. Since the majority of known PC susceptibility genes are involved in DNA repair, we focused on genes implicated in these pathways. We performed a region-based association study using the Mixed-Effects Score Test, followed by leave-one-out characterization of PC-associated gene regions and variants to identify the genes and variants driving risk associations. We evaluated 398 cases from two case series and 987 controls without a personal history of cancer.

Since 10% of PC cases are familial (FPC) or can be accounted for by genes implicated in hereditary cancer syndromes [3, 4] , gene-based surveillance strategies may enable early cancer detection in at-risk individuals. However, known predisposition genes account for only a minority of FPC [4] and the hereditary basis underlying the remaining fraction of FPC remains unknown [5] .\nSeveral studies have attempted to identify the hereditary basis for the fraction of FPC unexplained by known predisposition genes [5] [6] [7] . We previously reported a candidate gene list using a filter-based approach focusing on protein truncating variants (PTVs) to prioritize candidate DNA repair genes [6] . Roberts et al. used a similar filter-based approach to prioritize candidate genes in a genome-wide study. Neither of these investigations identified novel genes that underlie a significant fraction of FPC [7] . In a more recent exome-wide case-control association study evaluating frequency of PTVs in 437 PC cases and 1922 controls, only BRCA2, the most prevalent PC predisposition gene, approached exome-wide significance (p<2.69x10 -7 ) for enrichment of PTVs in PC cases [5] . These investigations highlight the heterogeneity of FPC and the challenges in delineating the genetic basis for the remaining fraction of FPC.\nRegion-based gene association tests may better identify genes containing rare risk variants by evaluating the combined effect of both PTVs and missense variants [5, 8] . The Mixed-Effects Score Test (MiST) is a novel region-based gene association method that combines burden and variance tests to identify causal genes and can incorporate variant annotation information [9] .\nIn this study, we searched for candidate PC susceptibility genes by examining association with both causal PTVs and missense variants. To increase statistical power, we focused on DNA damage response and repair genes as a majority of the known PC predisposition genes have a role in DNA repair. We used a rigorous approach combining MiST with a novel subsequent analysis, the leave-one-out (LOO) method, to identify potentially causal gene variants within a gene region that associates with disease [10, 11] .

In addition, we used a case-control ratio of 1:2, given the rarity of PC cases and the likelihood of sample availability for sequencing.

Candidate genes with less than 10 variants across the case-control series were removed, as this is a threshold requirement for MiST. The MiST analysis was complemented by a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis to identify which variant was likely contributing most to any identified association (S2 Text). This analytic strategy-combining MiST with LOO analysis-has not been previously described in cancer predisposition studies. To determine the optimal MAF threshold for identifying rare variants associated with cancer predisposition, we also performed our analysis using only variants with a MAF \ufffd0.5%.

Next, each window was dropped, one at a time, and the p-value for MiST was recalculated. An increase in p-value suggested that the dropped window contained at least one risk variant.

Of these, 4 genes (CHEK2, RECQL, SMG1 and TDG) were significant at the Bonferroni threshold (p<0.00021) ( Table 1 ). The LOO analyses were performed for the known PC predisposition genes significant at pvalue <0.05, and for the candidate genes that remained significant following Bonferroni's correction.\nWe first performed a ROC curve analysis using variants identified in BRCA2 to determine the threshold for p-value increase that would provide the highest sensitivity and specificity for the LOO analyses ( S2 Fig). Since the p.K3326X stopgain variant has not been shown to result in loss of protein function, it was excluded from the analysis. Across all samples, 96 unique BRCA2 variants were identified. The gene was split into 5 windows with 30 variants in each window and a minimum overlap of 10 variants. The first 4 windows (spanning variants 1-30, 21-50, 41-70, 61-90) led to an increase in MiST p-value when dropped (Fig 2A) . Thus, the LOO-V analysis was performed for these 4 windows (Fig 3) . Using the ROC curve for the LOO-V analysis, we determined that an increase in p-value for MiST of at least 35% when a given variant was dropped results in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 66-100%) and a specificity of 88% (95% CI 78-94%) for identifying pathogenic variants. At this threshold, 19 unique variants in 25 cases and in 1 control were identified as driving the association with PC risk (Table 2) . Therefore, the 35% p-value increase threshold was used for the LOO-V analysis of the remaining genes: BRCA1, STK11, SMG1, RECQL, TDG and CHEK2.\nThe LOO analyses revealed that the STK11, RECQL, TDG and CHEK2 associations were driven by more variants identified in the control series rather than the case series (S2 Table) . Therefore, these genes were not considered further. It is of course possible that these variants have a protective effect against PC risk.\nThere were 44 unique variants identified in BRCA1, which was split into 2 windows (spanning variants 1-30, 15-44) for the LOO-W analysis (Fig 2B) . Both windows had an increase in p-value. Thus, LOO-V was performed for both windows. Seven variants were identified in 8 cases, including two known pathogenic frameshift variants (Fig 3, Table 2 ).\nIn SMG1, 45 unique variants were identified in 41 cases (10.3%) and 45 controls (4.6%). The gene was split into two windows for the LOO-W analysis (spanning variants 1-30 and 16-45) and an increase in p-value was observed for both windows (Fig 2C) . Subsequent LOO-V analyses for both windows identified 14 unique variants across 27 cases and 2 controls driving the association with PC risk (Fig 3) . Of these variants, 12 were missense and 2 were splicing variants ( Table 2 ). The clinical characteristics for the 27 individuals carrying one of these 14 variants are detailed in Table 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Validation of SMG1 in FPC case-control series", "text": "To provide further evidence for SMG1 as a novel PC predisposition gene, we validated our findings in an independent case-control series consisting of 532 FPC cases (defined as \ufffd2 first-degree relatives with PC) and 753 non-cancer controls.

Interestingly, the nonsynonymous variant c.103G>A (p.A35T) was observed at a higher frequency in cases versus controls in both the discovery (p = 0.0009) and validation (p = 0.012) series, suggesting that it may be a recurrent SMG1 variant associated with PC risk. Since this variant is enriched in some ethnic populations, particularly the East Asian and Latino populations with a reported MAF of 13.3% and 9.4% in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [24] , we assessed the difference in variant frequency for only the cases with European Ancestry. The allele frequency for non-Finnish Europeans observed in the non-cancer samples in gnomAD is 0.38% (278/73592) compared with the observed allele frequency of 0.95% (17/ 1798) for all European PC cases from both the discovery and validation series (p = 0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, and SMG1", "text": "We first evaluated the list of variants in the 2 known predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Excluding the known pathogenic variants, there were 5 and 8 unique missense variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. However, the 5 missense variants in BRCA1 were discarded as they had a CADD score between 0-1.0. The 8 missense variants in BRCA2 were observed in 13 cases and 1 control (Table 2) . Unfortunately, we were unable to further validate these variants as tumour tissue was unavailable for these cases to determine whether there was a somatic second hit. There was no opportunity for segregation studies as no samples were available from their blood relatives.\nAlthough there were no tumour samples available to test for somatic inactivating second hit mutations, lymphocyte DNA was available to evaluate for segregation of the SMG1 variants with PC in two families with European ancestry (Table 2) . For the first family (A-78), the c.4249A>G (p.I1417V) variant was identified in two related individuals in our case series, the proband and the maternal aunt (Fig 4A) . We were then able to confirm the mutation in one of two maternal first cousins whose father had PC and, by inference, the latter affected patient also carried the c.4249A>G variant. Thus, the c.4249A>G variant segregated in all 3 individuals with PC on the maternal side. In the second family (B-105), there was a history of PC on both the maternal (1 relative) and paternal (3 relatives) sides of the family (Fig 4B) . The c.4952C>G (p.S1651C) variant was identified in the paternal aunt in our case series. However, it did not segregate in the proband with PC, possibly representing disease phenocopies in the family. Unfortunately, samples from the other paternal relatives with PC and their children were not available to determine whether the SMG1 variant segregated with PC on the paternal side of the family. To further evaluate the functional consequence of the SMG1 variants that emerged following the LOO-V analysis, we performed in-silico splicing prediction analyses for all missense variants in SMG1 (Table 2) . Interestingly, the c.4249A>G variant identified in family A-78, which segregated with two relatives with PC, was predicted to create both a splice acceptor and splice donor site.

In a recent case-control exome-wide association study of 437 PC cases and 1922 non-cancer controls, only BRCA2 approached significance for enrichment of rare inactivating variants in PC cases [5] . The authors concluded that, due to the genetic heterogeneity of familial PC, large cohorts with novel statistical methods will be required to identify novel predisposition genes. Another important finding is that the majority of genes associated with PC risk are DNA repair genes [25, 26] . Therefore, we focused the current study on putative DNA damage response and repair genes, and applied a novel statistical approach combining MiST with the LOO method to identify novel genetic variants associated with PC risk.\nRegion-based genetic association tests compare variants within a gene or a gene region in cases versus controls to predict whether a gene is associated with increased risk [8] . MiST is a region-based association test that incorporates a hierarchical-based model to account for confounders and predictive protein functionality scores of variants [9] . Moreover, MiST has been used successfully to identify genetic associations with complex traits [8, 9] , while the LOO analysis has been successfully combined with region-based association tests to identify causal variants [10] .\nSince MiST in combination with the LOO analysis had not been previously used in cancer predisposition studies, we performed the analyses at two MAF thresholds (\ufffd1% and \ufffd0.5%). At both thresholds, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were associated with PC risk. The p-values at the \ufffd1% MAF threshold for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 0.0297 and 0.0016, respectively. However, following Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing (p<0.000112), the association was lost for both genes. The pathogenic mutation frequency of BRCA1 in PC is 0.5%-1% in populations unaffected by a founder effect [14, 19] . Since our study was designed to identify genes with a pathogenic mutation frequency of 3%, we did not expect to identify an association with BRCA1. Similarly, we did not expect to observe an association with other known PC predisposition genes that carry a mutation frequency in PC of <3% (e.g., PALB2, ATM) [5, 14, 27] . However, the study was designed to detect an association of genes that carry a cumulative pathogenic variant frequency of at least 3%, including BRCA2 which has a 3-5% reported frequency of germline mutations in PC [5, 14, 19] . Loss of the BRCA2 association following correction for multiple testing may be explained by the exclusion of known germline BRCA2 mutations in Series A that formed part of the discovery case series [6] .\nAs a proof of principle, we used a ROC curve to determine the p-value change threshold required to identify known pathogenic mutations in BRCA2. At a p-value increase threshold \ufffd35%, we were able to identify all pathogenic mutations with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 66-100%) and a specificity of 88% (95% CI 78-94%). In addition to the known pathogenic mutations, novel potentially causal missense variants were identified. Unfortunately, samples were not available for segregation studies of these missense variants in affected relatives and to assess for somatic inactivation of the second BRCA2 allele in the corresponding tumours.\nFollowing correction for multiple testing, SMG1 was the only gene with a significant pvalue (p = 3.22x10 -7 ) that was driven by variants in PC cases. The variant frequency in cases was 10.3% versus 3.6% in controls. Interestingly, only two PTVs, both splicing variants (c.256 +2delGA and c.256+2delTC), and one non-frameshift variant (c.34_36delGCT) were identified. The other 42 unique variants identified were all missense changes. This observation is in keeping with the SMG1 genetic alterations in the COSMIC database [28] . There are no SMG1 PTVs in COSMIC PC cases and SMG1 PTVs are rarely present in other cancer types (50/ 42739 samples; 0.12%).\nSMG1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase in the same protein family as ATM [29] . SMG1 is implicated in p53 regulation following genotoxic stress and in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [30] . Loss of SMG1 function has also been associated with tumorigenesis [30, 31] . Gubanova et al. observed decreased p53 activity following ionizing radiation in U2-OS cells with loss of SMG1 compared to SMG1-wildtype cells, resulting in increased cell proliferation [30] . This study also showed that SMG1-deficient cells are unable to induce degradation of CDK2, a cell cycle checkpoint protein, and downregulation of Cdc25a, a related cell cycle checkpoint protein, leading to increased CDK2 activation and cell cycle progression after exposure to genotoxic stress. Gubanova et al. also knocked down SMG1 expression in HA1EB cells using shRNA and found that mice with SMG1 knockdown developed tumours more rapidly compared to mice with unaltered SMG1 expression. Furthermore, Roberts et al. showed that mice with only one functional SMG1 allele are more likely to develop papillary lung adenocarcinoma [31] . These observations suggest that SMG1 may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene. \ufffd SMGI c.4249A>G carrier status for the maternal uncle with PC was inferred by genotyping his son. B) In family B-105, the maternal aunt was included in our case series and was identified to be a carrier of the c.4952C>G (p.S1651C) SMG1 variant. The proband was found to not be a carrier of this SMG1 mutation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008344.g004\nIn both the discovery and validation series, variants were identified across the entire gene (Fig 5) . Similar to other serine/threonine protein kinases, SMG1 consists of 4 major domains: the N-terminal, FAT (FRAP, ATM and TRRAP), PIKK (PIK-related kinase), and FATC (FAT carboxyl terminus) domains [32] [33] [34] [35] . A majority of variants (8/14) identified in the LOO-V analysis were localized to the four functional domains, including the recurring variant (p. A35T) and the variant that segregated in kindred A-78 (p.I1417V) (Fig 5) .\nOne limitation of our case-control series is a potential bias introduced by the inclusion of related individuals (101 individuals from 85 families) in Series A of the discovery series, which may inflate the frequency of rare variants. In addition, as individual genotype-level data for the controls were not available for PCA analysis to remove genetic outliers, we were unable to confirm that the proportion of ethnic populations were similar between cases and controls. A difference in proportions may inflate the frequency of rare variants that are unique to specific ethnic populations. These limitations were, however, addressed by validating the SMG1 association in an independent case-control series. In addition to being a second unrelated case-control series, the validation series did not include related individuals or non-Caucasians. The observation of a significant association (p<0.0062) of SMG1 variants in cases (41/532; 7.7%) versus controls (32/754; 4.2%) in the validation series provides further support for SMG1 as a candidate PC susceptibility gene.\nSegregation of the c.4249A>G variant with PC in kindred A-78 (Fig 4a) provides additional evidence for SMG1 as a PC predisposition gene. This nonsynonymous variant is predicted to affect splicing, and segregated with all 3 PC cases on the maternal side of the family. There was opportunity for segregation assessment in only one other family. This kindred, B-105, harboured the c.4952C>G variant, which was identified in the proband's paternal aunt who had PC and was included in Series A of the discovery case series. The one relative with PC that we could test for segregation was the proband, but he did not carry the variant (Fig 4B) . However, the lack of segregation may be explained by the proband's tumour being a phenocopy. Moreover, as this kindred has affected relatives on both the paternal and maternal sides of the family, the genetic predisposition may be originating from the paternal side. In support of this possibility is that the c.4952C>G variant segregates to the paternal side, which has 3 affected relatives in the same generation rather than the single affected relative on the maternal side (Fig 4B) . Finally, the presence of a recurrent variant (i.e., c.103G>A) that associates with PC, in both the discovery and validation series, provides further support for the causal role of SMG1. While this variant may not alter protein function given the enriched MAF in the Asian and Latino populations and the presence of homozygotes in gnomAD, this variant may be in linkage disequilibrium with a pathogenic variant in Europeans, resulting in the association with PC observed in this European population. Alternatively, there may be a protective genetic variation among Asian and Latino populations that balances the penetrance of the c.103G>A in these populations.\nIn summary, we used a novel approach by combining MiST with the LOO analysis to identify causal genetic drivers of a familial cancer plagued by genetic heterogeneity. Specifically, we investigated for novel susceptibility genes with a significant contribution to familial PC by using a mutation frequency of at least 3% based on the germline mutation prevalence of BRCA2, the most common known PC predisposition gene. We validated this methodology by identifying pathogenic BRCA2 mutations, and identified SMG1 as a novel PC predisposition gene. Table. Summary of variants identified in the discovery series by the leave-one-out analysis for 4 genes with a significant association in MiST. The majority of variants identified in these 4 candidate genes were identified in the control series and were thus excluded from further analyses. MAF for our case series, control series, and 3 public databases as well as the CADD score are shown. The p-value increase observed for the leave-one-out variant test is indicated.
