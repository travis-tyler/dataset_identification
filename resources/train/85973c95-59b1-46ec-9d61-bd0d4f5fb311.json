[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] Temperature inversions in the upper water column where the surface layer is colder than the subsurface layer are common in the Southern Ocean [e.g., de Boyer Montegut et al., 2007;Dong et al., 2007], suggesting that salinity plays an important role in stabilizing the water column. To illustrate the importance of salinity in the Southern Ocean, we examined the contributions of temperature and salinity to the density seasonal cycle in the mixed layer. A monthly mixed layer temperature/salinity climatology was constructed from Argo float profiles (described in section 2) to compute density, and only regions with data for all months were included. The salinity contributions (r s ) were calculated using the time-mean temperature and monthly salinity fields, whereas the temperature contributions (r t ) were calculated using the monthly temperature and timemean salinity fields. [3] Figure 1 shows the ratio between the amplitudes of the seasonal variations in r s and r t , A(r s )/A(r t ), where A(r s ) and A(r t ) are the amplitudes of the seasonal harmonic of r s and r t , respectively, which suggests that the seasonal 100 [6] Up to the present, the salinity balance in the Southern 101 Ocean has not been examined to our knowledge. Although 102 direct observations in the Southern Ocean have historically 103 been sparse, particularly of salinity, recent satellite and in 104 situ observations provide some of the necessary data for a 105 preliminary examination of the mixed layer salinity balance.  (Figure 2c). Thus, we must determine whether the existing data provide adequate information to close the mixed layer salinity balance. [7] In this study, we use remotely sensed and in situ observations to evaluate whether the salinity budget of the mixed layer closes on a seasonal timescale in the Southern Ocean. To the extent that the budget does not close, what improvements can be made to the ocean observing system? Issues such as the relative role of air-sea freshwater fluxes and oceanic processes in the salinity balance, and the relative importance of horizontal advection versus vertical entrainment in the Southern Ocean, will be addressed. The upcoming 2010 salinity mission from space will stimulate numerous studies which should benefit from the present study.

Data"}, {"section_title": "171", "text": "[10] Gridded fields for both S m and h m were derived from 172 Argo float profiles of temperature, salinity, and pressure 173 [Gould and the Argo Steering Team, 2004]. All available 174 Argo profiles south of 30\u00b0S with a ''good'' quality flag from 175 January 2000 to June 2008 were used, while profiles with 176 pressure offset errors were excluded (http://www.usgodae. 177 org/argo/news/). The number of profiles in each 2\u00b0latitude 178 by 5\u00b0longitude grid box ( Figure 3a) indicated that there were 179 more profiles in the Pacific and Indian oceans to the north of 180 the SAF. The number of profiles in each month ( Figure 3b) 181 varied from 7000 in September to 9000 in May with little seasonal bias. Following de Boyer Montegut et al. [2004] and Dong et al. [2008], we determined the mixed layer depth, h m , from individual float profiles based on a density difference criterion, Dr = 0.03 kg m \u00c03 , where Dr is the density difference from the topmost near-surface value. A monthly climatology was then objectively mapped [Roemmich, 1983] from the individual h m using a decorrelation scale of 2\u00b0latitude by 5\u00b0longitude and 30 days in time. A detailed description of the mixed layer depth in the Southern Ocean is given by Dong et al. [2008]. Using the same objective analysis as Dong et al. [2008], a monthly climatological salinity map was derived from individual Argo salinity profiles. [11] The net freshwater flux, E \u00c0 P, includes two components, evaporation (E) and precipitation (P), and a number of E and P products are available. A monthly climatology constructed from 12 years (1990 -2001) of ECMWF reanalysis 40 data (ERA40) [Uppala et al., 2005] was used in this study because it provided the best balance in terms of root-mean-square (RMS) differences between the salinity tendency and the sum of the contributions from the freshwater flux, ocean advection-diffusion, and entrainment processes. The ERA40 freshwater fluxes are on a 2.5\u00b0\u00c2 2.5\u00b0grid, which were linearly interpolated to a 1\u00b0\u00c2 1\u00b0grid to match the salinity maps. The sensitivity of the results to the various E \u00c0 P products is given in 207 Appendix A. [14] The last term on the right-hand side of (1) describes 237 the entrainment of water from below the base of the mixed 238 layer. The entrainment velocity (w e ) was determined from 239 the turbulent kinetic energy balance, which is controlled by wind stirring and a stabilizing effect due to surface heating. A detailed description of w e is given by Qiu and Kelly [1993] and Dong and Kelly [2004]. Turbulent heat fluxes derived from the Objectively Analyzed air-sea Fluxes (OAFlux) [Yu and Weller, 2007] were used to calculate w e , as were radiation fluxes from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) [Zhang et al., 2004] and wind stress fields from COAPS. [15] The salinity differences (DS) between the mixed layer and just below the mixed layer were calculated from individual float profiles directly, then objectively mapped to a monthly climatology with a 1\u00b0\u00c2 1\u00b0grid. These salinity differences are relatively stable in time.  275 probably related to the advection of the saltier water by the subtropical gyre."}, {"section_title": "277", "text": "[16] An autocorrelation analysis indicates that the fresh-278 water fluxes have an e-folding scale of 8\u00b0latitude by 16\u00b02 79 longitude, suggesting that the freshwater fluxes are poten-280 tially smoother than other variables such as the wind stress 281 and SSH fields. To roughly match the spatial resolution of 282 all of the variables, we smoothed the salinity and velocity 283 fields using an 8\u00b0\u00c2 8\u00b0trianglular filter. This smoothing 284 process effectively reduced eddy features in the geostrophic 285 advection along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), 286 which do not appear in the other data sets and, subsequently, 287 improved the balance of the mixed layer salinity budget. 289 3.

The overall spatial pattern of the E \u00c0 P (Figure 5a) and that of the sum of the oceanic processes ( Figure 5b) are similar, but with opposite sign as expected, except in the southern part of the subtropical gyre in the Atlantic (35\u00b0S-45\u00b0S, 320\u00b0E-350\u00b0E) and to the north of the SAF in the eastern Indian and western Pacific oceans where both E \u00c0 P and the oceanic processes show negative values, i.e., a freshening effect to the mixed layer.

An examination of the velocity and 327 salinity gradient fields suggests that the spatial structure of 328 the advection-diffusion processes can be attributed to the 329 meridional salinity gradient ( Figure 6). The spatial structure 330 of the entrainment term ( Figure 5d) is very similar to that of 331 the E \u00c0 P term, but of opposite sign.

This 338 small-scale feature is missing from the E \u00c0 P term (Figure 5a), suggesting that a better E \u00c0 P product could improve studies with a focus on the ACC region.

The negative bias in the 369 sum of the contributions (gray line, Figure 7a) is most likely 370 due to the biases in the air-sea freshwater fluxes (E \u00c0 P)."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Variations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Domain Average", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "371", "text": "[23] An examination of each term on the right-hand side 372 of (1) suggests that the seasonal cycle of the surface salinity 373 is dominated by oceanic processes: horizontal advection-374 diffusion and vertical entrainment. The advection-diffusion 375 term is always negative throughout the year, which can be 376 attributed to the year-round westerly wind transporting 377 fresher water from the south to the north. The advection-378 diffusion shows a weak seasonal cycle, with its maximum 379 freshening effect in December and January. This maximum 380 advective freshening effect in austral summer is probably 381 related to the ice melting near Antarctica, which is subse-quently transported to the north via the Ekman process. The domain-averaged entrainment is positive year-round and experiences a strong seasonal cycle. The entrainment reaches its maximum in May and June, then decreases to zero by August. Similar to the advection-diffusion term, the air-sea freshwater flux term is also negative year-round, but its magnitude is about half of the advection-diffusion term. Unlike the mixed layer temperature budget where the air-sea heat exchange dominates its seasonal cycle, the air-sea freshwater flux plays little role in the seasonal variability of the mixed layer salinity averaged in the Southern Ocean. [24] By dividing the advection-diffusion term into geostrophic advection, Ekman advection, and diffusion components (not shown), similar to the mixed layer temperature budget of Dong et al. [2007], we found that the contribution of the geostrophic advection is negligible. The diffusion term is also very small and does not contribute to the S m seasonal cycle on the domain average. Most of the variations in the advection-diffusion term come from the Ekman advection. We further divide the advection into zonal and meridional components (Figure 7b). The Ekman advection Figure 7. (a) Domain-averaged salinity budget for the Southern Ocean (35\u00b0S-65\u00b0S). The gray curve is the sum of the contributions from air-sea freshwater fluxes (red, positive out of the ocean), oceanic advection-diffusion (blue), and vertical entrainment (green) to the salinity tendency (black).

Units are psu yr \u00c01 . is dominated by the meridional component, whereas the zonal component is close to zero. This is consistent with the 405 large meridional Ekman transport from strong westerly 406 winds and a large meridional salinity gradient. Both the 407 zonal and meridional components of the geostrophic advec-408 tion are relatively small when compared to the meridional 409 Ekman advection, but not negligible. The minimal role of 410 geostrophic advection in the salinity tendency is due to the 411 compensation of its zonal and meridional components 412 (Figure 7b).  1, 418 their sum, and the differences between the left-hand and 419 right-hand sides of equation 1during January (Figures 8a-8c 420 and 9a-9d) and May (Figures 8d-8f and 9e -9h). These 421 components approximately correspond to the maximum and 422 minimum of the salinity tendency. [26] In January, the salinity tendency (Figure 8a (Figure 8b, right-hand side of equation 1)shows similar spatial patterns to the salinity tendency. However, its magnitude is larger than that of the salinity tendency as shown by their differences (Figure 8c Figure 8. Spatial distribution of salinity tendency, the sum of the contributions to the salinity tendency, and their differences (salinity tendency minus the sum) for (a -c) January and (d-f) May, respectively. Units are psu yr \u00c01 . [27] The salinity tendency in May (Figure 8d) shows a similar structure to that of January (Figure 8a), but with opposite sign. The salinity tendency is positive over most regions south of 45\u00b0S and is generally negative to the north. This indicates that the mixed layer becomes saltier in austral winter. Again, the sum of all of the contributions (Figure 8e) well captures the spatial distribution of the salinity tendency, although its magnitude is relatively large. The strong magnitude in the sum can be seen from the differences (Figure 8f) between the salinity tendency and the sum (Figure 8d minus Figure 8e), which show a similar structure as the sum, but with opposite sign. Both the E \u00c0 P term (Figure 9e) and Ekman advection (Figure 9f) show a similar structure to their counterparts in January, but their magnitudes in May are about half of those in January. In fact, the spatial structure of the E \u00c0 P and Ekman advection terms are similar year-round. The geostrophic advection (Figure 9g) also shows a similar structure to that in January (Figure 9c) with comparable magnitude. The salinity increase in May is 479 mainly due to the vertical entrainment process (Figure 9h), 480 which is very strong and mostly positive south of 40\u00b0S. North of 40\u00b0S, except in the western part of the Pacific and 482 Atlantic oceans, the entrainment shows negative values 483 because the subsurface water entrained into the mixed 484 layer is fresher when compared to the mixed layer water 485 (Figure 4). The maximum entrainment appears in the Indian 486 Ocean around the SAF (60\u00b0E-90\u00b0E). 487 3.2.3. Regional Budget"}, {"section_title": "488", "text": "[28] As shown in Figure 1, salinity plays a larger role in 489 the Indian Ocean than in the Pacific Ocean north of the SAF 490 where the SAMW is formed. Thus, it is important to 491 understand the differences in the salinity budget for these 492 two regions, which will shed light on the regional similar-493 ities and differences of the mode water formation process. 494 To examine the salinity balance in the Indian and Pacific 495 oceans north of the SAF, we averaged the terms in 496 equation 1to a 5\u00b0latitude band to the north of the SAF, 497 which corresponds to the regions with formation of the deep 498 mixed layers. Figures 10a and 10b show the averaged terms 499 in the two regions, respectively. [29] The salinity budget in the Indian Ocean (Figure 10a) is similar to that averaged over the entire Southern Ocean (Figure 7). However, the magnitude of each term averaged in the Indian Ocean is three to four times larger, except for the E \u00c0 P term, which shows comparable magnitude with that averaged over the entire Southern Ocean. Similar to the domain average, the seasonal cycle of the salinity tendency is well captured by the sum of all of the contributions, with the exception being during August and September when the salinity tendency is positive, whereas the sum of the contributions produces negative values. The maximum and minimum salinity tendency occur in June and January, respectively. The E \u00c0 P term is very small and close to zero. The seasonal evolution of the mixed layer salinity is mainly controlled by the vertical entrainment and horizontal advection-diffusion processes. The entrainment term shows a strong seasonal cycle, but is always positive. The maximum entrainment occurs in April and May, one to two months prior to the peak of the salinity tendency. The advectiondiffusion term, dominated by Ekman advection, is always negative, and its maximum freshening effect is in January. When combined with Figure 1, which shows that the Figure 10. Salinity budget averaged over a 5\u00b0latitude band north of the SAF for (a) the Indian Ocean (80\u00b0E -120\u00b0E) and (b) the Pacific Ocean (240\u00b0E-280\u00b0E) where the deep mixed layer is formed in austral winter. The correspondence of the colors is the same as in Figure 5. The vertical lines correspond to one standard error for each term. salinity plays an equal or more important role in the density seasonal variation, this suggests that oceanic processes play an important role in the SAMW formation in the Indian Ocean on a seasonal time scale. In particular, vertical entrainment brings saltier water into the mixed layer from the subsurface and, subsequently, modifies the mixed layer density. [30] The salinity budget in the Pacific Ocean north of the SAF (Figure 10b) shows a different scenario from that averaged over the entire Southern Ocean (Figure 7) and that in the Indian Ocean (Figure 10a). The magnitude and seasonal evolution of the salinity tendency are comparable with those averaged over the entire Southern Ocean. The salinity tendency reaches its maximum in July and minimum in January. The positive salinity tendency is due to the vertical entrainment term. In the Pacific, the E \u00c0 P term plays a dominant role in the freshening of the mixed layer, while the advection-diffusion term plays only a minimal role. The E \u00c0 P term is negative throughout the year with the maximum freshening effect in austral summer (January -February) and minimum in austral winter (June -September). The advection-diffusion is quite small and shows a weak seasonal cycle, with negative values in the austral summer and fall and positive values in the spring. An examination of the contributions from the     each grid point i, and n is the number of data points for a 571 given month. Figure 11a suggests that the RMS imbalance 572 has no apparent seasonal variation, with an average rms(d) 573 of 0.52 psu yr \u00c01 . [32] To examine the spatial distribution of the imbalance, 575 following the methodology for the monthly imbalance, we 576 computed the RMS imbalance at each grid point. Here, d i is the imbalance at time i, and n is the number of data points at 578 a given geographic location, which equals 12 in this case. In 579 most regions, the RMS imbalance is less than 0.5 psu yr \u00c01 580 (Figure 11b). A relatively large imbalance is seen around 581 the SAF, whereas in the entire Pacific section the imbalance 582 is small, close to zero, which is primarily due to the small 583 values of the budget terms. One of the major features shown 584 in Figure 11b is the large imbalance along the Brazil Current 585 (35\u00b0S -50\u00b0S, 300\u00b0E-315\u00b0E) and in the broad Agulhas 586 Retroflection region (40\u00b0S-45\u00b0S, 0-70\u00b0E). Both regions 587 experience strong freshening (Figure 5c) from oceanic 588 advection, which can be attributed to the strong salinity 589 gradient ( Figure 6) in these regions. This freshening from 590 oceanic advection is only partially compensated by the 591 positive E \u00c0 P term (Figure 5a), suggesting that the E \u00c0 592 P data may not fully capture the oceanic processes in these 593 regions."}, {"section_title": "594", "text": "[33] Many factors can contribute to the imbalance, 595 including errors in the constructed salinity fields, freshwater 596 flux products, unaccounted for effects of seasonal ice melt 597 or variations in river runoff, representation of the mixed 598 layer depth, and velocity fields. Of these factors, the 599 freshwater fluxes are expected to be the largest contributor 600 to the mixed layer salinity budget error, as only limited 601 Southern Hemisphere data are available for the reanalysis 602 products and, hence, the reliability of these fluxes is 603 uncertain. The regions near the sea ice edge do not expe-604 rience a large RMS imbalance in the residual of the mixed 605 layer salinity budget, which we take as confirmation that the 606 effect of sea ice is not a dominant part of the residual. A 607 detailed description of the sensitivity of the mixed layer 608 salinity balance to the choice of data set is given in 609 Appendix A. In summary, we found significant differences 610 in the RMS imbalance if we change our choice of E \u00c0 P, 611 mixed layer depth, and salinity field. Changing the choice 612 of wind product and mean geostrophic velocity does not 613 have a significant influence on the results. This suggests 614 that a better mixed layer salinity budget for the Southern 615 Ocean can be achieved by improving the accuracy of the 616 freshwater flux products, increasing the spatial sampling of 617 the salinity field, particularly in regions with strong eddy 618 activity, and improving the representation of the mixed layer 619 depth. "}, {"section_title": "622", "text": "[34] In this study, the seasonal mixed layer salinity 623 balance in the Southern Ocean (0 -360\u00b0E, 35\u00b0S-65\u00b0S) 624 was examined from a combination of remotely sensed and 625 in situ observations. An examination of the time-mean 626 balance indicated that, although the spatial structure of the 627 freshwater flux term is similar to that of the oceanic 628 processes (advection, diffusion, and entrainment) with op-629 posite sign as expected, its magnitude is relatively small, consistent with the results for the tropics [Johnson et al., 2002]. [35] For the domain average, the mixed layer salinity undergoes a seasonal cycle. It increases from March to October and decreases from November to February. This seasonal evolution in salinity is well captured by the sum of the contributions from the oceanic and atmospheric processes. However, the sum of the contributions shows a negative bias. Unlike the mixed layer temperature budget in the Southern Ocean where the air-sea heat fluxes dominate the temperature seasonal cycle, freshwater fluxes play a minimal role in the salinity seasonal cycle. The seasonal variation in the mixed layer salinity is dominated by vertical entrainment, which can be mostly attributed (above 70%) to the seasonality of the vertical entrainment velocity. The advection-diffusion term, dominated by meridional Ekman advection, plays a secondary role. [36] The sum of all of the contributions also captures the spatial structure of the salinity tendency. South of 40\u00b0S, the salinity tendency is spatially coherent; it increases from March to October and decreases from November to February. To the north of 40\u00b0S, the seasonal variation in salinity tendency is generally opposite to that south of 40\u00b0S. The spatial structure of each term is similar throughout the year, although its magnitude changes with time. The freshwater flux term is negative south of 45\u00b0S and positive to the north.  (Figure 12), suggesting that the eddy dynamics in these high energetic regions may not be well represented in existing data products, specifically for the freshwater flux products and the salinity fields from in situ measurements whose spatial distribution tends to be biased. An examination of the spatial distribution of the Argo float profiles (Figure 3a) shows that the profiles in regions with a strong RMS imbalance are relatively sparse. Thus, the spatial structure of the salinity field may not be well captured by salinity objective maps, suggesting that an increase in the salinity measurements in these energetic regions can potentially improve the salinity budget. [38] Various sensitivity tests were performed to evaluate the contributions of uncertainties in different data sets to the imbalance. No significant differences in the RMS imbalance were found using different mean geostrophic advection or wind stress fields. This indicates that the uncertainties in the velocity fields are not the major contributors to the imbalance. Results from six different net freshwater fluxes (see Appendix A for detail) showed significant differences in the RMS imbalance, suggesting that a better freshwater flux product is needed to close the budget. Significant differences in the RMS imbalance were also found when the salinity climatology from the World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05) was used. Using the WOA05 salinity product instead of those derived from Argo profiles gave a RMS imbalance of 0.88 psu yr \u00c01 . This large difference is probably due to the lack of salinity measurements in the WOA05 for the Southern Ocean since 70% of the Argo float profiles used in our salinity maps were collected after 2005. This suggests that a better salinity field is important to close the budget. Hence, it is critical to accumulate salinity measurements continuously. [39] The Aquarius satellite, which is planned for launch in 2010, will provide monthly maps of global surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.2 psu. The Argo profiles show that the surface salinity and mixed layer salinity differ by only 0.001 psu on average with a standard deviation of 0.01 psu, suggesting that satellite observations of surface salinity well represent the mixed layer salinity, at least in the Southern Ocean. To examine the accuracy of the surface salinity measurements required to provide a better salinity budget, we applied a Monte Carlo technique where random errors with RMS(S) were added to the salinity maps. We then examined the RMS differences between the salinity tendency (@S/@t) from the original maps (considered as 'truth') and that from the salinity maps with random errors. This process was repeated with different magnitudes of salinity error, i.e., by varying the RMS(S) from 0 to 0.5 psu. Our examination suggested that, to achieve results that are better than the uncertainties ($0.52 psu yr \u00c01 ) induced by freshwater flux and oceanic processes for the Southern Ocean, satellite salinity measurements need to have an accuracy of 0.12 psu or less. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of the salinity measurements from space,    "}, {"section_title": "822", "text": "[44] Unlike the mixed layer temperature whose variations 823 in space and time can be well represented by satellite SST 824 measurements with continuous spatial and temporal cover-825 age, existing salinity maps are derived from sparse in situ 826 measurements. The uncertainties in the salinity field may 827 contribute to the imbalance. We examined the sensitivity of 828 the salinity budget to S m by making use of the salinity climatology from the World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05). With all of the other data sets the same as our base case, the results using S m from the WOA05 gave an average RMS imbalance of 0.88 \u00b1 0.06 psu yr \u00c01 . The large difference from our base case is probably due to the lack of salinity data in the World Ocean Database 2005, as the majority of the Argo profiles (70%) were from the post-2005 period. Although the spatial structure of the salinity data from the WOA05 is similar to our objective map for the Argo float profiles, the WOA05 field is much smoother, particularly around the ACC where the salinity gradient is the largest. This suggests that it is important to continuously accumulate salinity measurements with better spatial resolution to resolve the relatively fine structure of the salinity field. Ultimately, an improved salinity field for the Southern Ocean will improve our understanding of the upper ocean processes governing the meridional overturning circulation. [45] Note that the residual imbalance included some unresolved variations due to seasonal changes in the freshwater fluxes from sea ice. To further quantify the effect of sea ice seasonal variations, we used the monthly sea ice area from the National Snow and Ice Data Center of the University of Colorado, which suggested a total Antarctic ice area change of $12 \u00c2 10 12 m 2 on a seasonal time scale. This gave a freshwater input/output of 12 \u00c2 10 12 m 3 assuming a sea ice thickness of 1 m (typical for the Antarctic sea ice). If we assume this amount of freshwater is evenly distributed in our study region, it is equivalent to 0.13 m yr \u00c01 freshwater input/output, which is about 20% of the RMS difference between the freshwater fluxes from SOC and ECMWF. Thus, the seasonal variations in sea ice is not a large contributor to the salinity imbalance when compared to the uncertainties in the E \u00c0 P data. [46] Acknowledgments.
