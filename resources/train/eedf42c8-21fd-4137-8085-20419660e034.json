In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer 18 F-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Braak (Braak et al., 2011) and others (Braak and Braak, 1996; Bradley et al., 2002; Vemuri et al., 2008) , using neuropathology, demonstrated a close correlation between tau tangles and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the neuropathology literature suggests that tau tangles, but not amyloid-b plaques, correlate with cognition (Markesbery, 1997) , especially memory function (Terry et al., 1999) , which characterizes Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, tau tangle-associated neurodegeneration is likely to be part of the chain of events leading to cortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Yet, the neuropathology literature concerning the distribution of amyloid-b, tau, and their relationship to cognition is complex (Terry and Katzman, 1983; Price, 1997; Berg et al., 1998) , reporting cases with little amyloid-b and tau in young subjects, cases with widespread amyloid-b plaques but without tau tangles (Tiraboschi et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2009) , cases with tau tangles in the absence of amyloid-b plaques (Nelson et al., 2009) , and cases with both amyloid-b plaques and tau tangles widely distributed, especially as seen in subjects with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (Knopman et al., 2003; Monsell et al., 2013) . One well-established finding from neuropathological studies is the existence of intracellular tau tangles in non-demented cases, especially in the earliest tau tangle formation brain sites including transentorhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus (Price and Morris, 1999) . Furthermore, the neuropathology studies report exponential increase in the concentration of tau tangles with age, and greater spatial spread and further increase in concentration in the presence of widely distributed neuritic as well as diffuse plaques throughout neocortex and limbic structures (Price and Morris, 1999) . These reports suggest an interaction between the pace of amyloidb deposition and the spread of tau tangles, even at the earliest disease stage. However, limitations of pathology studies are that they only represent one time point, that the brain specimens are collected at some considerable time from the previous clinical evaluation, and that different studies use different methods, making a consensus view of the chain of events in living humans difficult to achieve.\nIn-depth analysis of the cause-effect mechanisms by which amyloid-b, tau, and symptomatology interact is of great interest, particularly for development of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid-b cascade hypothesis (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Karran et al., 2011) , the prevailing hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease research, posits that accumulation of amyloid-b is primarily responsible for the accumulation of tau tangles, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline especially in memory function. In addition to the knowledge gained from aforementioned neuropathology studies, accumulating evidence from in vitro tissue experiments and in vivo animal models has also provided direct experimental support for the amyloid-b cascade hypothesis, particularly for the amyloid-b-induced tau accumulation (Hurtado et al., 2010; Pooler et al., 2015) . Most importantly, recently developed PET ligands for amyloid-b (Mintun et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2011) and tau (Fodero-Tavoletti et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2013) provide information concerning the amount and topography of deposition of these two hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease in vivo. These PET ligands will enable temporal and spatial localization of the amyloid-b and tau, their respective contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease, and the mechanistic link between amyloid-b and tau pathology examined in vivo for the first time. Here, we examined in vivo the burden and the anatomical distribution of tau pathology as measured by 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention (Xia et al., 2013) and its relationship with antecedent and cross-sectional amyloid-b pathology as measured by florbetapir-PET retention longitudinally (Wong et al., 2010) , as well as its relationship with other Alzheimer's disease-related factors, using data from asymptomatic elderly individuals and early symptomatic individuals, recruited in a multi-centre Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Alzheimer's disease-related factors considered in this study were limited to age, gender, education, and APOE genotype based on the current literature reporting associations between these factors and neurobiological factors implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, after advanced age, APOE \"4 genotype is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (Payami et al., 1997) ; females compared to males are at higher risk of both neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid-b plaque neuropathology especially in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al., 2004; Damoiseaux et al., 2012) ; greater education may allow people to harbour amyloid-b plaques and other brain pathology linked to Alzheimer's disease without experiencing decline in their cognitive functioning (Stern, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "F-AV-1451 (also known as 18 F-T807) has been shown to bind selectively to paired-helical filament tau but not to other common protein aggregates such as amyloid-b, -synuclein, and TDP-43 deposits in human brain tissues (Xia et al., 2013; Marquie et al., 2015) . In vivo human studies indicate that patterns of 18 F-AV-1451 retention parallel neuropathological staging of neurofibrillary tau pathology of Alzheimer's disease and that tracer retention increases with age even in the presence of cognitive impairment and dementia (Chien et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016) . Florbetapir (also known as   18   F-AV-45 and Amyvid   TM   ) has been shown to bind to fibrillar forms of amyloid-b with high sensitivity and specificity in detection of presence and density of amyloid-b pathology with autopsy-verified histopathology (Choi et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2011) . In this study, we specifically hypothesized that in a population of older people with various degrees of cognitive impairment: (i) 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention would be independently associated with age and cross-sectional florbetapir retention, and to a lesser degree with APOE genotype; and (ii) greater annualized change in amyloid-b burden in frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal brain regions, measured by longitudinal florbetapir PET scans antecedent to 18 F-AV-1451 PET scans, would be associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention in limbic areas of inferior and lateral temporal and parietal lobes, i.e. brain sites of tau tangle deposition involved in early symptomatic disease stages. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures explained by this increased 18 F-AV-1451 retention pattern would be greater than, and independent of, the variance explained by the associated pattern of increased annualized change in florbetapir retention antecedent to 18 F-AV-1451 scan.\nF-AV-1451 retention in this region is largely considered off-target binding of the 18 F-AV-1451 tracer (Marquie et al., 2015) since limited neurofibrillary pathology has been reported in the basal ganglia. Further 18 F-AV-1451 tracer validation studies are required to assess the biological substrates of the advanced age associated greater off-target binding of the tracer in the basal ganglia structures. In our cohort, after controlling for other Alzheimer's disease-related factors, advanced age was associated with lower 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the anterior aspects of the medial frontal cortical regions. First, we should emphasize that the current study is based on a convenience cohort where the degree of true population representation is not known. Second, most neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease are strongly associated with rapid disease progression only in younger elderly individuals (Savva et al., 2009) . Older age at disease onset was associated with lower tau and amyloid-b pathology (Silbert et al., 2012) . Given the high prevalence of florbetapir-positivity in our cohort, one explanation for this negative age-association in cortical 18 F-AV-1451 binding could be that individuals who had amyloid-b pathology early had a more rapid rise in brain amyloid-b leading to rapid accumulation of tau tangles. Another possible explanation is that for any given level of cognitive impairment, a younger person is more likely to have only Alzheimer's disease as the brain pathology. On the other hand, an older person is more like to have other pathologies than just Alzheimer's disease (i.e. tau pathology), such as-but not limited to-small strokes and white matter disease. (ii) We observed that female gender was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding in diffuse cortical regions including lateral temporal, parietal, and frontal regions, in analysis uncorrected for confounding effects. Both neuropathology and in vivo studies agree that males and females may differ in the pathologic substrate for Alzheimer's disease (Lin and Doraiswamy, 2014) . Neuropathology studies suggest that females have a 3-year acceleration in tau tangle neuropathology (Corder et al., 2004) and this gender difference was largely attributable to APOE \"4 carrier females. Future research is warranted to assess the gender and APOE \"4 genotype interaction on in vivo F-AV-1451 binding prominently in lateral occipital cortices being associated with higher levels of education, in analysis uncorrected for confounding effects. Epidemiological studies suggest that education, in addition to other lifelong experiences, is associated with lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (Sharp and Gatz, 2011; Lo and Jagust, 2013) . Furthermore, previous data suggest that lifetime cognitive activity is associated with lower amyloid-b deposition (Vemuri et al., 2011; Lo and Jagust, 2013) . One explanation of this result is that education increases cognitive reserve (Stern, 2012) . This may represent an intrinsic cortical mechanism for responding to the effects of pathology, in particular amyloid-b facilitated tau accumulation. (iv) Greater global amyloid-b burden measured by florbetapir PET retention was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding in diffuse cortical regions including inferior and middle temporal regions, medial and inferior parietal cortices, and prefrontal regions, consistent with large autopsy studies and recent in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 studies (Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016) as well as the idea that neocortical tau accumulation is associated with the high amyloid-b burden.\nThe second major finding was that antecedent increased annualized change in amyloid-b burden in frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal brain regions, measured by longitudinal florbetapir PET, was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention in limbic areas of medial and inferior temporal and parietal lobes, sites of tau tangle deposition involved in early symptomatic disease stages. A florbetapir\u00c0/ + associated variability was observed in this relationship between 18 F-AV1451 SUVR and antecedent annualized change in florbetapir-SUVR identified using sparse canonical correlation analysis. In particular, the multimodality pattern association in florbetapir\u00c0 subjects was dominated by the annualized change in frontal florbetapir-SUVR with a relatively weaker increase in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal 18 F-AV1451 SUVR. Previous studies suggest that precuneus is the earliest cortical region to accumulate amyloid-b, closely followed by the cingulate and frontal cortices, then by the lateral parietal and temporal cortices (Bilgel et al., 2016) . This multimodality pattern association in florbetapir\u00c0 subjects might reflect the earliest tau deposition in the limbic areas due to the earliest amyloid-b spread. In addition, greater orbitofrontal 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention associated with increased annualized change in florbetapir retention was only observed in florbetapir + subjects. According to Braak and Braak staging, increased anterior frontal tau pathology is seen in stages III-IV with increasing cognitive impairment (Braak et al., 2011) . Thus, this multimodal pattern association specific to florbetapir + subjects may reflect a more advanced disease progression stage in florbetapir + subjects. These findings are in general consistent with three important concepts in Alzheimer's disease research not yet fully validated with in vivo data. First, autopsy studies consistently associated the spread of tau outside the medial temporal lobe with increased amyloid-b pathology (Braak et al., 1999) . Second, the most prevailing Alzheimer's disease biomarker model suggests that amyloid-b aggregation facilitates the disease pathological cascade including the tau accumulation outside the medial temporal lobe (Jack et al., 2013) . Finally, transneuronal transmission on disease-specific networks drives divergent spatiotemporal progression of amyloid-b and tau (Raj et al., 2012 (Raj et al., , 2015 .\nA long-term goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events, which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia. The ability to measure brain amyloid-b, tau, atrophy and cognition in a large group of subjects longitudinally will ultimately provide data, which will allow testing of the hypothesis that accumulation of brain amyloid-b leads to tau accumulation, which causes neurodegeneration measured by brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Our current ADNI dataset only has single time point 18 F-AV-1451 PET data, preventing a longitudinal analysis. However, we examined the feasibility of this approach using one time point by analysing the relationship of change in brain amyloid-b to brain tau to cognition. Thus our third major finding was that those brain regions that had tau tangles (measured by 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention) associated with increased annualized change in brain amyloid-b burden (measured by longitudinal florbetapir PET retention antecedent to the 18 F-AV-1451 PET scans), significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, and this was independent of the increased annualized change in florbetapir PET retention. In a region of interest analysis (Johnson et al., 2016) , greater inferior temporal 18 F-AV-1451 retention was related to greater impairment on MMSE and CDR-SB, with similar but weaker associations observed between greater global amyloid-b burden and greater impairment on MMSE and CDR-SB. In our data-driven multimodality analysis, we also observed that greater inferior temporal 18 F-AV-1451 retention, associated with increased annualized change in florbetapir retention in lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and orbitofrontal cortices, was significantly associated with global clinical outcome measures. Furthermore, it was not the increased annualized change in global amyloid-b burden, but increased annualized change in focal amyloid-b accumulation that greatly influenced the spread and severity of distant tau accumulation as detected by multimodal PET scans. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-b plaques correlate with cognition (Markesbery, 1997) , especially memory function (Terry et al., 1999) . Furthermore, cortical tau tangles are also associated with neurodegeneration (Braak and Braak, 1996; Bradley et al., 2002; Ballatore et al., 2007; Vemuri et al., 2008) , and are likely to be part of the chain of events leading to cortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Pathological studies (Braak and Braak, 1997b; Braak et al., 2011) showed that during the early development of Alzheimer's disease pathology, tau tangles increase in the medial temporal lobe, associated with synapse loss and neurodegeneration, while at the same time widespread neocortical amyloid-b plaques are developing. According to the amyloid-b hypothesis (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Karran et al., 2011) , the accumulation of amyloid-b leads to downstream events including accumulation of tau tangles, neurodegeneration, cognitive decline and dementia.\nA main strength of the present study is the inclusion of a variety of diagnostic groups including cognitively normal and early symptomatic subjects from a multi-centre study, which allowed us to study relationships between tau pathology and Alzheimer's disease-related factors in a continuum. At the same time, treating the cohort as a continuum in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology could be a flaw in our study design. In particular, even with the evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology, many of the clinically normal subjects and some of the MCI subjects will never develop Alzheimer's disease. As the subjects in our cohort are potentially samples from different populations (i.e. not necessarily on Alzheimer's disease path), the composition of the study cohort may be driving the associations observed in this study. Furthermore, MCI subjects are notoriously a very heterogeneous group and other pathologies, unrelated to Alzheimer's disease, may have contributed to variations in both tau and rates of amyloid-b. We should also note that this is a preliminary study with a relatively small sample size. Due to sample size limitations, we did not assess relationships between 18 F-AV-1451 PET, Alzheimer's disease-related factors, and brain atrophy. Future studies including more participants are needed to extend and replicate our findings."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Subjects of this study were ADNI-2 participants who recently underwent 18 F-AV-1451 PET imaging and had antecedent longitudinal florbetapir PET scans and structural MRI.

Although voxel-wise contrasts between groups were not assessed in this study, the in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR patterns were visually consistent with the patterns observed in previous post-mortem and in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET studies (Braak and Braak, 1997a; Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016) . Specifically, the florbetapir\u00c0 clinically normal subjects had low overall cortical 18 F-AV-1451 binding with presumably off-target 18 F-AV-1451 binding at basal ganglia, whereas more extensive medial temporal lobe binding was observed in the florbetapir + clinically normal subjects. Greater medial temporal lobe 18 F-AV-1451 binding with more extensive neocortical binding, especially in parietal and temporal regions, and selective sparing of primary cortices was observed with increased symptomatology as in MCI subjects. Similar to clinically normal subjects, the extent and magnitude of the 18 F-AV-1451 binding were amplified with florbetapir-positivity in MCI subjects."}, {"section_title": "F-AV-1451 binding in relation to Alzheimer's disease-related factors", "text": "In voxel-wise statistical analyses across all subjects assessing the associations between 18 F-AV1451 SUVR and each of the Alzheimer's disease-related factors without correcting for confounding effects of the remaining Alzheimer's disease-related factors, we found that (i) cortical 18 F-AV-1451 binding was positively associated with age in temporal pole and medial orbitofrontal regions, with APOE \"4 allele carrier status in hippocampus, and with global cortical florbetapir burden throughout medial and lateral temporal, lateral occipital and inferior parietal regions; (ii) cortical 18 F-AV-1451 binding was negatively associated with age, particularly in medial frontal brain regions, with male gender in lateral parieto-temporal regions, and with education in lateral occipital region; and (iii) presumably offtarget subcortical 18 F-AV-1451 binding was positively associated with age and male gender (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).\nThe independent relationships between these Alzheimer's disease-related factors and 18 F-AV-1451 binding were as follows: (i) controlling for gender, education, APOE \"4 allele carrier status, global cortical florbetapir burden, and the time interval between the last florbetapir-PET and Fig. 2A) . As global cortical florbetapir burden positively correlates with age (r = 0.16, P = 0.004), to test if correcting for confounding effects of global cortical florbetapir burden artificially introduced negative associations between age and 18 F-AV-1451 binding, analysis was repeated only controlling for gender, education, and APOE \"4 allele carrier status. Although negative association findings between age and 18 F-AV-1451 binding did not change, additional significant positive associations between age and 18 F-AV-1451 binding were observed in hippocampus and amygdala regions (Fig. 2B); (ii) increased global cortical florbetapir burden was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding in diffuse cortical regions, including inferior and middle temporal regions, medial and inferior parietal cortices, and prefrontal regions (Fig. 2C) , after correcting for age, gender, education, APOE \"4 allele carrier status, and the time interval between the last florbetapir-PET and 18 F-AV-1451 PET scans.

Florbetapir\u00c0/ + dichotomization was based on the initial florbetapir-PET scan analysis. On average, we observed increase in florbetapir SUVR throughout the cortex, with the greatest changes in the lateral temporal, medial inferior temporal, inferior parietal, medial parietal, inferior frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortices. Although florbetapir + subjects, compared to florbetapir\u00c0 subjects, had greater annualized change in florbetapir SUVR throughout the brain, florbetapir\u00c0 versus florbetapir + group differences were not significant in voxel-wise statistical analysis.\nWe used sparse canonical correlation analysis to assess the extent to which increased annualized change in florbetapir binding and spatial patterns of 18 F-AV-1451 binding were associated in our cohort. This was achieved by computing a reduced, optimal weighted average of a set of voxels in each modality that maximizes the correlation between multimodal measures. In the context of this study, sparse canonical correlation analysis aimed to isolate networks of voxels, potentially distinct for each modality, such that they collectively relate to each other with the highest correlation possibly attained within this cohort. This sparse selection of network of voxels was spatially distributed and automatically identified by using a regularized energy minimization approach to define the sets of voxels in one modality that were most informative about the other and the most reliable.\nSparse canonical correlation analysis solution vectors (i.e. weight vectors) are shown in Fig. 3 , where the brightness of the red-hued overlay is related to the solution's weighting at the local voxel. Sparse canonical correlation analysis indicated a pattern of increased annualized change in florbetapir binding in predominantly right lateral temporal and supramarginal regions, and bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices that was significantly associated with a pattern of greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding in hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal lobule predominantly in the left hemisphere (r = 0.27; P 5 10 \u00c07 ).

The pattern of increased annualized change in florbetapir binding explained 34% of the variance in MMSE score (P = 0.002) but did not add value to the pattern of greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding in explaining variance in MMSE score.\nIn the florbetapir + only sub-cohort, neither the first pattern of greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding nor the first pattern of increased annualized change in florbetapir binding explained variance in any cognitive/clinical measure independently. The second pattern of greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding explained 32% of the variance in the composite memory score (P = 0.02).\nAs exploratory analyses, we tested the main effect of global florbetapir burden and the main effects of voxelwise florbetapir SUVR measures on clinical/cognitive measures considered in this study, cross-sectional. None of the analyses reached statistical significance."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we assessed the patterns of 18 F-AV-1451 binding associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors and global clinical and cognitive outcome measures in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we explored highly associated patterns of greater 18 F-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in florbetapir binding antecedent to 18 F-AV-1451 PET, and to what extent this multimodal pattern association explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. One major difference between this work and all previously reported studies using tau PET ligands is that, in addition to classical voxel-based analysis, we used multivariate neuroimaging statistics respecting the spatial disconnect between amyloid-b and tau pathologies.\nOur major findings were as follows: (i) 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention was differentially associated with age and crosssectional florbetapir PET retention; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to 18 F-AV-1451 PET scans, prominently in the parieto-temporal brain regions as well as superior and medial frontal brain regions, was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal, lateral parietal, and to a lesser degree in the precuneus/posterior cingulate and orbitofrontal brain regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir\u00c0/ + associated variability; and (iii) greater 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention associated with increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to 18 F-AV-1451 PET scans, significantly explained variance in global clinical outcome measures, and this was independent of the increased annualized change in florbetapir retention.\nThe first major finding was that 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention was independently associated with age and cross- sectional florbetapir PET retention, but not with education, gender, or APOE \"4 genotype. This main observation was in line with neuropathology literature consistently reporting significant influence of age and amyloid-b on formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles but a lack of independent effect of APOE \"4 genotype on neurofibrillary tau tangle formation (Serrano-Pozo et al., 2015; Mufson et al., 2016) . Although the literature on association between in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention and the Alzheimer's diseaserelated factors is very limited at this point, our interpretation of these findings is as follows: (i) After correcting for global cortical florbetapir burden, advanced age was associated with greater 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the basal forebrain, temporal pole, and to some extent in the medial temporal lobe. Weaker age-associated 18 F-AV-1451 retention findings especially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex might be due to off-target binding in adjacent structures (Marquie et al., 2015) and relatively greater partial volume effects induced by greater tau-associated atrophy in these structures. Consistent with our findings, one in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET study previously reported advanced age associated greater in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention in medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, and insula in cognitively normal participants (Scholl et al., 2016) , while another notable study reported significant negative association between age and inferior temporal 18 F-AV-1451 PET retention in cognitively normal participants (Johnson et al., 2016) , both studies potentially capturing different aspects of age-related tau accumulation reported in large autopsy studies (Braak et al., 2011) . The strongest association between advanced age and greater 18 F-AV-1451 retention was observed in the basal ganglia."}]
