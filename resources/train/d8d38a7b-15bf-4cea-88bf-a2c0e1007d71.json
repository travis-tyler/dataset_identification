[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We apply instrumental variables (IV) techniques to a pooled data set of employment-focused experiments to examine the relation between type of preschool childcare and subsequent externalizing problem behavior for a large sample of low-income children. To assess the potential usefulness of this approach for addressing biases that can confound causal inferences in child care research, we compare instrumental variables results with those obtained using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We find that our OLS estimates concur with prior studies showing small positive associations between center-based care and later externalizing behavior. By contrast, our IV estimates indicate that preschool-aged children with center care experience are rated by mothers and teachers as having fewer externalizing problems on entering elementary school than their peers who were not in child care as preschoolers. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on associations between different types of community-based child care and children's social behavior, particularly within low-income populations. Moreover, we use this study to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of each analytic method for addressing causal questions in developmental research. \nDev Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 January 23. \nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nChanges in U.S. policy toward low-income families over the past two decades have contributed to unprecedented employment rates among single mothers and equally dramatic increases in the use of nonparental care for young children (Schoeni & Blank, 2000) . An estimated one million low-income children under the age of 6 years entered regular care arrangements in the wake of welfare reform (Fuller & Kagan, 2000) . Interest in identifying the effects of various early care and education settings on child well-being has intensified amidst mounting evidence that the first five years of life form an important foundation for later development Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) .\nNumerous studies suggest that center-based preschool programs can promote school readiness, especially among low-income children (Gormley, Gayer, Phillips, & Dawson, 2005; Love et al., 2003; Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007; NICHD Early Child-care Research Network, 2005), prompting many states to expand their efforts to fund such programs (see Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005) . Long-standing concerns exist, however, about the consequences of nonmaternal care-particularly center care-for children's socioemotional development (see Belsky, 2001 ). Several large-scale studies have demonstrated a link between center care experience and behavior problems during middle childhood (Halle et al., 2006; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2004), and early childhood professionals have reported increased rates of behavior difficulties in structured settings (Gilliam, 2005) . Yet other studies have failed to find an association between center care and problem behavior, particularly within low-income samples (Loeb, Fuller, Kagan, & Carrol, 2004; VotrubaDrzal, Coley, & Chase-Lansdale, 2004).\nIsolating whether developmental effects are attributable to child care or other factors is a major challenge in this work. Many of the empirical techniques used in developmental science make it difficult to separate correlation from causation (Blau, 1999; Duncan, Magnuson, & Ludwig, 2004) . In this study, we evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of two methods for estimating the effects of different preschool child care settings on children's subsequent behavior. Specifically, we compare the typical approach of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, controlling for a set of co variates, with instrumental variables (IV) estimation. By exploiting exogenous variation in families' use of different types of care-this case, arrangements induced by experimental treatments-IV controls for biases that arise when child or family characteristics affect both care selection and child functioning. In addition to its methodological contribution, this study informs the literature on the relation of community-based child care to young children's social behavior within low-income populations.\nOLS regression is a common analytic tool in social science research and, under classical assumptions, produces the best un biased linear estimates (Berry, 1993) . If these assumptions are violated, however, predictors can be correlated with the error term (or endogenous), resulting in biased parameter estimates. For example, omitting variables related to both the predictor and the outcome from the analytic model induces a spurious correlation between them. This is a significant concern in the child care literature given that the determinants of care and child well-being are not randomly distributed across families (Burchinal & Nelson, 2000; Cleveland, Wiebe, van den Oord, & Rowe, 2000; Lamb, 1998; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early Childcare Research Network & Duncan, 2003). Such factors as parental education, income, ethnicity, and beliefs are associated with child care quality, quantity, and type, as well as with children's development (Early & Burchinal, 2001; Fuller, Kagan, Caspary, & Gauthier, 2002 ; Huston, Chang, & Gennetian, 2002; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2004; Pungello Kurtz-Costes, 1999) . In addition, simultaneity bias is possible the association between child care and behavior is attributed entirely to the effect of care on behavior when the relationship actually bidirectional in nature (Duncan et al., 2004) . For example, parents' selection of child care likely reflects their assessment children's behavior or maturity, and parents of children with extensive behavior problems often face considerable constraints their care options (Gilliam, 2005) .\nThe most common method for addressing endogeneity concerns in child care research (and developmental science in general) multivariate regression with controls for a set of observed characteristics. This technique has several merits and is often driven by strong conceptual models; however, it is impossible to guarantee empirically that all potential sources of bias are accounted for, particularly those that are difficult to measure or observe. Moreover, the extensive use of covariates can approximate situations that do not exist in the real world and may be problematic if covariates are determined by, rather than determinants of, an outcome (Duncan et al., 2004; Newcombe, 2003) .\nInstrumental variable (IV) techniques, commonly used in the field of economics, have the potential to remove endogeneity bias from regression estimates (Angrist, Imbens, & Rubin, 1996; Moffitt, 2005) . The central strategy in IV estimation is to find a variable, or \"instrument,\" that produces exogenous variation in the predictor of interest, variation that can then be used to cleanly estimate the relationship between the predictor and outcome. IV has been used only occasionally in developmental research (see Arnold, McWilliams, & Arnold, 1998; Foster & McLanahan, 1996; Gennetian, Magnuson, & Morris, 2008; Magnuson et al., 2004) , primarily as a result of challenges in finding viable instruments. In this study, we required an instrument that predicted child care type but was otherwise uncorrelated with child functioning.\nA relatively novel application of IV with random-assignment data from social policy experiments has tremendous potential for addressing casual questions about development and family process and resolves some of the challenges faced in prior IV work (Gennetian, Morris, Bos, & Bloom, 2005; Riccio & Bloom, 2002) . Random assignment status is an ideal candidate for use as an instrument, because it is, by definition, exogenous to child, family, and community characteristics (Angrist et al., 1996) . Several studies have used this method to explore mechanisms by which intervention effects occur (Gennetian, Crosby, Dowsett, Huston, & Principe, 2006; Gibson-Davis, Magnuson, Gennetian & Duncan, 2005; Liebman, Katz, & Kling, 2004; Ludwig, Duncan, & Hirschfield, 2001; Magnuson & McGroder, 2002; Morris, Duncan, & Rodrigues, 2006; Morris & Gennetian, 2003) . Here, we applied this technique to data from several welfare and employment experiments to assess the effects of child care arrangements induced by the various policies tested in these studies. We used this analysis to illustrate the conditions, assumptions, and hazards of IV estimation and its potential utility for addressing developmental questions. There is an important distinction between the effects captured by OLS regression and IV estimation. Whereas OLS estimates rely on all of the natural variation that exists across the entire sample, IV estimates are derived only from the variation attributable to the (exogenous) instrument-in this case, parents who were induced by the experiment to use care arrangements they would not have otherwise used. For example, random assignment to a treatment that includes additional resources for child care may induce parents to use arrangements they would not be able to afford in the absence of the experiment. In economics, this effect is referred to as the local average treatment effect and differs from both intent-to-treat estimates, which measure overall program-control group differences regardless of take-up or participation rates, and treatment-on-the-treated estimates, which capture effects for those who actually receive the treatment (Angrist et al., 1996; Moffitt, 2005) .\nOne of the benefits of instrumental variable techniques is the tendency to generate parameter estimates that are consistent (i.e., convergent to population parameters as sample size grows), an improvement on conventional OLS estimates, which are never consistent in the presence of endogeneity regardless of sample size. At the same time, IV estimates are not impervious to bias, particularly in the context of very small samples (Angrist & Krueger, 2001; Gennetian et al., 2005) . The amount of bias depends largely on how well several key assumptions of IV are met (Angrist et al., 1996; Gennetian, Magnuson, & Morris, 2008) . First, instruments must represent a truly exogenous source of variation and must have a meaningful effect on both the endogenous variable and the outcome of interest. Instrumental variable analyses (with experimental or nonexperimental data) often suffer from low power to detect effects because of a weak relationship between the instrument and endogenous predictor. Weak instruments tend to produce estimates that are unreliable and biased toward the OLS estimate (Bound, Jaeger, & Baker, 1995) .\nA second assumption, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) requires that there be no overall community or displacement effects and that individuals within a particular program group have equal exposure to the treatment. In this study, we assume that individual values of child care and child behavior were unaffected by others' values on these variables, a reasonable assumption given that the number of participants in any one community was relatively small. It is unlikely that crowding out occurred in child care availability or that a single care arrangement or classroom contained multiple sample members. (For other scenarios in which SUTVA would not hold, see discussion in Sobel, 2006) .\nWell-designed and well-implemented social policy experiments satisfy the aforementioned assumptions . Two additional assumptions are more difficult to meet and deserve further discussion. Instrumental variables are assumed to move the endogenous predictor in one direction only (i.e., effects are monotonic). In an experimental context, the expectation is that participants do not behave opposite to their group assignment; for example, we assume that program group parents were not induced by the treatments to use less child care than they would have if they belonged to the control group. Although this 1 We note that the linear two-stage procedure described here can be used regardless of whether the endogenous variable (i.e., the dependent variable in the first stage) is continuous or binary; however, when the outcome of interest (i.e., the dependent variable in the second stage) is nonlinear, a slightly different approach (e.g., generalized method of moments) is needed to obtain instrumental variable estimates (Amemiya, 1990; Foster, 1997; Gennetian et al., 2008) .\nDev Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 January 23.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript assumption should be taken seriously, simulations in which participants act counter to their assignment suggest that violations do not substantively alter our findings.\nFinally, and perhaps most important to our analysis, the exclusion restriction requires that an instrumental variable be unrelated to the outcome variable except through its effect on the predictor being instrumented-that is, that it be totally mediated. In our case, instrumenting for type of care alone implies that all of the program effects on child behavior occur through their impacts on type of care. This assumption is untenable given that the experiments were designed primarily to influence parents' economic outcomes and may also have affected maternal well-being and parenting. Our analysis therefore instruments for these variables as well. IV estimation requires at least one instrument for each endogenous regressor; moreover, to produce meaningful results, the instruments should have differential effects on the variables in question (see Gennetian et al., 2008) . To disentangle the developmental effects of child care and income, for example, one ideally would have access to an instrument predicting child care (but not income) and another instrument predicting income (but not child care).\nStudies with multiple-group research designs (i.e., multiple treatments) and those with site differences in impacts can yield multiple instruments . Pooling microdata across random assignment studies testing different policies is another viable option for accessing multiple instruments with the added benefit of increasing sample size.\nIn the current study, we pool across 21 experiments to estimate the effects of center-and home-based child care on children's behavior net of the effects of maternal employment, earnings, income, and depressive symptoms. The mechanics of this technique are delineated below.\nRich longitudinal data on children's experiences in care (e.g., the NICHD Study of Early Child Care) have greatly advanced the field by simultaneously examining amount, timing, quality, and stability of care. These dimensions vary greatly within any type of care, but several structural differences between center-and home-based settings may affect social development independently of other aspects of care. As compared with home-based care, centers are more likely to have a predictable daily schedule, a structured curriculum, an environment designed for children, trained caregivers, larger groups of similarly aged children, and higher ratios of children to adults (e.g., Fuller, Kagan, Loeb, & Chang, 2004; Kisker, Hofferth, Phillips, & Farquhar, 1991; Kontos, Hsu, & Dunn, 1994) . Larger group sizes can provide greater opportunity for interaction with same-age peers, a potentially important experience for the development of social competence. At the same time, large groups can also increase the likelihood of interpersonal conflict and reduce the opportunity for interaction with adults (Dowsett, Huston, Imes, & Gennetian, 2008).\nOverall differences in care quality may also contribute to different effects for center-and home-based arrangements. Although both types of settings exhibit a wide range of quality (e.g., Fuller et al., 2004) , observational studies of settings serving low-income samples indicate higher average quality for centers than for home-based care, particularly with respect to cognitive stimulation (Coley, Chase-Lansdale & Li-Grining, 2001; Dowsett et al., 2008; Fuller et al., 2004; Loeb et al., 2004) . Indeed, numerous studies report better school readiness skills among children of all income levels who attend centers during the preschool years (see Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005) .\nFindings regarding children's social behavior, however, have been mixed. On the one hand, high-quality, center-based preschool programs for low-income children can promote social skills (Barnett, 1995; Schweinhart & Weikart, 1997; Yoshikawa, 1995) . In the national Head \nThe present study has a dual purpose. First, we compare two analytic methods-OLS regression and IV estimation-for estimating the relations between child care type and externalizing problems in order to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each. Second, we seek to use these analyses to inform the literature on the developmental effects of different care settings for children in low-income, single-mother families experiencing welfare-to-work policies. Both purposes uniquely contribute to child care research.\nDebate about child care effects on behavior has focused primarily on externalizing problems, in part because demonstrated relations of child care to externalizing behavior are pronounced and also because it is a potential precursor to deviant and aggressive behavior. Yet, evidence that group care settings may contribute to stress and anxiety in young children (Ahnert, Gunnar, Lamb, & Barthel, 2004; Watamura, Dowzella, Alwin, & Gunnar, 2003) suggests that internalizing problems should not be overlooked. In the current study, we conducted all analyses for both externalizing and internalizing behavior but concentrated on the former given space constraints and concerns about precision in the estimates of the latter (full results available on request). Measures of child behavior typically vary across reporters and contexts (e.g., home and school). Although maternal ratings provide valuable information, they are confounded with maternal well-being. Mothers with high levels of depressive symptoms tend to rate children higher on problem behaviors than do other mothers NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 1999; Yeung, Linver & Brooks-Gunn, 2002) . Moreover, mothers' and teachers' reports of child behavior tend to be only modestly correlated (usually in the .20-.30 range), and teacher ratings generally are not associated with maternal depression (Chang, 2003; Eisenberg et al., 2001; Runions & Keating, 2007; West, Denton, & Germino-Hausken, 1999). In this study, we examined both mother and teacher reports and controlled for maternal depressive symptoms. \nWe use data from six random-assignment studies of welfare and employment programs for low-income parents (see Table 1 ). Because some studies included multiple sites and others had multiple treatments, these studies provide information on 21 programs: Connecticut Jobs First, New Hope, two tests of the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) in urban counties, one test of the MFIP in rural counties, three tests of labor force attachment models in National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), one test of Canada's Self-Sufficiency Program (SSP) in British Columbia, two tests of SSP in New Brunswick, and 10 sites in the New Chance study. Although a common set of policies was tested across the 16 sites in New Chance, prior work indicates that program impacts on child care use varied by site (Yoshikawa, Rosman, & Hsueh, 2001 ). To capitalize on this variation in effects, we analyzed the New Chance data at site level, excluding six sites that had fewer than 10 observations in our targeted child age range. In sensitivity analyses, we include New Chance as a single instrument (collapsing across sites) to test the robustness of our results.\nKey policies tested in these experiments included the following: (a) earnings supplements, which provided cash bonuses for a set level of employment or allowed continued welfare receipt as earnings increased; (b) mandatory employment services that required participants to engage in job search activities or move directly into employment; (c) time limits on welfare receipt; and (d) enhanced child care assistance, which offered families additional resources to facilitate the use of licensed care. Although none of the programs constituted direct interventions for children, developmental impacts could occur through changes in family economic circumstances, family functioning, and experiences in various care environments.\nProgram impacts on parents' economic outcomes and child care use for the larger samples in these studies are well documented (D. Bloom & Michalopoulos, 2001; Gennetian, Crosby, Huston, & Lowe, 2004; Schoeni & Blank, 2000) . Earnings supplements increased income and employment, whereas employment mandates in isolation typically increased only the latter because additional earnings were offset by lost welfare benefits. Programs offering enhanced child care assistance increased the use of center-based child care; programs without enhanced child care assistance increased the use of home-based care (Crosby, Gennetian, & Huston, 2005) .\nOur pooled data set has several advantages, including random assignment data, comparable measures across studies, longitudinal follow-ups of children into elementary school, and a large sample (N = 3,290). Ideally, the data for this study would be derived from one large random assignment evaluation across multiple sites and testing numerous treatments. Pooling microdata from several experiments has been described as the next best option Riccio & Bloom, 2002) . We determined this to be a reasonable approach with the current set of studies given their comparability in design, sampling, and measurement. Each study included a survey approximately two to three years after random assignment as well as administrative records on employment, earnings, and welfare receipt throughout the follow-up period Across the experiments, similar measures of baseline socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and subsequent employment, income, earnings, parent psychological well-being, child care, and children's behavior problems were used. Our analyses controlled for a variety of baseline characteristics and study/site indicators to account for any unmeasured time-invariant characteristics of particular programs.\nCrosby et al. Page 7\nDev Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 January 23.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nThe current data set has already generated useful information about the well-being of lowincome children across various sites in the United States and Canada (Clark-Kauffman, Duncan, & Morris, 2003; Gennetian, 2004) .\nIn each study, one or two \"focal\" children per family were selected to be evaluated in the follow-up interview. Our analysis sample was limited to focal children who were 3 years 0 months to 4 years 11 months old at the beginning of the child care data collection period. We focus on this age group because children of this age are likely to spend more time in care compared with school-age children. We exclude children younger than three years of age because the studies lack adequate data for this age group. Furthermore, issues surrounding care (e.g., availability, quality, parental preferences) and its effects on development are likely to differ for infants and toddlers in comparison with preschoolers.\nDescriptive information for the analysis sample appears in Table 2 . Baseline characteristics of parents and children by study are presented in Appendix A. As expected with random assignment, any differences between program and control groups (8 of the 156 contrasts shown were statistically significant at the p < .05 level) can be attributed to chance. Survey response rates were quite high (from 75% to 85%) given the disadvantaged nature of this sample; attrition analyses appear in the individual reports. Approximately 15% of our preschool-aged sample lacked child care and/or social behavior data, more than a third of which is attributable to a priori design decisions in two of the studies. New Hope participants completed behavior ratings for only one of their (randomly selected) children even though up to two children per household were included in the sample. In SSP, participants were asked about child care for their youngest child only. Rather than impute values for variables with incomplete item-level data, our main analyses were restricted to cases with valid child care and behavior data. All cases in this subsample had complete baseline information (standard forms were administered at study entry, usually in the context of applying for or receiving public assistance); more than 99% had administrative economic data, and 97% had valid data on maternal depressive symptoms. To further consider the potential implications of missing data for our estimates, we examined patterns of missing data; conducted sensitivity analyses excluding studies with higher amounts of missing data (described in more detail below); and, re-ran our OLS analyses using multiple imputation methods. In this final check, we used the Imputation by Chained Equations program in STATA 10.0) to impute values for missing child care, child behavior, maternal depression, and economic outcome data based on an extensive list of baseline covariates including study site. All of the strategies described above indicated no qualitative or significant differences in the estimates.\nFamily and child baseline covariates-The following demographic and socioeconomic indicators assessed at baseline (i.e., prior to random assignment) were included as covariates in the analyses: child's age and gender, mother's age and ethnicity, number of children in the household, mother's marital history, mother's completion of high school or a graduate equivalency degree, mother's employment and earnings in the prior year, and family welfare receipt of two or more years. We also included a series of dummy variables representing each study site.\nChild care experiences-As part of the follow-up surveys, mothers provided retrospective reports of child care use for the prior 18 months to 2 years. Those who used at least one regular care arrangement (10+ hr per week) at any point during this period were asked additional questions about each arrangement. The child care measure covered all or \nNIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript most of the period between random assignment and the follow-up assessment, with one exception: In New Chance, detailed child care information was collected for the first 18 months of the study (when children were approximately 3 to 5 years old), whereas behavior outcomes were measured during the 42-month interview (when children were approximately 5 to 7 years old).\nWe categorized care arrangements into center-based care (including child care centers, preschool programs, and Head Start), and home-based care (including unregulated care by relatives nonrelatives and family child care homes that may be licensed certified). Our main analyses compared outcomes for children who experienced four mutually exclusive patterns of care: (a) only center-based care, (b) only home-based care, (c) a mix of center and homebased arrangements, or (d) no nonmaternal care over the follow-up period. Exclusive centeror home-based care may proxy for more exposure to that type of care or may indicate more stable patterns of care than mixed arrangements. The frequency of each type of care is shown in Table 2 . Almost 80% of preschoolers this sample were in some form of child care during the assessment period; one third of these children experienced mixed care, 21% were in center-based care exclusively, and 24% were in home based arrangements exclusively.\nFour of the studies (Connecticut Jobs First, MFIP, New Chance, and New Hope) collected information about duration of care arrangements; we used these data to examine the association between amount and type of care. Children who experienced center care exclusively and home care exclusively were in care for approximately 60% of the follow-up period. Children in mixed care were in center and home care (either concurrently or consecutively) for 45% and 52% of the follow-up, respectively. Assessments of care quality and information about licensing were unavailable in these studies. Zero-order relationships between the baseline covariates and types of care are shown in Table 3 . Correlations were very similar for program and control groups (not shown).\nEmployment, income, and earnings-Unemployment insurance and public assistance records provided information on mothers' employment and earnings from the time of random assignment through the follow-up period. From these records, we constructed average quarterly employment, average quarterly income, and average quarterly earnings across the quarters for which we had child care data. The income measure was the sum of welfare income (from public assistance records), earnings, and earnings supplements when appropriate. Income from other household members or noncustodial parents (e.g., child support) was not included. Radloff, 1977) . The CES-D assesses the frequency of such symptoms as crying or feeling lonely in the prior week. Two of the studies used a subset of the original 20 items, so standardized z scores (created within study) were used in the analysis.\nChildren's externalizing behavior-Maternal ratings of children's externalizing behavior were collected at follow-up in each study with three comparable scales-items from the Behavior Problem Index (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1981; Peterson & Zill, 1986) in the Connecticut Jobs First, MFIP, New Chance, and NEWWS studies; the Problem Behavior Scale of the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliot, 1990) New Hope) collected teacher ratings of externalizing behavior for children who had entered school by the time of the follow-up assessment (N = 379) with measures that were similar or identical to those completed by parents. Maternal and teacher reports of externalizing behavior were moderately correlated, r(366) =.34, p <. 001. Zero-order correlations of the covariates and predictors with mother-and teacher-reported outcomes are shown in Table 4 .\nWe performed parallel OLS and IV analyses estimating the effects of different types of preschool child care on mother and teacher reports of children's externalizing problems during the early school years. In all of the analyses, behavior ratings were compared for children who experienced only center care, only home-based care, mixed care, or no regular child care during the study period. The no-care group served as the omitted category because it is considered the norm for the population relevant to these studies (i.e., single mothers receiving public assistance prior to federal welfare reform).\nOrdinary least squares regression models-In the first OLS model, we predicted maternal ratings of externalizing behavior as a function of the types of care children experienced during the follow-up period, controlling for baseline (pretreatment) covariates. A second model included maternal depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings as additional predictors. A similar pair of OLS models was evaluated for teacher ratings of child behavior; however, because teacher data are available in only three studies and for a relatively small number of children, these models contain a reduced list of covariates and include maternal earnings as the only additional predictor. Three covariates (mother's age, mother never married, and employment in year prior to study entry) as well as maternal depressive symptoms were omitted because they contribute little to the prediction of teacher-rated behavior.\nIndicators of experimental treatment status were not included in the OLS models. To detect systematic differences by treatment group status in the relations between care and behavior, we conducted OLS analyses for the program and control groups separately as well as jointly and found no notable differences (results not shown).\nInstrumental variables analysis-We used instrumental variables (with 2SLS) to evaluate a set of models similar to those described above for OLS. Instead of relying on naturally occurring variation in child care, however, the IV models exploited experimentally induced variation to estimate the relationship between type of care setting and children's behavior.\nIn the first-stage equation, each child care category (i.e., exclusive center care, exclusive home-based care, and mixed care) was regressed on a set of baseline covariates and 21 dummy variables representing random assignment status (experimental = 1; control = 0) for each of the programs/sites. Thus, program-control group differences in the occurrence of each type of care within a given study/site were used to generate predicted child care values for children in that study; these values reflect the likelihood of children experiencing each type of care given their family's assignment to the program or control group in a particular study. Differential impacts on child care use across the studies created variability in the predicted levels for individual children. The second-stage IV equation was identical to the OLS regression with the exception that predicted child care values from the first stage were used instead of the observed values. To estimate these models, we use the \"ivreg\" procedure in STATA, which automatically provides the correct second-stage standard errors (assuming that linearity in the dependent variable does not affect our results).\nDev Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 January 23.\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\nAs in the OLS analysis, we first tested the effects of child care type and then evaluated a second model that considers the potential role of maternal depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings. To satisfy the exclusion restriction in IV, we instrumented for these additional predictors in the same way we instrumented for child care type (see Gennetian et al., 2008) . We took advantage of 21 unique instruments available in the pooled data set. The IV models with teacher data included a reduced set covariates and instrument for type of care and maternal earnings only. Detailed empirical specifications for the IV models are provided in Appendix B.\nResults\nWe began by examining individual study impacts on child care, employment, income, earnings, and depressive symptoms (shown as program-control group differences in Table 5 ) and on mother and teacher ratings of children's externalizing behavior (shown Table 6 ). These \"reduced form\" effects underlie our ability estimate the IV models. The important information in these tables is not whether there were impacts in individual studies but whether there was variation in impacts on both child care type and behavior across studiesvariation that allowed us to estimate the effects program-induced variability to variation in children's behavior Indeed, we found that our instruments statistically related to the predictors of interest.\nIn parallel OLS and IV models estimating the effects of care type on externalizing behavior, we considered children who experienced exclusive center-based care, exclusive home-based care, mixed arrangements, in comparison with those not in regular nonmaternal care. For mother-reported behavior, Model 1 tested the effect of the child care variables, controlling for baseline covariates; Model 2 added mothers' CES-D scores, employment, income, and earnings. For teacher-reported behavior, Model included the baseline covariates and child care variables, and Model 2 added maternal earnings. In the OLS models, maternal depression and economic variables were included as additional predictors; in the IV models, these variables were instrumented by deriving predicted values from the experimental impacts on each.\nMother-rated behavior-Results for mother-reported problems appear in the first four columns of Table 7 ; in each pair coefficients, OLS estimates appear first, followed by the corresponding IV estimates.\nThe OLS estimates indicate a positive association between center care (either exclusively or combined with home-based arrangements) and externalizing behavior and no effects for exclusive home-based care. Coefficients for exclusive center care and mixed care were similar in magnitude, and both changed little when maternal depressive symptoms and economic variables were added to the model. The magnitude of the effects was small: 10% increase in the probability of experiencing either type of care was associated with .01-.02 of a standard deviation more externalizing behavior compared with children who were not in child care.\nA different pattern of relations between care arrangement and externalizing behavior emerged from the IV analyses; these models indicate lower externalizing scores for children who experienced only center care arrangements as preschoolers. This effect was statistically significant in the model that simultaneously instrumented for maternal depressive symptoms and economic outcomes. The larger coefficient in Model 2 suggests that the center care effect cannot be explained by variation in mothers' depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings. The coefficient of .015 indicates that a 10% increase in the probability of exclusive center care was associated with a .15 standard deviation decrease in externalizing problems (compared to no care). The IV estimates for exclusive home-based care and mixed care are not significantly different from the reference category of no care; post hoc comparisons of exclusive center care with the other types of care indicate differences that do not reach statistical significance (center only vs. mixed, \u03c7 2 (1) = 2.28, p = .13; center only vs. home only, \u03c7 2 (1) = 1.43, p = .23).\nWe performed several tests to evaluate the validity of the IV estimates. First stage F tests on the instruments (shown in brackets in Table 7 ) indicated sufficient strength for each endogenous predictor, with the exception of maternal depressive symptoms (not surprising given that this outcome was not targeted by the programs and that few impacts occurred). We further evaluated our IV results by employing two commonly used tests. First, when instruments outnumber regressors, an overidentification test (e.g., Sargan statistic) can be used to measure the association between instruments and the error term in the second-stage equation; valid instruments should not have any such association as they are assumed to reflect random variation in the predictor. For all models in the current analysis, Sargan's statistic confirmed the exogenous nature of our instrument set. Second, we also computed the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) chi-square statistic to evaluate whether OLS and IV estimators were equivalent; rejection of the null hypothesis is generally taken as an indication of non-equivalence and endogeneity (though other conditions may lead to rejecting the null as well, including model misspecification; Davidson & MacKinnon, 1993) . Statistically significant DWH tests for exclusive center care, \u03c7 2 (1) = 5.29, p < .05, income, \u03c7 2 (1) = 5.77, p < .05, and earnings, \u03c7 2 (1) = 4.49, p < .05, suggested bias in the OLS estimates for these variables.\nTeacher-rated behavior-According to the OLS estimates shown in Columns 5 and 7 of Table 7 , children who experienced mixed care as preschoolers had more teacher-rated externalizing problems in elementary school than those without preschool child care experience. A 10% increase in the probability of using mixed care was associated with a .02 standard deviation increase in externalizing behavior.\nBy contrast, the IV analyses indicated effects (of marginal statistical significance, p < .10) in the opposite direction, specifically, children who experienced either exclusive center care or mixed care received lower externalizing scores from teachers. The IV coefficient for exclusive center care indicates that a 10% increase in the probability of this care was associated with a .25 standard deviation reduction in teacher-reported externalizing problems. This effect was larger than that for parent-reported problems but was also less precise (indicated by the larger standard error), partly because few studies collected teacher data. As in the parent models, post hoc tests revealed no statistically significant differences between the three types of care. At the same time, the DWH test of consistency between OLS and IV estimates indicates that some endogeneity existed, \u03c7 2 (1) = 9.80, p < .05; the only individual variable for which this test approached significance was exclusive center care, \u03c7 2 (1) = 2.21, p = .14.\nThe finding that both exclusive center care and mixed care reduce behavior problems at school tentatively suggests a benefit from having at least some exposure to center care during the preschool years. A follow-up IV analysis indicates that experiencing any center care was associated with significantly lower teacher ratings of externalizing behavior (\u03b2 = \u2212. 015, SE = .008, p < .05). A similar analysis of home-based care revealed no significant effects on teacher-rated behavior. \nWe conducted follow-up analyses with alternative model specifications to ensure that results were not disproportionately influenced by one or two studies. In one analysis, we excluded the New Chance study because its program and sample differed somewhat from those of other studies. In a second test, we collapsed across the New Chance sites, treating them as a single experiment (and using treatment status as one instrument), given concerns about small samples in the individual sites. In a third analysis, we excluded the Canadian SSP sites, because differences in local and national contexts could affect our estimates. The OLS and IV coefficients for child care type remained qualitatively similar across all of these analyses (results available upon request).\nThis study joins several recent articles that highlight the usefulness of comparing results across methods within a single data set (e.g., Magnuson et al., 2007; McCartney et al., 2010; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early Child-care Research Network & Duncan, 2003). Our approach differs from earlier work by examining experimentally induced differences in the types of childcare arrangements used by lowincome mothers affected by policies designed to increase their employment. We contrast OLS and IV estimates of the relations between type of child care and children's externalizing behavior with pooled data from 21 random-assignment policy experiments that increased maternal employment, changed family economic resources, and increased children's exposure to a variety of nonmaternal care settings.\nConsistent with prior research linking center care experience to behavior problems (e.g., Halle et al., 2006; Magnuson et al., 2007; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2004), our OLS results indicate higher maternal ratings of externalizing problems for school-age children who had attended centers as preschoolers (either exclusively or combined with home-based care) than for children who had not had regular care arrangements. Teachers also reported more problems for children with prior center experience (at a marginal level of significance), particularly for those who had been in mixed care. The OLS results are robust to controls for baseline covariates, maternal depression, employment, income, and earnings.\nBy contrast, IV techniques indicate that children who had been in only center arrangements during their preschool years had fewer subsequent externalizing problems, according to both mothers and teachers. Teachers also reported fewer problems for children who had experienced mixed care arrangements. That is, according to teachers, children who had experienced any center care as pre-schoolers exhibited fewer problems in their early school years than did their peers with no such experience. Having at least some exposure to organized group care prior to school entry may help children acquire appropriate classroom behaviors. These results should be considered suggestive rather than conclusive. Although the IV coefficients for center care were consistently larger than those for home-based and mixed care, estimates for the three types of care were not statistically different from one another.\nInterestingly, our OLS results mirror those obtained in correlational studies, whereas our IV results are similar to findings from random-assignment studies of early childhood interventions. This pattern suggests that an instrumental variables approach may address biases not easily controlled for in correlational designs. A number of attempts to reproduce Child care history prior to study entry is one unmeasured factor that might help to explain the discrepant findings. The present data captured care experiences across the preschool period (i.e., ages to 5 years) and social behavior ratings when children were 5 to years old. Random assignment presumably equates program and control groups on amount and type of child care experienced prior to three years of age, but different histories could affect the OLS comparisons, which capture the cumulative effects of child care Extensive hours of care (especially in centers) for infants and toddlers have been shown to predict relatively high levels externalizing behavior in preschool and elementary school (Belsky et al., 2007; Waldfogel, 2006) . During the early 1990s when these data were collected, low-income mothers of infants and toddlers were much less likely to be in the labor force (and to be using child care) than presently.\nWe used multiple treatment effects as instruments to separate the effects of child care type from those of employment, income, earnings, and maternal depressive symptoms. The child care coefficients change little when additional variables are added to the model, but is possible that treatments that increased center care also changed some unmeasured feature of children's lives (e.g., parents' employment schedule or stability) in ways that influenced behavior.\nIn reconciling the IV and OLS results, we questioned whether center care induced by the experiments was somehow different than center care received by children in the control group (and by extension, center care accessible to the general population). Several programs that increased the use of centers offered more generous, seamless, or comprehensive child care assistance than the assistance available in the control condition (Crosby et al. 2005) , which may have allowed families to access higher quality care or maintain more stable care than they would have otherwise We doubt, however, that OLS-IV discrepancies reflect systematic differences in quality or stability within type because (a) OLS estimates of the relations between type of care and behavior do not differ by treatment group status (i.e., center care is associated with more problems in both groups), and (b) there are no experimental impacts on crude measures of structural characteristics of care (e.g., child-toadult ratios) in the subset of studies that collected this information (Crosby et al., 2005) .\nNotably, our OLS and IV results are not discrepant for all predictors (i.e., maternal depression and economic variables). Moreover, parallel analyses examining the effects of child-care type on school achievement, we find consistent results across the two methodsboth the OLS and IV estimates indicate academic benefits for children attending centers in the year or two prior to school entry (Gennetian et al., 2006) . These findings provide some assurance that the OLS-IV differences reported here are not an artifact of method. Finally, the robustness of our IV coefficients to changes in the sample and instrument set boosts our confidence in the results.\nThis study relies on a global measure of children's care experiences (i.e., types of arrangements during a 2-year period); thus, we cannot determine the extent to which measured effects reflect care quality, stability, or intensity, nor do we know whether Second, small samples of preschoolers in some of the programs and sites prevented us from examining whether the observed relationships varied for particular subgroups of children (e.g., by child gender or ethnicity). Third, this set of studies does not contain large enough samples of children younger than the age of 3 years to estimate the effects of care type on infants and toddlers, a group for which there are particular concerns about the effects of organized care (Belsky et al., 2007) . Finally, our method of complete-case analysis could lead us to underestimate or over. estimate the true effects of care on behavior if study attrition led to a restricted range of behavior problem reports. However, our confidence in the estimates is strengthened given that we also conducted missing-at-random-based analyses of multiply imputed data; in that case, any selective nonresponse would have to be over and above patterns of missingness related to the covariates. Further research is necessary both to replicate the current set of results and to identify particular circumstances in which center care can promote or impede socioemotional adjustment (e.g., see McCartney et al., 2010).\nAlthough this broad look at child care type stands in contrast to the rich information about child care in other studies, our data set has several strengths not available in most other studies, including longitudinal, random-assignment designs with multiple sources of information on large samples of low-income children who experienced substantial shifts in child care as a result of mothers' interactions with welfare and employment programs. Moreover, the effects captured by the IV analysis-the impact of child care for families whose arrangements would change as a result of the interventions tested in these studiesare particularly relevant for policy. Given these advantages, the information produced here is, intended to complement that from more intensive naturalistic studies in the pursuit of understanding how child care experiences relate to children's development."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Changes in U.S. policy toward low-income families over the past two decades have contributed to unprecedented employment rates among single mothers and equally dramatic increases in the use of nonparental care for young children (Schoeni & Blank, 2000) . An estimated one million low-income children under the age of 6 years entered regular care arrangements in the wake of welfare reform (Fuller & Kagan, 2000) . Interest in identifying the effects of various early care and education settings on child well-being has intensified amidst mounting evidence that the first five years of life form an important foundation for later development Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) .\nNumerous studies suggest that center-based preschool programs can promote school readiness, especially among low-income children (Gormley, Gayer, Phillips, & Dawson, 2005; Love et al., 2003; Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007; NICHD Early Child-care Research Network, 2005) , prompting many states to expand their efforts to fund such programs (see Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005) . Long-standing concerns exist, however, about the consequences of nonmaternal care-particularly center care-for children's socioemotional development (see Belsky, 2001 ). Several large-scale studies have demonstrated a link between center care experience and behavior problems during middle childhood (Halle et al., 2006; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2004) , and early childhood professionals have reported increased rates of behavior difficulties in structured settings (Gilliam, 2005) . Yet other studies have failed to find an association between center care and problem behavior, particularly within low-income samples (Loeb, Fuller, Kagan, & Carrol, 2004; VotrubaDrzal, Coley, & Chase-Lansdale, 2004 ).\nIsolating whether developmental effects are attributable to child care or other factors is a major challenge in this work. Many of the empirical techniques used in developmental science make it difficult to separate correlation from causation (Blau, 1999; Duncan, Magnuson, & Ludwig, 2004) . In this study, we evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of two methods for estimating the effects of different preschool child care settings on children's subsequent behavior. Specifically, we compare the typical approach of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, controlling for a set of co variates, with instrumental variables (IV) estimation. By exploiting exogenous variation in families' use of different types of care-this case, arrangements induced by experimental treatments-IV controls for biases that arise when child or family characteristics affect both care selection and child functioning. In addition to its methodological contribution, this study informs the literature on the relation of community-based child care to young children's social behavior within low-income populations."}, {"section_title": "The Problem of Endogeneity: Two Analytical Approaches Ordinary Least Squares Regression", "text": "OLS regression is a common analytic tool in social science research and, under classical assumptions, produces the best un biased linear estimates (Berry, 1993) . If these assumptions are violated, however, predictors can be correlated with the error term (or endogenous), resulting in biased parameter estimates. For example, omitting variables related to both the predictor and the outcome from the analytic model induces a spurious correlation between them. This is a significant concern in the child care literature given that the determinants of care and child well-being are not randomly distributed across families (Burchinal & Nelson, 2000; Cleveland, Wiebe, van den Oord, & Rowe, 2000; Lamb, 1998; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early Childcare Research Network & Duncan, 2003) . Such factors as parental education, income, ethnicity, and beliefs are associated with child care quality, quantity, and type, as well as with children's development (Early & Burchinal, 2001; Fuller, Kagan, Caspary, & Gauthier, 2002; Two-stage least squares estimation (2SLS) is the most common form of IV analysis. In the first stage, the endogenous predictor (in this case, type of care) is regressed on the instrument (random assignment status) and a set of covariates to obtain coefficients that reflect the amount of variation in child care attributable to program group membership. The first-stage coefficients are used to generate predicted values (probabilities) for each type of care for each child. Free from selection bias, these values are then used in the second stage equation to obtain a \"clean\" estimate of the relation of child care type to behavior; that is, child behavior is regressed on the predicted values and covariates from the first-stage. The substitution of predicted scores for actual scores in the second stage requires an adjustment to the standard errors; this correction is included in most statistical packages offering 2SLS estimation. 1 There is an important distinction between the effects captured by OLS regression and IV estimation. Whereas OLS estimates rely on all of the natural variation that exists across the entire sample, IV estimates are derived only from the variation attributable to the (exogenous) instrument-in this case, parents who were induced by the experiment to use care arrangements they would not have otherwise used. For example, random assignment to a treatment that includes additional resources for child care may induce parents to use arrangements they would not be able to afford in the absence of the experiment. In economics, this effect is referred to as the local average treatment effect and differs from both intent-to-treat estimates, which measure overall program-control group differences regardless of take-up or participation rates, and treatment-on-the-treated estimates, which capture effects for those who actually receive the treatment (Angrist et al., 1996; Moffitt, 2005) .\nOne of the benefits of instrumental variable techniques is the tendency to generate parameter estimates that are consistent (i.e., convergent to population parameters as sample size grows), an improvement on conventional OLS estimates, which are never consistent in the presence of endogeneity regardless of sample size. At the same time, IV estimates are not impervious to bias, particularly in the context of very small samples (Angrist & Krueger, 2001; Gennetian et al., 2005) . The amount of bias depends largely on how well several key assumptions of IV are met (Angrist et al., 1996; Gennetian, Magnuson, & Morris, 2008) . First, instruments must represent a truly exogenous source of variation and must have a meaningful effect on both the endogenous variable and the outcome of interest. Instrumental variable analyses (with experimental or nonexperimental data) often suffer from low power to detect effects because of a weak relationship between the instrument and endogenous predictor. Weak instruments tend to produce estimates that are unreliable and biased toward the OLS estimate (Bound, Jaeger, & Baker, 1995) .\nA second assumption, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) requires that there be no overall community or displacement effects and that individuals within a particular program group have equal exposure to the treatment. In this study, we assume that individual values of child care and child behavior were unaffected by others' values on these variables, a reasonable assumption given that the number of participants in any one community was relatively small. It is unlikely that crowding out occurred in child care availability or that a single care arrangement or classroom contained multiple sample members. (For other scenarios in which SUTVA would not hold, see discussion in Sobel, 2006) .\nWell-designed and well-implemented social policy experiments satisfy the aforementioned assumptions . Two additional assumptions are more difficult to meet and deserve further discussion. Instrumental variables are assumed to move the endogenous predictor in one direction only (i.e., effects are monotonic). In an experimental context, the expectation is that participants do not behave opposite to their group assignment; for example, we assume that program group parents were not induced by the treatments to use less child care than they would have if they belonged to the control group. Although this 1 We note that the linear two-stage procedure described here can be used regardless of whether the endogenous variable (i.e., the dependent variable in the first stage) is continuous or binary; however, when the outcome of interest (i.e., the dependent variable in the second stage) is nonlinear, a slightly different approach (e.g., generalized method of moments) is needed to obtain instrumental variable estimates (Amemiya, 1990; Foster, 1997; Gennetian et al., 2008) . assumption should be taken seriously, simulations in which participants act counter to their assignment suggest that violations do not substantively alter our findings.\nFinally, and perhaps most important to our analysis, the exclusion restriction requires that an instrumental variable be unrelated to the outcome variable except through its effect on the predictor being instrumented-that is, that it be totally mediated. In our case, instrumenting for type of care alone implies that all of the program effects on child behavior occur through their impacts on type of care. This assumption is untenable given that the experiments were designed primarily to influence parents' economic outcomes and may also have affected maternal well-being and parenting. Our analysis therefore instruments for these variables as well. IV estimation requires at least one instrument for each endogenous regressor; moreover, to produce meaningful results, the instruments should have differential effects on the variables in question (see Gennetian et al., 2008) . To disentangle the developmental effects of child care and income, for example, one ideally would have access to an instrument predicting child care (but not income) and another instrument predicting income (but not child care).\nStudies with multiple-group research designs (i.e., multiple treatments) and those with site differences in impacts can yield multiple instruments . Pooling microdata across random assignment studies testing different policies is another viable option for accessing multiple instruments with the added benefit of increasing sample size. In the current study, we pool across 21 experiments to estimate the effects of center-and home-based child care on children's behavior net of the effects of maternal employment, earnings, income, and depressive symptoms. The mechanics of this technique are delineated below."}, {"section_title": "Relations of Type of Care to Social Behavior", "text": "Rich longitudinal data on children's experiences in care (e.g., the NICHD Study of Early Child Care) have greatly advanced the field by simultaneously examining amount, timing, quality, and stability of care. These dimensions vary greatly within any type of care, but several structural differences between center-and home-based settings may affect social development independently of other aspects of care. As compared with home-based care, centers are more likely to have a predictable daily schedule, a structured curriculum, an environment designed for children, trained caregivers, larger groups of similarly aged children, and higher ratios of children to adults (e.g., Fuller, Kagan, Loeb, & Chang, 2004; Kisker, Hofferth, Phillips, & Farquhar, 1991; Kontos, Hsu, & Dunn, 1994) . Larger group sizes can provide greater opportunity for interaction with same-age peers, a potentially important experience for the development of social competence. At the same time, large groups can also increase the likelihood of interpersonal conflict and reduce the opportunity for interaction with adults (Dowsett, Huston, Imes, & Gennetian, 2008) .\nOverall differences in care quality may also contribute to different effects for center-and home-based arrangements. Although both types of settings exhibit a wide range of quality (e.g., Fuller et al., 2004) , observational studies of settings serving low-income samples indicate higher average quality for centers than for home-based care, particularly with respect to cognitive stimulation (Coley, Chase-Lansdale & Li-Grining, 2001; Dowsett et al., 2008; Fuller et al., 2004; Loeb et al., 2004) . Indeed, numerous studies report better school readiness skills among children of all income levels who attend centers during the preschool years (see Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005) .\nFindings regarding children's social behavior, however, have been mixed. On the one hand, high-quality, center-based preschool programs for low-income children can promote social skills (Barnett, 1995; Schweinhart & Weikart, 1997; Yoshikawa, 1995) . In the national Head Start Impact Study, three-year-olds assigned to Head Start were rated by their mothers as having fewer behavior problems than children in the control group, though no differences were found for four-year-olds (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, 2005) . Two nonexperimental comparisons of different types of community-based child care for low-income children show no relation between center attendance and maternal ratings of problem behavior or social competence, controlling for care quality and family selection factors .\nOn the other hand, analyses of community-based child care for two large samples of children linked center experience and negative social behavior. Children in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care who spent more time in centers during their early years were rated higher on externalizing problems by teachers at age 4 and 1/2 years and throughout elementary school (Belsky et al., 2007; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early Childcare Research Network, 2004) . Subsequent analyses indicated that the number of other children in the setting rather than center care per se predicted externalizing problems; moreover, several approaches to testing the causal effects of child care within this sample have produced mixed results (McCartney et al., 2010) . Nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) also indicated higher levels of teacher-rated externalizing behavior among children who attended center-based programs prior to school entry (Halle et al., 2006; Loeb, Bridges, Bassok, Fuller, & Rumberger, 2007; Magnuson et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "The Present Study", "text": "The present study has a dual purpose. First, we compare two analytic methods-OLS regression and IV estimation-for estimating the relations between child care type and externalizing problems in order to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each. Second, we seek to use these analyses to inform the literature on the developmental effects of different care settings for children in low-income, single-mother families experiencing welfare-to-work policies. Both purposes uniquely contribute to child care research.\nDebate about child care effects on behavior has focused primarily on externalizing problems, in part because demonstrated relations of child care to externalizing behavior are pronounced and also because it is a potential precursor to deviant and aggressive behavior. Yet, evidence that group care settings may contribute to stress and anxiety in young children (Ahnert, Gunnar, Lamb, & Barthel, 2004; Watamura, Dowzella, Alwin, & Gunnar, 2003) suggests that internalizing problems should not be overlooked. In the current study, we conducted all analyses for both externalizing and internalizing behavior but concentrated on the former given space constraints and concerns about precision in the estimates of the latter (full results available on request). Measures of child behavior typically vary across reporters and contexts (e.g., home and school). Although maternal ratings provide valuable information, they are confounded with maternal well-being. Mothers with high levels of depressive symptoms tend to rate children higher on problem behaviors than do other mothers NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 1999; Yeung, Linver & Brooks-Gunn, 2002) . Moreover, mothers' and teachers' reports of child behavior tend to be only modestly correlated (usually in the .20-.30 range), and teacher ratings generally are not associated with maternal depression (Chang, 2003; Eisenberg et al., 2001; Runions & Keating, 2007; West, Denton, & Germino-Hausken, 1999) . In this study, we examined both mother and teacher reports and controlled for maternal depressive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Method Data Sources", "text": "We use data from six random-assignment studies of welfare and employment programs for low-income parents (see Table 1 ). Because some studies included multiple sites and others had multiple treatments, these studies provide information on 21 programs: Connecticut Jobs First, New Hope, two tests of the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) in urban counties, one test of the MFIP in rural counties, three tests of labor force attachment models in National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), one test of Canada's Self-Sufficiency Program (SSP) in British Columbia, two tests of SSP in New Brunswick, and 10 sites in the New Chance study. Although a common set of policies was tested across the 16 sites in New Chance, prior work indicates that program impacts on child care use varied by site (Yoshikawa, Rosman, & Hsueh, 2001 ). To capitalize on this variation in effects, we analyzed the New Chance data at site level, excluding six sites that had fewer than 10 observations in our targeted child age range. In sensitivity analyses, we include New Chance as a single instrument (collapsing across sites) to test the robustness of our results.\nKey policies tested in these experiments included the following: (a) earnings supplements, which provided cash bonuses for a set level of employment or allowed continued welfare receipt as earnings increased; (b) mandatory employment services that required participants to engage in job search activities or move directly into employment; (c) time limits on welfare receipt; and (d) enhanced child care assistance, which offered families additional resources to facilitate the use of licensed care. Although none of the programs constituted direct interventions for children, developmental impacts could occur through changes in family economic circumstances, family functioning, and experiences in various care environments.\nProgram impacts on parents' economic outcomes and child care use for the larger samples in these studies are well documented (D. Bloom & Michalopoulos, 2001; Gennetian, Crosby, Huston, & Lowe, 2004; Schoeni & Blank, 2000) . Earnings supplements increased income and employment, whereas employment mandates in isolation typically increased only the latter because additional earnings were offset by lost welfare benefits. Programs offering enhanced child care assistance increased the use of center-based child care; programs without enhanced child care assistance increased the use of home-based care (Crosby, Gennetian, & Huston, 2005) .\nOur pooled data set has several advantages, including random assignment data, comparable measures across studies, longitudinal follow-ups of children into elementary school, and a large sample (N = 3,290). Ideally, the data for this study would be derived from one large random assignment evaluation across multiple sites and testing numerous treatments. Pooling microdata from several experiments has been described as the next best option Riccio & Bloom, 2002) . We determined this to be a reasonable approach with the current set of studies given their comparability in design, sampling, and measurement. Each study included a survey approximately two to three years after random assignment as well as administrative records on employment, earnings, and welfare receipt throughout the follow-up period Across the experiments, similar measures of baseline socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and subsequent employment, income, earnings, parent psychological well-being, child care, and children's behavior problems were used. Our analyses controlled for a variety of baseline characteristics and study/site indicators to account for any unmeasured time-invariant characteristics of particular programs.\nThe current data set has already generated useful information about the well-being of lowincome children across various sites in the United States and Canada (Clark-Kauffman, Duncan, & Morris, 2003; Gennetian, 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "In each study, one or two \"focal\" children per family were selected to be evaluated in the follow-up interview. Our analysis sample was limited to focal children who were 3 years 0 months to 4 years 11 months old at the beginning of the child care data collection period. We focus on this age group because children of this age are likely to spend more time in care compared with school-age children. We exclude children younger than three years of age because the studies lack adequate data for this age group. Furthermore, issues surrounding care (e.g., availability, quality, parental preferences) and its effects on development are likely to differ for infants and toddlers in comparison with preschoolers.\nDescriptive information for the analysis sample appears in Table 2 . Baseline characteristics of parents and children by study are presented in Appendix A. As expected with random assignment, any differences between program and control groups (8 of the 156 contrasts shown were statistically significant at the p < .05 level) can be attributed to chance. Survey response rates were quite high (from 75% to 85%) given the disadvantaged nature of this sample; attrition analyses appear in the individual reports. Approximately 15% of our preschool-aged sample lacked child care and/or social behavior data, more than a third of which is attributable to a priori design decisions in two of the studies. New Hope participants completed behavior ratings for only one of their (randomly selected) children even though up to two children per household were included in the sample. In SSP, participants were asked about child care for their youngest child only. Rather than impute values for variables with incomplete item-level data, our main analyses were restricted to cases with valid child care and behavior data. All cases in this subsample had complete baseline information (standard forms were administered at study entry, usually in the context of applying for or receiving public assistance); more than 99% had administrative economic data, and 97% had valid data on maternal depressive symptoms. To further consider the potential implications of missing data for our estimates, we examined patterns of missing data; conducted sensitivity analyses excluding studies with higher amounts of missing data (described in more detail below); and, re-ran our OLS analyses using multiple imputation methods. In this final check, we used the Imputation by Chained Equations program in STATA 10.0) to impute values for missing child care, child behavior, maternal depression, and economic outcome data based on an extensive list of baseline covariates including study site. All of the strategies described above indicated no qualitative or significant differences in the estimates."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Family and child baseline covariates-The following demographic and socioeconomic indicators assessed at baseline (i.e., prior to random assignment) were included as covariates in the analyses: child's age and gender, mother's age and ethnicity, number of children in the household, mother's marital history, mother's completion of high school or a graduate equivalency degree, mother's employment and earnings in the prior year, and family welfare receipt of two or more years. We also included a series of dummy variables representing each study site.\nChild care experiences-As part of the follow-up surveys, mothers provided retrospective reports of child care use for the prior 18 months to 2 years. Those who used at least one regular care arrangement (10+ hr per week) at any point during this period were asked additional questions about each arrangement. The child care measure covered all or most of the period between random assignment and the follow-up assessment, with one exception: In New Chance, detailed child care information was collected for the first 18 months of the study (when children were approximately 3 to 5 years old), whereas behavior outcomes were measured during the 42-month interview (when children were approximately 5 to 7 years old).\nWe categorized care arrangements into center-based care (including child care centers, preschool programs, and Head Start), and home-based care (including unregulated care by relatives nonrelatives and family child care homes that may be licensed certified). Our main analyses compared outcomes for children who experienced four mutually exclusive patterns of care: (a) only center-based care, (b) only home-based care, (c) a mix of center and homebased arrangements, or (d) no nonmaternal care over the follow-up period. Exclusive centeror home-based care may proxy for more exposure to that type of care or may indicate more stable patterns of care than mixed arrangements. The frequency of each type of care is shown in Table 2 . Almost 80% of preschoolers this sample were in some form of child care during the assessment period; one third of these children experienced mixed care, 21% were in center-based care exclusively, and 24% were in home based arrangements exclusively.\nFour of the studies (Connecticut Jobs First, MFIP, New Chance, and New Hope) collected information about duration of care arrangements; we used these data to examine the association between amount and type of care. Children who experienced center care exclusively and home care exclusively were in care for approximately 60% of the follow-up period. Children in mixed care were in center and home care (either concurrently or consecutively) for 45% and 52% of the follow-up, respectively. Assessments of care quality and information about licensing were unavailable in these studies. Zero-order relationships between the baseline covariates and types of care are shown in Table 3 . Correlations were very similar for program and control groups (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Parent economic and psychological well-being during the follow-up", "text": "Employment, income, and earnings-Unemployment insurance and public assistance records provided information on mothers' employment and earnings from the time of random assignment through the follow-up period. From these records, we constructed average quarterly employment, average quarterly income, and average quarterly earnings across the quarters for which we had child care data. The income measure was the sum of welfare income (from public assistance records), earnings, and earnings supplements when appropriate. Income from other household members or noncustodial parents (e.g., child support) was not included.\nMaternal depressive symptoms-As part of the follow-up interview, parents completed a version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) . The CES-D assesses the frequency of such symptoms as crying or feeling lonely in the prior week. Two of the studies used a subset of the original 20 items, so standardized z scores (created within study) were used in the analysis.\nChildren's externalizing behavior-Maternal ratings of children's externalizing behavior were collected at follow-up in each study with three comparable scales-items from the Behavior Problem Index (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1981; Peterson & Zill, 1986) in the Connecticut Jobs First, MFIP, New Chance, and NEWWS studies; the Problem Behavior Scale of the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliot, 1990) in New Hope; and a fouritem Externalizing subscale (Morris & Michalopoulos, 2000) in SSP. For the pooled data set, we converted behavior scales to standardized z scores using study-specific control group means and standard deviations. Three studies (Connecticut Jobs First, New Chance, and New Hope) collected teacher ratings of externalizing behavior for children who had entered school by the time of the follow-up assessment (N = 379) with measures that were similar or identical to those completed by parents. Maternal and teacher reports of externalizing behavior were moderately correlated, r(366) =.34, p <. 001. Zero-order correlations of the covariates and predictors with mother-and teacher-reported outcomes are shown in Table 4 ."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Plan", "text": "We performed parallel OLS and IV analyses estimating the effects of different types of preschool child care on mother and teacher reports of children's externalizing problems during the early school years. In all of the analyses, behavior ratings were compared for children who experienced only center care, only home-based care, mixed care, or no regular child care during the study period. The no-care group served as the omitted category because it is considered the norm for the population relevant to these studies (i.e., single mothers receiving public assistance prior to federal welfare reform).\nOrdinary least squares regression models-In the first OLS model, we predicted maternal ratings of externalizing behavior as a function of the types of care children experienced during the follow-up period, controlling for baseline (pretreatment) covariates. A second model included maternal depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings as additional predictors. A similar pair of OLS models was evaluated for teacher ratings of child behavior; however, because teacher data are available in only three studies and for a relatively small number of children, these models contain a reduced list of covariates and include maternal earnings as the only additional predictor. Three covariates (mother's age, mother never married, and employment in year prior to study entry) as well as maternal depressive symptoms were omitted because they contribute little to the prediction of teacher-rated behavior.\nIndicators of experimental treatment status were not included in the OLS models. To detect systematic differences by treatment group status in the relations between care and behavior, we conducted OLS analyses for the program and control groups separately as well as jointly and found no notable differences (results not shown).\nInstrumental variables analysis-We used instrumental variables (with 2SLS) to evaluate a set of models similar to those described above for OLS. Instead of relying on naturally occurring variation in child care, however, the IV models exploited experimentally induced variation to estimate the relationship between type of care setting and children's behavior.\nIn the first-stage equation, each child care category (i.e., exclusive center care, exclusive home-based care, and mixed care) was regressed on a set of baseline covariates and 21 dummy variables representing random assignment status (experimental = 1; control = 0) for each of the programs/sites. Thus, program-control group differences in the occurrence of each type of care within a given study/site were used to generate predicted child care values for children in that study; these values reflect the likelihood of children experiencing each type of care given their family's assignment to the program or control group in a particular study. Differential impacts on child care use across the studies created variability in the predicted levels for individual children. The second-stage IV equation was identical to the OLS regression with the exception that predicted child care values from the first stage were used instead of the observed values. To estimate these models, we use the \"ivreg\" procedure in STATA, which automatically provides the correct second-stage standard errors (assuming that linearity in the dependent variable does not affect our results).\nAs in the OLS analysis, we first tested the effects of child care type and then evaluated a second model that considers the potential role of maternal depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings. To satisfy the exclusion restriction in IV, we instrumented for these additional predictors in the same way we instrumented for child care type (see Gennetian et al., 2008) . We took advantage of 21 unique instruments available in the pooled data set. The IV models with teacher data included a reduced set covariates and instrument for type of care and maternal earnings only. Detailed empirical specifications for the IV models are provided in Appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Individual Study Impacts", "text": "We began by examining individual study impacts on child care, employment, income, earnings, and depressive symptoms (shown as program-control group differences in Table 5 ) and on mother and teacher ratings of children's externalizing behavior (shown Table 6 ). These \"reduced form\" effects underlie our ability estimate the IV models. The important information in these tables is not whether there were impacts in individual studies but whether there was variation in impacts on both child care type and behavior across studiesvariation that allowed us to estimate the effects program-induced variability to variation in children's behavior Indeed, we found that our instruments statistically related to the predictors of interest."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Ordinary Least Squares Regression and Instrumental Variables Estimation Models", "text": "In parallel OLS and IV models estimating the effects of care type on externalizing behavior, we considered children who experienced exclusive center-based care, exclusive home-based care, mixed arrangements, in comparison with those not in regular nonmaternal care. For mother-reported behavior, Model 1 tested the effect of the child care variables, controlling for baseline covariates; Model 2 added mothers' CES-D scores, employment, income, and earnings. For teacher-reported behavior, Model included the baseline covariates and child care variables, and Model 2 added maternal earnings. In the OLS models, maternal depression and economic variables were included as additional predictors; in the IV models, these variables were instrumented by deriving predicted values from the experimental impacts on each.\nMother-rated behavior-Results for mother-reported problems appear in the first four columns of Table 7 ; in each pair coefficients, OLS estimates appear first, followed by the corresponding IV estimates.\nThe OLS estimates indicate a positive association between center care (either exclusively or combined with home-based arrangements) and externalizing behavior and no effects for exclusive home-based care. Coefficients for exclusive center care and mixed care were similar in magnitude, and both changed little when maternal depressive symptoms and economic variables were added to the model. The magnitude of the effects was small: 10% increase in the probability of experiencing either type of care was associated with .01-.02 of a standard deviation more externalizing behavior compared with children who were not in child care.\nA different pattern of relations between care arrangement and externalizing behavior emerged from the IV analyses; these models indicate lower externalizing scores for children who experienced only center care arrangements as preschoolers. This effect was statistically significant in the model that simultaneously instrumented for maternal depressive symptoms and economic outcomes. The larger coefficient in Model 2 suggests that the center care effect cannot be explained by variation in mothers' depressive symptoms, employment, income, and earnings. The coefficient of .015 indicates that a 10% increase in the probability of exclusive center care was associated with a .15 standard deviation decrease in externalizing problems (compared to no care). The IV estimates for exclusive home-based care and mixed care are not significantly different from the reference category of no care; post hoc comparisons of exclusive center care with the other types of care indicate differences that do not reach statistical significance (center only vs. mixed, \u03c7 2 (1) = 2.28, p = .13; center only vs. home only, \u03c7 2 (1) = 1.43, p = .23).\nWe performed several tests to evaluate the validity of the IV estimates. First stage F tests on the instruments (shown in brackets in Table 7 ) indicated sufficient strength for each endogenous predictor, with the exception of maternal depressive symptoms (not surprising given that this outcome was not targeted by the programs and that few impacts occurred). We further evaluated our IV results by employing two commonly used tests. First, when instruments outnumber regressors, an overidentification test (e.g., Sargan statistic) can be used to measure the association between instruments and the error term in the second-stage equation; valid instruments should not have any such association as they are assumed to reflect random variation in the predictor. For all models in the current analysis, Sargan's statistic confirmed the exogenous nature of our instrument set. Second, we also computed the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) chi-square statistic to evaluate whether OLS and IV estimators were equivalent; rejection of the null hypothesis is generally taken as an indication of non-equivalence and endogeneity (though other conditions may lead to rejecting the null as well, including model misspecification; Davidson & MacKinnon, 1993) . Statistically significant DWH tests for exclusive center care, \u03c7 2 (1) = 5.29, p < .05, income, \u03c7 2 (1) = 5.77, p < .05, and earnings, \u03c7 2 (1) = 4.49, p < .05, suggested bias in the OLS estimates for these variables.\nTeacher-rated behavior-According to the OLS estimates shown in Columns 5 and 7 of Table 7 , children who experienced mixed care as preschoolers had more teacher-rated externalizing problems in elementary school than those without preschool child care experience. A 10% increase in the probability of using mixed care was associated with a .02 standard deviation increase in externalizing behavior.\nBy contrast, the IV analyses indicated effects (of marginal statistical significance, p < .10) in the opposite direction, specifically, children who experienced either exclusive center care or mixed care received lower externalizing scores from teachers. The IV coefficient for exclusive center care indicates that a 10% increase in the probability of this care was associated with a .25 standard deviation reduction in teacher-reported externalizing problems. This effect was larger than that for parent-reported problems but was also less precise (indicated by the larger standard error), partly because few studies collected teacher data. As in the parent models, post hoc tests revealed no statistically significant differences between the three types of care. At the same time, the DWH test of consistency between OLS and IV estimates indicates that some endogeneity existed, \u03c7 2 (1) = 9.80, p < .05; the only individual variable for which this test approached significance was exclusive center care, \u03c7 2 (1) = 2.21, p = .14.\nThe finding that both exclusive center care and mixed care reduce behavior problems at school tentatively suggests a benefit from having at least some exposure to center care during the preschool years. A follow-up IV analysis indicates that experiencing any center care was associated with significantly lower teacher ratings of externalizing behavior (\u03b2 = \u2212. 015, SE = .008, p < .05). A similar analysis of home-based care revealed no significant effects on teacher-rated behavior."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analyses", "text": "We conducted follow-up analyses with alternative model specifications to ensure that results were not disproportionately influenced by one or two studies. In one analysis, we excluded the New Chance study because its program and sample differed somewhat from those of other studies. In a second test, we collapsed across the New Chance sites, treating them as a single experiment (and using treatment status as one instrument), given concerns about small samples in the individual sites. In a third analysis, we excluded the Canadian SSP sites, because differences in local and national contexts could affect our estimates. The OLS and IV coefficients for child care type remained qualitatively similar across all of these analyses (results available upon request)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study joins several recent articles that highlight the usefulness of comparing results across methods within a single data set (e.g., Magnuson et al., 2007; McCartney et al., 2010 ; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early Child-care Research Network & Duncan, 2003) . Our approach differs from earlier work by examining experimentally induced differences in the types of childcare arrangements used by lowincome mothers affected by policies designed to increase their employment. We contrast OLS and IV estimates of the relations between type of child care and children's externalizing behavior with pooled data from 21 random-assignment policy experiments that increased maternal employment, changed family economic resources, and increased children's exposure to a variety of nonmaternal care settings."}, {"section_title": "Cross-Method Comparison of Findings", "text": "Consistent with prior research linking center care experience to behavior problems (e.g., Halle et al., 2006; Magnuson et al., 2007; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 2004) , our OLS results indicate higher maternal ratings of externalizing problems for school-age children who had attended centers as preschoolers (either exclusively or combined with home-based care) than for children who had not had regular care arrangements. Teachers also reported more problems for children with prior center experience (at a marginal level of significance), particularly for those who had been in mixed care. The OLS results are robust to controls for baseline covariates, maternal depression, employment, income, and earnings.\nBy contrast, IV techniques indicate that children who had been in only center arrangements during their preschool years had fewer subsequent externalizing problems, according to both mothers and teachers. Teachers also reported fewer problems for children who had experienced mixed care arrangements. That is, according to teachers, children who had experienced any center care as pre-schoolers exhibited fewer problems in their early school years than did their peers with no such experience. Having at least some exposure to organized group care prior to school entry may help children acquire appropriate classroom behaviors. These results should be considered suggestive rather than conclusive. Although the IV coefficients for center care were consistently larger than those for home-based and mixed care, estimates for the three types of care were not statistically different from one another."}, {"section_title": "Reconciling Discrepant Results Across Methods", "text": "Interestingly, our OLS results mirror those obtained in correlational studies, whereas our IV results are similar to findings from random-assignment studies of early childhood interventions. This pattern suggests that an instrumental variables approach may address biases not easily controlled for in correlational designs. A number of attempts to reproduce experimental impact estimates with nonexperimental regression methods demonstrate the difficulty of doing so, suggesting that the threat posed by selection bias is nontrivial (see H. S. Bloom, Michalopoulos, Hill, & Lei, 2002; Ludwig et al., 2001; Wilde & Hollister, 2002; ) . Two methods that yield estimates similar to those from experiments are regression discontinuity and careful matching of groups on pretest measures (Cook, Shadish, & Wong, 2008) , but neither of these methods is common in child care research (see Gormley et al., 2005 , for an exception).\nChild care history prior to study entry is one unmeasured factor that might help to explain the discrepant findings. The present data captured care experiences across the preschool period (i.e., ages to 5 years) and social behavior ratings when children were 5 to years old. Random assignment presumably equates program and control groups on amount and type of child care experienced prior to three years of age, but different histories could affect the OLS comparisons, which capture the cumulative effects of child care Extensive hours of care (especially in centers) for infants and toddlers have been shown to predict relatively high levels externalizing behavior in preschool and elementary school (Belsky et al., 2007; Waldfogel, 2006) . During the early 1990s when these data were collected, low-income mothers of infants and toddlers were much less likely to be in the labor force (and to be using child care) than presently.\nWe used multiple treatment effects as instruments to separate the effects of child care type from those of employment, income, earnings, and maternal depressive symptoms. The child care coefficients change little when additional variables are added to the model, but is possible that treatments that increased center care also changed some unmeasured feature of children's lives (e.g., parents' employment schedule or stability) in ways that influenced behavior.\nIn reconciling the IV and OLS results, we questioned whether center care induced by the experiments was somehow different than center care received by children in the control group (and by extension, center care accessible to the general population). Several programs that increased the use of centers offered more generous, seamless, or comprehensive child care assistance than the assistance available in the control condition (Crosby et al. 2005) , which may have allowed families to access higher quality care or maintain more stable care than they would have otherwise We doubt, however, that OLS-IV discrepancies reflect systematic differences in quality or stability within type because (a) OLS estimates of the relations between type of care and behavior do not differ by treatment group status (i.e., center care is associated with more problems in both groups), and (b) there are no experimental impacts on crude measures of structural characteristics of care (e.g., child-toadult ratios) in the subset of studies that collected this information (Crosby et al., 2005) . Notably, our OLS and IV results are not discrepant for all predictors (i.e., maternal depression and economic variables). Moreover, parallel analyses examining the effects of child-care type on school achievement, we find consistent results across the two methodsboth the OLS and IV estimates indicate academic benefits for children attending centers in the year or two prior to school entry (Gennetian et al., 2006) . These findings provide some assurance that the OLS-IV differences reported here are not an artifact of method. Finally, the robustness of our IV coefficients to changes in the sample and instrument set boosts our confidence in the results."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Strengths", "text": "This study relies on a global measure of children's care experiences (i.e., types of arrangements during a 2-year period); thus, we cannot determine the extent to which measured effects reflect care quality, stability, or intensity, nor do we know whether children in different settings experienced different amounts of care in their lifetimes. Second, small samples of preschoolers in some of the programs and sites prevented us from examining whether the observed relationships varied for particular subgroups of children (e.g., by child gender or ethnicity). Third, this set of studies does not contain large enough samples of children younger than the age of 3 years to estimate the effects of care type on infants and toddlers, a group for which there are particular concerns about the effects of organized care (Belsky et al., 2007) . Finally, our method of complete-case analysis could lead us to underestimate or over. estimate the true effects of care on behavior if study attrition led to a restricted range of behavior problem reports. However, our confidence in the estimates is strengthened given that we also conducted missing-at-random-based analyses of multiply imputed data; in that case, any selective nonresponse would have to be over and above patterns of missingness related to the covariates. Further research is necessary both to replicate the current set of results and to identify particular circumstances in which center care can promote or impede socioemotional adjustment (e.g., see McCartney et al., 2010) .\nAlthough this broad look at child care type stands in contrast to the rich information about child care in other studies, our data set has several strengths not available in most other studies, including longitudinal, random-assignment designs with multiple sources of information on large samples of low-income children who experienced substantial shifts in child care as a result of mothers' interactions with welfare and employment programs. Moreover, the effects captured by the IV analysis-the impact of child care for families whose arrangements would change as a result of the interventions tested in these studiesare particularly relevant for policy. Given these advantages, the information produced here is, intended to complement that from more intensive naturalistic studies in the pursuit of understanding how child care experiences relate to children's development."}, {"section_title": "Benefits and Challenges of Using Instrumental Variables in Developmental Research", "text": "Both OLS and IV represent useful approaches for understanding developmental issues; under the right conditions, however, the latter may offer some advantage in estimating causal relations. By relying on exogenous variation (vs. naturally occurring variation), IV techniques can purge some of the problematic components from the predictor variable, producing less-biased estimates and strengthening causal claims. The fact that IV relies on only a portion of the total variance, however, often leads to less precise (as indicated by large standard errors) and more conservative estimates than those obtained using OLS.\nIdentifying appropriate instruments (i.e., those that satisfy the assumptions of IV and have sufficient predictive power) can be challenging. Social policy experiments are ideal for this purpose in many respects but generally only useful if multiple treatments within or across studies are available to permit estimation of different predictors ). In the current study, we have access to several instruments based on between-site differences in program impacts on employment, income, maternal depression, and child care that resulted both from different programs and from differences in program implementation across sites. For example, the type of child care support provided to New Chance participants varied by site, leading, in essence, to different treatments; some sites provided on-site child care, whereas others helped families access providers in the community (for details, Yoshikawa et al., 2001 ).\nMany topics of interest to developmental scientists may not amenable to random-assignment designs, particularly given large number of cases needed to perform IV. In the absence experimental data, state or local variations in child care regulation and policy may provide viable instruments; however, states often differ in multiple ways that are important for children's development, making the exclusion restriction more difficult to satisfy Large national data sets (e.g., ECLS-B) lend themselves to approach, allowing investigators to use sources of exogenous variation in child care experiences to gain a better understanding the effects on children (for an example of this approach, Magnuson et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Associations between center care and behavior problems have appeared in research findings for more than 25 years (see Belsky, 2001 ), but they occur less consistently for low-income samples Votruba-Drzal et al., 2004) . The overhaul of U.S. welfare system in the 1990s raised many questions about how children would fare in the face of policies designed to reduce welfare reliance and increase employment among low-income mothers. Our findings address some of these questions using techniques to isolate the effects of policy-induced changes preschool child care on children's behavior during the early school years. We find tentative evidence that community-based center care used under these circumstances may reduce, rather than increase, externalizing problems. These modest effects occur the range of programs (of unknown quality) that were available and selected by parents; larger benefits might be expected from policies designed specifically to provide children with high-quality care (see Rigby, Ryan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2007) .\nGiven the growth of various forms of preschool experience the U.S.-and their apparent advantages for academic skills, particularly for low-income children-it is critical to identify ways which these settings can also foster social skills and self-control Developmental scientists have an expanding set of theoretical methodological tools to examine such topics. We hope to see added to this toolbox; particularly when combined with random assignment designs, this technique has the potential to greatly improve researchers' ability to infer causality.
