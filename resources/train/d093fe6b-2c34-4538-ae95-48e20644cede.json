Shifting social identities may be an under-appreciated explanation of this gap: identification with environmentalists in the U.S. dropped from 78% to 42% since 1991. In four pre-registered studies of U.S. residents (total N = 2,033), we explored the predictors and outcomes of environmentalist identity. We also developed a novel implicit measure of less deliberate aspects of environmentalist identity. We used explicit and implicit environmentalist identity to predict self-reported environmental behaviors and policy preferences.

Campaigns to address the psychological foundations of environmental problems by scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers generally focus on raising awareness and changing beliefs about the environment. For example, the United States National Science Foundation budgeted $20m in 2010-11 alone for education programs about climate change (NSF, 2010). However, support for environmental action is only weakly predicted by beliefs about the environment across 47 countries (Eom, Kim, Sherman, & Ishii, 2016). Another approach to conservation has been studying the individual differences that predict pro-environmental behavior such as biospheric values (Steg, Bolderdijk, Keizer, & Perlaviciute, 2014) and personality traits, especially Openness to new experiences (Brick & Lewis, 2016). However, few interventions targeting values or personality traits have emerged, in part because it is difficult to permanently modify these factors (Manfredo et al., 2017). A promising basis for conservation might be found in how people identify with groups that are associated with environmental beliefs or behaviors. Evidence is mounting that social identities are tightly linked to pro-environmental actions (Fielding & Hornsey, 2016;Fritsche, Barth, Jugert, Masson, & Reese, 2017): whether people feel part of certain groups predicts whether they conserve water or vote for pro-environmental regulations. 1.1 Environmentalism. Multiple groups are associated with environmentally relevant behaviors. Party identity and political orientation are linked to pro-environmental behavior and policy support (Gromet, Kunreuther, & Larrick, 2013), perhaps due to increasing political polarization in the United States. Other groups linked with pro-environmental behavior include the Green Party, vegetarians, and White people (Pearson & Schuldt, 2014). Groups associated with anti-environmental behavior include coal miners or free-market capitalists. However, the social group that is most conceptually consistent with pro-environmental behavior is environmentalists, whose defining feature is a shared desire for healthy ecosystems. Environmentalist identity has changed dramatically in the last three decades (Gallup, 2016). In 1991, a strong majority of United States residents (78%) identified as environmentalists. By 2016, it fell to 42%. This decline accompanied the emergence of a partisan divide in environmentalist identity. Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to consider themselves as environmentalists in 1991, but by 2016 Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to consider themselves environmentalists: 56% vs. 27% (Gallup, 2016). One possible account for these declines is a change in what 'environmentalist' means (Pearson & Schuldt, 2018). For example, public information campaigns and the deliberate politicization of environmental topics for political and financial gain may have bound environmentalist identity with left-wing politics (Dunlap & McCright, 2010). Recent studies suggest environmentalists in the United States are now seen as radical political activists (e.g., \"militant\", \"unclean\"; (Bashir, Lockwood, Chasteen, Nadolny, & Noyes, 2013) and a threat to society (Hoffarth & Hodson, 2016). To the extent that identification with environmentalists now signals negative qualities such as radicalism, individuals may be more likely to distance themselves from environmentalists. The decline of environmentalist identity may pose a problem for the conservation movement. Individuals who think positively of environmentalists (Ratliff, Howell, & Redford, 2017) or who think of themselves as \"environmentally-friendly consumers\" (Kashima, Paladino, & Margetts, 2014;Whitmarsh & O'Neill, 2010) report engaging in more pro-environmental behavior. Previous research on conservation and identity mostly examined identification with the environment as opposed to with a social group (Clayton, 2012). These 'environmental identity' measures overlap heavily with each other and with environmental concern and values (van der Werff, Steg, & Keizer, 2013). Different components of identifying with the environment appear to predict lower vs. higher cost pro-environmental behaviors (Kashima et al., 2014). One scale of environmental self-identity (van der Werff,  taps social group membership but may potentially be confounded with past behavior. Attitudes and behaviors are different from how much an individual feels that they are part of the social group environmentalists, and it is unknown whether group membership alone predicts pro-environmental concern and behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that environmentalist identity is a stronger predictor of self-reported pro-environmental behaviors in the United States than even political orientation (Brick et al., 2017). The current studies replicate and extend that finding with larger pre-registered studies that include multiple operationalizations of identity, behavior, and political preferences."}, {"section_title": "How social identity drives pro-environmental behavior. Social identities drive", "text": "behavior across diverse contexts (Brewer, 2003, pp. 480-491;Dunning, 1999;Ellemers, Spears, & Doosje, 2002), including pro-environmental action (Fielding & Hornsey, 2016). Identifying with a group could lead to pro-environmental behavior through at least four routes: 1. Social identities provide guidance on how to act when individuals lack information or are ambivalent (informational social influence; (Brewer, 2003). 2. Social identities motivate behavior through the desire to act consistently with group goals (Cialdini, 2003;Oyserman, Fryberg, & Yoder, 2007). Therefore, motivations based on group membership can be externally driven: behaviors are changed to meet the expectations of others. Acting in line with group goals may provide social benefits such as inclusion, whereas failing to do so may incur social costs such as criticism. Group-based motivations can also be internally driven, for example to align behavior with personal values and beliefs. 3. Environmental issues such as conservation are commons dilemmas (Van Lange, Joireman, Parks, & Van Dijk, 2013), and interventions that lead to cooperation over limited resources are therefore well-suited to environmental issues. Notably, social identity interventions lead to greater cooperation over limited resources (van Vugt, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Identities can promote consistency and interdependence between pro-environmental", "text": "behaviors in an effect called behavioral spillover (Kashima et al., 2014;Th\u00f8gersen, 1999;Truelove, Carrico, Weber, Raimi, & Vandenbergh, 2014;Walker & Thomas, 2014). For example, an environmentalist who agrees to install solar panels might later feel more motivated to compost. Behavioral spillover is especially important for conservation because most individuals are ignorant about which behaviors are most important, for example on climate change (Gardner & Stern, 2008) or water use (Attari, 2014), and because changes in multiple behaviors would be necessary for sufficient conservation to address massive problems like climate change. These four routes for identity-based behavior change led to a burst of research linking social identities with pro-environmental outcomes (e.g., Brick et al., 2017;Fielding & Hornsey, 2016;Kashima et al., 2014;Whitmarsh & O'Neill, 2010). Given the apparent importance of social identities, further attention to measurement validity would be valuable. In environmental psychology, identity has usually been measured with self-report, which is convenient and appears to show reliable effects but introduces specific limitations. Previous research has not investigated whether individuals are sometimes unable or unwilling to report their identification with social groups. Multiple types of identity measures might better reveal the link between identity and pro-environmental outcomes and potentially reveal blind spots from different methods."}, {"section_title": "Explicit and implicit measures of environmentalist identity. Explicit self-reported", "text": "measures of identity capture peoples' conscious theories of what groups they belong to. These personal theories may be at odds with their identity as revealed by other means. As identification with environmentalists is now a strong signal of political affiliations (e.g., being a Democrat or Republican in the United States), people may be unwilling or unable to report the full extent of their identification with environmentalists (Milfont, 2008). For example, at a college that is politically progressive or left-wing students may claim to be environmentalists to signal that they are liberal even when it contradicts their private commitments (i.e., externally motivated environmentalists). Similarly, people in a town with a large oil industry may publicly disavow environmentalists even when this contradicts their private identities (i.e., hidden environmentalists, cf. Gal, 2015). We used measures of implicit identity to tap into mental associations that lay outside of conscious awareness or control. The implicit measure in the current studies is the Single-Target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT), which measures the speed at which people sort words into categories to assess the degree to which concepts are associated together in memory (Bluemke & Friese, 2008). Implicit measures are weakly correlated with explicit measures across domains (Cameron, Brown-Iannuzzi, & Payne, 2012;Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, & Banaji, 2009;Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le, & Schmitt, 2005). However, the strength of the correlation varies widely based on factors such as whether the target construct is socially sensitive or well-elaborated (Nosek, 2005). Implicit measures have been fruitful for predicting a wide range of behaviors (Cameron et al., 2012;Greenwald et al., 2009). For example, implicit identification with math predicts whether people choose to major in math-intensive majors (Nosek, Banaji, & Greenwald, 2002), implicit shyness predicts spontaneous shy behavior (Asendorpf, Banse, & M\u00fccke, 2002), and implicit Democrat/Republican identity predicts support for partisan welfare policies among self-described political independents (Hawkins & Nosek, 2012). Implicit measures of liking and disliking have also been used to understand environmental topics such as implicit attitudes toward nature (Schultz, Shriver, Tabanico, & Khazian, 2004), implicit biospheric values (Walker & Thomas, 2014), and implicit attitudes toward environmentally friendly grocery products (De Houwer & De Bruycker, 2007;Panzone, Hilton, Sale, & Cohen, 2016). 1.3.1 Note about measurement fidelity. As with almost any psychological measure, explicit and implicit measures of identity are susceptible to methodological influences outside of the constructs of interest. For example, explicit self-reports are susceptible to issues such as social desirability, recall bias, question framing, and acquiescence (for a review, see Krosnick & Presser, 2009), whereas implicit measures are susceptible to issues such as stimulus selection, cognitive control, and task-switching ability (Calanchini, Sherman, Klauer, & Lai, 2014;Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998;Mierke & Klauer, 2003). The inclusion of both explicit and implicit measures mitigates the disadvantages of each."}, {"section_title": "Study overview.", "text": "Four pre-registered online studies investigated explicit and implicit environmentalist identity and their relation to self-reported pro-environmental behavior and policy preferences.

Explicit environmentalist identity.", "text": "To measure whether individuals saw themselves as environmentalists, we used a four-item identity scale across all studies: \"I see myself as an environmentalist\"; \"I am pleased to be an environmentalist\"; \"I feel strong ties with environmentalists\"; and \"I identify with other environmentalists\" (Brick et al., 2017;Smith, Seger, & Mackie, 2007), rated from 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). The four items were combined into a composite, and Cronbach's alphas were .91-.93 for all studies. Two other single-item explicit identity measures, inclusion of environmentalists in self and inclusion of nature in self, were assessed in Study 2 (Schultz, 2002). In our main analyses, we present the four-item measure because it was more reliable, explained more variance in preferences and behaviors, and was measured in all four studies. 1 Implicit environmentalist identity. For a measure of identity that bypasses self-report, we used the Single-Target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT; (Bluemke & Friese, 2008), which measures associations between a single concept and its attributes (e.g., identification with environmentalists). In the current studies, the ST-IAT measured associations between the concepts 'Environmentalist' with 'Self' and 'Other'. This ST-IAT consisted of five blocks (20 trials in the first block, 48 trials in other blocks). Participants in the first block sorted words belonging to one of two categories ('Self' and 'Other') by pressing either \"E\" (for 'Other') or \"I\" for (for 'Self'). In the second and third blocks, participants sorted words belonging to one of three categories ('Self', 'Other', and 'Environmentalist') by pressing either \"E\" (for Other) or \"I\" for (for 'Self' or 'Environmentalist'). In the fourth and fifth blocks, participants did the same except 'Environmentalist' words were also categorized with the 'Other' words instead of the 'Self' words. The stimuli presented in the first block were divided equally between the two categories, whereas the other blocks contained 14 trials each for the paired stimuli and 20 trials for the stimuli that were not paired with another category. 2 The ST-IAT was scored using the D2 algorithm (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003), which indexed how quickly participants categorized words when 'Environmentalist' was paired with 'Self' compared to when 'Environmentalist' was paired with 'Other'. The pre-registered analytic plan stated that participants would be excluded from all analyses for careless responding if more than 10% of the trials on the ST-IAT were faster than 400 ms. This criterion excluded 15 (2.5%) participants in Study 1, 39 (7.7%) participants in Study 2, 71 (12.5%) participants in Study 3a, and 29 (4.9%) participants in Study 3b. The stimuli for 'Self' were: Mine, Myself, I, My, Self. The stimuli for 'Other' were They, Their, Them, Theirs, Other. To select the stimuli for the 'Environmentalist' category, we conducted a pilot study of 130 Amazon MTurk participants who generate synonyms for the word 'Environmentalist' and also rated the overlap between Environmentalists and words chosen by the researchers in advance. The final stimuli were selected because of high agreement between raters for representing Environmentalists while not strongly implying other demographics such as gender: Environmentalist, Conservationist, Preservationist, Tree-Hugger. These terms were also chosen because they balance positively and negatively valenced words. We tested slight variations on the procedure in each study. In Study 1, the ST-IAT alternated between congruent and incongruent blocks instead of going in sequential order (i.e., 2 To test for order effects, in Studies 1 & 2 participants were randomly assigned to the ST-IAT as above or in a flipped order where Other/Environmentalist vs. Self were Blocks 2 & 3 and Other vs. Self/Environmentalist were Blocks 4 & 5 (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Self-Environmentalist block first yielded higher implicit identity, F(1,945)=76.5, p<.0001. However, entering order with explicit and implicit identity into two regressions predicting behavior and then policy preferences, with or without the 2-and 3-way interactions, yielded no main nor interaction effects of order, all ps \u2265 .29. Order does not account for the main findings. congruent blocks first, then incongruent blocks second or vice versa). In Study 2, the critical blocks were in sequential order but were doubled in length to 96 trials. Finally, Studies 3a and 3b used the standard ST-IAT described above.

These items were combined into a composite, r(538) = .42, p < .0001 (see Supplement for analyses with these items as separate predictors that show the same result). In Studies 3a and 3b, we also measured opinions about a novel environmental issue to avoid explicit memories of personal commitments, e.g., stances on familiar issues like climate change. A mock article was created to appear to be from the Los Angeles Times newspaper titled \"Controversy over commercial development in East Rock\". The 260-word article described a legal challenge to a commercial development in the desert based on an inadequate environmental review (see Supplement for image and text). Participants responded to two items from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely): \"How much do you support stopping construction for the next three weeks for the independent environmental review?\" and \"How much do you support allowing construction on the East Rock business development to continue without further review?\" [reverse-scored]. These two items were highly associated, r(760) = .57, p < .0001. To achieve the greatest construct coverage, these novel policy questions were combined with the three trade-off questions into a composite score, Cronbach's alphas 3a = .83, 3b = .88 (see Supplement for exploratory analyses that separate out the novel policy items and find parallel results)."}, {"section_title": "Additional measures.", "text": "We also investigated additional measures as predictors of environmentalist identity. We measured childhood experiences, environmental attitudes, key demographics, motivations to act pro-environmentally, feeling awe, and perceptions of environmentalists' social status (see below).

Because this scale is not strictly ordinal, scores were made into a composite of less than bachelor's (1-6), bachelor's (7), or more than bachelor's (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14), and this composite was used for correlations.

First, pro-environmental behavior was predicted from implicit and explicit identity. Then, policy preferences were predicted from implicit and explicit identity. The partial correlations were Fisher's z-transformed for analyses and converted back to Pearson's r for interpretation. Partial correlations drop any variance that is shared between predictors of the outcome, and remaining effects can be interpreted as unique contributions of that predictor similar to a regression coefficient. We also examined the correlations between implicit and explicit identity, metaanalytic r = .24, p < .00001 (see Figure 1 and Tables 3 & 4).  Note. Implicit = implicit environmentalist identity, Explicit = explicit environmentalist identity, and partial rs include the other identity measure, except for the Pearson's correlation between the two. Explicit environmentalist identity was highly predictive of self-reported proenvironmental behavior and policy preferences, partial rs = .58, .62, ps < .00001, suggesting that social identity may be important for pro-environmental action. In contrast, implicit environmentalist identity did not uniquely predict pro-environmental behavior nor policy preferences, partial rs = .05, .05, ps = .13, .14. To investigate whether the predictions were improved by accounting for externally motivated environmentalists (high explicit/low implicit) or hidden environmentalists (low explicit/high implicit), we also conducted an analysis examining whether implicit and explicit identity interacted to predict behavior and policy preferences. Behavior and policy preferences were separately regressed onto standardized implicit and explicit identity and their interaction term, again using the R package metafor to combine the four studies meta-analytically. There was no evidence for an interaction between implicit and explicit identity, partial rs for the interaction predicting behavior, r = .07, p = .33; predicting policy, r = .06, p = .57.

Four of the effect sizes showed greater variation across the studies than might be expected by chance: explicit on behavior, Q = 22.28, p < .0001, explicit on policy, Q = 10.62, p = .01, interaction on behavior, Q = 30.85, p < .0001, and interaction on policy, Q = 79.81, p < .0001.

Due to measurement", "text": "unreliability, partial correlations are vulnerable to high false-positive rates when used to establish incremental validity (Westfall & Yarkoni, 2016). To address this issue, we also conducted the incremental validity analyses as structural equation models (SEM) that take into account measurement variance using the R package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). Individual-level data were aggregated across all four studies for these analyses. The indicators for the explicit identity latent variable were the four explicit identity items used in all analyses and the indicators for the implicit identity latent variable were D scores calculated separately for the first ST-IAT critical blocks and the second ST-IAT critical blocks. Using this approach, we removed error variance by accounting for the covariances between the indicator variables. The model predicting behavior was a good fit (Schreiber, Nora, Stage, Barlow, & King, 2006) on 1 of 3 fit indexes, SRMR = .027, and a poor fit on the other two indices, CFI = .938, RMSEA = .143. This model found slightly weakened behavior prediction for explicit identity, \u03b2 = .49, p < .001, and slightly improved behavior prediction for the ST-IAT, \u03b2 = .10, p = .005.

We also conducted similar SEM models where ST-IAT had three indicators (dividing the trials by thirds instead of halves). The measurement model with three indicators is just-identified, and therefore model misfit can only result from the structural relations between constructs. The pattern of results did not change. Note that the main meta-analysis results use partial correlations, which are similar but not interchangeable with the above \u03b2s. Overall, this SEM-based approach strengthens the interpretation suggested by the partial correlation approach: explicit (but not implicit) identity is a strong predictor of pro-environmental behavior and policy preferences."}, {"section_title": "Predictors of environmentalist identity (Study 2).", "text": "Revealing what causes environmental identity might illuminate pathways responsible for its decline and could also inform interventions to increase helpful behaviors. We hypothesized in pre-registration that implicit identity would be positively related to these childhood experiences: frequency of childhood visits to museums, attendance of summer camp, lived with a pet, and took care of a pet. However, these experiences were unrelated to implicit identity, all zero-order |rs| \u2264 .09, ps > .08. Implicit identity was then regressed onto these four variables simultaneously. None predicted implicit identity, all ps \u2265 .12, all eta-squared \u2264 .01, suggesting that implicit identity is not related to the self-reported frequency of these childhood experiences. Exploratory analyses revealed that implicit identity was unrelated to currently living in a rural area, r(1135) = -.06, p = .06. Implicit identity was also hypothesized in pre-registration to be positively related to internal motivation to be pro-environmental, dispositional awe, and social status of environmentalists (Studies 3a & 3b; see Table 4). Implicit environmentalism was related to internal motivation, r(797) = .21, p < .001, and social status of environmentalists, r(755) = .09, p = .019. Regressions were run in Studies 3a & 3b predicting implicit identity from these three predictors. All betas are standardized. Higher internal motivation was positively related to higher implicit identity in both samples, Study 3a \u03b2 = .06, t(293) = 3.67, p < .001, Study 3b \u03b2 = .04, t(454) = 2.79, p = .006. No other effects were significant, ps \u2265 .25. Overall, there was partial support for these factors predicting implicit identity. In contrast, explicit identity was associated with nearly every factor, including these novel zero-order correlations: living in a rural area, r(1135) = -.15, p < .0001, childhood summer camp attendance, r(373) = .15, p = .003, childhood living with a pet, r(367) = .19, p = .0003, and education, r(1710) = .19, p < .0001 (see Table 4). To explore the more novel predictors, exploratory analyses were run predicting explicit identity from internal motivation to be proenvironmental, dispositional awe, and social status of environmentalists. Across Studies 3a & 3b, all three factors uniquely predicted explicit identity, ps \u2264 .003, and the strongest was internal motivation, \u03b2 = .94, t(751) = 25.1, p < .0001. Our pre-registered analytic plans specified that further tests between the factors in Table   4 would be exploratory. Overall, the pattern of zero-order correlations suggests many factors might contribute to explicit identity, particularly environmental concern, r(542) = .58, p < .0001, and internal motivation to appear pro-environmental r(794) = .71, p < .0001 (see Table 4). It could be valuable to study these associations longitudinally and/or experimentally to discover their potential consequences."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Four high-powered pre-registered studies examined the relationships between environmentalist identity and pro-environmental behavior, policy opinions, childhood experiences, and dispositions. Meta-analysis revealed that explicit identity is a strong and reliable predictor of pro-environmental behavior and policy preferences, consistent with recent work highlighting environmentalist identity (Brick et al., 2017;Fielding & Hornsey, 2016). Social identity appears a valuable tool to understand and influence pro-environmental actions including voting. Identifying with environmentalists may lead to associating pro-environmental behaviors with self-worth (Baumeister & Leary, 1995), which could in turn cause both public and private conservation actions. We also show for the first time that implicit environmentalist identity is a reliable construct that is moderately and positively related to explicit identity. Although implicit identity is positively associated with pro-environmental behavior and policy preferences, it does not uniquely predict those outcomes when controlling for explicit identity. Also, we did not find evidence that accounting for interactions between implicit and explicit identity improved the prediction of behavior and policy preferences (e.g., externally motivated environmentalists that have higher explicit identity but lower implicit identity or hidden environmentalists that have lower explicit identity and higher implicit identity). These findings suggest that self-reports of environmentalist identity are sufficient for predicting environmental behavior and policy preferences. A recent theory of implicit associations, the Bias of Crowds model (Payne, Vuletich, & Lundberg, 2017), suggests that implicit associations are better understood as properties of groups rather than of individuals. Weak individual-level correlations in these studies are consistent with this perspective. Because implicit associations reflect group-level processes in the Bias of Crowds model, stronger correlations should be expected when group levels of implicit environmentalist identity are correlated with group-level behavior. Future research could examine whether region-level implicit environmentalist identity predicts aggregated outcomes such as regional pro-environmental laws or county-level recycling."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future research.", "text": "We relied on self-reports of behavior, which boosts construct comprehensiveness (by including a wide range of pro-environmental behaviors) and ease of data collection. However, self-reports of behavior are not the same as actual behavior. A recent meta-analysis finds that the relationship between self-reported and objective pro-environmental behavior is only moderate at r = .46 (Kormos & Gifford, 2014), suggesting that there are differences in the processes underlying objective and self-reported behavior. From the perspective of dual-process models such as the MODE model (Motivation and Opportunity as DEterminants of the Attitude-Behavior Relation (Fazio & Towles-Schwen, 1999;Olson & Fazio, 2008), people have the motivation and opportunity to deliberate and override automatic mental processes when reporting their past behavior. In the current studies, self-reports of behavior could be driven by deliberative processes that artificially reduce their relationship with implicit identity and artificially inflate their relationship with explicit identity. In other words, the relationship between explicit identity and behavior may be inflated due to shared measurement variance. Because the SEM analyses did not assess behavior at the item-level, there is unfortunately no elegant way to remove this shared measurement variance. Future studies might use other behavior measures as suggested below. The MODE model also predicts that implicit associations will influence behavior more when people lack the motivation or opportunity to override automatic mental processes. Future research examining situations where people do not have the motivation or opportunity to override automatic processes may therefore find stronger relationships between implicit identity and pro-environmental behavior. We suggest researchers consider impulsive or spontaneous proenvironmental behavior (e.g., recycling out of habit) or behavior where self-presentation motives are weak or absent (e.g., private home energy use). A further limitation in this paper stems from the observed heterogeneity between studies, which are evident in the variability of the relationship between explicit identity and behavior and the poor model fit of the SEM analyses. This heterogeneity represents uncertainty around the effect size estimates and therefore the specific estimates should be interpreted cautiously. Poor model fit might be expected based on the studies not being direct replications but rather conceptual replications using different scales and populations. Future studies using different methods or measures might find different effect sizes. This paper also investigated novel associations with environmentalist identity. Internal motivation to appear pro-environmental was strongly and positively associated with explicit identity, behavior, and policy preferences, while external motivations were not. Environmentalist identity in the U.S. might be driven more by personal goals and values than external pressure or social signaling. This does not reveal how the environmentalist identity arose; external and internal motivations might both be involved. Further research manipulating the visibility or normative approval of pro-environmental actions (Brick et al., 2017) could help explore this divergence further by demonstrating the conditions under which external motivations drive behavior. We also studied the potential origins of environmentalist identity by measuring childhood experiences with summer camps, animals, and museums. We found only weak connections between these recalled childhood experiences and explicit identity, and none with implicit identity. These results suggest that these recalled childhood experiences are unlikely to be the primary determinants of adult environmentalist identity. However, these measures were not validated for childhood exposure to nature. We encourage researchers to use more established measures (Pensini, Horn, & Caltabiano, 2016;Wells & Lekies, 2006). Another potential predictor of adult identity is the local communities in which people live. Future work on identity antecedents could examine community-level variables such as community political climate, other social identities, socioeconomic status, and educational attainment. Future research on education may be particularly illuminating, as country-level educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness across 119 countries (Lee, Markowitz, Howe, Ko, & Leiserowitz, 2015). Next, the stimuli used as synonyms for Environmentalist in the ST-IAT were not thoroughly validated. The terms were generated by the authors and iterated through an MTurk pilot study (see Methods: Implicit environmentalist identity) that used both open response and Likert-type ratings of synonym overlap with Environmentalists. Potential confounds such as positivity or negativity were not measured for the terms. As a reviewer helpfully pointed out, the negative term \"Tree-Hugger\" could have impacted the results. As a robustness check, we computed the ST-IAT D score with and without the \"Tree-Hugger\" term in Study 1 to see if the main findings were affected by this stimulus. The new ST-IAT D score was correlated with the original calculation at r = .98 and was similarly correlated with explicit identity and behavior, suggesting that the term \"Tree-Hugger\" did not change the main findings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion.", "text": "Environmental concern is growing in recent decades, but individual pro-environmental behavior remains stagnant. This disconnect creates the need for other predictors to understand and influence behavior. Social identity drives myriad behaviors (Ellemers et al., 2002) and holds particular promise for conservation because it can lead to mental associations between diverse environmental behaviors (Truelove et al., 2014). Across four pre-registered studies predicting a wide range of outcomes, we found that explicit environmentalist identity was strongly associated with pro-environmental behaviors and policy preferences. In contrast, implicit environmentalist identity had no unique contribution. These findings suggest that understanding individuals in social contexts can support the study of environmental behavior, and that self-report is sufficient for predicting behavior from environmentalist identity. We welcome other researchers to use the novel implicit measure and analysis code to test for relationships with other identities and outcomes. Future research could isolate the key identities that influence pro-environmental actions, the origins of these identities, and design interventions to boost pro-environmental behavior by selectively highlighting or obscuring links with key social groups."}, {"section_title": "Supplement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Behavior measures", "text": "All items were rated from 1 (never), 3 (sometimes), to 5 (always). 1.
