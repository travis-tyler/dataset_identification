In modern society, difficulties in achieving social reconciliation on matters of public concern are also mainly due to the competing philosophical principles held by social groups. The problems can be of economic, social and political nature."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF FIGURES", "text": "Policy instruments serve to mitigate differences among social classes on these issues. As a continuous process, policy making generates several feedback loops. Evaluating the economic and social impact of policy intervention plays a critical role in guaranteeing the implementation of goals set by program designers and policy makers. In this sense, the concept of program evaluation not only refers to the results of policy interventions, but more broadly to the efficiency and efficacy of the governmental decision-making process. While the ultimate goal of policy interventions is to improve social well-being, the criterion for improvement has been extended from objective to subjective measures in economic studies. With limited emphasis on subjective measures, in the past policy makers neglected the possibility that policy interventions, e.g. welfare programs, could negatively affect an individual's subjective well-being (SWB). 1 As a result, many individuals eligible for a program refuse to participate when only objective indicators are considered to define well-being improvement. 2 This doctoral research is an attempt to shed light on two aspects of public policy analysis. Using causal inference techniques, the first two studies focus on identifying the socio-economic impacts of immigration laws of two types: one is associated with undocumented immigrants, while the other one is linked to foreign-born high-skilled labor market participants. In the third study, with a newly developed eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition technique, I identify the prevalent measurement errors in self-reported subjective well-being, one critical issue when using SWB as an indication of welfare improvement in policy evaluation. Viewed as one focus of public concern, immigration is at the center of political debate. Identifying the intended and unintended impacts of immigration policies on different aspects of society has significant repercussions. In the first essay, I identify an anti-illegal immigrant bill's initial effect on crime rate. In 2011, Alabama enacted the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (Alabama HB 56), which was considered the nation's strictest anti-illegal immigration bill (Fausset, 2011). The bill imposes extreme restrictions on undocumented immigrants in Alabama and set limits on every aspect of their lives, including enrollment in schools and job market participation. Our study is motivated by a recent interest in the literature to evaluate antiillegal immigrant laws (Bohn et al., 2014;Hoekstra and Orozco-Aleman, 2017), and its impact on crime rate (Bell et al., 2013). To evaluate the impact of Alabama HB 56 on crime this paper uses the synthetic control approach, which was first employed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003). I create a counter-factual synthetic Alabama based on crime reports, economic indicators, and demographic characteristic during the period 1998-2014. Variables used in constructing the synthetic Alabama are chosen following the literature on crime rate (Blau and Blau, 1982;Bailey, 1984;Fajnzylber et al., 2002). Particularly, to proxy the risk of being arrested and punished, I use police presence and capital sentence legality accessed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I used the admission cases of primary substance use of marijuana and alcohol, accessed from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as a proxy for illicit drug use. Gallup's polling data for practicing religion and church attendance are employed to account for cultural characteristics. State level economic indicators such as Gini index and unemployment status are obtained in the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey. Estimation results provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous causal effects of Alabama HB 56 on crime. Compared with the synthetic counterpart, Alabama HB 56 contributed to an increase in violent crime rates, while there was no significant change in property crime rates after the act. The results can be linked to the seminal work of Gary Becker (Becker, 1968), who modeled criminal behavior from a rational decision analysis based on the benefits and opportunity costs of crime. In general, unemployment status decreases the opportunity cost of criminal behavior. Fleisher (1966) and Ehrlich (1973) document a significant causal effect of unemployment on criminal activities in the US. Since the Alabama HB restricts undocumented immigrants from taking job positions, it is expected to increase criminal activities. Another possible mechanism is associated to the growing literature on expressive value of law, which suggests the act of enacting a particular law serves the function of shaping norms or prescribed attitude towards behavior (Bursztyn and Jensen, 2017). The adoption of an anti-immigration law will send out a signal of increased tolerance to discrimination behavior against undocumented workers, which can also potentially generate tensions or conflicts that may result in violent crimes against undocumented immigrants. Whether the increase in violent crimes is committed by undocumented immigrants or against them, and through which underlying mechanism merit further investigation using richer data. In the second essay, I leverage the H-1B policy shock generated by the AC 21 as an exogenous variation and examine the subsequent changes in foreign Ph.D graduates' job market preferences. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act (AC 21) was signed into law in October, 2000(U.S. Congress, 2000. It eliminates the cap on the number of H-1B visas granted for applicants in universities, non-profit and government research institutions. As a result, choosing a career in an uncapped H-1B qualified entity means to circumvent the risk of facing the fiercely competitive H-1B application process and possibly avoiding potential losses due to a visa rejection. Accordingly, AC 21 would impose a direct effect on foreign-born Ph.D. graduates' job preference in academia, while having an indirect (or second degree) effect on the job preference in industry. Our study is motivated by a profound linkage between the H-1B program and high-skilled labor markets in the United States. One key issue surrounding the immigration debate is whether high-skilled immigrants have a complementary or displacing effect on domestic workers. Most immigrant scientists and engineers started their careers in the United States via this visa program and they are now making substantial contributions to the economy and advancing technological development (Peri, 2007;Anderson and Platzer, 2006;Wadhwa et al., 2007). In this sense, a relaxed visa policy for high-skilled immigrants allows experts from a wide range of fields to stay in the US labor market after completing their studies, producing benefits over the long run. Yet, the debate about the short-run effects of the H-1B visa program is still unsettled. A crowding-out influence from the influx of high-skilled immigrants on domestic workers is supported by the literature (Borjas, 2005;Islam, 2009;Ottaviano and Peri, 2012;Borjas and Doran, 2012). A crucial challenge for detecting this effect relies on overcoming the endogeneity of the behavior of immigrants in the job market. An evaluation of how immigration policy changes influence job market preferences of high-skilled immigrants paves the way to accurately identify the impact of foreign workers on domestic workers. To quantitatively identify the treatment effect on job market choices, we establish our estimation model using individual level variation in visa status and graduation time, before and after the policy shock. Due to idiosyncratic features of each doctorate academic field, our baseline specification includes both major and year fixed effects. In order to allow for different disciplines to have distinct trajectories over time, we estimate models that incorporate major-specific linear trends. Specifications extending to incorporate field-by-year fixed effects to allow majors of different fields to accommodate differential shocks are also investigated. Our Difference-in-Difference estimates suggest a strong causal relationship between AC 21 and the job preferences of Ph.D holders in academia and industry labor markets. We find that after the implementation of AC 21, foreign Ph.D graduates are 5% more likely to pursue a job in academia, and 3-4% less likely to choose an industry job compared to U.S. domestic graduates. Placebo experiments and falsification tests exclude the possibility of other external changes around the same time period driving these results. In the third essay, we examine the potential misclassification errors in self-reported happiness data and explore the characteristics of countries and demographic groups with substantial misclassification errors. The well-known Easterlin paradox and modified Easterlin hypothesis are re-examined with the corrected SWB data. The pursuit of happiness has been paramount for humankind throughout history. It has evoked the attention of philosophers from Epicurus and Aristotle to Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Evaluating social well-being is a central topic in economics. A recent and growing literature argues that income and consumption are not ideal measures of welfare (see Fleurbaey (2009) for a review). Subjective well-being (SWB) can arguably be used as a standard for measuring social welfare and progress. Recently, it is gaining attention in economic research on policy evaluation. The most frequently used method to elicit SWB is to directly ask people about their feelings of happiness and overall life satisfaction (e.g., Frey and Stutzer, 2000, 2002, 2010Diener, 2000). However, compared to objective indicators of social welfare, SWB is subject to substantial misreporting or measurement errors (e.g., Hagedorn, 1996;OECD, 2013;Diener et al., 2013;Sheridan et al., 2015;Chetty, 2015). Although the ample evidence of measurement errors is documented in self-reported happiness, this issue has been mostly ignored by empirical practitioners. To address this concern, we apply a novel closed-form identification and estimation method first proposed by Hu (2008) and developed in Feng and Hu (2013). In general, the methodology employs an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition technique to establish a closed-form identification for the misclassification matrix of SWB, which is constructed a priori using the conditional distribution of reported happiness. By pre-multiplying the inverse of the identified misclassification matrix by the unconditional distribution of reported SWB, the true latent SWB distribution is directly estimated. The identification strategy in our article is implemented closely in the spirit of Feng and Hu (2013). For computation time reasons, we select 80 countries based on geographical diversity and consistency of survey data across periods in the Integrated European/World Value Survey (EVS/WVS). We use reported \"feeling of happiness\" in EVS/WVS as the direct measurement of SWB, while \"life satisfaction\" (LS) and \"freedom of choice and control in life\" (FCC) serve as two repeated measures of SWB. Under relatively weak assumptions, we are able to obtain the latent SWB probability distributions by country and demographic groups. Another motivation of our study is related to the well-known \"Easterlin paradox\" (Easterlin, 1974(Easterlin, , 1995Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004). The Easterlin paradox posits that although there is a positive correlation between individual income and measures of SWB, aggregate happiness is not significantly associated with GDP per capita. Meanwhile, a modified version of the Easterlin's hypothesis has also been proposed. It argues that the correlation between income and SWB only exists for individuals with income below a certain threshold, beyond which income is no longer related to happiness (Frey and Stutzer, 2002;Clark et al., 2008;Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2008;Di Tella et al., 2010). Our analysis produces the following major findings. We find that self-reported happiness elicited from survey questions has substantial misclassification errors. Religious belief and the development stage of a country play critical roles in determining the magnitude of misclassification errors in reported SWB. We revisit the Easterlin paradox and find that based on a country level analysis there is no evidence supporting neither the original hypothesis nor the modified version of the Easterlin's paradox when using the corrected measure of happiness, although the reported (uncorrected) SWB provides support to the original Easterlin paradox. These findings imply that, to use SWB measures in evaluating economic development and welfare, they have to be corrected for measurement errors. 2. UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF THE ALABAMA HB 56 IMMIGRATION LAW ON CRIME: A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS*"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the last decade, illegal immigration has received considerable attention from state governments. In 2007, Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which was followed in 2010 by SB 1070; the harshest U.S. act against undocumented immigrants at the time. One year later Alabama enacted the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (Alabama HB 56), which is now considered the nation's strictest anti-illegal immigration bill (Fausset, 2011). Both legislative acts were enacted to restrict the enrollment of undocumented immigrants in schooling and in the job market. The consequences of these anti-illegal immigration acts have received much attention from governments and researchers. Despite the growing interest in the relationship between illegal immigration and crime environment, the evaluation of the causal effect of those policies is subject to debate. While evidence of positive relationship between immigration and crime has been found in some recent studies, such as Spenkuch (2013), a major vast literature provides suggestive evidence that immigrant legalization has contributed to the decline of crime (Baker, 2015;Mastrobuoni and Pinotti, 2015;Pinotti, 2017). Meanwhile, some previous studies suggest that immigration has no effect on crime (Butcher and Piehl, 1998;Chalfin, 2013). This paper evaluates the impact of Alabama HB 56 on crime using the synthetic control approach, which was first employed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) to estimate the consequences of the conflict i n B asque, S pain. T hey c onstructed a s ynthetic ' Basque' u sing a w eighted average of other provinces in Spain according to similarities in economic and demographic indicators. Following their approach, we create a counterfactual synthetic Alabama based on crime reports, economic indicators, and demographic characteristic during the period 1998-2014. The results provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous causal effects of Alabama HB 56 on crime. Com-pared with the synthetic counterpart, Alabama HB 56 contributed to an increase in violent crime rates, while there was no significant change in property crime rates after the act. Our study is motivated by a recent interest in the literature to evaluate anti-illegal immigrant laws. For instance, using a synthetic control method, Bohn et al. (2014) find that the 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act substantially reduced the proportion of undocumented immigrants in the population of Arizona. Hoekstra and Orozco-Aleman (2017) examined the effect of Arizona SB 1070 on the undocumented immigrants' individual decisions regarding their migration destination. Their results show that the passage of the bill significantly reduced unauthorized immigration to Arizona by 70%. Our study focuses on the causal effect of Alabama HB 56 on crime, rather than the direct effect on the proportion of unlawfully present immigrants. Bell et al. (2013) conducted a similar study where they examined the relationship between crime and immigration in the UK during the 1990s and 2000s. They found that preventing asylum seekers from finding jobs resulted in increases in property crime, but had no impact on violent crime. We use a different estimation framework and focus on the evaluation of the treatment effect of anti-illegal immigrant laws on crime in Alabama. In contrast to their finding, Alabama HB 56 increased violent crime but had no impact on property crime. Our results can be linked to literature after Becker (1968), who modeled criminal behavior from a rational decision analysis based on the benefits and opportunity costs. In general, unemployment status decreases the opportunity cost of criminal behavior. Fleisher (1966) and Ehrlich (1973) documented the significant causal effect of unemployment on criminal activities in the US. Since the Alabama HB 56 restricts undocumented immigrants from taking job positions, it is expected to increase criminal activities. However, there is also literature suggesting that increasing police force can reduce crime (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004;Levitt, 2002). According to this view, the increase in immigration police force due to Alabama HB 56 may reduce crime. In spite of the contradictory predictions, our results support the former; the anti-immigrant law is more likely to increase violent crime. The rest of this paper proceeds as follow. Section 2.2 introduces the institutional background. Section 2.3 describes the methodology and data. Section 2.4 presents the results. Section 2.5 performs placebo tests to provide statistical inference, and section 2.6 concludes.\nThe pursuit of happiness has been paramount for humankind throughout history.  Fleurbaey (2009) for a review). Subjective well-being (SWB) can arguably be used as a standard for measuring social welfare and progress. The contemporary literature related to the economics of happiness started with the pioneering work of Richard Easterlin (1974). Recently, SWB is gaining attention in economic research and welfare evaluation. The most frequently used method to elicit SWB is to directly ask people about their feelings of happiness and overall life satisfaction (e.g., Frey and Stutzer, 2000, 2002, 2010Diener, 2000). This method is attractive due to its simplicity and versatility. However, compared to objective indicators of social welfare, SWB is subject to substantial misreporting or measurement errors. Self-reported measures of happiness can be largely disturbed by contextual factors, and personal reasons such as selective memory and projection bias. Furthermore, people may avoid reporting extreme categories of SWB, deceiving themselves to believe that they are more (or less) happy than they actually are (e.g., Hagedorn, 1996;Sheridan et al., 2015). Individuals may also be easily influenced by random shocks of recent events at the time of responding to surveys due to projection bias (Chetty, 2015). For example, dealing with health problems or the loss of a close relative may negatively impact happiness measures. On the contrary, a recent job promotion or the birth of a child may positively influence self-reported happiness. More importantly, it is difficult for some people to precisely evaluate their subjective well-being. Using a hypothetical survey of SWB rankings under different scenarios, Benjamin et al. (2012) find systematic reversals in individual choices of reported happiness. Although there is evidence of measurement errors in self-reported happiness (OECD, 2013;Diener et al., 2013;Chetty, 2015), this issue has been mostly ignored by empirical practitioners. Since precise and reliable measurements of SWB are fundamental for understanding the economics of happiness, we believe that it is critical to explore ways to recover the true latent status of SWB. To address this concern, we apply a novel closed-form identification and estimation method first proposed by Hu (2008) and developed in Feng and Hu (2013). In general, the methodology employs an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition technique to establish a closed-form identification for the misclassification matrix of SWB, which is constructed a priori using the conditional distribution of reported happiness. By pre-multiplying the inverse of the identified misclassification matrix by the unconditional distribution of SWB, the underlying true distribution of latent SWB is directly estimated. This method is becoming popular in recent empirical applications (e.g., An et al., 2010An et al., , 2017. The identification strategy in our article is implemented in the spirit of Feng and Hu (2013). The data source that we employ to recover the true underlying distribution of latent SWB is the Integrated European/World Value Survey (EVS/WVS). EVS and WVS have been widely used in economic research (e.g., Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008b;Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2015;Stevenson and Wolfers, 2013;Alesina and Giuliano, 2010;Galor and \u00d6zaka, 2016). Besides its broad use, we use these data because it contains three direct measures of SWB across countries and time, which are required for identification. 1 For sake of computation, we select 80 countries based on geographical diversity and consistency of survey data across periods. We use reported \"feeling of happiness\" in EVS/WVS as the direct measurement of SWB, while \"life satisfaction\" (LS) and \"freedom of choice and control in life\" (FCC) serve as two repeated measures of SWB. 2 Under relatively weak assumptions, we impose a structure on the misclassification of reported happiness and are able to obtain the latent SWB probability distributions by country and demographic groups. Based on these results, we exploit country characteristics and specific demographic groups to explain misclassification errors. Particularly, we examine how the prevalent religion of a country affects the magnitude and direction of the bias in self-reported happiness. The relationship between religion and SWB has been abundantly discussed (e.g., Ellison, 1994;Dolan et al., 2008;Deaton and Stone, 2013;Argyle, 2003;Francis, 2010;Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2015). In this article, we add to the literature by examining this association through the lens of identifying misclassification errors in SWB. Another motivation of our study is related to the well-known \"Easterlin paradox\" (e.g., Easterlin, 1974Easterlin, , 1995Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004); See Kahneman and Krueger (2006) positive relationship between SWB and income across countries and over time (e.g., Hagerty and Veenhoven, 2003;Deaton, 2008;Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008a;Sacks et al., 2010;Stevenson and Wolfers, 2013). Meanwhile, a modified version of the Easterlin's hypothesis has also been proposed. It argues that the correlation between income and SWB only exists for individuals with income below a certain threshold, beyond which income is no longer related to happiness (e.g., Frey and Stutzer, 2002;Clark et al., 2008;Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2008;Di Tella et al., 2010). For instance , Clark et al. (2008) state that \"greater economic prosperity at some point ceases to buy more happiness.\" The debate about the Easterlin paradox and its modified hypothesis is likely to continue unless SWB can be more precisely measured and quantified. Our study makes the first attempt to use a sophisticated method to correct misclassification errors in self-reported SWB. Our analysis produced the following major findings. The three key variables selected as the measures for subjective well-being come from 1) level of happiness, 2) overall life satisfaction (LS) and 3) freedom of choice and control in life (FCC). The \"happiness\" variable is the directly reported measure of SWB (Helliwell et al., 2012;OECD, 2013). We use LS as another close measurement of SWB, as suggested by previous literature (OECD, 2013). FCC is chosen as the third measurement of SWB for identification purposes, which will be further elaborated in the next section. Since the three SWB questions use different scales, to identify the latent status of SWB, we recoded them to guarantee all three variables of interest share a common support. The variables are defined as follows: 1) Happiness has three levels: \"unhappy\", \"quite happy\" and \"very happy\"; 2) overall life satisfaction can be: \"most dissatisfied\",\"quite satisfied\" and \"most satisfied\"; 3) freedom of choice and control can be: \"not at all\", \"quite a bit\" and \" a great deal\". The overall distributions of the three variables are similar, with around 14-19% of the observations in the first category, 51-57% in the second category, and 23-27% in the third category. In addition to demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, family income) provided in the EVS/WVS dataset, country-level characteristics are also used in the analysis. GDP per capita was obtained from the Penn World Table (Feenstra et al., 2015). The World Factbook was used to identify the prevalent religion of each country."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Background", "text": "The Alabama HB 56 Bill passed in June 2011 imposes extreme restrictions to undocumented immigrants in Alabama. It requires every public elementary and secondary school to determine whether students were born outside of the US or if their parents are undocumented. The Bill makes it a felony for an undocumented immigrant to \"enter into any business transaction with a government agency\". It also prohibits signing rental agreements or providing housing accommodations for undocumented immigrants. Similar to other immigration acts, Alabama HB 56 also requires \"every business entity or employer in the state to enroll in E-Verify\", the federal government's online database used to check the employment eligibility of workers. As a consequence, undocumented immigrants have fewer opportunities for education, employment and businesses, thereby lowering opportunity cost for criminal behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Data", "text": "To evaluate the effect of HB 56, one needs to find a comparable counterfactual for Alabama. This paper employs a data-driven method to construct a synthetic Alabama, which is a weighted average over all the control states. In the framework of the synthetic control method, J is the number of states, j = 1 is the treated state, Alabama. The rest of the states from j = 2, ., J are the potential control alternatives constituting a \"donor pool\" to construct a synthetic Alabama. Define Y C jt and Y T jt as the outcome of unit j at time t in the control group and treatment group respectively. Let W = w 1 , w 2 , , w J\u22121 be the (J \u2212 1) \u00d7 1 vector of weights, with 0 \u2264 w j < 1 and w 1 + w 2 + + w J\u22121 = 1. By choosing the proper W * , the following minimization problem can be solved at t = T 0 , the pre-intervention period. Then, the treatment effect can be calculated by applying W * to t = T 1 post-intervention period. Our outcome variables are crime rates at the state level which are obtained from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) statistics from 1998 to 2014. To construct the synthetic Alabama, we combine state-level police labor force data from 1998 to 2014 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and calculate per capita statistics. We further control for state differences in death penalty legality. Since Fajnzylber et al. (2002) find that cultural characteristics such as religion views and illicit drug use can affect an individual's propensity to crime, we use the percentage of respondents who identify as Christian from Gallup's polling data (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014). Due to data limitations, we use the number of hospital admission for primary substance abuse as control for illicit drug use. Specifically, we control alcohol and marijuana use per 100,000 habitants (accessed from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). There is substantial evidence documenting how income inequality contributes to crime behavior, in particular violent crimes (Blau and Blau, 1982). Thus, the Gini index in the American Community Survey (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014), and unemployment status in the Current Population Survey (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014) are also included. Regarding demographic aspects, we use the proportion of non-citizen Hispanics over 15-yearold without high school education as the proportion of the population most likely to be undocumented (Bohn et al., 2014). Over the past decade, several states have launched their own immigration regulations. States impacted by similar interventions should be excluded from the donor pool (Abadie et al., 2015), thus we remove all the states that passed E-verify or Omnibus Immigration Legislation (OIL) around the same period."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Violent crime", "text": "While evaluating the impact of Alabama HB56 on violent crime, synthetic Alabama was constructed by a combination of Kentucky (42.1%), Oklahoma (40.6%), Florida (9.6%), and New Mexico (7.6%), with W * displayed in the parentheses.

If a significant placebo effect is detected, then the estimated shift for Alabama would be seriously undermined. prediction error (MSPE) larger than twice of Alabama. MSPE measures the magnitude of the difference in the outcome variable between the treated unit and its synthetic counterpart (Abadie et al., 2010(Abadie et al., , 2015. The states with large fluctuating MSPE in the pre-treatment period will not provide valid information. The black line denotes the gap in the outcome variable between the treated and synthetic control group, while the gray lines represent the gaps in each of the iterative application of intervention for the units in the donor pool. Twenty-two controls states and Alabama are presented in Figure 2.3. Alabama displays the largest gap-line in the post-intervention period. According to Abadie et al. (2010), the probability of estimating such a magnitude of gap-line under the random treatment assignment is as low as 1/22, which in terms of the inference interpretation means a p-value of lower than 5%. We also perform the placebo tests by examining the distribution of post-pre MSPE ratio across states. A large post-period MSPE does not validate the treatment induced shift unless the post-pre period ratio of MSPE is also large. Figure 2.4 reports how this ratio spreads across Alabama and all the other 37 control states. Alabama has a value of post-period about 27 times larger than the pre-period. If the treatment is randomly assigned to any state in the donor pool, the probability of obtaining a MSPE ratio as large as Alabama's is 1/37 = 0.027. We further implement the sensitivity test by leaving out the four states with positive weights one at a time and re-estimating the model. Figure 2.5 plots the four synthetic groups constructed by leaving one state out together with the reproduction of Figure 2.1. As seen, our result for violent crime is robust to the exclusion of any particular state with positive weight. All leave-one-out synthetic groups present similar effects to our findings. By sacrificing some extent of goodness of fit, it demonstrates our result is not driven by any particular state."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The recent waves of anti-immigrant regulation have been paid interest from researchers and governments. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of the harshest anti-immigration bill, Alabama HB 56, on crime using a synthetic control approach. We provide suggestive evidence of heterogeneous effects of Alabama HB 56 on violent crime and property crime. Although this anti-immigrant bill did not affect property crime in Alabama, violent crime significantly increased after the bill was enacted. The intention of this act is to reduce the amount of illegal immigrants living in Alabama and create a better socio-economic environment for the local citizens. However, its consequences Figure 2.5: Leave-One-Out Distribution of the Synthetic Control for Alabama are contradictory to the expectations. There is evidence for the negative economic consequences caused by the passage of this act. HB 56 is estimated to cost Alabama as much as $11 billion in economic output and another $264.5 million in tax revenue (Addy, 2012). And in this study we find unintended effect on violent crime rate. This calls for the state government to take the potential negative side effects into consideration while adjusting future immigration-related bills. Our results can be linked to the literature in which criminal behavior is analyzed based on the benefits and opportunity costs Becker (1968 establish a potential causal relationship is further implemented through the clause stating that \"any individual who is on an uncapped H-1B visa will be counted towards the cap if he/she switches to a job that is subject to a cap\" (U.S. Congress, 2000). According to these terms, AC 21 would impose a direct effect on the job preference in academia, while having only an indirect (or second degree) effect on the job preference in industry. The intent-to-treat effect from AC 21 possibly affects all students who graduated with any academic degree, but jobs in academia or research institutions in general require a doctoral degree. Thus, we concentrate on the identification of causal effects on Ph.D holders as they participate in high-skilled labor markets and are important drivers of innovation and discovery in science and industry (Cohen et al., 2002;Stuen et al., 2012). Our Difference-in-Difference estimates suggest a strong causal relationship between AC 21 and the job preferences of Ph.D holders in academia and industry labor markets. We find that after the implementation of AC 21, foreign Ph.D graduates are 5% more likely to pursue a job in academia, and 3-4% less likely to choose an industry job compared to U.S. domestic graduates. Placebo experiments and falsification tests exclude the possibility of other external changes around the same time period driving these results. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the following section, we document the literature and motivation. Section 3 provides a brief overview of the institutional details of AC 21. Section 4 provides an overview of the data and presents descriptive results of our analysis. Section 5 introduces our identification strategy, where we leverage individual level variation in the visa status to identify the effects of AC 21 on job placement. Section 6 reports the results. In Section 7, we discuss the two inference strategies that we use and present results for the placebo experiments and falsification test. Section 8 explores heterogeneous effects by doctoral field and section 8 concludes.\nEvaluations of economic development and social welfare normally use objective outcome indicators; however, subjective measurements of welfare also provide insights. Subjective well-being data have usually been obtained by self-reported surveys. However, due to its inherent nature, reported SWB is subject to substantial misclassification errors. In this article we apply a new method to uncover the latent true distribution of subjective wellbeing using data from the integrated EVS/WVS surveys. We find that reported happiness in surveys has substantial misclassification errors. This is of particular importance to the literature since most studies rely on reported SWB to address economic questions of interest. We explore the characteristics of countries and demographic groups with substantial misclassification errors and find that religious beliefs and the development stage of the countries play a critical role in the magnitude of misclassification errors in reported SWB. We revisit the Easterlin paradox and find that based on a country level analysis there is no evidence supporting neither the original hypothesis nor the modified version of the Easterlin's paradox when using the corrected measure of happiness, although the reported (uncorrected) SWB provides support to the original Easterlin paradox. The identified misclassification errors in reported subjective well-being provide directions for the future research. First, further efforts can be devoted to conduct causal analysis of the relationship between misclassification errors and their influencing factors. A richer longitudinal dataset or exogenous variations can help to establish causality. In addition, follow-up surveys may enable researchers to explore individual characteristics driving misclassification errors in SWB reports. Finally, experimental studies can be useful to examine how psychological and behavioral elements such as envy and self-deception affect misclassification errors of SWB measures in survey data.  1981-1984, 1990-1993, 1999-2001-2010, while WVS was conducted for six waves: 1981-1984, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2004, 2005, 2010. Some countries were not continuously surveyed across the waves. For the same wave, WVS and EVS may or may not cover exactly the same years (e.g., \"WVS: 1989-1993\" vs. \"EVS: 1990-1993\", \"WVS: 1999-2004\" vs. \"EVS: 1999-2001. Due to this very unbalanced feature of the data structure, we pool all the waves together for each country and conduct a cross sectional analysis. Table 4.7 shows the summary statistics for the reported values of the three measurements of subjective well-being (SWB). In each demographic cell, it reports the sample mean for the percentage of people reporting each level of a given SWB measure. The tabulation is implemented with all 80 countries sample pooled together. In Table 4.8, we present the estimated misclassification error in each country. It summarizes by major religion, geographical location, development stage, reported/corrected SWB along with the misclassification errors (by level and vector distance).       "}, {"section_title": "Literature and Motivation", "text": "The linkage between the H-1B program and high-skilled labor markets is profound. Most immigrant scientists and engineers started their careers in the United States via this visa program and they are now making substantial contributions to the US economy and advancing technological development (Peri, 2007;Anderson and Platzer, 2006;Wadhwa et al., 2007). 3 In this sense, a relaxed visa policy for high-skilled immigrants allows experts from a wide range of fields to stay in the US labor market after completing their studies, producing benefits over the long run. Yet, the debate about the short-run effects of the H-1B visa program is still unsettled. On one hand, high-skilled immigrants provide both critical contributions in fundamental research and auxiliary skills in management and entrepreneurship. For instance, Kerr and Lincoln (2010) found that a 10% increase in the H-1B population resulted in around 4% higher growth in the number of noncitizen scientists and engineers without displacement impacts on their native counterparts. Further, Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle (2010) document that an increase in the share of immigrant college graduates induces a sizable positive spill-over effect on innovation. By leveraging the lottery assignment of H-1B as an exogenous intervention in computer-related occupation markets, Peri et al. (2014a) showed that negative shocks in H-1B assignment generated from the lottery process reduced employment and the growth rate of wages for native workers; this result suggests a complementary relationship between native and foreign workers. Similarly, Islam et al. (2017) found that the increase of skilled immigrants in a particular group raised the wages of both native and immigrants from that group. Using historical data, Moser et al. (2014) document a productivity boost on fellow Chemistry researchers following the immigration of Jewish scientists from Nazi Germany. On the other hand, a crowding-out influence from the influx of high-skilled immigrants on domestic workers is also supported by the literature. This effect was found either through direct displacement or by lowering wage rates. For instance, the influx of foreign mathematicians after the Soviet Union collapse temporarily displaced American mathematicians in the academic labor market (Borjas and Doran, 2012). Evidence from Borjas (2005) showed that the inflow of foreign doctorate students had negative impacts on the earnings of native Ph.D graduates within the same field. Further, a series of studies discussed the substitutability of immigrants and natives through examining their wage rate relationship (e.g. John and Zimmermann, 1994;Borjas, 2003;Islam, 2009;Ottaviano and Peri, 2012, etc.). Motivated by these previous studies, we exploit the impact of exogenous variation in immigration policy on high-skilled labor markets through examining the job placement preference of wage rates, and the number of patents subsequently filed in the United States. Kato and Sparber (2013) investigated the relationship between the variation generated from the reduced H-1B visa cap around 2003 and the SAT scores of international college applicants. Later, Shih (2016) examined the effect of this visa cap change on college enrollment of international students. The most thematically relevant study to our paper is Amuedo-Dorantes and Furtado (2017). The authors leveraged the differentiation in the availability of H-1B substitute visas for students from different countries and explored how the visa cap reduction affected foreign individuals jobs in academia. The authors use the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) data source to focus on the job market for science and engineering(S&E). 4 However, our research design and data provide a distinct perspective for a broader study population. We focus on how the relaxation in the immigration policy affects foreign-born doctoral recipients' selection into the academic market. From the design point of view, our article studies the H-1B cap exemption regulated from the AC 21 policy. We employ the variation in nationality (domestic/foreign) to examine intent-to-treat effects. More importantly, our study employs licensed data from a census of Ph.D holders of all academic majors. Using data of Ph.D recipients from all academic fields is useful to understand foreign professionals' selection into different academic labor markets. A significant amount of literature explores the H-1B program influence normally using a restricted sample of individuals within STEM fields (e.g. Kerr and Lincoln, 2010;Mithas and Lucas Jr, 2010;Hunt, 2011;Peri, Shih, and Sparber, 2014a,b;Kerr, Kerr, and Lincoln, 2015;Hunt, 2015;Peri, Shih, and Sparber, 2015, etc.). We add to the literature on H-1B program analysis by extending it to all academic fields and achieving better external validity than previous studies."}, {"section_title": "Visa Policy and Job Choices", "text": "AC 21 passed in January 2000, and it was signed into law in October of the same year by President Clinton. It intended to enhance the effectiveness and portability of the H-1B visa program. The key provision relevant to our study is the special rule allowing universities and research institutions to hire as many foreign-born graduates as they need without being subjected to the annual H-1B quotas. While there are no specific educational level requirements in AC 21, we argue that the primary treatment effect would be on foreign nationals with doctoral degrees. The favorable visa conditions of AC 21 would potentially motivate all noncitizen graduates to favor academic and research institutions more than other employment prospects. However, academic positions normally require applicants to have a doctoral degree and a strong research background. In this sense, the uptake of the treatment induced by AC 21 would come first and foremost from doctorate recipients. In the following sections, we identify the primary treatment effect on all Ph.D graduates and exploit possible heterogeneous effects by academic fields. Aside from the annual H-1B quota, foreign-born graduates also face many other constraints when pursuing a job in the United States. After graduation, they are required to file a 12-month Optional Practical Training (OPT) certificate while applying for the H-1B working visa. Failing to receive an H-1B visa before the OPT expires leaves the prospective worker with a 60-day grace period to leave the country. In addition, the extra cost incurred during the H-1B application may be significant for small businesses, considering that foreign professionals are paid at the same level as domestic workers. In some cases, in order to hedge the additional costs, companies may offer lower salaries to H-1B recipients compared to American citizens. Moreover, businesses may have less incentives to invest in professional development, training and promotion opportunities for H-1B workers, since they might be mobile if the employer can not provide further sponsorship for a legal permanent residence application. 5 The enactment of AC 21 significantly reduces potential losses due to a visa rejection, and to a great extent helps foreign-born graduates to avoid the above mentioned constraints, as long as they commit to work in a cap-exempt research institution. Accordingly, the entry barriers become relatively higher for working in industry after the adoption of AC 21. Taking together, jobs in research related institutions may become more attractive after the AC21 policy intervention. On the other hand, the disadvantages of working in academia, nonprofit and government research institutions are not negligible. The income in these institutions tends to be generous, but it is usually lower than in industry, especially at the entry level. Potential promotions or large salary increases are unusual during the first several years of working in universities and research institutions. The highly competitive market situation for jobs in academia and research institutions also indicates that the most qualified professionals would probably have opportunities in both academia and industry. The exogenous shock generated from AC 21 will exercise most of its influence on the top qualified foreign doctoral graduates who are potential candidates to both job markets. We hypothesize that with lower barriers to enter the US academic job market, AC 21 may induce individuals to choose a career in H-1B exempted institutions. \"Total graduates\" represents Ph.D holders who intend to stay in the US within the next year after graduation. \"Graduates with definite plan\" represents individuals with determined study or employment plans and intend to stay in the US for the following year."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We employ licensed data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) to execute the quantitative analysis. The SED is a unique annual census conducted since the 1950s. It covers Ph.D graduates from U.S. universities across all fields of study. The survey is implemented at the time of graduation, and hence the response rate is over 90%. We extract micro level data from 1995 The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table 3.1. Our analysis is restricted to Ph.D graduates intending to stay in the U.S. after graduation. From the demand side, whether an individual is willing to stay in the United States is affected by the job market conditions of the United States, their home countries and other countries, since holding a doctoral degree from an English speaking country potentially opens the door to global placement. We assume these conditions collectively are exogenous at the time of graduation for a doctorate student. From the supply side, significant world events around the time of the implementation of AC 21 would most likely randomly affect the job preference for academia or industry. As seen, around 70% of the doctorate recipients, both citizens and foreign-born, have definite plans for employment, study or postdoctoral training after graduation. Of these individuals, half have definite employment plan. Starting from 2004, SED only collect the data of the prospect employers for individuals who indicate they do have a definite work plan. SED does not provide follow-up information regarding the placement of individuals who indicate they do not have definite work plans. Accordingly, we implement the causal analysis with sample restricted to individuals with definite post-graduation plans. 6 If most of the remaining doctorate recipients, who did not have definite employment plans at the time of the survey end up working in academia (industry), then our estimated effect on academic job choice is underestimated (overestimated). The empirical identification is based on individual level variation in the visa status. Ph.D holders with temporary visas are the most affected cohort and serve as the treatment group, while their US citizen counterparts serve as the comparison group. 7 In the top panel of Table 3.1, we summarize the demographic characteristics of temporary residents and U.S. citizens. The two cohorts differ in many aspects. Males account for 72% of Ph.D recipients with temporary visas while only for 51% of U.S. citizens. By nature, the two groups also show substantial racial differences. The association of interest between the policy change and the job market choice could potentially be driven by treatment and control differences in socioeconomic characteristics. Spurious causal relations can be generated if we fail to adequately control for these observable differences. Thus, we control for individual level demographic information in our extended model specifications. Individuals from different fields of study face different labor market conditions. Potential heterogeneity across fields of study may also differ across the treatment and comparison groups. The second panel in Table 3.1 shows the differences between foreign and U.S. citizen Ph.Ds in each academic field. The statistics present for the sample focused on individuals with definite employment plans. The majority of native doctorate recipients with earned their doctorates in Humanities and Education; whereas most foreign graduates hold doctorates in Engineering. Effectively controlling the divergence in preferences for doctoral fields is also critical in capturing the potential causal effects from AC 21. To exclude the possibility that the causal effects are driven by changes in the labor market conditions of some specific fields, we allow for flexible interactions of field and time indicators, and explore potential heterogeneous effects by each doctoral field. Finally, the outcome variables are presented in the last panel of academia\" is defined as working in a 4-year college or university, medical school, universityaffiliated research institute or community college, which are the options offered in the questionnaire. In addition to working in academia or industry, other respondents stated they would be working in federal/local/foreign government or self-employed.

The related parameter \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4, indicates the estimated treatment effect. Standard errors are clustered at the fourteen broadly classified academic fields. 11 Due to idiosyncratic features of each doctorate academic field, our baseline specification includes both major and year fixed effects. In order to allow for different disciplines to have distinct trajectories over time, we extend equation 3.1 to include major-specific linear trends. We also estimate specifications that incorporate field-by-year fixed effects to further allow majors of different fields to accommodate differential shocks over time. The results from these specifications and the inclusion of demographic variables serve as augmentations and robustness checks for the baseline results. If the estimated treatment effect changes drastically in any of these extensions, it would indicate that either socioeconomic factors or idiosyncratic trends explain the outcome effects and the baseline parameter may not be associ-ated with the exogenous shock that we intend to identify. As our point estimates shown in Section 3.6, this is not the case and the additional models support the general results."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results", "text": "Our baseline estimates for academic and industry job markets are shown in column (1) of Tables 3.2 and 3.3. Following the baseline results are the estimates for extended specifications which are shown in columns (2) to (4) of these two tables. In addition to the DID linear probability model, we also use a DID probit specification to estimate Equation 3.1. Estimates for the two models are shown in panel A and B of these tables respectively. The results for the linear estimation shown in Table 3.2 indicate that after implementing AC 21, foreign born Ph.Ds are 5% more likely to work in academia than domestic Ph.D graduates. The marginal effect for the probit specification implies an even larger influence, with foreign Ph.D graduates being 7% more likely to work in academic jobs. Our point estimate is robust to the inclusion of controls for idiosyncratic shocks by doctoral fields over time in column (2) and controls for demographic characteristics in column (3). In column (4), we further incorporate major-specific linear time trends into the model, in order to allow for each major to follow a differential trajectory. The parameter of interest remains unchanged. These point estimates are robust and significant at the 1% level throughout all specifications. The results provide suggestive evidence that pre-post variation in job market preferences over cohorts of different visa status is not correlated with other determinants of the outcome variable. Thus, we argue that the estimated effect is driven by the AC 21 policy intervention rather than other factors. Similarly, Table 3.3 displays analogous estimates for industry job choice. Across all specifications, the estimated parameters are statistically significant at the 1% level. The results show that following AC 21, foreign Ph.D graduates are less likely to work in industry than before the policy intervention. The magnitude of the reduction in probability is around 3 -4%. The absolute value of the point estimate decreases slightly when we include socioeconomic control variables and other controls for differential trends by doctoral fields and majors.  It suggests that the assessment of AC 21 on the job preference in industry is impacted by variations in doctoral field/major trends and demographic characteristics. This is plausible since the direct effect of AC 21 is primarily exercised on job choice in academia, and hence the inclination of working in industry assumes an indirect effect. Meanwhile, opportunities to work in government and self-employment for native graduates might also have spillover effects on the probability of foreign Ph.Ds to work in industry. These unobserved influencing elements are proxied by socioeconomic and field heterogeneity covariates. Accordingly, additionally controlling for these variables has impact on the magnitude of the point estimates for industry jobs."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic Difference-in-Difference Estimation", "text": "We perform further analysis using the dynamic Difference-in-Difference estimates in the spirit of Cheng and Hoekstra (2013). Specifically, the treatment and control difference of the outcome variable is estimated two/three years prior to the treatment (one year prior to treatment, the year of treatment, one year after treatment, two years after treatment and three years after treatment) relative to the average treatment and control difference four years or more prior to the treatment. By allowing for dynamic divergence between the treatment and control groups over time, this procedure detects how the treatment effect evolves over time. The identification design is invalidated if a significant jump in the dynamic DID coefficients is observed before the year of the treatment. That is, the possibility of other external factors driving the estimated effect cannot be excluded if the highest departing pattern did not appear immediately after the treatment. Based on Equation 3.1, we build our dynamic Difference-in-Difference estimation model as: where the associated coefficients of D f t are the dynamic DID estimates. The dynamic DID results are shown in Figures 3.3 and 3.4 for academia and industry respectively. We include additional control variables for demographic factors and allow for academic field specific shocks from the baseline model. For both outcome variables of interest, there is no evidence of a significant jump before the enactment of AC 21. The average pre-period coefficient is about 0.6% for academic jobs and 0.5% for industry jobs. Following the passage of AC 21, we observe notable differences in the estimated job preference for both job markets. The magnitude is as large as 9% increase at the peak in academia and 8% decrease at the dip in industry jobs. Throughout the post AC 21 period, the average treatment effect for the academic job market amounts to 5.6% and -4.1% for industry.

As shown in the brackets of these two tables, the statistical significance does not change at all for the outcome variable of academic job preference. The significance level changes slightly in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3.3 for industry jobs. Consistent with our previous discussion (See section 3.6.1), this again suggests that the job preference in industry assumes a less direct effect from AC 21, and it is sensitive to the inclusion of observed and unobserved factors proxied by demographic characteristics. The second approach is to construct p-values using the bootstrap t-procedure (Cameron et al., 2008). With a small number of clusters, the cluster-robust standard errors might be downward biased, this in turn can cause over-rejection of the no-effect null hypothesis. Thusly, we conduct the bootstrap t-procedure with 999 replications and present the bootstrapped p-value in Table 3.4.

To rule out this possibility, we check if the DID estimates are significant to a randomly assigned treatment year before the adoption of AC 21. Specifically, we conduct several placebo exercises to compare the outcome differences in the treatment and comparison groups over different designs of pre-and post-treatment year arrangements. Columns (1) to (4) of Table 3.5 show the results of placebo tests over different specifications for academic job preference. Columns (5) to (8) display the equivalent estimation for industry job choice. Each row represents a different pre/post arrangement scenario. For example, the first row assigns the placebo intervention year to 1995. Across the estimation scenarios and specifications, nearly all of the estimates indicate no effect. It is noteworthy to detect no significant effects in the placebo tests given the large sample size of the dataset used in this study."}, {"section_title": "Falsification Test", "text": "The identification of the Difference-in-Difference strategy is based on two key assumptions. The first assumption is the parallel trend assumption for foreign-born and U.S. domestic graduates. Namely, without the policy intervention, the treatment and comparison group would have undertaken the same time trend over time. We checked the first assumption qualitatively and quantitatively in previous sections and presented the results in Figures 3.1 to 3.4. The other assumption states that except for the exogenous shock generated from the policy intervention, other external variations are assumed to be orthogonal to the outcome of interest after effectively controlling for observable differences. In this section, we will test this second assumption. Constructing a test for the second assumption in our study is equivalent to checking whether Ph.D graduates who are exogenous to this policy intervention also change their job type preference after its implementation.   1995,1996,1997,1998 or 1999, we test whether there is significant jump even before the actual AC 21 (enacted at the end of 2000) took into effect. For instance, we set pre-period from 1995 to 1997, post-period from 1998 to 2000 for placebo intervention supposed to happen at the end of 1997. The dependent variable is whether individual response to place in academia at the time of answering the questionnaire. The explanatory variable of interest refers to noncitizen Ph.Ds who graduated after the adoption of AC 21. Data is restricted to doctorate recipients who have determined plan for employment and intend to stay in the US in the immediate following year. Field-Year fixed effect controls for 385 doctoral majors. Robust standard errors are clustered at fourteen broadly classified doctoral fields. qualified for a high standard faculty position would normally not be influenced by this visa policy to take a post-doctoral position instead of a full-time faculty opportunity. It is also reasonable to assume that a foreign doctorate holder with a permanent job offer in industry would not be driven by AC 21 to favor a post-doctoral position. Essentially, AC 21 only affects the job preference of individuals with job prospects subject to the regulation of the H-1B policy. Due to this feature, AC 21 would not have a significant impact on the aggregate participation level of post-doctoral scholars. In order to exclude other external events taking place around the same time of AC 21 driving the results in Section 3.6, analogous estimations for post-doctoral scholars, unaffected by the AC 21, are implemented in this section and they should yield null effects. According to this line of reasoning, we perform similar estimations to post-doctoral participation. Table 3.6 presents the point estimates for our main specifications using DID linear probability and DID probit models. Across columns (1) to (4), we gradually augment our specifications to al-  studies provide support to the notion that the unresponsiveness of post-doctoral participation to AC 21 is driven by its orthogonality to the policy change."}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous Effects by Doctoral Field", "text": "In this section we investigate whether AC 21 affects foreign Ph.Ds asymmetrically by academic field. As shown in Table 3.1 domestic and foreign-born doctoral recipients diverge in their preferences for academic fields. For instance, foreign Ph.D students are more likely to select STEM related majors compared to domestic students. In order to account for this potential selection, we control for detailed major fixed effects and allow for different majors to follow their own linear trend in our aggregate estimation presented in previous sections. Since the supply and demand of the job market conditions for different fields naturally differs, an individual field examination will provide an indication of where the exact treatment effect comes from. Therefore, an investigation on the potential heterogeneous responses of job choices to AC 21 by academic field is needed. Meanwhile, we argue that the exogenous shock from AC 21 is independent of the field selection of foreign-born Ph.Ds. Considering the strong requirements and specialized information required by doctoral programs, it is unlikely that foreign Ph.Ds would strategically change their fields in response to AC 21. Furthermore, our post-period includes six years after AC 21, covering the full length of most doctoral programs. Most Ph.D cohorts who registered after the full implementation of this policy intervention would also officially graduate after 2006, and these cohorts are already excluded from our data. We stratify the sample to fourteen broadly classified doctoral fields as defined in For industry jobs shown in Table 3.8, the heterogeneity in career preferences are mainly driven by AGLS, CS and BM. Overall, we observe more variation in the significance of point estimates for career choices in industry. For instance, Mathematics is only marginally affected by this policy in both models and the parameter significance level for CS decreases to 5% in the linear model. This is consistent with our previous aggregate results in Section 3.6.1 and might be plausibly explained  by the fact that the provisions of AC 21 only impose an indirect effect on industry job choices."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "The prevalent debate surrounding immigration policy has attracted much attention. One key issue often discussed is whether high-skilled immigrants have a complementary or displacing effect on domestic workers. A crucial challenge for detecting this effect relies on overcoming the endogeneity of the behavior of immigrants in the job market. An evaluation of how immigration policy change influences job market preferences of high-skilled immigrants paves the way to accurately identify the impact of foreign workers on domestic workers in the future. In this study, we leverage the H-1B policy shock generated by the AC 21 as an exogenous variation and capture changes in job choices of foreign Ph.D graduates in academia and industry. AC 21 eliminates the cap on the number of H-1B visas to be granted for applicants in universities, non-profit and government research institutions. We present evidence that eliminating the H-1B visa cap for research institutions makes newly foreign Ph.Ds more likely to stay in academia in the United States. Meanwhile, these estimated results do not take into consideration the potential growth among foreign Ph.Ds to work in nonprofit/government research institutions. To the extent that Ph.D recipients are driven to seek employment in these institutions, our estimated effects will understate the potential impact on aca-demic labor markets. One notable pattern for our results is that the effects from AC 21 phased out eventually as the Great Recession approached. From the perspective of demand side, as all cap-exempt institutions are non-profit entities, it is plausible that these institutions were not able to fully digest the increased supply of noncitizen Ph.D generated from this policy. Besides the AC 21, there is also a lack of follow-up favoring policies facilitating qualified institutions to boost the demand for noncitizen doctoral recipients. This unbalance was further intensified as the Great Recession finally commenced and we see a trend of career preference back to its previous levels after five years of the adoption of AC 21. Our findings have critical policy implications. We argue that the accumulated effect from this exogenous variation could be even larger. As identified by previous studies, the influx of highskilled immigrants, particularly Ph.D holders, makes great contributions to the number of patents filed and the development of fundamental research across academic fields. Admittedly, in the field of scientific research, sometimes contributions from several key figures could bring groundbreaking reform to a discipline.

Y and  Next, we define the misclassification probabilities and distributions for the latent SWB status in matrix form. For each demographic group c, one realization of the combination of the three individual characteristics, the misclassification matrix is defined as: The diagonal matrix is defined as: Similarly, other distribution matrices are defined as: The assumptions required for identification of the underlying true SWB status are provided below. Assumption 1. P r(X|X * , Z, c) = P r(X|X * , c) This assumption implies that conditional on the true SWB status and individual characteristics, the reported status does not rely on other measurements of SWB. The Z measure is only allowed to correlate with misclassification errors through the latent true SWB status. The difference between the latent X * and X is assumed to be independent with respect to other measures represented by Z. Assumption 2. P r(Y |X * , X, Z, c) = P r(Y |X * , c) Similarly to Assumption 1, Assumption 2 indicates that reported SWB (X) and the measure of Z affect the probability distribution of reported LS only through the latent true SWB status; X or Z does not contain additional useful information on reported LS beyond the true SWB and individual characteristics c. Note that Feng and Hu (2013), by the first-order Markov restriction, essentially assume that P r(Y * |X * , Z * , c) = P r(Y * |X * , c). In our case we impose Assumption 2 following Hu (2008). Assumption 3. Full rank condition: Rank(H X,Z|c ) = 3. We quantitatively test the rank condition using the method proposed by Robin and Smith (2000). The full rank of H X,Z|c is tested in a sequential procedure. Specifically, we first test the null hypothesis of rank 1 against rank 2, and then rank 2 against rank 3. The results of the rank test are presented in the supplementary materials. In our setting, to leverage the potential variation between FCC and SWB, FCC was chosen as Z. 5 . Assumption 4. P r(Y = 3|X * = i, c) = P r(Y = 3|X * = j, c) for all i = j. Assumption 5. Given the measure of Y and individual characteristics c, the conditional probability P r(Y = 3|X * , c) is strictly increasing in X * . Assumption 3 guarantees the invertibility of H X,Z|c , and Assumption 4 indicates the three elements in the diagonal matrix H Y =3|X * ,c are different. Assumption 5 is equivalent to assuming that when LS status is observed in level 3 (most satisfied with life), it is more likely that individuals make their judgement based on their latent SWB of level 3 as well. Similarly, it is less likely that a self-reported level of 3 in LS is based on a lower underlying SWB (i.e., level 1 or 2)."}, {"section_title": "Estimation Procedures", "text": "The identification procedure for latent SWB is constructive.

First, by the law of total probability and stated assumptions, the following relationships are satisfied: In matrix form, we have (4.10) 5 Theoretically, the three measurements can be used interchangeably. Empirically, we choose FCC to be the third measurement of SWB as it serves the purpose of measuring SWB, but it also causes variation in the joint distribution of X and Z by each level of Z to the extent that H X,Z|c has the best chance to exist. Namely, if X and Z are identical, Z does not provide any additional information on their joint distribution; and each column of H X,Z|c is expressed in the other two columns, then the inverse of H X,Z|c will not exist. The last equation indicates that the left-hand side has an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition on the right hand side. The left hand side is obtained from the survey responses. Accordingly, the misclassification matrix H X|X * ,c is directly estimated through eigen-decomposition. Theorem 1. Under Assumptions 1 through 5, the misclassification matrix H X|X * ,c is nonparametrically identified and directly estimated through the unique eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition of equation 10. This result is obtained following Theorem 1 in Hu (2008); See a complete proof in Section S2 of the Supplement. In the second step, the distribution of the underlying true status is recovered by multiplying the inverse matrix of H X|X * ,c by the self-reported SWB vector.

Specifically, the observed proportion of people in country i who report being \"unhappy\", \"quite happy\" and \"very happy\" are defined by the vector {\u03c9 1i , \u03c9 2i , \u03c9 3i }. Using the constructive identification procedures described in the previous section, the underlying latent distribution for the three levels of SWB is represented by the vector Reported By comparing panels (a) and (b), we find that while nations such as Russia, China and Brazil do not appear to have sizable differences between reported and corrected levels of happiness, other countries show pronounced differences (e.g., Japan, United States). [  The difference between reported and corrected SWB at each level of happiness can be either positive or negative, (i.e., over-reporting or under-reporting the true happiness status). 7 Simply comparing the aggregate levels of SWB fails to account for the direction of the misclassification errors. In order to further explore discrepancies between reported and corrected happiness, we also calculate misclassification errors taking into account the direction of correction and the distance between the two vectors. Specifically, we utilize the potential error at each level of happiness to construct misclassification errors of SWB for each country. We define Level 1 bias as and Level 3 bias as \u03c9 3i \u2212 \u03c9 * 3i , which represent the biases in reporting \"unhappy\" and \"very happy\" categories, respectively. These two measures are further examined since they are more informative about the direction of misclassification errors of individual SWB. A positive Level 3 (Level 1) bias implies a significant proportion of people reporting more extreme feelings of happiness than they really are; i.e., reporting \"very happy\" (\"unhappy\"), while actually being \"quite happy\". In contrast, a negative Level 3 (Level 1) bias suggests that people are inclined to suppress extreme categories. For instance, an individual may overstate happiness due to self-deception, while others may understate SWB. In another example, as the \"Doctrine of the Mean\" is highly praised in Asian Confucian culture, 8 citizens in Confucian countries may be more likely to report being \"quite happy\" and avoid extreme categories.  Level 1 bias but negative Level 3 bias; which means they are more inclined to over-report being \"unhappy\", but under-report being \"very happy\". There are nine countries with this pattern, six of which are from eastern Europe, including Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Macedonia. The other three countries are Colombia, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. On the other hand, there are 38 countries with negative Level 1 and positive Level 3 biases, implying under-reporting being \"unhappy\" and over-reporting being \"very happy\". Out of the 38 countries sharing this pattern, 13 countries have both Level 1 and Level 3 biases larger than 0.1 in absolute value. These countries are Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Rwanda, Singapore, Tanzania and Venezuela, most of which are located in tropical regions.  We represent misclassification errors in vector distance using Euclidean distance and rectilinear distance (L1 norm). The misclassification error vectors measure the distance between reported For all other countries, the detailed orderings are slightly different for the two measures. For the three most populous countries in the world, both measures indicate that China has relatively small misclassification errors, while the United States experiences sizable misclassification errors, and India is subject to moderate errors. 9"}, {"section_title": "Determinants of Misclassification Errors in SWB", "text": "One of the main objectives of this article is to understand why some countries display substantial misclassification errors of SWB while other countries do not.

Then, we examine the correlation between misclassification errors and demographic characteristics while controlling for country fixed effects.

The first row suggests that none of the measurements of misclassification errors are correlated with the log of GDP per capita. In the following rows of Table 4.1, we examine the correlation between misclassification errors and prevalent religious beliefs.

The results are shown in Table 4.2. Gender differences in misclassification errors of SWB seem to be negligible. Male respondents have slightly larger misclassification errors measured by rectilinear distance. We do not observe significant variations in misclassification errors by age measured by Euclidean or rectilinear distance. However, in columns 3 and 4, we observe that younger individuals are more inclined to over-report being \"very happy\" and under-report being \"unhappy\", compared to older individuals. With respect to individual income, we find that low-income individuals are more likely to report being \"quite happy\" when they are actually \"unhappy\"; and they tend to report being \"very happy\" when they are in fact \"quite happy\". This finding indicates an overall pattern of upward shifting from the true underlying SWB when low-income individuals respond to happiness surveys. Interestingly, relative to middle-income individuals, the high-income group shows a similar pattern in Level 3 bias to the low-income group, but with smaller magnitude and lower significance. In order to capture heterogenous correlations of misclassification errors of SWB and individual-level characteristics conditional on country-level features, we split the sample by prevalent religion and economic development stage. The results are reported in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 respectively. Recall that in Table 4 to under-report their true underlying SWB. On the other hand, \"very happy\" men from Islamic countries are more likely to report being \"quite happy\" or \"unhappy\". We also find heterogeneous effects by age. In line with the results for the overall sample, in predominantly Christian countries, younger people tend to express optimistic feelings when reporting SWB, generally over-rating their subjective well-being compared to older cohorts. Young people from Islamic countries show a similar pattern. However, people from Confucian countries show an opposite pattern with regards to the association between age and misclassification errors of SWB. That is, they tend to shift their overall underlying SWB downwards. Regarding relative income, people from countries with multiple prevalent religions show a similar pattern. In general, low-income and high-income cohorts are more likely to report a higher overall subjective well-being level than their true underlying status. We further probe the correlation between misclassification errors of SWB and individual characteristics conditional on the development stage of the country. Table 4.4 provides suggestive evidence of heterogenous relationships across countries in different stages of development.

The reference group for age band is \"50 and more years\"; The reference group for income is \"middle income level\". All specifications controlled for country level fixed effects. males from high-income countries show higher misclassification errors in SWB measured by Euclidean and rectilinear distance. In particular, in high-income countries, males tend to report being \"quite happy\" or \"very happy\" when they are actually \"unhappy\". Young people from low-income countries tend to report a \"very happy\" status when their true underlying happiness status is lower. This bias is relatively weak in middle-income countries and it is not significant in high-income countries. Low-income individuals tend to report their true underlying SWB in an upward-biased pattern. Moreover, the high-income group shares the same reporting pattern of SWB as the lowincome group. The coefficients are significant for both cohorts in low-income countries. In middleincome countries, both low-income and high-income people who are actually \"unhappy\" tend to report they are \"quite happy\" or \"very happy\". Additionally, low and high-income people living in high-income countries present larger misclassification errors measured by Euclidean and rectilinear distance.  "}, {"section_title": "The Easterlin Paradox", "text": "In this section, we revisit the Easterlin paradox and modified Easterlin Hypothesis by investigating the correlation between reported and corrected happiness and GDP per capita. We first implement simple regressions of average reported and corrected happiness on the log of GDP per capita. As shown in Table 4.5, there is no significant correlation between reported happiness and GDP per capita. This result, based on the reported level of happiness, provides support for the Easterlin paradox. However, the corrected measure of happiness is strongly associated with GDP per capita, leading to reject the Easterlin hypothesis. Notably, the coefficients are only slightly different. From the scatter diagram ( \"Fig 1\" in the original paper) of the seminal paper by Easterlin (1974), the author indicates that the \"the association between the wealth and happiness ... is not so clear-cut\". We replicate Easterlin's findings using reported happiness from WVS/EVS and the log of GDP per capita instead of GNP per capita. The equivalent representations are displayed in the two panels of the scatter plots in Figure 4.4. Similar to the original graph, panel (a) of  We also test the modified-Easterlin hypothesis following Stevenson and Wolfers (2013): where GDP c stands for GDP per capita of country C, and k is the threshold of satiation point (e.g., $15,000 in Stevenson and Wolfers (2013)). If the modified-Easterlin hypothesis holds, the equality of \u03b2 rich = 0 must hold, or at least the relationship of \u03b2 rich < \u03b2 poor . However, we find strong evidence against the modified-Easterlin hypothesis, as shown in Table 4.6. In columns 1 and 2 of panel A with $10,000 as the threshold, we find that \u03b2 rich > 0 \u2265 \u03b2 poor , regardless of whether the dependent variable is reported happiness or corrected happiness. The reported and corrected happiness measures are positively associated with the log of GDP per capita for high-income countries at the 1% level of significance. Notice that using the reported data, the estimation yields a negative SWB-GDP gradient among poor countries, and this slope coefficient is also significant as shown in column 1. However, this negative coefficient becomes insignificant with the corrected data, suggesting that the SWB-GDP relation is not significantly different from zero for the countries below the threshold after correcting the misclassification errors. We further test whether this relationship is sensitive to the selected threshold amount and the exact specification. The result of \u03b2 rich > \u03b2 poor is robust to the variation of the threshold to $15,000 and $20,000. These results are consistent with the findings in Stevenson and Wolfers (2013). It is likely that there are heterogenous correlations between GDP and SWB across countries in different development stages. Hence, we also specify a flexible nonparametric linear spline. The results are presented in panel b of Table 4.6 with knots set at $10,000 and $20,000. The point estimate is similar to that in panel a and significant at the 1% level. Although there is a reduction in the magnitude of the correlation between the log of GDP per capita and SWB after applying the SWB correction in all specifications, it is clear that this association is robust even beyond the threshold of $20,000. Taken together, neither the original nor the modified-Easterlin hypothesis is supported by the cross-country analysis of corrected SWB. This means that corrected measures of SWB are correlated with GDP per capita; However, reported SWB is not. This implies that SWB measures can be used to evaluate economic development and welfare, but they have to be corrected for measurement errors."}, {"section_title": "Proof of the Identification Procedure", "text": "In this section, we provide the formal proof that following Theorem 1 in Hu (2008), Assumptions 1 through 5 guarantee the nonparametric identification and estimation for the misclassification matrix H X|X * ,c through eigen-decomposition.

"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "Public policy is essential to society. Good policy initiatives help society to operate more effectively without necessarily sacrificing equity. Quantitatively evaluating the efficiency and impact of public policies determines whether the policy making outcomes result as planned. While the intended effect is well-anticipated, the unintended effects are generally difficult to foresee. Both impacts are of public-interest and they are key for social welfare. This dissertation covers three slightly different angles to study public policy. In the first essay, we identify potential unintended effects leading to an increase in the occurrence of violent crime rates following the initial passage of Alabama's anti-illegal immigrant bill-HB56. One explaining mechanism is provided in the seminal work of Gary Becker (Becker, 1968). HB56's strict restriction for undocumented immigrants taking job positions decreased the opportunity cost of criminal behavior. Another possible mechanism is associated to the growing literature on expressive value of law, which suggests the act of enacting a particular law serves the function of shaping norms or prescribed attitude towards behavior (Bursztyn and Jensen, 2017). The adoption of an anti-immigration law will send out a signal of increased tolerance to discrimination behavior against undocumented workers, which can also potentially generate tensions or conflicts that may result in violent crimes against undocumented immigrants. Whether the increase in violent crimes is committed by undocumented immigrants or against them, and through which underlying mechanism merit further investigation using richer data. In the second essay, we examine the impact of an immigration law-AC 21 on high-skilled labor markets. The unexpected exemption of the H-1B visa cap for working in eligible academic institutions or research entities changed the risk of being denied entrance to the US labor market for foreign-born Ph.D. graduates. The finding suggests that AC 21 significantly boosted the preference for working in academia by 5% among US-trained foreign doctorate recipients. AC 21 also indirectly caused foreign Ph.D. graduates to be 3-4% less likely to begin a career in industry. These results further pass a series of variation in specifications and placebo and falsification tests. The po-tential implication of these findings is profound. Well-educated foreign professionals are playing leading roles in innovation and technology development in the United States. Being able to retain the human capital actively contributing to fundamental research can significantly benefit United States in the long-term. The results of this study indicate that this goal can be effectively achieved by simply reducing the barriers in the visa application process for high-skilled professionals. When policy makers design intervention programs, their goals are usually measured by objectively measurable outcomes, such as food access and expenditures, changes in prices, income, health care access, etc. While objective measures serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of public policies, subjective well-being provides insights on whether a policy benefits the general public in a broader sense. Indeed, recent studies attempt to use subjective welfare to study poverty (Blank, 2008), health and the environment (Zhang et al., 2015), and social progress (Fehder et al., 2018). However, the inherent measurement error in reported SWB restricts it from being applied for public policy research. In the third essay, we use a newly developed method to recover the latent true distribution of subjective well-being for 80 countries. The results show that SWB, collected in surveys, has substantial misclassification errors. Religious beliefs and the development stage of a country play critical roles in determining the magnitude of misclassification errors. Reexamining the Easterlin paradox and modified-Easterlin hypothesis implies that although reported SWB is not associated with GDP per capita, corrected measure of SWB is; and this relationship is robust beyond an income satiation point. To apply SWB for program evaluation study, future research still need to identify the influencing factors which causally impact the misclassification errors in reported SWB. A richer longitudinal dataset and exogenous variation would be ideal ways to move in this direction."}]
