These methods are relatively invasive, costly, and often have high screening failure rates. Consequently, research is aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of A\u2424 and tau. Objective: This study aims to investigate a case/control polygenic risk score (PGRS) as a marker of tau and investigate blood markers of a combined A\u2424 and tau outcome for the first time. A sub-study also considers plasma tau as markers of A\u2424 and tau pathology in CSF. Methods: We used data from the EDAR*, DESCRIPA**, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts in a logistic regression analysis to investigate blood markers of A\u2424 and tau in CSF. In particular, we investigated the extent to which a case/control PGRS is predictive of CSF tau, CSF amyloid, and a combined amyloid and tau outcome. The predictive ability of models was compared to that of age, gender, and APOE genotype ('basic model'). Results: In EDAR and DESCRIPA test data, inclusion of a case/control PGRS was no more predictive of A\u2424, and a combined A\u2424 and tau endpoint than the basic models (accuracies of 66.0%, and 73.3% respectively). The tau model saw a small increase in accuracy compared to basic models (59.6%).

Although diagnostic criteria for AD focus on pathological evidence of A\u2424, tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also considered [1] . Jack et al. provide a theoretical model for the progression of AD based on existing evidence that is consistent with the popular amyloid cascade hypothesis [2, 3] . This hypothesis states that the build up of tau is triggered by increasing levels of A\u2424 in the brain.\nThe search for a biomarker of AD pathologies (tau and A\u2424) is ongoing with the best markers currently being measurements of tau and A\u2424 in the CSF and via positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. These methods are relatively invasive and often have high screening failure rates meaning a high proportion of individuals that are scanned have low levels of these pathologies. Additionally, PET scanning in particular is an expensive procedure costing around $3,000 per scan [4] . There are only approximately 2,380 (http://www.imvinfo.com, August 2016) PET scanners in the United States meaning access to facilities is limited [5] . The lumbar puncture needed to access CSF is also considered a high-risk procedure in many western countries [6] . To address these shortcomings, research is aiming to elucidate blood biomarkers of AD pathologies (A\u2424 and tau) [7] . One motivation for discovering a blood-based biomarker of AD pathology comes from clinical trial recruitment. For example, when recruiting into a trial of an anti-amyloid therapeutic, a blood-based biomarker of A\u2424 could act as a filtering step to identify individuals with abnormal levels of A\u2424 before performing a confirmatory PET scan or lumbar puncture. As such a test is likely to be cost-effective, we could reduce the cost of screening while also reducing the number of individuals subject to the invasive lumbar puncture and PET scanning procedures. So far, research into a blood marker has largely focused on A\u2424 brain burden, rather than tau pathology. However, some studies have investigated genetic markers of tau [8] . This study aims to further this research by investigating markers of a combined A\u2424 and tau outcome for the first time.\nGenome wide association studies (GWAS) of AD to date have identified over 20 risk loci explaining approximately 16-33% of genetic variability in the disease [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Compared to the predicted heritability of 50-70%, this is fairly low [13] [14] [15] . Modern technologies including next generation sequencing and the development of high coverage, exome chips are beginning to address this issue of missing heritability. Meanwhile polygenic risk scores (PGRS) are aiming to combine genetic risk from variants of lower effect size [16] . To date, PGRS in AD have only been trained on case/control endpoints as GWAS studies of pathological outcomes are relatively small (for example, N = 1,269 [17] ). Studies have shown case/control PGRS are associated with AD-related phenotypes but few have investigated their predictive ability in test data [18, 19] . When we studied the predictive ability of a PGRS for A\u2424 burden, we saw that the case/control PGRS used was no more predictive than demographics (age, gender) and APOE genotype alone (Voyle et al., in submission). However, we hypothesize in the current study that the PGRS may be more predictive of a combined A\u2424 and tau outcome; a more 'AD-like' phenotype.\nThis study aims to investigate the predictive ability of a case/control PGRS on CSF A\u2424 and tau. A substudy will also consider plasma tau as a predictor. We use individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), EDAR, and DESCRIPA studies to investigate these associations and compare all models to those of demographics (age, gender) and APOE genotype [20, 21] . We hypothesize that blood markers of AD will perform better when predicting a combined pathology (tau and A\u2424) endpoint over tau and A\u2424 individually. The combined endpoint should be more representative of an 'AD-like' phenotype."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohorts", "text": "EDAR was a prospective, longitudinal study which aimed to examine and evaluate biomarkers of early AD and treatment response [21] . In particular, the study focused on A\u2424 oligomers and the effect of genetic variants on these oligomers. For more information see http://www.edarstudy.eu. Our access to samples and clinical and phenotypic information from the EDAR study was enabled by the European Medical Information Framework and has been previously described (Voyle et al. in submission) .\nDESCRIPA was also a prospective, multi-center study. It was coordinated by the European AD Consortium and focused on collecting data from non-demented subjects with the aim of developing screening guidelines and clinical criteria for AD. Further details of this study can be found in Visser et al. [20] .\nADNI is a longitudinal cohort study aiming to validate the use of biomarkers in AD clinical trials and diagnosis. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI study was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

Details of the data processing are briefly outlined below.\nThe cohorts were subject to quality control and imputation separately, as described in Coleman et al. [24] . In short, the data was filtered to ensure a minor allele frequency of greater than 5% for all SNPs before removal of rare variants and subjects with high levels of missing data. SNPs that differed significantly (p < 0.00001) from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were removed. The data was pruned for SNPs in linkage disequilibrium and for genetically similar individuals.

An individuals APOE genotype was coded as 1 if at least one 4 allele was present and 0 otherwise. Models were also built using only the demographic variables age, gender, and APOE genotype, for comparison. Throughout this study these models are referred to as 'basic models'.\nTwo analyses were performed to study these three endpoints of interest:\n1. PGRS: Models were built in ADNI 1 data (A\u2424 and tau N = 363; Total CSF burden N = 244) and tested in data from EDAR and DESCRIPA (A\u2424 and tau N = 250; Total CSF burden N = 135) and The sample sizes of each dataset used in these analyses are given in Table 1 . All models including a PGRS co-varied for the first three genetic principal components to account for population structure. The predictive ability of each model was quantified using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [27] [28] [29] .\nPGRS PGRS were created within each cohort using PRSice [30] . Effect sizes from stage 1 of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) case/control GWAS were used as the weights to generate the risk score [9] . We used 0.5 as the pvalue threshold for inclusion in the PGRS. This threshold showed the most significant association with case/control diagnosis in the large IGAP PGRS study [31] . The genetic region coding for APOE was removed from all scores and included as a separate covariate due to its strong influence. The PGRS was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, per cohort. This aims to account for the scores including different SNPs due to availability on the different SNP chips. It is important to note that APOE genotype is included as a covariate in modeling and not in the PGRS. Therefore, the PGRS is only exploring variation above and beyond APOE. This is different to the focus of the IGAP PGRS study which included APOE within the PGRS [31] . We have chosen this approach to investigate whether information from a SNP chip adds anything above APOE. Furthermore, generally, APOE is not well measured on SNP chips so APOE genotype is determined by targeted genotyping.\nThe datasets used for model testing (EDAR and DESCRIPA) were not included in the IGAP study. Furthermore, although some samples from ADNI were included in IGAP, the majority were only included in the training, not testing, stages.

See Table 5 for full results."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate blood biomarkers that may be predictive of AD pathologies (A\u2424 and tau). We modeled levels of A\u2424 and tau in CSF using a PGRS and a sub-study considered measurements of tau in blood plasma. We also studied a total CSF burden endpoint for individuals with abnormal tau and A\u2424, or normal tau and A\u2424. The results shown here highlight that a case/control PGRS and plasma tau do not substantially outperform demographics (age, gender) and APOE genotype. The highest model accuracies were seen when modeling the total CSF burden phenotype.\nSeveral studies have focused on identification of blood biomarkers of A\u2424 [17, 32, 33] . However, few have achieved successful replication. The hypothesis tested in this study was that a combined tau and A\u2424 endpoint would be closer to an AD case/control phenotype and consequently easier to predict. This study supports this hypothesis, although the improvements in accuracy are minimal. Further, this accuracy of prediction was achieved by the basic model and the two blood biomarkers investigated, a case/control PGRS and plasma tau, did not improve model accuracy in the majority of cases. Firstly, this could be explained by the PGRS being trained on a case/control endpoint. As individuals can often be misdiagnosed with AD the case/control phenotype can be misleading. GWAS are beginning to be large enough to detect risk SNPs associated with A\u2424 and tau. When sample sizes in these studies increase further they should be used to train PGRS. Intuitively, they may achieve improved predictive ability than models based on a case/control PGRS. Furthermore, due to the relatively small sample size of this study, the PGRS only utilizes common variation excluding loci such as TREM2. As larger studies become available the inclusion of such rarer variants in genetic risk scoring should be considered.\nIn the sub-study, it is interesting that plasma tau is no more predictive of CSF tau than age, gender, and APOE genotype. Furthermore, plasma tau achieves a higher accuracy when modeling CSF A\u2424. The lack of ability to predict CSF tau indicates the need for further assay development to detect still more sensitive measurements. Furthermore, research into the permeability of the blood-brain barrier will help theorize as to how much pathology signal from the brain and CSF is likely to be seen in blood.\nThis study has shown the importance of replication in independent datasets; models that perform well in training data often do not replicate. It is particularly important to test replicability when standardized protocols for assays do not exist [34] . For example, this analysis highlights the difference between EDAR, DESCRIPA, and ADNI in the assays and cut-offs used to define high and low pathology burden. The CSF A\u2424 cut-off for high/ low burden ranges between 192 pg/ml and 550 pg/ml. Efforts are being made to standardize such metrics for future research [35, 36] .\nIt is important to point out the limitations of this study. Firstly, there are differences in sample collection methods, assays and data processing pipelines between ADNI 1, ADNI 2, EDAR, and DESCRIPA. In particular, the GWAS platforms used differ between the studies. The models in this study are trained in ADNI 1, which uses a slightly older Illumina chip (Human610-Quad) than ADNI 2, EDAR, and DESCRIPA. Although this means that the data from the other cohorts may not be fully utilized, it is unlikely to cause a lack of replicability. However, it is possible that some replicability is lost due to differences in sample collection methods and data processing. Furthermore, the use of the older SNP chip (Human610-Quad in ADNI 1) may have lead to reduced SNP content and sub-optimal imputation within the ADNI 1 cohort. It is also of note that the ADNI study was included in IGAP, effect sizes from which were used to create the PGRS. We believe that the benefit of a larger sample size for training outweighs any negative impact. Despite the use of well-characterized cohorts in this study, we must point out that the sample size considered is still relatively small. In future work, this could be addressed by the use of longitudinal aging studies instead of the case/control cohort studies used here.\nFinally, we have shown that the multi-modal approach used in the sub-study investigating plasma tau, did not improve predictive ability above the basic model. We used a simple additive model and more complex methods such as OmicKriging may be useful in this setting [37] . Furthermore, the standard for measuring AD pathology, in particular A\u2424, is through PET imaging. Generally, PET imaging and CSF measurements are used interchangeably but any results should be replicated using imaging based outcomes. In combination with a pathological endpoint more closely related to an AD phenotype, such as the total CSF burden used here, the suggestions presented in this discussion could improve the predictive ability of proposed markers of A\u2424 and tau."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study has used data from the EDAR, DESCRIPA, and ADNI cohorts to investigate blood markers of A\u2424 and tau. We see that a case/control PGRS is no more predictive of pathology than age, gender, and APOE genotype. A sub-study shows that model accuracy is not improved by the addition of plasma tau measurements. These results emphasize that the search for predictive factors of A\u2424 and tau, above and beyond demographic and APOE information, is still ongoing. Better understanding of AD risk alleles, development of more sensitive assays, and studies of larger sample size are three avenues that may provide such factors. However, the clinical utility of possible predictors of brain A\u2424 and tau must also be investigated. "}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": ""}]
