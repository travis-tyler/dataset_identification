The MCR provides passage for $20 billon of trade as well as supports the local economy in Astoria, OR, and the numerous ports located along the Columbia River in both Oregon and Washington. It is important that the navigational channel is maintained to allow the 42 million tons of annual cargo to pass through the inlet and support more than 40,000 tradedependent jobs (USACE, 2012). This necessity has required the MCR to be a heavily engineered inlet with a convergent jetty system and the need to dredge three to five million cubic meters of sediment annually (J. Gailani et al., 2019). The navigational channel is over-dredged each year by 1.5 m to account for the inability to dredge in the winter due to the energetic conditions (Moritz et al., 2007). Tidal inlets, in general, are a challenging setting to make observations due to high flowrates, sediment transport, and morphological change (Elias et al., 2012). The MCR is subject to large waves, strong currents, and variable bathymetry or depth; these characteristics make it a challenging environment to predict and maintain. Bathymetry estimation at tidal inlets is a topic of interest for coastal scientists and engineers as tidal inlets are subject to a large amount of morphodynamic change (Barnard et al., 2012). Having a method to provide reliable bathymetric estimates using remote sensing technology could provide valuable information that would show almost real-time bathymetric change after the annual dredging is complete and provide insight into how the channel changes throughout the year. The value of bathymetry estimation using remote sensing has been acknowledged by the military, as well, as surveys of navigational inlets in restricted areas are often impossible to achieve (Moghimi et al., 2016). Assimilating information about waves or currents, or both, for bathymetric estimation has shown promising results in riverine, nearshore, and tidal inlet applications. Bathymetry estimation is possible by assimilating both surface currents and wave characteristics that are observed via in situ measurements or remote sensing techniques. For example, Landon et al. (2014) developed bathymetry estimates by assimilating velocity observations collected from surface drifters in the Kootenai River. Wilson et al. (2014) showed the ability to improve nearshore bathymetry estimates by assimilating in situ and remote sensing observations of frequencywavenumber pairs and alongshore currents. Moghimi et al. (2016) assimilated both wave and surface current information to improve bathymetry estimates at tidal inlets. These aforementioned studies are based on an ensemble-based data assimilation framework presented by Wilson et al. (2010), and use a combination of in situ and remote sensing data. It is our intention to determine if assimilating solely remote sensing observations (from Synthetic-aperture radar [SAR imagery]) of wave kinematics can improve bathymetric estimates using a hybrid assimilation method similar to Wilson et al. (2010) and Wilson & \u00d6zkan-Haller (2012). The method presented here will not rely on an ensemble-based framework and will therefore, allow for computationally efficient and quick production of bathymetric estimations. Prior attempts have been made using remote sensing data; both SAR (Yu et al., 2016) and marine X-band radar (Honegger et al., 2020;Zuckerman & Anderson, 2018) to obtain estimates of bathymetry at tidal inlets. Direct inversion of the dispersion relationship using X-band radar and the cBathy algorithm (Holman et al., 2013;Plant et al., 2008) was completed by Honegger et al ( , 2020 at the MCR and New River Inlet, NC. Bathymetry estimates at the MCR generated a root-meansquared-error (RMSE) of 4.20 m in the river mouth when compared to the same true bathymetry (Akan et al., 2018) used in this study. Herein we will be using solely satellite based remote sensing data and inverting the dispersion relationship to generate our bathymetric estimates at the MCR. In linear wave theory, the dispersion relation dictates how the frequency and wavenumber of a wave component are related to the bathymetry and currents at a particular location. This relationship can be inverted using data assimilation methodologies to estimate a depth using estimated or observed values of angular frequency, wavenumber, wave direction, and currents. We will show how we have assimilated observations derived from SAR imagery to estimate bathymetry using weighted least squares with a Bayesian estimation to minimize the error between observed wavenumbers and those predicted by a numerical model. Our goals are to determine if SAR observations can be assimilated to estimate a bathymetry that qualitatively reproduces the location and depths of the bathymetric features in the actual bathymetry, explore sensitivity of variations in assimilated frequency, and to establish limitations of this method and SAR observations used for bathymetry inversion. , and E) exist and can be seen in Figure 1 along with the current deep water disposal site ODMDS (Site F). Sites A and B are of importance for this study as they are existing bathymetry features that can be used to assess the performance of the inversion method. ODMDS (Site A) is located to the southwest of the tip of the South Jetty; disposal at site A has not taken place since 1994 due to reports that the mound was causing waves to steepen, amplify and break in the vicinity of the channel (J. Z. Gailani et al., 2003). It was estimated in 1995 that the disposal mound at site A will be dispersed outside of the area boundaries in approximately 20-40 years' time. In contrast, ODMDS B (site B) is located almost directly west of the inlet and is not considered to be a dispersive site (J. Z. Gailani et al., 2003); it can clearly be seen in the bathymetry used for this study. Figure 1: The Mouth of the Columbia River outlets to the Pacific Ocean between two rubble-mound jetties, the study area features multiple shoals, spits, and dredge material disposal sites The bathymetry at the Mouth of the Columbia River is characterized by a few key features that can be seen in Figure 1; the navigational channel, Peacock Spit, Clatsop spit, and ODMDS Site A and B. The navigational channel begins with a northwestern trajectory as it traverses the Lower Columbia River Estuary. The channel then widens and transitions to the MCR navigational channel when it reaches Sand Island. The channel points west from Jetty A before taking on a southwestern direction and exiting the inlet between the north and south jetties. Peacock Spit is located on the Washington side of the inlet and abuts the north jetty and extends from Benson beach in the offshore direction. Clatsop Spit is located on the Oregon side of the inlet and follows along the south jetty while extending into the southern portion of the channel. ODMDS A and B are historical disposal sites located southwest of the tip of the south jetty and due west of the inlet mouth respectively; the disposal sites are distinct features that diverge from the surrounding bathymetry. We will qualitatively evaluate the depth and extent of these features within the bathymetry estimates, and we will use these key features to gauge the performance of the estimate. The wave climate of the Pacific Northwest is severe and associated with large wave heights and long period swells generated by large fetch areas in the North Pacific (Tillotson & Komar, 1997). The wave climate at the Columbia River inlet varies with season, typically in the winter time the inlet experiences waves with an average height of 3 meters, 12 to 13 second periods, and a wave approach direction of west-southwest. In the summer the average wave height is closer to 1.2 meters, with an average period of 8 seconds, and an approach direction from the west-northwest (Ruggiero et al., 2005). The Columbia River watershed includes parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah for a total drainage area of approximately 668,000 km 2 . Mean monthly river discharge varies from 3,500 to 9,600 m 3 /s throughout the year, and tidal velocities range from 1 m/s during flood to 2 m/s during ebb conditions (Akan et al., 2017). A plume generated by the river outflow extends to the continental shelf and is responsible for impacts to the local salinity, temperature distribution, and algae blooms (Akan et al., 2017). It has been shown that the tidal currents at the MCR impact the waves (Gonzalez et al., 1985) and during ebb tides can increase the wave height by a factor of two (Elias et al., 2012). These strong wave-current interactions provide challenging conditions for observations and can often force wave breaking to happen at the mouth of the inlet."}, {"section_title": "Model Description", "text": "The coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave-sediment transport (COAWST) modeling system (Warner et al., 2010) applied by Akan et al. (2017) was used to generate the hydrodynamic characteristics necessary to complete the bathymetric inversion. The COAWST model includes a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) (Shchepetkin & McWilliams, 2003 one-way coupled to a Simulated Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) (Booij et al., 1999). Only the wave and current components of COAWST model were used. The work herein is primarily based on the validated simulations of Akan et al. (2017). The model run duration was updated to encompass the period of time during which SAR observations took place. Model runs were completed for two bathymetric configurations; an actual observed (true) bathymetry, and a simplistic first guess (prior) bathymetry. The true bathymetry is described in Akan el al., (2018), and prior bathymetry was generated by spatially smoothing the true bathymetry. A smoothing length scale was applied to a rectangular area that covered the inlet and the surrounding area offshore of the inlet. The   wavelengths of these waves can be estimated by directly measuring the distance between wave peaks using a Fourier transform method. A SAR image has an associated dwell time, which is the period of time it takes for the SAR to capture the image as it travels past the target image location. Hence, it is possible to estimate the rate at which the waves are traveling and therefore their period. The dwell time for an observation point is often only 1-2 second and this is a significantly shorter time period when compared to the average period of waves at the MCR of 8 -14 seconds. Therefore, the estimated frequency can have a large amount of error associated with it due to the SAR only observing the wave traveling over a relatively short distance during the image capture. Wavenumber observations are generated by moving a small sample window across the image and completing a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to locate the spectral energy peaks. This process was completed by Dr. Christopher Wackerman, and the data was provided for assimilation. For further information regarding SAR observations of ocean waves it is recommend that the reader reviews Lyzenga (1988). Generating wave characteristics from SAR images is limited if the Fourier transform window does not encompass any wave modulations, breaking waves are present, or if image noise is present. The peak spectral signal to noise ratio (SNR) was used as a metric to determine the quality of wavenumber observations by the SAR. Along with the wavenumber-frequency pairs, the following additional data was included with the observational data set; spectral energy, SNR, latitude, and longitude. For each FFT window a spatial spectrum is generated by averaging the intensity of each FFT. Using these spatial spectra an overall spectral peak value can be identified for the entire image. To define a local peak a scale factor is used; the scale factor is a cut-off value established as ninety percent of the overall maximum spectral peak value. At each observation point the scale factor allowed for the wavenumber-frequency pair that was associated with the largest spectral value to be selected for assimilation. This approach resulted in a single wavenumber-frequency pair at each spatial data point for a majority of the time. In the event that more than one pair was associated with a point, the pair with the largest SNR was selected for assimilation. The SAR observations generate wavenumber component (k x and k y) values, and these values are defined with the following orientation in the SAR image. k x is positive to the right and k y is positive when pointed towards the bottom of the image. The SAR sensor has a look direction that is reported relative to degrees from true North. The SAR-observed wave frequency has a significant amount of associated noise and it was determined that the observed frequency would not be suitable for use in the assimilation (C. Wackerman, Naval Research Laboratory, 2019, personal communication). This was confirmed in trial assimilations where the SAR observed wavenumber-frequency pairs were used and an inverted bathymetry was produced that was unrealistic and showed little similarity to the true bathymetry. To successfully invert the bathymetry by assimilating the SAR wavenumber observations, it will be necessary to estimate the correct wave frequency for each observation."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Conditions", "text": "It is important to understand the environmental conditions at the Mouth of Columbia River during each image collection as these provide background information about the conditions that are impacting the wave kinematics and will impact the assimilation results. Environmental conditions are observed by a buoy located 20 nautical miles offshore of the MCR, the buoy is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NOAA buoy 46029 is located in 134 meters of water depth and records detailed wave and atmospheric conditions including but not limited to; wave height, wave direction, wave period, wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure. The buoy also produces spectral wave data that will be used in the wave direction filtering process discussed later on. An estimation of surface currents and water levels during each SAR image collection can be obtained using the ROMS component of the COAWST model. The ROMS model results are preferable to the observations of the NOAA tide gauge located in Astoria, OR because the tide gauge is approximately 8 km upriver from the MCR and therefore allows for a tidal lag to be present. Using the observations from the offshore buoy and the ROMS-predicted currents and water levels, we can obtain an overall idea of the environmental conditions that were present during the SAR image capture.    The June 08, 2013 02:14:14 UTC image was collected during a slack tide just prior to a flood tide. Mild currents are predicted with a velocity range between the jetties of 1 to 1.5 m/s. The energy spectrum from the buoy shows a bimodal spectrum at both the 2:00 UTC and 3:00 UTC measurements. The spectrum has a low frequency peak of 0.0525 Hz and a higher frequency peak of 0.12 Hz. Air pressure is falling, and wind speeds are constant during the SAR image capture time.

The covariance matrices described with this method follow a Gaussian parametric form where x and y are the coordinates of observation or model points. L x , and L y are length scales for the respective coordinates and \u03c3 is the amplitude of vertical variance for the error of the prior bathymetry."}, {"section_title": "Computation of Covariance Matrices in Observational Domain", "text": "Computing covariance matrices for the model domain has limitations due to the large number of model points and subsequent large covariance matrices. To increase computational efficiency and reduce storage requirements, we can interpolate the N model points to the M observation point grid, thereby simplifying the multiplication of covariance matrices. For this derivation we will redefine ! = \u0413 , and then identify two terms from equation (2) that will be simplified. # 5\u04136 will be identified as term 1 and 5\u04136# 5\u04136 will be term 2. We are able to recognize that \u0413 in observational space (\u0413 o ) is a diagonal matrix; this is because we are assuming a slowly varying bathymetry and therefore the dispersion relationship is a local condition. Any variations in depth will only impact the wavenumber at that same observation point because there is no sensitivity to any other location. Therefore, to specify the covariance matrix in observational space we need only define a vector \u0413 7 = 89 8 corresponding to the sensitivity at the observation points, and then \u0413 = :;<= \u0413 > where \u0413 o is an M x M diagonal matrix. With the model points interpolated on the observational grid and using the Gaussian parametric form shown in equation 3it is possible to then calculate the covariance matrix between the depth at the observation points and the depth at the model grid points (C oh ). With that definition, term 1 evaluated in observational space can be written as follows: A similar simplification can be applied to term 2 of equation 2, by defining C oo as an M x M covariance matrix between the depths at the observation points; it is calculated using the same Gaussian parametric form as equation 3. Term 2 can then be written as \u0413# \u0413 = :;<= \u0413 7 # :;<= \u0413 7 The simplified terms can now be substituted back into equations (2), and the final equation for the updated bathymetry estimate is as follows: \u210e = \u210e + # :;<= \u0413 7 :;<= \u0413 7 # :;<= \u0413 7 + # \u210e \u2212 The MATLAB code using the bathymetry inversion discussed above can be found in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "Wave Direction Filtering", "text": "It is common for the MCR to experience swells arriving from both the northwest and southwest. Such bidirectional conditions were sometimes present in the SAR observations; these conditions are clearly seen in the May 21 st image. The wave directions observed by the SAR can be determined by finding the direction of the kx/ky vector and relating it to the sensor look direction and how the look direction relates to true north. As we will see in Figure 8, the observations can clearly be grouped by direction. An observed wavenumber now has a known wave direction but still will need to be associated with a frequency in order to be useful for the assimilation procedure. The directional energy spectrum produced by the NOAA buoy can be utilized to gain an understanding of the frequency associated with each directional wave component. The directional spectrum therefore allows us to assign a frequency to a directional component of the waves arriving at the MCR. The SAR and NOAA buoy are observing the same waves and we can use wave direction to relate the SAR observed wavenumber and the NOAA buoy observed relative angular frequencies. Therefore, the results of this wave direction filtering process can be seen in Figure 7 & 8, and the process will be shown for the May 21 st image. A SNR threshold of 10 was used for all observations in the wave direction filtering to reduce the amount of low quality points being assimilated. The May 21 st image was the image best suited for the wave direction filter as it had a bimodal spectrum and two distinct wave components-one arriving from the southwest and the other from the northwest. The crisscross wave pattern from these two wave trains arriving from opposing directions can clearly be seen in the SAR image. These wave components can be seen in the wavenumber observations when they are plotted with respect to wave direction. The lower wavenumber cluster shown in red in Figure 8 is associated with waves arriving from the southwest with a peak frequency of 0.0625 Hz. This frequency corresponds to the spectral peak located from 189\u02da to 265\u02da in the directional spectrum shown in Figure 7. The higher wavenumber group shown in blue corresponds to the wave group arriving from the northwest with a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Again, this can be confirmed by the spectral peak arriving from 280\u02da to 340\u02da in Figure 7."}, {"section_title": "General Application of Wave Direction Filter", "text": "To apply the wave direction filter to additional SAR images, we will set a few criteria based on the results of the wave direction filtering of the May 21 st image. SAR observations will be clustered into two distinct regions; designated as the northwest and southwest regions. The northwest region is associated with observations that arrive from 250\u02da to 320\u02da and have a wavenumber between 0.035 and 0.1 rad/m. This region captures observations of wave components arriving at the MCR from northwest. Observations in this region can be seen for all the images analyzed in this study. The southwest region includes observations arriving from 200\u02da to 250\u02da that have a wavenumber in the range of 0.022 to 0.05 rad/m. Occasionally there is energy observed in the southwest region, most prevalently in the May 21 st and June 8 th observations. The longer waves associated with the southwest region are often generated by a coastal jet that extends along the Oregon coast (Ellenson & \u00d6zkan-Haller, 2018). It should be acknowledged that the observations with very low wavenumbers (<0.02 rad/m) that follow the scalloped pattern were determined to be low quality data and were not assimilated in the inversion. These data points had low SNR and would have wavelengths beyond those of interest here. To retain the highest quality and most realistic observations, all data outside of the northwest and southwest regions was disregarded. When applying the wave direction filter regions to other SAR images there was a discernible division of the observation in the northwest region. When the location of each cluster of wavenumber observations in the region is explored, as shown in Figure 9 for the June 8 th image, it is visible that data points in the lower portion of the northwest region are located south of the south jetty. We recognize that the two separate clusters of observations in the northwest cluster are actually the same wave components. The reason for the separation between the two clusters is due to refraction around the south jetty. The division of the wavenumber observations arriving from the northwest was a common occurrence in additional SAR images. When a frequency is being assigned to each cluster of wavenumber observations, it is important to recognize that the wave components arriving from the northwest should be assigned a single frequency as a group.

We will review the results through both a qualitative and quantitative lens to provide an insight to how the method is estimating the larger scale bathymetric patterns as well as the smaller, more minute features. For a qualitative analysis, we will visually review the posterior bathymetry and comment on how the method has predicted the larger features; ODMDS A & B, the navigational channel, Clatsop Spit, and Peacock Spit. Overall patterns of underestimation or overestimation of depth will also be discussed. To quantify the performance of the bathymetry estimation we will use rootmean-square error (RMSE) and bias across three transects, as well as the location and depth of the MCR navigational channel along a transect. The three transects were selected to provide a detailed view of the estimated bathymetry and how the prior bathymetry was updated with respect to the key features. Transect A-A, B-B, and C-C can be seen in Figure 12 and have the following characteristics; A-A follows the MCR navigational channel alignment as it crosses the domain, B-B is a north-south transect seaward of the jetties that intersects Peacock Spit before arcing south and crossing the navigational channel, and C-C is a north-south transect that begins at the shoreward end of the north jetty then crosses the navigational channel and Clatsop Spit and terminates at the south jetty. Transect C-C provides comparison of the depth and shape of the navigational channel for the estimated bathymetries."}, {"section_title": "Verification with Model-Derived Data", "text": "Prior to assimilating the SAR observations, model-derived data was assimilated to evaluate the skill of the inversion method as well as to set a baseline for performance. Model-derived data consisted of calculated output fields sampled at locations consistent with SAR observations. In our case, the COAWST model was run using the true bathymetry as an input, to provide the surface wave properties required for assimilations. The model-calculated fields were sampled using the SAR observation locations and grid spacing. The observation values were calculated by interpolating the velocity components, wave direction, and true depth at the SAR observation locations. The dispersion relationship including current influences was used to solve for wavenumber using the interpolated data and the wave frequency as observed by NOAA buoy 46029. An assumption is being made that the model-derived observations are associated with only a single component that corresponds with the NOAA buoy frequency. Currents and wave direction from the prior bathymetry model were used for the inversion, as is standard for all the completed inversions discussed herein. The inversion results using the model-derived data showed that the model had skill and could accurately correct the prior bathymetry to generate features; specifically the navigational channel, Peacock Spit, Clatsop Spit, and ODMDS A. These results can be seen in Figures 11 & 12. Depth estimations at Peacock Spit were underestimated and created a bathymetry that is shallower than the true depth (see Figure 12e). It should be noted that there is limited spatial coverage of observation points to assimilate in the area of Peacock Spit and therefore the posterior bathymetry did not show significant improvement in the northern portion (x > 4,000 m) of transect B-B in Figure 12e. The inversion method accurately locates the navigational channel, as can be seen in the alongshore transects in Figures 12e & 12f; however, the method underestimates the true depth of the channel. The extent and shape of Clatsop Spit is well-estimated by the model; the depth however, is underestimated when compared with the true bathymetry (see Figure 12f). Completing the assimilation and inversion using model-derived data not only provides a baseline, but it also shows the best performance that high quality observations, a highly-skilled model, and ample spatial coverage can produce.

The associated frequencies as observed by the NOAA buoy for the clusters of SAR observations were 0.1 Hz for the NW region and 0.0625 Hz for the SW region. Observations showing refraction around the south jetty seem to be minimal; however it is possible that the cluster below the NW region boundary could be evidence of some refraction. Overall the filtering captured high quality data judging by the SNR (not shown); a filter with a higher threshold than the SNR of 10 used here may be able to reduce the selection of lower quality observations. Figure 13 shows a cluster of observations with corresponding wavenumbers greater than 0.15 that could be associated with a higher frequency peak; however these points were not assimilated as they were outside of the distinct wave direction filter regions.  Figure   14 shows the overall domain in which the assimilation took place for the true bathymetry, prior bathymetry, and the posterior bathymetry. Figure 15 shows the three transects used for the quantitative analysis as well as the spatial coverage of the SAR observations. The posterior bathymetry when assimilating the May 21 st SAR observations predicts multiple features present at the MCR including the navigational channel, Peacock Spit, and Clatsop Spit. The predictions include a continuation of the navigational channel from jetty A towards the tip of the north jetty; the location of the channel is shifted south when compared to the true bathymetry. This can also be seen in the large discrepancy in depth at the beginning of transect A-A in Figure 15d. This discrepancy in the depth is most likely responsible for a large portion of the RMSE calculated for transect A-A. Transect B-B in Figure 15e shows that the depth and location of the navigational channel are well estimated. The western extent of Clatsop Spit is well estimated by the posterior bathymetry, however the width of the spit as you trace transect C-C north to south is narrower than that seen in the true bathymetry. Due to limited spatial coverage of observations around Peacock Spit, it is poorly represented in the posterior bathymetry; however for the portion of Peacock Spit where observations are available, the assimilation is attempting to reduce the depth. The portion of Peacock Spit that is overestimated in the northern extent of transect B-B (x = 2,000 m) was more closely examined and the overestimation was the result of a few low quality data points. A method to filter out these low quality observations could be beneficial in reducing the RMSE across the transect; however a method was not established for this study but could be an opportunity for future work.

Refraction of the wave component arriving from the northwest does not seem to be observed. Of note, there is a large amount of observation spread about the higher wave number range; greater than 0.1 rad/m. This image has the largest spread of observation with respect to wavenumber, when compared to the others. The frequencies associated with the NW & SW regions were 0.12 Hz and 0.0625 Hz respectively.        Figure 24d shows that the posterior transect has a similar shape to that of the true bathymetry, however the depth of the posterior is underestimated for a majority of the transect. We can also see that the center of the navigational channel is roughly estimated in transect C-C shown in Figure 24e, the depth however is over estimated and the location is shifted to the south. Clatsop spit in the posterior bathymetry is estimated to be approximately five meters shallower than that of the true bathymetry, the north-south extent of spit is underestimated and reduced from that of the prior bathymetry. For this assimilation the spatial coverage of the observation points over Peacock Spit is good, however the assimilation produces many holes and shoals that are not consistent with the true bathymetry. This is confirmed in transect B-B which shows little resemblance to the true bathymetry along the northern extent of transect B-B. ODMDS A is estimated for the June 8 th image; however it is connected to the bar like feature running north-south in front of the inlet.

In this section we will explore how this uncertainty manifests itself in the results. Earlier, we used model-derived data to verify the method's skill and saw the detailed bathymetry that could be estimated using so called \"perfect\" or modelderived observations. We will be developing a different kind of twin experiment, where we will assemble a very specific hybrid data set to help us understand the manifestation of frequency uncertainty in the inversion. This data set is termed \"hybrid\" because it is using a combination of the SAR observations and model generated fields. The model-derived data set discussed in section 3.1 was constructed by using a single frequency and calculating a wavenumber using model outputs. In contrast, the hybrid data set discussed here was fashioned by using the SAR observed wavenumber, SAR observed wave directions, the true depth at the observation point, and model generated currents over the true bathymetry. Using the dispersion relationship with currents and the previously mentioned inputs, we can calculate the relative angular frequency that corresponds to the known true depth at the observations points. To remove the uncertainty from limited spatial coverage of observations, all observation points were used in this assimilation. The SAR wavenumber observations with the largest SNR at each observation point were selected. The calculated \"true\" frequency can then be linked to the SAR observations and the assimilation can be completed. Figure 25 shows the calculated frequencies for the model-observation hybrid data; we can see the reference line on the y-axis for the frequencies of 0.0625 Hz and 0.1 Hz selected from the energy spectrum for the wave direction filtering method. The cluster of frequencies in Figure 25 clearly resembles those of NW and SW regions in the wave direction filtering method. The frequencies selected for the wave direction filter look to be an average value for the clusters of calculate true frequencies, therefore showing that the select frequencies are a good representation of the true frequencies. Figure 25: Model-Observation hybrid frequencies calculated using SAR observed wave direction and wave direction, true depth, and model generated currents; the reference lines on the y-axis are associated with the spectral peak frequencies used for the observations selected by the wave direction filtering process This exercise was conducted using the May 21 st and June 8 th SAR observations as they provided the highest quality observations of all provided images. To quantitatively explore the results using the model-observation hybrid frequencies, we can review the calculated RMSE and bias across the three transects used for analysis in chapter 3, results are shown in Table 3. Values that are an improvement over the prior bathymetry are highlighted in red. RMSE was improved across all transects except for transect B-B for the June 8 th observations. The RMSE across transect A-A was reduced from 7.66 m in the prior bathymetry to 3.7 m in the posterior bathymetry for the June 8 th image. When comparing the results using the hybrid data against the results of the model-derived observations, we can see that the model-derived observations performed better except for a minor improvement in transect C-C for June 8 th . The resulting posterior bathymetry showed many strong similarities to the true bathymetry including; the navigational channel, Clatsop Spit, and Peacock Spit. show that the location and depth of the navigational channel is accurately predicted. Clatsop Spit is accurately represented in the posterior bathymetry in extent and location quite well; however the method has again underestimated the depth. Outside of the jetties, in the offshore direction, many of the shoals were underestimated, which is a reoccurring trend when the calculated true frequency is used for the inversion of other observation dates.  : Results for assimilation using SAR observations and hybrid frequency for 21 May 2013 13:47:33 UTC (a) true bathymetry (b) Prior \"smoothed\" bathymetry and location of observations (c) posterior bathymetry and transects used for analysis (d) transect A-A (e) transect B-B (f) transect C-C Figure 28: Results for assimilation using SAR observation and hybrid frequency for 08 JUNE 2013 02:14:14 UTC (a) true bathymetry (b) Prior \"smoothed\" bathymetry and (c) posterior bathymetry Figure 29: Results for assimilation using SAR observations and hybrid frequency for 08 JUNE 2013 02:14:14 UTC (a) true bathymetry (b) Prior \"smoothed\" bathymetry and location of observations (c) posterior bathymetry and transects used for analysis (d) transect A-A (e) transect B-B (f) transect C-C"}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Assigned Frequency within Wave Direction Filter", "text": "Exploring the sensitivity of the assigned frequency to the assimilated wavenumber after it has been filtered by wave direction provided verification of the frequencies assimilated with the observations shown in Chapter 3. The May 21 st and June 8 th images were used for this analysis as they each contained the most observations in each wave direction filtering region. Only the results from the May 21 st SAR image are shown in Figure 30, however similar results were seen for the June 8 th observations. Each individual component (i.e. NW or SW region) associated with a frequency was used as the only observations assimilated in the inversion method while the frequency was varied across a range (0.0525 -0.0775 Hz for the SW region and 0.0875-0.11 Hz for the NW region); the RMSE was then calculated for the estimated bathymetry across the three analyses transects. The RMSE analysis showed that for both May 21st and June 8th, the frequency determined by the NOAA buoy spectra (or a frequency very close to it) produced the best inversion results in a majority of the transects. Figure 30a & 30b shows the transect RMSE for the NW and SW regions for the May 21 st image and illustrates that in transects A-A and B-B the RMSE is close to the minimum for the NOAA buoy observed frequency. Transect C-C shows an optimal frequency that is closer to 0.0925 Hz for the NW region. Figure   30c and 30d shows that the depth along transect A-A was underestimated with the NW and SW region observations. A possible explanation for this in regards to the SW region would be that majority of the SW region points are located outside of the jetty and to the south of the south jetty.

We briefly evaluated the 32 other SAR images for assimilation, and determine that the May 21 st and June 8 th provides some of the highest quality observations of all the images. However, an in-depth analysis was not conducted for the additional images, and as such, there is an opportunity for future analysis of the SAR observation data set."}, {"section_title": "Additional Observation filtering", "text": "In addition to the wave direction filter method, a few other methods were applied to try and identify the highest quality observations. These filters were often situational and could not be applied across all the observations. For example, the SNR threshold was increased to 50 for all the images and this slightly reduced the RMSE for the May 21 st and June 8 th images compared to the SNR threshold of 10 specified in Chapter 3. However, using a SNR threshold of 50 severely limited the number of observations available for assimilation along the navigational channel for May 29 th & 30 th . Results generated when a higher SNR threshold was used for the May 21 st assimilation can be seen in Figures 31 & 32. In this assimilation, the SNR threshold was 50 and the wave direction filter regions were reduced in size. These changes in the quality filter reduced the RMSE in Transect A-A from 7.8 m to 4.2 m, while the RMSE in transect B-B and C-C remained the same. It is our belief that a filter with a higher quality threshold could be used to improve the posterior bathymetry and that this could be an opportunity for future exploration and analysis. The posterior bathymetry often lacked a smooth transition between the numerous estimated holes and shoals; further analysis was conducted to understand the cause of these features. It was determined that often the hole or shoal was associated with a cluster of a few points that were associated with a wavenumber that was not consistent with what the model was estimating, thereby creating a deeper or shallower area about these few points. A technique to filter out these inconsistent points was not determined by this study but would be an opportunity for future work that could significantly reduce the RMSE of the posterior bathymetries estimated by the method.

Firstly, spatial resolutions of the SAR observations can limit the ability of the inversion method; the overall spatial resolution of the SAR observations can have a window size as small as 64 x 64 pixels; however, this window size might not be small enough to provide the resolution of observations to estimate smaller spatial features in the bathymetry. Additionally, applying a quality filter to the data, such as SNR can remove a majority of the points in key areas of interest such as the navigational channel between the jetties or ODMDS A. The presence of breaking waves in the SAR images led to a reduction of high quality observation points. This was especially noticeable in the May 29 th image where a majority of the observation points in the area between the north and south jetty had a low SNR; these points were therefore not reliable for assimilation. The breaking waves are noticeable in the SAR image as the brighter portions of the image between the jetties. Additional discussion with Dr. Chris Wackerman confirmed that the presence of breaking waves produces lower quality observations because the SAR images the breaking waves to appear stationary. In the event of future SAR observations for bathymetry inversion, this study provides the following recommendations based on the discussed results. The optimal conditions for observations would include a time period when there is limited wave breaking, multiple wave components are present with differing wave directions, and the arriving wave components contain waves with relatively longer wavelengths. In the case of the MCR and other inlets, observations collected during slack tide may reduce the impact of currents on wavelength and wave breaking."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5: Conclusion", "text": "In this research we created and tested a methodology that assimilated wave characteristics collected via synthetic-aperture radar and model-generated surface currents to produce bathymetry estimates at the Mouth of the Columbia River.

Implemented an assimilation method that allowed for covariance matrices to be computed in the observational domain, thereby reducing the computational storage and efficiency and no longer required the covariance matrices to be calculated in the model domain. 2. Verified that assimilating model-derived SAR wavenumber observations and a single absolute angular frequency can produce an estimate bathymetry with a reduced RMSE when compared to a prior \"best-guess\" bathymetry. 3. Generated wavenumber-frequency pairs that reproduced many of the large scale features present in the true bathymetry by filtering wavenumber observations using wave direction and the frequency as measured by the NOAA buoy. 4. Produced posterior bathymetries that when observation conditions were favorable, provided a sense of the MCR navigational Channel, Peacock Spit, Clatsop Spit, and ODMDS A. RMSE was reduced across some of the analysis transect that were located along the key bathymetry features. 5. Explored the uncertainty related to assigning an absolute angular frequency to a wavenumber observation and how this uncertainty manifests itself as RMSE in the estimated posterior bathymetry.
