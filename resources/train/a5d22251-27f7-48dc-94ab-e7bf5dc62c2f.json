In particular, brain metabolism which can be measured by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has been regarded as a key biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders. Identifying brain metabolic topography associated with aging could give insight into the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline and help differentiate normal aging from neurodegenerative disorders.\nAlthough the relationship between cerebral glucose metabolism and aging has been repeatedly studied, there has been controversy about which brain regions show significant age-related metabolic decline (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Individual genetic background and healthy status as well as underlying brain disease gives rise to the individual variability in age-related metabolic change (7, 8) . Due to this variability, we have not been able to predict individual aged brain understandably. Therefore, instead of consideration of individual variability, previous studies have focused on the trend of overall aging changes using cross-sectional imaging data with statistical models such as linear regression. Even though this statistical analysis could provide overall brain metabolic changes, it was difficult to individually apply to estimate how far a given subject's brain metabolism is from the normal population at the same age. This individual evaluation of brain metabolism can be extended to the differentiation between normal and abnormal aging process. It requires normal population distribution database of all ages, however, it has been challenging to build a database of the population distribution of normal brain metabolism for each age from the cross-sectional data with subjects of various age distribution.\nHere, we develop a model for predicting future brain metabolic topography by generating brain PET image.\nIn this study, we utilize variational autoencoder (VAE), a type of unsupervised learning methods, which can generate images from some representations (VAE) (9) . We applied it to predicting FDG brain PET at different ages. Each FDG PET image combined with the subject's current age information was represented by lowdimensional features and then PET images corresponding different ages were generated. We also generated population distribution data of normal brain metabolic topography at different ages, which represented variability om individual metabolic activity at each age. As an application of our approach to discovering factors that potentially affect brain aging, we further investigated whether APOE4 status impacted on the age-related metabolic change by using a generative model that uses age and APOE4 information."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Prediction of future brain metabolic change", "text": "The VAE-based model was designed to represent FDG PET images and corresponding subjects' age to latent features (Fig. 1A) . The posterior part of this model, a generator component, could produce PET images from any values of the latent features and age information. The model was trained by baseline PET images of 393 cognitively normal subjects.\nTo generate future brain PET images, we firstly obtained latent features of a subject's baseline PET image using the encoder. We assumed that these were not changed according to aging as characteristic individual features. The features of a subject were entered into the generator with any age, which could generate the subject's virtual brain PET at different ages (Fig. 1B) . The model was tested by cognitively healthy subjects who underwent both baseline and follow-up PET. Follow-up PET scans were obtained for 26 subjects after 4 years from baseline and for 11 subjects after 5 years. Predicted metabolic change was compared with corresponding real metabolic change computed by follow-up PET data. Each predicted future brain PET and real follow-up PET was subtracted by corresponding baseline PET for the comparison (Fig. 1C) . As a result, delta maps, the future brain PET subtracted by baseline, obtained from real follow-up PET showed individual variability.\nCorresponding predicted future brain PET also showed those variable patterns ( Fig. 1D) . A subject showed prominently decreased metabolism in the cerebral cortices, while another showed relatively increased metabolism in the frontal cortex ( Fig. 1D) . The delta map obtained by real follow-up was positively correlated with that obtained by prediction ( fig. S1 ).\nTo compare predicted future brain PET and real follow-up PET quantitatively, mean metabolic changes of 116 predefined brain regions across all subjects were calculated. Averaged predicted changes in regional metabolism was significantly correlated with the real changes obtained by real follow-up data (r= 0.59, p < 0.001 and r=0.59, p < 0.001 for 4-year and 5-year follow-up, respectively; Fig. 2A and B) . Bland-Altman plot showed the difference between predicted and real regional metabolic activities ( Fig. 2C and D) . The 95% confidence interval of the prediction error of regional metabolic activity was -0.027 -0.027 for 4-year follow-up and -0.027 -0.048 for 5-year follow-up. In addition, individually predicted and real metabolic changes were compared. To show how individual prediction of metabolic change was similar with the real change, voxelwise correlations of individual delta maps obtained by follow-up and prediction were calculated. We could find a trend of high correlation between the two delta maps of same subject though the prediction of metabolic change was failed in some subjects ( fig. S2) . The similarity between predicted and real metabolic change was not significantly affected by subjects' age, gender, follow-up diagnosis, APOE4 and baseline mini-mental state examination."}, {"section_title": "Generating overall brain metabolism aging movie", "text": "We applied our model to the assessment of overall regional metabolic changes.

Thus, it has been hard to obtain population distribution of normal brain at each age. Randomly resampled latent features could generate population distribution of regional brain metabolic activity for all ages (Fig. 4A) . Generated brain PET data from resampled latent features provide the variety of regional metabolic activity. Histograms of each brain region at different ages were drawn ( Fig. 4B) . As aforementioned representative brain metabolic changes, histograms of posterior cingulate and caudate showed a trend of left shifting according to aging. Distribution of overall aging patterns of regional metabolism was also exhibited ( Fig. 4C, fig. S4 ). Dotted lines represent 95% confidence intervals of regional metabolic activity.\nWe found individual variability in regional brain metabolism at different ages. The individual variability was determined by the distribution of latent features. To show how each latent feature affects brain metabolism, PET images were generated by changing latent features. Brain metabolic patterns were changed according to latent features as shown in Fig. 5 . As an example, increased feature 1 was associated with decreased brain metabolism in the posterior temporal and occipital cortices and increased feature 2 was associated with increased frontal metabolism."}, {"section_title": "APOE4 status and age-related metabolic change", "text": "Because clinical variables affect age-related metabolic change and its variability, we further investigated whether APOE4 status impacts on metabolic changing patterns. Another VAE model was trained using two conditions, age and APOE4 status ( Fig. 6A) . This model can generate virtual brain PET images according to the age and APOE4 status. Thus, age-related metabolic change according to APOE4 can be estimated by inputting APOE4 positive and negative states, respectively ( Fig. 6A) . We identified that APOE4 could affect variability of age-related metabolic change. The FDG PET images generated by average latent features and APOE4 positive and negative status at different ages were subtracted by generated PET of the age of 50 ( Fig. 6B) . We found that metabolic decline in occipital lobe was faster in APOE4 carriers. Distribution of regional metabolism according to APOE4 status was estimated ( Fig. 6C) . Using distribution of metabolic difference between brain metabolism generated by APOE4 status, the significance of difference in regional metabolism was estimated (fig. S5).\nRegional metabolic activity of the calcarine and lingual cortex was significantly higher in APOE4 carrier than APOE4 noncarrier before 60, while that of the hippocampus and amygdala was significantly lower in APOE4 carrier at 50 ( Fig. 6D) . Regional metabolic activity of posterior cingulate, precuneus and caudate, where rapid age-related metabolic decline was found, did not show significant difference in accordance with APOE4 status.\nMetabolic change in APOE4 carriers and noncarriers of all brain regions was represented with 95% confidence intervals ( fig. S6 ). "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we predicted aging of brain metabolic topography by using a generative model. Brain metabolic changes are highly variable as aging process and cognitive changes are affected by several individual factors. Our model aimed at generating PET images according to the age trained by cross-sectional PET image data combined with different ages. The model could provide predicted future metabolic decline and validated by real follow-up data. Our results estimate population distribution of normal brain metabolism at each age. This approach was extended to investigate the effect of APOE4 status on the variability of regional brain metabolism at different ages.\nOur generative model could find population distribution of brain metabolic topography for each age as well as predict age-related metabolic change. Cognitive aging and age-related functional decrease is accompanied by increased individual variability (10) . This individual variability is affected by several factors including life experience, genetic backgrounds and susceptibility to neuropathology (11) . Furthermore, cognitive variability in individuals across time tends to occur mainly after the age of 60 (12) . Increased individual variability in aging has been supported by several functional neuroimaging studies (13) (14) (15) . Nonetheless, age-related brain metabolism change has been briefly estimated by observing overall correlation between age and metabolism (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . This previous approach could not consider individual variability in age-related metabolism (10, 16) .\nFurthermore, it has been difficult to estimate age-dependent normal population distribution of brain image data as the data consist of subjects with different ages. A conventional linear regression model based on overall metabolic changes estimated by all baseline scans failed to estimate personal variability in metabolic decline patterns ( fig. S7) . That was because the model only estimated same decline patterns for all subjects by calculating voxelwise linear regression based on the population. According to our model, the variability of brain metabolism was represented by the latent features. They determine age-related metabolism patterns because generator used only the latent features and age as inputs. In other words, latent features could reflect individual factors which affect the variability in metabolic topography.\nEach latent feature represented specific metabolic topography patterns which could be indirectly identified by generating images according to different feature values as shown in Fig. 5 . In this regard, random resampling of the latent features generated variable brain metabolic topography, which could be used for estimating population distribution. Our result, population distribution of brain metabolism at each age can be applied to quantitatively define regional abnormality in individuals. Using this distribution, we can define how far a given individual brain PET is from the normal population. Thus, this distribution may help to develop quantitative biomarker which represents abnormal aging process of individual brain metabolism.\nOur model could predict regional patterns of individual future brain metabolic change, while future prediction of metabolic change was incorrect in quite a few cases. As shown in fig. S2 , the predicted delta maps were not correlated with real delta maps in individuals at right-lower portions of the matrix. Nonetheless, overall regional metabolic changes obtained by the prediction were highly correlated with those of real follow-up data as shown in Fig. 2 . That was because VAE eventually extracted age-associated metabolic topography patterns from overall variation of brain metabolism in the training samples. In other words, because of the high variability in age-related brain metabolic changes, VAE-based model generated future brain PET image by approximating global age-related patterns of training samples. It is closely related to the limitation of VAE which tends to generate averaged and blurry images and lack of variety in generated images (17) . In addition, not only aging but several cognitive, healthy and nutritional factors affect brain metabolic patterns (18, 19) .\nBecause of the multiple factors affecting brain metabolism, accurate individual prediction is substantially difficult. In this study, we simply assumed that other factors of future brain PET except age are unchanged. As multiple factors could determine metabolic topography, the generative model with multiple conditions such as cognitive score may improve future PET prediction. Furthermore, combination of another generative model such as generative adversarial model may improve the prediction accuracy (20) .\nPopulation distribution of metabolic topography revealed that APOE4 carriers showed higher metabolism in the calcarine and lingual cortex, while lower metabolism in the hippocampus and amygdala before 55. The difference in these regions were not found after 60, which suggested that age-related metabolic changes of these regions were greater in APOE4 carriers than noncarriers. The relationship between APOE4 and brain metabolism in normal elderly has been investigated in previous studies as well (21) . The regions which showed difference metabolism in accordance with APOE4 status were partly different as the previous study showed that metabolic decline was faster in composite region-of-interests including posterior cingulate, precuneus and lateral parietal cortices (21). Beside, another study using functional MRI showed APOE4 status affected the differentiation of functional networks including hippocampal and visual networks though they used different modality (22) . Structural MRI study showed that APOE4 carriers tended to have thicker cortex in temporooccipital areas and steeper age-related decline in cortical thickness (23). Although the regions related to APOE4 were partly different according to the studies, our result supports APOE4 carriers could affect functional brain aging patterns. Additionally, by estimating population distribution, we could identify regional metabolic difference at all ages. Our approach can be extended to investigation of the association between other clinical variables and age-related changes. It can eventually help find the factors that determine the individual variability in aging.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report that applies a generative model to estimate aging of high dimensional medical data. As an extended application of our approach, PET data according to interpretable features, such as sex and cognitive scores, can be generated by using conditional VAE which aimed at synthesizing virtual data from the conditional distribution (24, 25) . This conditional generative model can be used for various problems in neuroimaging analyses. For example, the model may be used for predicting several task-specific functional brain images from a single image data. Virtual task-related brain images can be predicted by inputting tasks as conditional inputs of VAE model. Furthermore, this approach would improve conventional statistical voxelwise analyses of neuroimaging data. An important limitation of the voxelwise analysis is the presence of multiple covariates (26, 27) . So far, covariates such as subject's age and brain volume have been handled as nuisance variables using general linear model. Instead, virtual neuroimaging data in same conditions can be generated by this approach. For instance, we can compare brain images of different groups by generating virtual data with controlled covariates such as same age and brain volume.\nAs a deep generative model may be able to precisely predict high dimensional data, future application will be extended to various medical implications. Recently, generative models have been used in various biomedical fields as well as neuroimaging data. A generative model was applied to generating novel molecular fingerprints as an artificial intelligence drug discovery framework (28) . As a recently developed application to medical image processing, generative model was used for automatic lesion segmentation (29) .\nIn our study, we predict aging of metabolic topography by generating PET images. In spite of individual variability in age-related change, future regional metabolic changes were precisely predicted. Population distribution of normal brain metabolism at different ages was estimated. It revealed that regional metabolic decline was different according to the APOE4 status. This brain metabolic change prediction method can provide a plausible explanation of individual variability in cognitive aging. Furthermore, we expect that this approach will be extended to the development of preclinical biomarker for several neurodegenerative disorders as well as defining abnormal brain aging.
