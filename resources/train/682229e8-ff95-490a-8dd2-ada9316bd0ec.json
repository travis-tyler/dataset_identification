[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Importance of Assessing the Developing Non-Cognitive Skills of Low-"}, {"section_title": "income Children", "text": "Monitoring and supporting the acquisition of non-cognitive skills is especially important for low-income children who often face early adversity and experience delays in non-cognitive skill development (Blair & Raver, 2015;Macmillan et al., 2004). Head Start was developed to reduce the gap in school readiness evident at school entry due to socio-economic disparities, and in addition most states now provide publicly-funded prekindergarten programs with a similar goal of boosting both cognitive and non-cognitive skill development for children from low-income families (Garc\u00eda, 2015;U.S. Department of Education, 2007). Addressing early delays in these skill domains is important, given that children who begin school unprepared for its learning and behavioral demands typically remain low achievers throughout elementary school and are more likely than their more advantaged peers to experience learning disabilities, conflictual relationships with teachers and peers, grade retention, early school drop-out, and long-term underemployment (Ryan, Fauth, & Brooks-Gunn, 2006). The broad use of preschool student outcome assessments to track preschool program impact on these school readiness outcomes is relatively recent. The 1998 reauthorization of Head Start required programs to assess child outcomes in areas of early literacy, language, and numeracy skills; however, it was not until the 2007 reauthorization that programs were required to conduct standardized and structured assessments in all five domains of the early learning standards, including social-emotional competence and approaches to learning. The assessment of these two non-cognitive domains is challenging, due in large part to the relatively small amount of research on measures designed for preschool children (Darling-Churchill & Lippman, 2016). Moreover, most of the assessment measures currently used by Head Start and state pre-kindergarten programs are time-consuming to complete and fail to distinguish between social-emotional competence and approaches to learning (Ackerman & Coley, 2012;Halle, Zaslow, Wessel, Moodie, & Darling-Churchill, 2011;Halle & Darling-Churchill, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Predictive Validity of Preschool Non-Cognitive Skills", "text": "When preschool measures intend to assess children's school readiness, evidence of predictive validity to elementary school adjustment is of critical importance. By definition, school readiness reflects the acquisition of foundational skills that foster a child's success at school after kindergarten entry, and hence measures of school readiness should predict to early elementary school measures of school adjustment, performance, and attainment. Yet, very few measures of non-cognitive school readiness have been studied predictively to determine whether preschool scores actually indicate a readiness that is associated with success in the elementary school context. Historically, research on the predictive validity of school readiness measures has focused on academic skills with little attention to the socialemotional domain. For example, in a meta-analysis of 70 longitudinal studies examining predictive links between school readiness measures collected in preschool and kindergarten or first grade adjustment (La Paro & Pianta, 2000), only two studies examined the predictive validity of teacher-rated social-emotional competence, and only one of those two studies found evidence of predictive validity. Specifically, Ladd and Price (1987) found that preschool teacher ratings of social competence (sharing, peer involvement) and task mastery assessed using the California Preschool Social Competency Scale (Flint, Hick, Horan, Irvine, & Kukuk, 1980) each significantly predicted similar dimensions of adjustment in kindergarten (rs ranged from .21 to .52). Although not included in that meta-analyses, an additional study conducted in 1985 found that preschool teacher ratings of approaches to learning (e.g., a 7-item scale describing attention, concentration, and interest in activities) significantly predicted first grade achievement tests (reading, r = .52; math, r = .39) and teacher-rated academic performance (reading, r = .47;math, r = .43;Birrell, Phillips, & Stott, 1985). Since that 2000 review, several additional studies have examined the predictive validity of preschool measures of social-emotional competence or approaches to learning. For example, Pianta and Stuhlman (2004) found that teacher-rated social competence, rated on the California Preschool Social Competency scale significantly predicted reduced teacher conflict in kindergarten and first grade (r = \u2212.50 and \u2212.25, respectively) and first grade social competence (r = .44). Similarly, Daniels (2014) found that teacher-rated social competence in preschool significantly predicted kindergarten social competence (r = .44). Burchinal and colleagues (2008) also documented significant associations between preschool teacher ratings of social competence (using the Teacher-Child Relationships Scale) and kindergarten social competence (r = .34), as well as kindergarten reading (r = .21) and math (r = .20) skills. Focusing on approaches to learning, McDermott, Leigh, & Perry (2012) found that the 29item Preschool Learning Behavior Scale significantly predicted kindergarten academic performance (r = .15 \u2212 .32), social skills (r = .22 \u2212 .34), and work habits (r = .23 \u2212 .35) as well as first grade academic performance (r = .18 \u2212 .35) and work habits (r = .25 \u2212 .38). Another study found positive links between preschool teacher-rated approaches to learning (composited across three measures) and later achievement tests in kindergarten (r = .27 math, .14 reading) and in first grade (r = .30 math, .27 reading;McWayne et al., 2009). These studies document the potential promise of using preschool teacher ratings to assess social-emotional competence and approaches to learning in ways that predict kindergarten school adjustment. However, they fall short of establishing whether preschool teachers are able to rate these two non-cognitive skill sets reliably in ways that predict differentially to dimensions of children's future school adjustment when using brief scales."}, {"section_title": "The Current Study", "text": "This study evaluated the utility of two brief preschool teacher rating scales of socialemotional competence and approaches to learning in a sample of low-income preschool children. There were three primary research aims. The first goal was to describe the internal consistency and inter-rater reliability of each of the scales. The second goal was to explore the predictive validity of each preschool rating scale, by computing correlations with kindergarten and first-grade achievement, behavior problems, peer relation difficulties, need for school services, and grade retention. The third goal was to determine the unique and differential predictability of each scale to the set of kindergarten and first grade outcomes, and establish the extent to which they extended prediction of school adjustment above and beyond predictions based on direct assessments of child emergent literacy skills."}, {"section_title": "Method Participants", "text": "Participants included two cohorts of 4-year-old children (Total N = 164, 14% Hispanic-American, 30% African-American, 56% Caucasian; 56% girls) recruited from 22 Head Start preschool classrooms in three counties in Pennsylvania, who served as the \"usual practice\" comparison group for an intervention trial. None of these children received the intervention. At the time of baseline assessment, children were, on average 4.59 years old (SD = .32, range = 3.87-5.82). Their families all met the requirements for participation in Head Start; the median annual family income was $18,000, which is below the national poverty threshold. Lead teachers (N = 22; 85% Caucasian, 10% African American, 5% Hispanic; 100% female) had a mean of 6 years teaching in Head Start (SD = 5.8, range = .04-23) and had taught elsewhere for an average of 4.7 years (SD = 6.31; range = 0-26). Their primary language was English (100%), and 6 teachers used Spanish for work (29%). Most of these teachers had a four-year degree, some with additional graduate coursework (N = 14); the rest had a two-year degree (N = 8). Assistant teachers (N = 22; 95% Caucasian; 5% African American; 100% female) had mean of 5 years teaching in Head Start (SD = 5.56; range = 0-18) and an average 2 years' experience teaching elsewhere (SD = 3.85; range = 0-14). One teacher spoke Spanish primarily, and three used Spanish at work. A few had a four-year (2) or a two-year (2) college degree. One had a child development associate certificate. The rest (17) had a high-school degree and (for most) some additional course work towards a certificate or two-year degree. At the beginning of the preschool year, brochures describing the research project were distributed to parents of all 4-year-old children in the participating classrooms, and 86% elected to participate in the study and completed initial assessments. Children were then followed longitudinally, as they transitioned from the original 22 Head Start classrooms into 113 kindergarten classrooms and then 121 first grade classrooms. All but 7 children participated in the follow-up assessment at the end of kindergarten (96% retention) and all but 8 children participated in the follow-up assessment at the end of first grade (95% retention). T-tests comparing the children who were missing in kindergarten and first grade with the other children who remained in the study revealed no significant differences on any of the study measures."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Each year, research assistants delivered rating measures to teachers at the end of the year (April-May); teachers completed the measures and returned them to the project. Teachers were compensated financially for their time. Child assessments were conducted at school by trained assessors. Preschool assessments were conducted in April-May of 2003 (cohort 1) and 2004 (cohort 2) and included two individual \"pull-out\" sessions (30-45 minutes each). Subsequently, in kindergarten (2004-05) and first grade (2005-06), assessments were conducted in March-April during one individual session. Assessors were college students or community members with child development backgrounds who were trained to proficiency on all instruments before testing sessions. After attending training workshops, assessors conducted three pilot assessments with supervision and feedback and were then observed in the field for several assessments. Study procedures aligned with the American Psychological Association standards for ethical conduct of research and were approved by the university Institutional Review Board."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "School readiness.-To measure school readiness at the end of preschool, this study used the School Readiness Questionnaire developed for the REDI project (Bierman et al., 2008) included 9 items describing approaches to learning that were similar to those used by Birrell et al. (1985). Item content included being able to sit at a table and do work, being ready for the cognitive demands of school, able to work independently, each rated on a 6-point scale (\u03b1 = .97). Response options ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The Social Competence Scale (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1995) assessed prosocial behaviors (e.g., sharing, understanding other's feelings) and emotion regulation (e.g., can calm down when excited or upset) using 10 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = never to 6 = always; \u03b1 = .95). Head Start lead and assistant teachers provided independent ratings in the pre-kindergarten baseline year. For each of these scales measuring non-cognitive skills, the total score represents an average item rating. Brief screening measures also evaluated emergent literacy skills at the end of the preschool year. Three subscales testing early literacy skills were drawn from the Pre-CTOPP (later, the Test of Preschool Early Literacy [TOPEL]; Lonigan, Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 2007). Blending and Elision assessed phonological processing. Children were asked to combine different parts of a word, such as \"hot\" and \"dog\" or \"b\" and \"air\" and point to the correct picture or say the full word (\u03b1 = .86); and children were asked to deconstruct compound words, pointing to the correct picture or saying the correct word (e.g., Point to \"snowshoe\" without \"snow\"; Say \"airport\" without \"air\"; \u03b1 = .83). On the Print Awareness subtest, children identified pictures of letters or words and named letters (\u03b1 = .97). Prior research has reported correlations in the range of r = .43 to r = .88 between these three subscales and the acquisition of initial reading skills (Lonigan, 2006). Scores from these three sub-scales were standardized and averaged to create a preschool literacy achievement composite. Kindergarten and first-grade adjustment.-Multiple dimensions of elementary school adjustment were assessed, including academics, behavior problems, peer difficulties, need for school services, and grade retention. Achievement tests administered in Kindergarten and first grade included two subtests from the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE; Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999). The Sight Word Efficiency subscale measured the number of words read accurately within 45 seconds, and the Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subscale measured the number of nonwords sounded out accurately within 45 seconds (test-retest reliability reported by the developers of .85 \u2212 .90). A prior study of 202 ethnically diverse first grade students (Hagan-Burke, Burke, & Crowder, 2006) documented strong convergent validity for the TOWRE subtests, which correlated significantly with the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) Nonsense Word Fluency scale (r = .73-.74). Two subtests from the Woodcock-Johnson-III: Tests of Achievement (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001) were also administered. The Letter-Word Identification subscale assessed children's letter recognition and basic sight word knowledge; the Applied Problems subscale presented children with a series of math-related questions that became increasingly difficult (such as showing two fingers, counting objects, and adding or subtracting small numbers). These subtests are drawn from a standardized diagnostic battery with strong reliability (coefficient alpha > .80 for ages 6-8). High levels of content validity and structural validity are documented in the manual, along with a set of studies that have established concurrent validity with other established achievement tests (Woodcock et al., 2001). Total scores on these four academic achievement measures were standardized and averaged to create a composite score representing achievement at both kindergarten and first grade. Teachers rated child academic performance at kindergarten and first grade using 13 items assessing early achievement skills drawn from the Language and Literacy scale of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K: National Center for Educational Statistics, 2011). Items measured early reading (demonstrates phonetic understanding, reads independently, identifies letters), writing (writes simple words, understands conventions of print), and memory skills (follows two-step directions, writes from memory) and were rated on a fourpoint Likert scale from not yet to proficient. The average item score was used to represent teacher-rated academic performance (\u03b1 = .97) at both grades. To assess early elementary behavior problems, teachers rated child aggressive-disruptive behavior problems using the Teacher Observation of Child Adaptation -Revised Authority Acceptance scale (TOCA-R; Werthamer-Larsson, Kellam, & Wheeler, 1991). The seven items included overt aggression (e.g., yells, fights) and oppositional behaviors (e.g., stubborn, breaks rules), rated on a six-point Likert scale from almost never to almost always and averaged to form a total behavior problems score (\u03b1 = .89), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of behavior problems. Analyzing an ethnically diverse sample of children atrisk for conduct problems from the Fast Track Project, 754 children's scores on the TOCA-R (administered in kindergarten) were significantly correlated with later measures of parent rated school adjustment (r = \u2212.27-.41), teacher rated behavior problems (r = .35-.41) and social competence (r = \u2212.33-.38), and self-rated school adjustment (r = \u2212.16-.31) in sixth, eighth, and eleventh grades (Racz, King, Wu, Witkiewitz, McMahon, & The Conduct Problems Research Group, 2013). To assess early elementary peer difficulties, teachers rated four items from the Excluded by Peers subscale of the Child Behavior Scale (Ladd & Profilet, 1996). The items were: \"Is liked by classmates;\" \"Is disliked by classmates\" (reverse-scored); \"Is left out or ignored by classmates;\" and \"Is teased or picked on by classmates.\" Average item scores were used to reflect peer difficulties (\u03b1 = .84). Correlations with observations of kindergarten children and the Excluded by Peers subscale of the Child Behavior Scale (two cohorts each with n = 206) demonstrated that scores on this scale negatively correlated with positive peer interactions (r = \u2212.19-.22) and positively correlated with nonsocial behaviors (r = .15-.17; Ladd & Profilet, 1996). When compared in both low-and high-risk children aged 4-to 7years-old to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, correlations with the scale ranged from .59 to .87 (Goodman & Scott, 1999). Each year, teachers also responded to a list of 12 yes/no items to describe the child's need for and receipt of any special education or adjunct support services at school, including having an IEP, speech and language services, learning support, and behavioral support (\u03b1 = . 89). Items were summed to reflect the total number of school support services needed and used by each child. Finally, retention in kindergarten or first grade was recorded as an outcome reflecting elementary school adjustment (\"0\" = not retained and \"1\" = retained in kindergarten or first grade). Demographic covariates.-At the initial assessments, parents were asked to identify the sex and race of the child. They were also asked questions about their educational attainment and occupation and (if relevant) the education and occupation of their spouse or live in, coparenting partner. Educational attainment and occupations were coded to represent family socio-economic status using the Hollingshead (1975) system."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Analyses proceeded in three steps. First, analyses were undertaken to examine the internal and inter-rater reliability of preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence and approaches to learning. Second, correlations were computed to assess the associations between these two preschool teacher ratings and subsequent kindergarten and first-grade school adjustment. Finally, regressions were computed to evaluate the unique and differential predictive associations of preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence and approaches to learning to kindergarten and first-grade adjustment, in combination with preschool early literacy skills."}, {"section_title": "Research Aim #1: Preschool Teacher Ratings of Non-Cognitive Skills", "text": "Preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence were normally distributed. Ratings of approaches to learning were slightly negatively skewed (M skewness = \u22121.218) and leptokurtic (M kurtosis = 1.187), but still within acceptable limits. The internal reliability of each scale was evaluated, revealing strong internal consistency (\u03b1 = .95 socialemotional competence; \u03b1 = .97 for approaches to learning). Item-total correlations are shown in Table 1. To evaluate inter-rater reliability, total scores provided by lead and assistant teachers were compared. They were moderately to highly correlated for approaches to learning (r = .74) and social-emotional competence (r = .60). Analyses indicated comparable associations between lead and assistant teacher ratings and kindergarten and first-grade outcomes; thus, lead and assistant teacher ratings were averaged for subsequent analyses, creating total scores for the two scales, social-emotional competence and approaches to learning. The two non-cognitive skills scales themselves (social-emotional competence and approaches to learning) were highly correlated (r = .79)."}, {"section_title": "Research Aim #2: Concurrent and Predictive Correlations", "text": "Next, descriptive analyses and a series of correlations were undertaken to examine relations between preschool teacher ratings of non-cognitive skills and later elementary school adjustment. Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in Table 2. Correlations among preschool teacher ratings and kindergarten/first grade outcome variables are presented in Table 3. As shown in the first two columns of Table 3, preschool ratings of approaches to learning and social-emotional competence were significantly related to multiple indices of kindergarten and first grade school adjustment (achievement, academic performance, behavior problems, peer difficulties, need for services; rs ranged from .23 to . 50). In addition, grade retention was significantly related to preschool approaches to learning (r = \u2212.23) but not social competence."}, {"section_title": "Research Aim #3: Predictive Regression Analyses", "text": "Finally, in order to assess the degree to which preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence and approaches to learning uniquely and differentially predicted elementary school outcomes above and beyond prediction based on direct assessments of preschool literacy skills, a series of hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses was conducted. For each regression, control variables (child sex, race, and family socio-economic status) were entered first. Then, teacher ratings of social-emotional competence and approaches to learning were entered in step 2, along with preschool assessments of early literacy skills. Academic domain.-Results for the academic domain are displayed in Table 4. Prediction to elementary school assessments of child academic achievement are shown in the top section of Table 4 with kindergarten outcomes on the left and first grade outcomes on the right. After accounting for demographic control variables, the addition of preschool teacher ratings and early literacy skills together accounted for 30% of the variance in kindergarten achievement and 30% of the variance in first grade achievement, with approaches to learning and direct assessments of early literacy skills each contributing unique variance in each model. Findings were very similar across the models predicting academic achievement in kindergarten and first grade. Prediction to teacher ratings of children's academic performance in kindergarten and firstgrade are shown in the second section of Table 4. Together, the preschool scores accounted for 31% of the variance in kindergarten teacher ratings of academic performance and 34% of the variance in first grade teacher ratings of academic performance. In both years, direct assessments of early literacy skills made significant unique contributions. Preschool teacher ratings of approaches to learning also made a significant unique contribution to kindergarten academic performance, but this prediction was reduced to a trend level by first grade. Table 4 shows predictions to kindergarten and first grade teacher ratings of aggressive-disruptive behavior problems. Preschool teacher ratings and early literacy skills accounted for 23% of the variance in kindergarten behavior problems, and social-emotional competence emerged as a unique predictor. Preschool teacher ratings and early literacy skills accounted for 14% of the variance in first grade behavior problems, with social-emotional competence again emerging as a unique predictor."}, {"section_title": "Social-behavioral domain.-The third section of", "text": "Predictions to elementary school peer difficulties shown in the bottom section of Table 4. Preschool teacher ratings and early literacy skills accounted for 11% of the variance in peer difficulties in kindergarten and 14% in first grade. Preschool social-emotional competence ratings made unique contributions in first grade and showed a marginally significant trend in kindergarten. General school adjustment.-Finally, predictions from school readiness indicators to child needs for supplemental school services in both kindergarten and first grade are shown in the top section of Table 5. Non-cognitive measures of school readiness and early literacy skills significantly predicted 20% of the variance in a child's need for services in kindergarten and 27% of the variance in first grade. At both grade levels, preschool approaches to learning was a unique predictor, along with early literacy skills (marginally significant in kindergarten, significant in first grade.) Grade retention was examined in first grade, designating retention in either kindergarten or first grade. The preschool predictors studied here accounted for 8% of the variance in grade retention, with approaches to learning adding significant unique variance."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Using brief rating scales, preschool teachers provided assessments of child social-emotional competence and approaches to learning that significantly predicted multiple domains of school adjustment after children transitioned into kindergarten and first grade. The two scales showed internally consistent ratings of the non-cognitive skills of focus, approaches to learning (e.g., can work independently, able and willing to follow teacher instructions) and social-emotional competence (e.g., cooperates, controls temper in a disagreement, accepts things not going his or her way). Two teachers who rated children independently showed moderate reliability when assessing approaches to learning (r = .74) and social-emotional competence (r = .60). Ratings of approaches to learning and social-emotional competence were highly correlated, but were differentially predictive of future elementary school outcomes, reflected in distinct patterns of correlation and unique contributions in multiple regressions. Specifically, in regression analyses including both non-cognitive rating scales and preschool literacy skills, preschool approaches to learning uniquely predicted kindergarten and first grade academic achievement, academic performance, and need for services. Correlations with these outcomes were consistent with these regressions, favoring preschool approaches to learning over social-emotional competence, with an average r = .46 versus .36 for the kindergarten outcomes and an average r = .49 versus .37 for the first grade outcomes. Approaches to learning also uniquely predicted grade retention. In contrast, in regression analyses, social-emotional competence uniquely predicted behavior problems and peer difficulties in kindergarten and first grade. Correlations with these outcomes favored preschool social-emotional competence ratings over approaches to learning, with an average r = .42 versus .37 for the kindergarten outcomes and an average r = .38 versus .28 for the first-grade outcomes."}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Measuring Preschool Non-cognitive Skills", "text": "Countering the increasing emphasis on preschool academic learning during the past fifteen years, educators and researchers alike recognize the importance of non-cognitive skill development for children's school readiness and future school adjustment (Bassok et al., 2016;Yoshikawa et al., 2013). For example, a recent long-term longitudinal study showed that kindergarten teacher ratings of prosocial skills uniquely predicted key educational outcomes (high school graduation, lower grade retention rates, less need for special education services), as well as future employment and reduced criminal involvement at age 25 (Jones et al., 2015). Kindergarten teachers agree with this research (Bassok et al., 2016); when asked to list critical school readiness skills, a majority include approaches to learning (can follow directions, 91%; sits still and pays attention; 77%) and social-emotional competencies (takes turns and shares; 77%). Reflecting this growing consensus, Head Start modified its national early learning standards in 2015 to emphasize approaches to learning and social-emotional development as two of the five major early learning domains (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Despite consensus on the importance of these skill domains, the ability of preschool teachers to assess them and monitor child progress in skill acquisition has been hampered by the lack of short, practical, and valid measures. Past research has documented the predictive validity of teacher ratings collected after school entry, when children are in kindergarten (Li-Grining, Votruba-Drzal, Maldonado-Carre\u00f1o, & Haas, 2010;Matthews & Kizzie, 2010;McClelland, Morrison, & Holmes, 2000). However, only a few studies have examined the predictive validity of preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence or approaches to learning. No prior study has compared brief preschool teacher ratings of social-emotional competence and approaches to learning, to determine how effectively and distinctively brief ratings can predict different domains of elementary school functioning. The differential patterns of prediction found here are consistent with prior research that has examined each dimension separately (for example, Ladd & Price, 1987 for social-emotional competence; McDermott et al, 2012 for approaches to learning.) Their differential patterns of prediction validate the separation established in Head Start's revised early learning standards, in which they serve as distinct dimensions of school readiness (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). This study adds to the existing literature by demonstrating that preschool teachers can rate these two dimensions on brief scales, with significant and differential predictive validity."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "Several study limitations warrant mention. The Head Start sample followed here consisted of low-income families, and hence it is unknown whether the results would also generalize to a nationally-representative sample that included greater heterogeneity in family socio-economic status. Although the teacher ratings showed sufficient inter-rater reliability to support predictive validity, the level of agreement was somewhat low for ratings of socialemotional competence, suggesting that additional measure refinement may be needed. Low levels of interrater agreement in social and behavioral domains are not new problems in psychometrics, as the varying expectations of raters and differences in task demands across contexts are difficult to resolve. Further precision around operationalizing item content and response options should be a continued area of investigation in measurement, in particular for young children. The present study assessed the general predictive validity of these brief rating scales, but did not validate their use as diagnostic screeners. In the advent of prevention-oriented screening practices in school (e.g., School-Wide Positive Behavior Support, Response to Intervention and Instruction) it may be tempting to consider ways in which brief screenings can be used to identify children for possible support or intervention. Although the early identification of students who may benefit from support on non-cognitive skill domains is a worthy goal, the current study did not test for sensitivity and specificity in the identification of individual children. In other words, it remains unclear whether these scales could be used to identify individual children who need additional services in either domain of approaches to learning or social-emotional adjustment."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice and Future Directions", "text": "Despite these limitations, the present findings offer encouragement in terms of preschool teachers' abilities to assess social-emotional competence and approaches to learning using practical, brief scales. Few of the measures currently used to assess the school readiness of children in non-cognitive domains have been examined in terms of their predictive validity from preschool to elementary school (Halle & Darling-Churchill, 2016;Weisenfeld, 2017), and most involve longer teacher-rating scales and/or additional assessment methods, such as the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Devereux Early Childhood Assessment Clinical Form, and the Social Skills Rating System. Given the goal of linking preschool preparation with kindergarten outcomes in a way that reduces assessment burdens on teachers and students alike, the development and validation of brief scales measuring noncognitive skills is a critical goal. Currently, curriculum-based measures of achievement are often used as screeners for children entering kindergarten, taking on average 30 minutes or more per child (Costenbader, Rohrer, & Difonzo, 2000;Weisenfeld, 2017). The two scales used in the current study consist of no more than 10 items each while still maintaining adequate psychometric properties, and offer predictive value beyond that provided by achievement screeners alone, especially for behavioral outcomes. In addition, research on measures that are in the public domain as was conducted here will increase the accessibility of these tools for all providers of early childhood education. While nationally-representative norms are not yet available for the measures studied here, they offer value as examples of brief, practically-useful scales with adequate criterion validity and present an opportunity for future measurement research. 1 In general, addressing factors that contribute to the achievement gap in students from lowincome families as well as identifying those students who may have difficulty with school adjustment after kindergarten entry may guide efforts to better supporting long-term academic success. Identification of children in need of more supports in non-cognitive skill domains is a challenge given the lengthy, and sometimes, contextually inappropriate measures available for measuring non-cognitive skills of young children. Given these considerations, the brief, theoretically-based school readiness measures studied here fill an important, practical gap."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
