Activities of daily living are usually divided into basic and instrumental activities of daily living [1, 2] . The loss of performance of the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) belongs at the very core of the dementia concept. Also, improved function or reduced rate of deterioration of the ability to perform everyday tasks is included in the definition of treatment success for dementia [3] .\nInformation about IADL performance is usually obtained from caregivers through information reports, like the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [4] . Due to importance of IADLs, there has been a range of analyses of their relationship with neuropsychiatric or cognitive indexes [5] or neuroimaging biomarkers [2] . IADL impairment has been associated with in vivo amyloid burden in cortical regions [6] and also with brain atrophy and white matter lesions [1] . However, only simple statistic approaches like Pearson's or Spearman's correlations have been applied in the study of these relationships and the results have been far from definitive.\nOne reason for the inconsistent findings of the relationship between behavior change and biomarkers may be that there are both linear and non-linear components to the associations, and many standard analytical tools focus only on the linear aspects. Catastrophe models on the other hand can deal with complicated linear and non linear behaviors at the same time.\nCatastrophe models, in particular cusp catastrophe model, have been successfully applied to health outcomes [7] , social behavior [8] , therapy and program evaluation [9] , accident processes [10] , anxiety and performance [11] , cognitive development [12] , selection of target behavior [13] , alcohol use [14] , substance use [15] , drinking [16, 17] , sexual initiation [18] , nursing turnover [19] and HIV prevention [20] . However, in those studies the data were fit to a cusp surface without support from any phenomenological model.\nIn order to support a brain task, a network between several neurons is created. This network is characterized by a correlation length, x, [21] that depends both on the topology and on the functionality of the network [22] . The degree of metabolic activity necessary to support the task (and the network) is proportional to the volume of the network determined by this correlation length. This metabolic activity is equal to the energy used to maintain the function of the neurons and their links, m 0 , plus the energy required for the dynamic formation of the specific network, m x .\nHowever each brain task is not instantiated in its own isolated network. Networks are shared between tasks resulting in connectivity hubs [23] . When several cognitive processes share the same network, they may do so without a proportional increase in metabolic demand. In order to characterize this phenomenon, we introduce the concept of synaptic overlap. The degree of synaptic overlap is proportional to the mean shared area, which is energized by other processes along the network's correlation length. This characteristic network overlap has been well described and is often referred to as a network of networks [21] .\nSo, the energetic balance of the network is summarized as,\nwhere a and b are coefficients that convert the geometric characterization of the network into energy units and r characterizes the synaptic overlap. Equation (1) describes the possible values of the system in the space determined by metabolic energy, synaptic overlap, and correlation length (m x , r 2 , x).\nLet us now assume that the metabolic energy for a cognitive task is proportional to the change rate of the correlation length between neurons, that is, m x \u223c dx/dt. So, equation\n(1) could be written as,\nwhere now \u03b1 and \u03b2 are functions derived from equation (1) that depends, in general, on metabolic energy, synaptic overlap and time, and where U is a potential function that corresponds to the Riemann-Hugoniot surface x 3 \u2212 \u03b2x \u2212 \u03b1 = 0 for different \u03b1 and \u03b2 values.\nEquation (2), or the equivalent potential, describes a cusp model [24, 25] that predicts sudden changes for x values; here \u03b1 and \u03b2 are known as asymmetry control parameter and bifurcation control parameter respectively.Equation (2) is thus a deterministic model that relates the energy in a cognitive task network to its correlation length.\nIn order to apply this model to real data the correlation length is assumed to be proportional to the network output and a probabilistic term is added. This casts equation (2) into a stochastic differential equation,\nwhere \u03c3 (x) represents a diffusion process, that will be assumed to be constant, and which W (t) is a white noise Wiener process. Notice that (3) is a Langevin equation where the correlation length corresponds to the position of the particle under the potential. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density could be written as,\nSince the variation of x in time is faster than the change of U, it can be assumed that \u03c1 changes very slowly over time, and consequently \u2202\u03c1/\u2202t \u2243 0. From this, it is straightforward that,\nwhere C is a normalization constant. This last expression gives the probability of obtaining a network of size x for the steady state case, that is, if the system varies slowly over time.\nSince the probability density for a network with correlation length x is known, the entropy of the set of networks, can be calculated as,\nshowing the natural evolution of the system.\nIn order to evaluate our model we selected some data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). ADNI is a research effort devote to brain imaging research of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The website groups clinical, imaging, genetic and biospecimen biomarkers through the stages from normal aging to dementia. The standardized methods for imaging and biomarker collection and analysis are intended for facilitating a cohesive research worldwide. ADNI provides the collected information to all registered members [26] [27] [28] .\nA sample of 1351 subjects was selected from ADNI cohort. All available data from these individuals gave a total of 3025 study visits. We selected for analysis: positron emission tomography fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) standard uptake value ratio, total brain volume (TBV), intracranial volume (ICV), as well as the functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) score. For each subject the brain ratio (BR) was calculated as the ratio between TBV and ICV.\nIn order to compare across variables with different value ranges, we normalized all data to the [0, 1] interval. In the case of FAQ values the transformation was applied in opposite direction. That is, the FAQ score increases as impairment of IADL increases but the normalized variable decreases as impairment of IADL increases.\nThe network output is proposed as proportional to IADL; the bifurcation (\u03b2) and asymmetry (\u03b1) control parameters are proposed as linear functions of the independent variables [29] . That is,\nand v stand for the normalized values of FAQ, FDG and BR and w i , a i and b i are fitting coefficients. The software fits the data to the standard cusp model, where the bifurcation is centered at \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 0 and x = 0. However, by requiring that w 0 = a 0 = b 0 = 0, as boundary conditions, the data were fitted to (3).\nAll the statistical procedures were made using R Statistical Software [30] . The R package \"cusp\" calculate the Cobb's pseudo-R 2 parameter as a measurement of the goodness of fit [29] . and \u03b2 values. It can be seen that there is a preferential direction along the cusp surface,\nrepresented as a straight line. By translating and rotating the coordinate system, so that \u03b1 lies over this straight line and applying the boundary conditions, x can be expressed in its \"natural\" coordinate system (\u03b1 \u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 ). Figure 2 is the representation of the data in the new coordinate system. It shows how the data distribute for x values. Here, it can be seen that two different results are possible, IADL task failure for low values of IADL performance, and success, for high values of IADL performance.\nThe entropy of the system, calculated according to (6) and represented in Figure 3 , defines the possible evolution of the system in time. The system evolves in the general direction of the known aging processes of brain, represented with arrows in Figures 1 and 2 . However, the maximum value of entropy corresponds to the point of \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 \u2243 2.15, very close to the point where the data intersects the \u03b1 = 0 plane (\u03b2 = 2.06).\nOlder age is generally characterized by decreasing brain volume [31] and a decline in brain glucose metabolism [32] [33] [34] . Our model shows that even if this declining process occurs slowly it could end in a catastrophic failures of IADL, that is, in dementia.\nAs can be seen in Figure 4 , the \"high energy\" states produce only networks with high output. However, when there is a loss of brain volume with older age and a lower energy use, a point is reached where the probability of producing a network with a very low output is not zero. That is, the probability of task failure suddenly becomes greater than zero. This probability of failure increases along the aging process while the probability of success decreases. At some point along this continuum, an individual will be diagnosed with dementia.\nAt very low values of BR and FDG the probability of success will be zero.\nOur results show that functional brain decline is clearly observed through the measures of the energy consumption (FDG) and the brain volume (BR). However, there is no deterministic relation between those biomarkers and the onset of dementia. On the contrary, an individual's decline could follow a random path through the surface determined by Equation (2). Furthermore, the precise moment when the subject falls into dementia can not be predicted because it is governed by a probability function. It has been argued that dementia is the result of a pathological process acting on the brain and is fundamentally different from what is called healthy aging. However, based on the results of our model, normal aging results in a small, but continuous change in the brain that can drive loss of performance in IADLs. This presents the provocative possibility that at least in some case (e.g., the oldest-old) a dementia syndrome could be an end-point of otherwise normal aging.\nHowever, the solution posed here is only for the steady state. That is, the curve of Figure   2 represents the evolution of system only if changes occur slowly. Stroke, infections, and the like cause abrupt changes to the system, and these are not accounted for in our model. We do not exclude the possibility that dementia could also appear as a consequence of sudden changes on the brain. While our model explains the general behavior of the data, the entropy of the system, shown in Figure 3 does not explain more advanced cases of dementia. This could mean that the model should not be applied to the more sparse networks that would be apparent in demented individuals. This is a novel approach not only in the field of dementia but more generally for neu- "}]
