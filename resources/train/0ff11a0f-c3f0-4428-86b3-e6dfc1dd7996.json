[{"section_title": "1", "text": "Two of the most important indicators of the educational system's success are the rates at which young people drop out of and complete high school each year. The Common Core of Data (CCD) survey system of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) annually collects information about public school dropouts and completers. This report presents the number and percentage of students dropping out of and completing public school (among states that reported dropouts) for the 2000-01 school year."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The CCD consists of five surveys that are completed each year by state education agencies (SEAs). Three of these surveys provide basic statistical information about public elementary/secondary institutions, students, and staff. Although all information is reported directly by SEAs, the surveys include data about individual states, local education agencies, and schools. The numbers of students who complete high school with a regular diploma or some alternative credential have been reported at the state and local education agency levels since the 1987-88 CCD collection. A dropout statistic was added to the Local Education Agency (School District) Universe beginning with the 1992-93 collection (reporting 1991-92 dropouts) ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations in This Report", "text": "The high school 4 -year completion rate presented here differs in its calculation from other published rates, and readers should be alert to this when making comparisons with other studies (see a list of current NCES reports on this subject at the end of this report). The inclusion of both regular and other high school completions, and the exclusion of General Educational Development (GED) recipients, may also lead to differences with other reports (see the \"High School Completers\" section for a further description).\nAlso, state and local policies and data collection administration may have profound effects on the count of dropouts and completers reported by a state. One example of a discrepancy is that not all states provide multiple types of high school completions. Some states award regular diplomas to all students while others award some form of alternative credential to special education students. Another example of a discrepancy is the degree of rigor with which states or districts verify the enrollment status of students who have transferred out of state. Dropout and completion data collected by the CCD are reported from the administrative records of SEAs. Some states collect their data through student-level records systems, while others collect aggregate data from schools and districts. Although state CCD Coordinators verify each year that they have followed the CCD dropout definition, states vary in their ability to track students who move in and out of districts, and it is probable that some students have been misclassified."}, {"section_title": "High School Dropouts", "text": "Determining Dropout Status. The CCD definition determines whether an individual is a dropout by his or her enrollment status at the beginning of the school year (the same day used for the enrollment count). Beginning in 1990, NCES defined a dropout as an individual who 1) was enrolled in school at some time during the previous school year (e.g., 1999-2000) ; and 2) was not enrolled at the beginning of the current school year (e.g., 2000-01); and 3) has not graduated from high school or completed a state-or district-approved educational program; and 4) does not meet any of the following exclusionary conditions: 3 A total of 33 states reported publishable data for both 1993-94 and 2000-01 (Louisiana's data were not comparable between these 2 years and were also not included in this analysis). Among this group, the range of dropout rates generally decreased from 1993-94 to 2000-01. Dropout rates for reporting states in 1993-94 ranged from a low of 2.7 percent in North Dakota to a high of 13.7 percent in Arizona. Seven years later, the reported rates ranged from 2.2 percent in North Dakota to 10.9 percent in Arizona.\nOf those 33 states that had dropout rates in 1993-94 and 2000-01, 8 states (24 percent) reported dropout rates of less than 4 percent in 1993-94; this increased to 12 states (36 percent) in 2000-01. In 1993-94, dropout rates for 20 of the 33 states ranged from 4 to 7 percent. In 2000-01, 19 of the 33 states had dropout rates that ranged from 4 to 7 percent. Of those 33 states, 6 states reported dropout rates of higher than 7 percent in 1993-94, and only 3 states reported dropout rates of higher than 7 percent in 2000-01.\nDropout rates were more likely to decline than increase over the 7-year interval: only 4 of the 33 reporting states increased and none by more than 1 percentage point. In this period, the dropout rates decreased by at least 2 percentage points in Arizona, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.\nBy Race/Ethnicity. High school dropout rates for each of five racial/ethnic groups 2 were calculated by dividing the number of grade 9 through 12 dropouts in a racial/ethnic group by the grade 9 through 12 membership for that group. Of the 46 states that reported dropouts for the 2000-01 school year, 43 were able to do so by race/ethnicity (table 3) . Caution should be used when interpreting results by race/ethnicity as some of the racial/ethnic group populations are quite small in some states. To see the percentage of individuals in each racial/ethnic group in each of the states, see appendix A-1.\nIn the 2000-01 school year, dropout rates were generally lowest for White, non-Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander students and highest for American Indian/Alaska Native; Black, nonHispanic; and Hispanic students in reporting states. Relative to groups other than White, nonHispanic students, dropping out was rare for Asian/Pacific Islander high school students in reporting states. The Asian/Pacific Islander dropout rate was less than 4 percent in more than twothirds (30) of reporting states. No state reported a dropout rate of 10 percent or more for this group (table 3) .\nMore than 15 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native high school students dropped out in Arizona, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Twelve states had a dropout rate of 10 percent or higher for American Indian/Alaska Native students. Only one state (Wyoming) reported a Black, nonHispanic dropout rate of more than 15 percent. However, there were eight states that reported dropout rates of 10 percent or more among Black, non-Hispanic high school students. Among Hispanic high school students, dropout rates were 10 percent or higher in 11 reporting states.\nBy District Locale Code. The CCD assigns each school a locale code that identifies its location rela tive to a population center; the codes range from \"large city\" to \"rural.\" The school locale codes have been aggregated to the school districts with which the schools are associated, and the dropout rates among the different types of locales are shown in Relatively high dropout rates were most often observed in reporting school districts that served large or midsize cities and least frequently in rural areas. Nine reporting states had dropout rates of more than 10 percent in large city school districts, while only one state had a dropout rate of more than 10 percent for its rural school districts inside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSAs)."}, {"section_title": "High School Completers", "text": "The term \"high school completer\" includes both diploma recipients and other high school completers. Thus, the CCD 4-year high school completion rate includes both diploma recipients and other high school completers. (This rate includes other high school completers but does not reflect those receiving a GED-based equivalency credential.) Diploma Recipients. These are individuals who are awarded, in a given year, a high school diploma or a diploma that recognizes some higher level of academic achievement. They can be thought of as students who meet or exceed the coursework and performance standards for high school completion established by the state or other relevant authorities.\nOther High School Completers. These individuals receive a certificate of attendance or some other credential in lieu of a diploma. Students awarded this credential typically meet requirements that differ from those for a high school diploma. Some states do not issue an \"other high school completion\" type of certificate, but award all students who complete school a diploma regardless of what academic requirements the students have met. Thus, in order to make data as comparable as possible across states, this report includes both regular and other diploma recipients in its high school 4-year completion rate."}, {"section_title": "Exclusion of High School Equivalency", "text": "Recipients. High school equivalency recipients are awarded a credential certifying that they have met state or district requirements for high school completion by passing an examination or completing some other performance requirement. High school equivalency diplomas are considered valid completion credentials, but high school equivalency recipients are not included in the CCD completion rate. There are two reasons for this exclusion. First, high school equivalency recipients are reported on the CCD only at the state level and can not be disaggregated to the district level. Second, not all states report high school equivalency counts on the CCD, and the statistic is therefore not comparable across states. In the 2000-01 school year, the 4 years of dropout data needed to calculate a high school 4-year completion rate were available for 39 states. The high school 4-year completion rates ranged from a high of 90.1 in North Dakota to a low of 65.0 in Louisiana for those states with data. In 2000-01, seven of the reporting states had 4-year completion rates above 85 percent: Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. Five states had 4-year completion rates below 75 percent: Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, and New Mexico."}, {"section_title": "High School 4-year Completion", "text": "The majority of high school completion credentials are in the form of a diploma. There were 37 reporting states with data available to calculate a 2000-01 high school 4-year completion rate that either reported other high school completer data (i.e., certificates of completion) or did not award any type of other high school completer credentials (Wisconsin and Wyoming's other high school completers were missing and were therefore not included). Other high school completers made up only 1.8 percent of all high school completers in these 37 reporting states (derived from table 5). Twenty-eight of these states awarded other high school completion credentials (the other nine states did not award these credentials) and had data necessary to calculate a 2000-01 4-year completion rate for other high school completers (e.g., recipients of certificates of completion). In 6 of these 28 states-Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Oregon, and Tennessee-the percent of all students who completed by means of another high school completion credential was 5 percent or more.\nOver Time. Table 6 presents the rate of high school completions over time (including diplomas and other high school completers, but excluding high school equivalencies). It is important to note that states have different policies in regard to awarding high school diplomas versus other high school credentials. Caution should be used when comparing states.\nThis report includes 4-year completion rates for the 1994-95 through 2000-01 school years (table 6). Since 4 years of dropout data are required to calculate a 4-year high school completion rate, fewer than 15 states had completion rates in 1994-95 or 1995-96 . For this reason, discussions of the 4-year completion rate over time will be based on the 1996-97 and 2000-01 school years; there are 32 states that had 4-year high school completion rates in these 2 years. Seven of the states' 4 -year completion rates went down between 1996-97 and 2000-01. The changes (increases and decreases) were relatively small: less than 2 percentage points in 18 states. Two states, Idaho and Nevada, increased their 4 -year high school completion rates by over 9 percentage points between 1996-97 and 2000-01.\nBy Race/Ethnicity. Four-year completion rates by race/ethnicity can be presented for 36 states in the 2000-01 school year in table 7. Caution should be used when interpreting results by race/ethnicity as some of the racial/ethnic group populations are quite small in some states. For the percentage of individuals in each racial/ethnic group in the state, see appendix A-2.\nAs might be expected given the dropout rates, Asian/Pacific Islander and White, non-Hispanic students were more likely to have higher completion rates than Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and American Indian/Alaska Native students. Six reporting states had high school 4 -year completion rates below 60 percent for Black, non-Hispanic students, seven reporting states for Hispanic students, and 8 reporting states for American Indian/Alaska Native students. No state had a 4-year completion rate below 60 percent for Asian/Pacific Islander or White students.\nSeventy-eight percent (28) of reporting states had a White, non-Hispanic 4-year completion rate and 75 percent (27) had an Asian/Pacific Islander 4-year high school completion rate of over 80 percent.\nBy District Locale Code. As is evident from table 8, reporting states' large city school districts were more likely than other distric ts to have a relatively low high school 4-year completion rate of less than 60 percent. In 2000-01, no reporting state's large city school districts had 4-year completion rates of 80 percent or more. The reporting states' districts in urban fringes of large cities fared much better, with 19 (66 percent) with completion rates of 80 percent or more. The same was true for 25 (74 percent) districts in urban fringes of midsize cities.\nFour-year completion rates of 80 percent or higher were more likely to occur in reporting states' rural school districts than any other district locale. In fact, more than three-fourths of the reporting states had a 4-year completion rate of 80 percent or more in their rural school districts (78 percent in rural districts outside of MSAs and 80 percent in rural districts inside of MSAs). Ungraded students are prorated into the 9-12th grade total for dropout rate calculation purposes. For those states that did not report dropouts, no prorated 9-12th grade enrollment was calculated."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "These states reported on an alternative July through June cycle rather than the specified October through September cycle.

NOTE: High school completers includes regular and other diplomas as well as other completers, but does not include high school equivalencies (e.g., GED). The completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of high school completers in a given year by the number of high school completers in that year and dropouts over a 4-year period. A state that reported completers but not dropouts would not have a high school completion rate. Other completer data are missing in the following states: Wisconsin and Wyoming. Values for 1 year of the 4-year completion rate denominator are imputed. See the Technical Notes for more details. NOTE: High school completers includes regular and other diplomas as well as other completers, but does not include high school equivalencies (e.g., GED).

NCES collects and publishes statistics about high school dropouts and completers through several of its surveys. It is important to note the differences in the nature of these surveys and the populations they include. The surveys produce different, not conflicting, information.\nThe CCD rate in this report is an event dropout rate. NCES publishes three types of dropout rates.\nEvent rates describe the proportion of students who leave school each year without completing a high school program. This annual measure of recent dropout occurrences provides important information about how effective educators are in keeping students enrolled in school. Data used to compute event rates are collected through the CCD and the Current Population Survey (CPS).\nStatus rates provide cumulative data on dropouts among all young adults within a specified age range. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts regardless of when these individuals last attended school. Since status rates reveal the extent of the dropout problem in the population, these rates can be used to estimate the need for further education and training designed to help dropouts participate fully in the economy and life of the nation. Data used to calculate status rates for young adults ages 16 through 24 are collected through the CPS.\nCohort rates measure what happens to a group of students over a period of time. These rates are based on repeated measures of a cohort of students with shared experiences and reveal how many students starting in a specific grade drop out over time. Typically, data from longitudinal studies provide more background and contextual information on the students who drop out than are available through the CPS or CCD data collections. Data used to calculate cohort rates were collected through the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS:88) and will be collected again in the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002 .\nConceptually, the dropout collection through the CCD is designed to be consistent with the current CPS procedures. However, there are operational differences in dropout collection procedures between the two data sets. First, the CCD represents a state's public school dropout counts; in other words, the dropout rate represents the number of public school students who have dropped out over the total number of public school students enrolled in the state. This differs from the CPS dropout counts in a few ways. The CPS counts include students who were enrolled in either public or private schools. Secondly, the CPS is a count of young adults who live in the state, not necessarily those who went to school in that state. The third difference between CPS and CCD dropout collection procedures is that the CCD collects data on dropouts from grades 7 through 12 and reports event rates based on grades 9 through 12 versus only grades 10 through 12 in the CPS. Fourth, the CCD collection is based on administrative records rather than a household survey, as in the CPS. One other difference is that, in contrast to the CPS, the CCD collection counts those students who leave public school to enroll in GED programs (outside the public education system) as dropouts, while they are not counted as dropouts in the estimates NCES publishes based on CPS data. Finally, the CPS is not traditionally used to report state-level dropout estimates."}, {"section_title": "How does the CCD 4-year completion rate differ from the CPS completion rate?", "text": "The CCD and CPS are different types of data collections that lead to different completion rates. The CCD is an annual administrative records data collection from SEAs of data about schools, districts, and states. The CPS is a monthly household survey of 50,000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide information about employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the civilian noninstitutionalized population.\nMany of the differences between the CCD and CPS dropout collections are evident in their respective data collection procedures. There are additional distinctions, however. The CCD is more of an accountability measure for states, while the CPS measure defines a population. The main difference is that the CCD 4-year completion rate is a leaver rate for a specific period of time (4 years): of those who leave school, how many completed. The CPS measures an age group of the population (in NCES' case, 18-to 24-year-olds) and asks if they graduated from school. Thus, the CCD estimates a cohort completion rate for those who have left school, while the CPS provides a status rate based on the total young adult population."}, {"section_title": "National totals", "text": "Because not all states report dropouts using the CCD definition, the CCD cannot provide national totals for dropout or completion rates. It is also not advisable to create \"reporting state\" totals, because the bias introduced by those states that are missing is unknown. When all states are able to report to NCES using the CCD dropout definition, a national total of dropouts and completers can and will be reported."}, {"section_title": "District locale codes", "text": "The locale code for a district is based on the locale codes of the schools in the district weighted by the number of students in each school.

Arizona and Idaho did not report 11th grade dropouts (year 3), therefore this data was imputed by taking the average of the reported grade 11 (year 2) and grade 11 (year 4). Note that the imputed grade total was set to the sum of the imputed race totals in cases where the sum of the imputed race totals was more than the initial imputed grade total. This is a new procedure starting with the 2000-01 4-year completion rates. "}]
