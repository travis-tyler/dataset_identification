The report examines two cohorts of borrowers: those who began their postsecondary education in the 1995-96 academic year (BPS:96/01) and those who began in the 2003-04 academic year (BPS:04/09). The report presents estimates of both cohorts' cumulative borrowing and repayment statuses as of June 30, 2015, some 20 years after the 1995-96 cohort and 12 years after the 2003-04 cohort began postsecondary education. In both of these cohorts of beginning postsecondary students, approximately 60 percent had taken out federal loans to finance their education by 2015. 1 This report presents estimates concerning students' cumulative borrowing and the loan repayment milestones of entering repayment, defaulting, and paying off loans. The report compares these experiences across varied demographic, enrollment, and employment characteristics."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 3", "text": "The Selected Findings section of this report presents a summary of the data shown in the five tables included in the report. Each table presents federal loan and repayment data from the BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09 cohorts as of 2015, covering 20 and 12 years, respectively, after each cohort first entered postsecondary education. 3 For comparison with the BPS:04/09 cohort, data are also presented for the BPS:96/01 cohort as of 2007, some 12 years after they began postsecondary education. Appendix A provides a glossary of the variables used in this report and a glossary of terms pertaining to federal student aid and the federal loan program. Appendix B presents details about the methods and procedures used for BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, with information on data sources, technical notes on NSLDS, an explanation of the creation of new derived variables for analyzing loan repayment, and cautions for analysts. In particular, readers should be aware that the variables created to measure federal loan default differ in crucial ways from default measures published by FSA, and should not be directly compared. This issue is discussed in more detail in appendix B. Appendix C includes standard errors for the estimates presented in tables 1 through 5 as well as descriptive statistics on key variables used in the analyses for all students and for borrowers in each cohort. These statistics are provided to give readers context on the demographic, enrollment, employment, and financial aid characteristics of each BPS cohort.

PAYING OFF LOANS: Among 1995-96 and 2003-04 first-time beginning postsecondary students who took out federal education loans, percent who had paid off all federal loans without default, by selected demographic, enrollment, and employment characteristics: 2007 and 2015-Continued 5 Summarizes students' attendance intensity for all academic-year enrollment in the 6 years after entering postsecondary education. Attendance intensity in summer terms was not included. Full-time attendance generally means enrollment in 12 or more credit hours per term or 24 credit hours per academic year. Students in the \"always full time\" and \"always part time\" categories were enrolled full time and part time, respectively, for all academic-year terms in which they were enrolled. Students in the \"mixed enrollment\" category enrolled full time in some academic-year terms and part time in others. 6 Undergraduate certificates are short-term postsecondary credentials typically completed within 1 to 2 years. They are designed to equip people with the skills needed for direct entry to employment or to earn a license. 7 Full-time employment status is defined as working 35 or more hours per week, and part-time employment status is defined as working less than 35 hours per week. 8 For the cohort of students who began in 1995-96, those who were currently enrolled and considered themselves primarily a student and not an employee 6 years after entering postsecondary education are included in the total but excluded here; and, for the cohort of students who began in 2003-04, those who were enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program 6 years after entering postsecondary education are included in the total but excluded here. 9 For the cohort of students who began in 1995-96, the \"Lowest 25 percent but above zero\" includes those with incomes greater than zero but less than $19,001; the \"Lower middle 25 percent\" includes those with incomes between $19,001 and $26,700; the \"Upper middle 25 percent\" includes those with incomes between $26,701 and $35,000; and those in the \"Highest 25 percent\" had incomes of $35,001 or more.

"}, {"section_title": "Glossary of Terms and Concepts", "text": "The glossary below defines key terms and concepts that are central to understanding federal student loan repayment and that therefore provide context for understanding and using the 2015 Federal Aid Supplements. Note that the data included in the 2015 Federal Aid Supplements cover 1 to 2 decades, during which time many different program rules and policies were in effect. Details regarding any of these key terms (e.g., how many days of delinquency constitute a default or the conditions for granting a deferment) must be obtained from the relevant legislation and regulations of the particular financial aid program for the time period in question. Administrative wage garnishment-An employer may withhold a portion of an employee's earnings for submission to a federal loan collector for payment of the employee's defaulted federal loan. Up to 15 percent of disposable income can be taken by the federal government or a guaranty agency to repay student loan debt. Bankruptcy-People who are found legally insolvent are declared bankrupt. Their loans are discharged and their property is distributed among creditors or otherwise administered to satisfy the interests of their creditors. Federal student loans are rarely dischargeable in bankruptcy and then only after proving undue hardship in an adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy court. See http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/bankruptcybasics-glossary#content-for-b. Collection agency-Collection agencies, sometimes under contract to the U.S. Department of Education or other loan holder, administer loan payments from defaulted borrowers. Besides handling billing, check processing, and payment transfers, the collector must locate and persuade recalcitrant borrowers to make payments. Consolidation loan-Consolidation combines more than one federal loan into one loan with a single monthly payment. Borrowers can choose this option during the grace period or after entering repayment to simplify and lower payment amounts, but because it extends the length of the debt, it increases the total amount of interest paid. Only federal loans held by the borrower, not private loans, can be consolidated into Federal Consolidation Loans. Cost of attendance (COA)-The total amount required to attend postsecondary education includes tuition and fees; room and board; the cost of books, computers, required supplies, transportation, dependent care, and loan fees; and miscellaneous and personal expenses."}, {"section_title": "A-12 APPENDIX A-GLOSSARIES", "text": "Default-A loan is in default if the borrower fails to make a payment for 270 days if the loan is paid monthly and 330 days for a loan that is paid in less frequent installments. Prior to October 1998, a loan was in default if the borrower failed to make a payment for 180 days. A loan may also be in default for nonfinancial reasons, such as the borrower's violating the terms of the contract or promissory note. When a loan defaults, the outstanding amount, including both interest and principal, becomes due in full, and the loan is assigned to a collection agency. Any additional interest, collection fees, court costs, attorney's fees, and other costs associated with the collection process are added to the amount due. The borrower is no longer entitled to any deferments or forbearances and may be subject to an offset of federal or state tax refunds or lottery winnings, as well as administrative wage garnishment. The loan holder might take legal action to force repayment, and credit bureaus are notified, potentially affecting the borrower's credit ratings for years. Finally, students who are in default on any Title IV student loan are not eligible for additional Title IV student aid until they have made payments of an approved amount for a specified time period. Default rate-The ratio of defaults to all student loans can be measured in loans, dollars, or borrowers; are calculated for various time periods; and can include different mixes of loan types. FSA regularly publishes different types of default rates (see table B-4). Deferment-A deferment is a sanctioned temporary cessation of payments on the principal balance of the loan. To enter into deferment, borrowers must meet certain conditions (e.g., enrollment in postsecondary education, durations of unemployment, Peace Corps participation). If the loan is not subsidized, the interest payments still accrue and may be added to the payments later. Delinquency-A delinquency occurs 1 day after a scheduled payment on a loan is not fully paid. Disbursement-Disbursed federal student aid funds are paid to the student or to the school on behalf of the student for education costs. Federal student aid funds are usually paid in two or more disbursements. The funds are usually used first to pay tuition and fee charges to the school, and any remaining funds, termed \"a refund,\" are then given to the student for living expenses. Expected Family Contribution (EFC)-Used to determine a student's eligibility for need-based federal financial aid, this number represents how much the student, or their family in the case of dependent students, is expected to contribute toward college expenses. This determines the amount of aid for which the student is eligible. It is calculated from the financial information provided by the student in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)-Students use this form to apply for federal student aid, such as federal grants, loans, or work-study. Financial need-The difference between the cost of attendance at a postsecondary institution and the amount that the student can afford as calculated by their EFC. Forbearance-A forbearance is a temporary cessation of loan principal payments under agreement with the loan servicer, usually for financial hardship. Interest continues to accrue. Grace period-The period of time between when a borrower graduates or leaves school and when he or she is required to begin monthly loan payments is known as the grace period. For Stafford Loans, the grace period is 6 months. If the loan is unsubsidized, interest will accrue during this period. Guaranty agency-Guaranty agencies administered the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program for states on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education from 1965 to 2010. Each state had a designated guaranty agency that received funds from the federal government and borrower fees to pay claims to lenders, process loan applications, maintain information on borrowers and loans, collect payments from defaulted borrowers, educate students about financial aid, and prevent loan defaults. Income-based repayment-In income-based repayment, the monthly loan amount due is based on the borrower's income. The U.S. Department of Education has several such plans with varying requirements, including the Income-Based Repayment Plan, Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan, Income-Contingent Repayment Plan, and the Income-Sensitive Repayment Plan. See https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven. Lender-Financial entities provide the capital for student loans. Under the FFEL program that existed from 1965 to 2010, lenders for federal student loans were commercial banks, credit unions, or private nonprofit financial institutions. Under the Direct Loan program, which began in 1993 and became the exclusive source of federal loans in 2010, the lender is the U.S. Department of Education. Loan discharge-A loan discharge is the release of a borrower from the obligation to repay his or her debt. Federal student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy after the borrower proves undue hardship in an adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy Perkins Loan-Federal Perkins Loans are loans that carry a very low interest rate and are offered by postsecondary institutions to students at any level who have exceptional need. The funds come from the institution, originating from the federal government through the campus-based Perkins Loan program. Not all institutions participate. Amounts are limited to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received. Details on Perkins Loans can be found at the following URL: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/perkins. PLUS Loan-Federal PLUS Loans are loans offered to parents of dependent undergraduates and, since 2006, graduate students (PLUS originally meant Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students). These loans carry higher interest rates, the interest payments are not subsidized, and the borrower cannot have an adverse credit history. Amounts are limited to the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received. Private student loans-Private student loans originate from commercial banks, state-affiliated nonprofit entities, and other institution sources. Unlike federal loans, private loans are not considered financial aid because they have no subsidy of any kind and the decision to offer them is entirely at the discretion of the lender. They carry market-based interest rates, often require a cosigner, may not have a fixed monthly payment, and generally have higher fees and interest rates than federal student loans. They also usually offer fewer protections to students who have difficulty with repayment. They are frequently an alternative source of funds for students who cannot qualify for federal loans or who need more money than they can receive through federal loans. Repayment-In repayment status, a borrower is required to make monthly payments on his or her loan(s). The standard repayment arrangement is fixed monthly payments for 10 years. Details concerning repayment can be found at the following URL: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand."}, {"section_title": "Stafford Loan-Stafford", "text": "Loans are federal loans offered to undergraduate or graduate students that carry low interest rates and can be subsidized or unsubsidized. Subsidized Stafford Loans are awarded based on financial need, and the federal government pays interest on the loan until the student begins repayment and during authorized periods of deferment thereafter. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are not need based, and students are charged interest for the duration of the loan, although the interest can be capitalized (converted into a lump sum and added to the principal). Amounts are limited by class level, dependency status, and cost of attendance. Under the FFEL program that existed from 1965 to 2010, the sources of funds for FFEL Stafford Loans were commercial banks, credit unions, and private nonprofit financial institutions. Under the Direct Loan program, which began in 1993 and became the exclusive source of federal loans in 2010, the source of funds for Direct Stafford Loans is the U.S. Department of Education. TEACH Grant-Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grants (TEACH) are awarded to students preparing to become teachers at participating postsecondary schools.

The sampled students were FTB students who attended institutions eligible for inclusion in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) that was fielded during the respective academic year. To be eligible for inclusion in BPS, students had to have met the following criteria: \u2022 began postsecondary education between July 1 (of 1995 or 2003) and June 30 (of 1996 or 2004); \u2022 were enrolled in an academic or vocational program to receive a degree or certificate or were taking at least one course for credit that could be applied toward the requirements for an academic degree; \u2022 were not concurrently enrolled in high school; and \u2022 had not completed a postsecondary course for credit after completing their high school requirements before July 1 (of 1995 or 2003). Sampling in NPSAS was done in two stages, first at the institution level and second at the student level. To be eligible for the NPSAS:96 sample, institutions were required to offer a postsecondary education program that was at least 3 months or 300 clock hours, to be open to the public, and to be located in the United States or Puerto Rico. In addition to these three criteria, a fourth was imposed in NPSAS:04: Institutions also had to be eligible to distribute federal financial aid funded through Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The institution sampling frame for each NPSAS was constructed from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data files for the prior academic year. Institutions were selected with probabilities proportional to composite measures of size, which were functions of a variety of overall sampling rates. These rates, in turn, varied by control and level of first institution and type of student.

Sample members for whom there were no matching data had not received any loans or grants from the Stafford, PLUS, or Pell Grant programs included in the database. While Parent PLUS Loans are included in NSLDS, they were excluded from analyses in this report because there were too few students in the cohorts with these loans for robust analysis, and the repayment of these loans is the responsibility of parents, not the students whose loan repayment is the focus of the analyses presented in this report. The match of sample member's Social Security numbers to the NSLDS records occurred at one point in time, April 14, 2016. The information obtained from the match included data on each student's entire federal financial aid history through that date. There is sometimes a delay, however, in entities' updating students' records in NSLDS. Because of this, only information through June 30, 2015, was considered when creating the variables used in this report. This ensures that all students' loan 2 Parent PLUS Loans are loans parents can take out in their own name to help fund their dependent children's postsecondary education. information had been updated through the same date. Additionally, because the variables indicate financial aid status for each cohort as of June 30, 2015, they capture outcomes exactly 20 school years after the 1995-96 cohort began postsecondary education and 12 school years after the 2003-04 cohort began. A third set of variables was calculated for the 1995-96 cohort at the 12-year mark, allowing comparison of the two cohorts 12 years after beginning postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Aggregating Data", "text": "In some cases, the data needed to create variables of interest do not exist in a single record within the database. For example, details on loan defaults are recorded in several places in NSLDS and must be combined. Additionally, most students take out more than one loan or receive more than one grant, and borrowers with multiple loans can have loans in different statuses. In order to make the enormous amount of data on each student's financial aid history more accessible to researchers, analysts aggregated data to the student level for delivery through particular derived variables. For example, key loan status information was identified for multiple loans and over time periods to create such variables as \"ever had a deferment on a loan.\" Students also usually borrow multiple loans in a similar time period to cover several school enrollment periods. Loans from the same school for the same time period are often grouped together for servicing, which includes the administrative tasks of billing, payment processing, and record keeping. Grouped loans tend to share the same status as they move through repayment. For this reason, a useful way to measure the progress of the student toward paying off all loans is to examine the status of their most recent loan, thus focusing on the loan for which the student has made the least progress in paying off their debt. All of this complicated loan repayment information was extracted from NSLDS and summarized to create the derived variables that are part of the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements."}, {"section_title": "Federal Student Aid Supplements", "text": "The 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements consist of data files providing both the data collected from NSLDS and derived variables generated from those NSLDS data.

Supplement data are available to researchers through the same mechanisms used to release all BPS data: PowerStats, a web-based software tool available to the general APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY public and discussed in more detail later in this appendix, and restricted-use data files, which are available to researchers who obtain a restricted-use data license.

Sampling error is the error in statistical analyses that arises from the unrepresentativeness of the sample examined. Sampling error exists in all samplebased datasets, including BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, because different samples, although realizations of the same design and methods, will produce different estimates of population parameters. The standard error measures the degree to which sample-based estimates vary about the expected population value under repeated sampling. Standard errors for the estimates in tables 1-5 are found in tables C-1 through C-5. Nonsampling error is a general term for the deviations of estimates from their true values due to a reason other than the sample chosen. Nonsampling errors are due to a number of issues, including but not limited to nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. When there are multiple sources of data for some variables (for example, the CPS, institutional records, student interviews, and the NSC), as exist in BPS, differences in reporting across data sources can lead to inconsistencies among variables. Nonresponse bias is the bias that results when respondents differ in meaningful ways from nonrespondents. This specific form of nonsampling error can arise at any level of data collection. Institutions may fail to provide enrollment lists or student records in the NPSAS base year, or students may fail to respond to an interview or items within an interview. Whether at the institution-, student-, or item-/variable-level, whenever nonresponse exceeded 15 percent, statisticians estimated the bias due to nonresponse. Student-level nonresponse bias analyses examined the bias before and after the study nonresponse weight adjustment by comparing key characteristics of respondents and nonrespondents. In BPS:96/01, of the 77 variable categories used to evaluate student-level nonresponse bias, 12 categories had significant bias between respondents and nonrespondents before weighting, and two categories had significant bias after weighting. Those two categories were \"yes, prior respondent\" and \"no, not prior respondent.\" In BPS:04/09, of the 78 variable categories used to evaluate student-level nonresponse bias, 53 categories had significant bias before weighting, and one category had significant bias after weighting. That category was \"institution undergraduate enrollment between 0 and 1,821 students.\" Item-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on interview items with particularly high levels of nonresponse. In both BPS:96/01 and BPS:04/09, questions about respondent income, spouse income, and credit card balances had relatively high rates of nonresponse. In BPS:96/01, seven interview items were examined because they had more than 10 percent missing data and more than 50 nonrespondents: cumulative undergraduate GPA (17 percent), Lifetime Learning tax credit 1999 (10 percent), gross annual salary for current job (23 percent), gross annual salary for first postenrollment job (27 percent), gross salary for 2000 (15 percent), spouse's gross salary for 2000 (23 percent), and total balance due on all credit cards (15 percent). In BPS:04/09, 18 interview items were examined because they had more than 5 percent missing data and were administered to at least 100 respondents: intensity of enrollment 2008 at school 3 (7 percent), currently enrolled in postbaccalaureate program 2 (8 percent), type of postbaccalaureate degree or certificate program 2 (7 percent), enrollment intensity in postbaccalaureate program 2 (6 percent), enrolled for any other postbaccalaureate degrees or certificates 2 (6 percent), primary major string (9 percent), secondary major string (6 percent), job duties (15 percent), industry string (21 percent), years in same or similar job (7 percent), months in same or similar job (14 percent), respondent income in 2008 (8 percent), respondent income estimate for 2008 (18 percent), spouse's income for 2008 (8 percent), spouse's income estimate for 2008 (43 percent), balance due on all credit cards (5 percent), spouse's total student loan amount (9 percent), and amount of spouse's loans still owed (6 percent).

The data are not, however, representative of all Pell Grant recipients or all federal borrowers for any time period. Estimates of amounts borrowed or aspects of loan repayment that are produced from these data will not match estimates from other U.S. Department of Education loan data from the same time period, including such estimates as those based on the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) cohorts' data; the quarterly federal loan volume published by the Federal Student Aid Data Center, Office of Postsecondary Education; or financial aid data from IPEDS. Data drawn from transactional databases change over time because the data are constantly being updated and corrected. Information comes from many sources, and the sources have different schedules of updating and correcting. Also, events such as death or bankruptcy can take years to be reported. Thus, at any given time there is a risk that any specific value might be in error. This also means that data covering the same time period may not match exactly if they are extracted at different times. However, the longer the time elapsed between the end of the observation period and extraction, the more likely the data are to be accurate because more updates have occurred in the intervening time. For example, all variables in the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplement were computed as of June 30, 2015, but because these data were extracted several months later, on April 14, 2016, there was time for the data to be updated before the Supplement variables were computed."}, {"section_title": "Loan Default Variables", "text": "Several variables used in this analysis were created to indicate federal loan default, but these measures of default differ in crucial ways from default measures published by FSA, such as the cohort default rate, the budget lifetime default rate, and the cumulative lifetime default rate. Additionally, FSA releases measures of the loan portfolio by loan status, including default: \u2022 The cohort default rate is the most well-known measure of default, defined by statute and used over the past 25 years. It was originally defined as the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment in a fiscal year and defaulted by the end of the following fiscal year. In addition to this 2-year cohort default rate, FSA also computes a 3-year rate, i.e., the percentage of borrowers who defaulted by the end of the second fiscal year after they began repayment. 4 These rates exclude defaults that occur outside the 2-or 3-year window, as well as defaults that are reversed or rehabilitated before the end of the cohort default period. \u2022 The budget lifetime default rate is a projection of the percentage of Stafford Loan dollars that will be in default in the projected 20-year repayment period of a loan cohort. \u2022 The cumulative lifetime default rate is the percentage of Stafford, Parent PLUS, Graduate PLUS, and consolidation loans that enter repayment during a particular fiscal year and have been defaulted on through the end of the most recent fiscal year. Both the budget lifetime default rate and the cumulative lifetime default rate are calculated by cohort year, with the first rate based on the total dollar amount of loans projected 20 years into the future and the second rate based on the number of loans and looking retrospectively from the year for which it is calculated. \u2022 The loan portfolio data measure the cumulative outstanding amount of loans, measured in dollars, in default (and in other statuses) and the number of recipients with any loan in that status at the end of each quarter. The default variables created for the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements vary from the FSA default measures just described in a number of ways. Table B-4 presents a comparison of the default rates. First, all variables created for the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements, as well as variables created from NSLDS data for previous BPS datasets, use the student or borrower as the level of analysis. With the exception of the cohort default rate, none of the FSA default rates discussed above is a borrower-level rate. Second, the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplement variables that measure default rates, although borrower-level variables, differ from the cohort default rate in the timeframe over which they are defined. The default variables created for the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements measure defaults for any loan that a borrower took out in the first 12 or 20 years after beginning postsecondary education. Therefore, default rates computed from the 2015 Federal Student Aid Supplements are higher than other published rates.    Second, because capitalized interest is sometimes included in the outstanding principal balance amount in NSLDS data, the amount owed due to accrued interest cannot always be clearly distinguished from the original principal. For example, when a borrower begins repayment, interest accrued on an unsubsidized Stafford Loan can be added to the principal amount. In the case of default, the outstanding interest balance at the time of default is added to the outstanding principal amount. Also, in some instances, loan consolidation can result in capitalized interest being included in the new outstanding principal amount. All of these conditions represent instances where the principal amount owed can exceed the amount borrowed. Third, different amount-owed variables include different types of loans. Two loan types that present analytic challenges are consolidation loans and PLUS Loans. Consolidation loans simply transfer the same debt from multiple loans to a single loan. Therefore, to avoid double-counting debt, it is necessary to count only the latest consolidation amount or only the original underlying loan amounts. For PLUS Loans, there are two types: Parent PLUS Loans, which are held by the parents of dependent students, and Graduate PLUS Loans, which were created in 2006 for graduate students. Parent PLUS Loans are not debt held by respondents and are excluded from all variables used in this analysis, whereas Graduate PLUS Loan debt is included. Finally, NSLDS data cover only federal loans and do not include debt from private sources."}, {"section_title": "Deferment Variables", "text": "Several derived variables were created to summarize the large amount of data in NSLDS on deferments. NSLDS records every deferment granted for every loan by every borrower, including the start and end dates and type of each deferment. The 32 deferment types were summarized into six deferment reason categories relevant for research. In addition, some derived variables provide such counts as the total number of times a borrower deferred payments among all loans or the number of times a borrower deferred loan payments for a particular reason. Examples of other summary-derived variables include the average number of deferments per loan, the most common deferment type for a borrower among all the deferment categories, and whether a borrower had a deferment."}, {"section_title": "PowerStats", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using PowerStats, one of the web-based software applications available at NCES's DataLab website (https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/). adjusted standard errors, which are necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences between estimates.
