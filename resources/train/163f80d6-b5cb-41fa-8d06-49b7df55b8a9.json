In this study, we aimed to develop a risk prediction model to predict fast decline in the A\u03b2+ MCI population using multimodal biomarkers. We included 186 A\u03b2+ MCI patients who underwent florbetapir PET, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, and FDG PET at baseline. We defined conversion to dementia within 3 years (= fast decline) as the outcome. The associations of potential covariates (MCI stage, APOE4 genotype, corrected hippocampal volume(HV), FDG PET SUVR, AV45 PET SUVR, CSF A\u03b2, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)) with the outcome were tested and nomograms were constructed using logistic regression models in the training dataset (n=124, n of fast decliners=52). The model was internally validated with the testing dataset (n=62, n of fast decliners=22). The multivariable analysis (including CSF t-tau) showed that MCI stage (LMCI vs. EMCI; OR 15.88, 95% CI 4.59, 54.88), APOE4 (OR 5.65, 95% CI 1.52, 20.98), corrected HV*1000 (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09, 0.57), FDG SUVR*10 (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27, 0.71), and log e CSF t-tau (OR 6.20, 95% CI 1.48, 25.96) were associated with being fast decliners. In the second model including CSF ptau instead of t-tau, the above associations remained the same, with a significant association between CSF p-tau (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.26, 16.31) and fast decline. The constructed nomograms showed excellent predictive performance (90%) on validation with the testing dataset. Among A\u03b2+ MCI patients, our findings suggested that multimodal AD biomarkers are significantly associated with being classified as fast decliners. A nomogram incorporating these biomarkers might be useful in early treatment decisions or stratified enrollment of this population into clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 4 biomarkers, nomogram, conversion to dementia"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) Petersen et al., 2001) . However, rates of clinical deterioration of MCI patients are variable, as some patients quickly progress to AD dementia while others remain stable or even revert to normal cognition (Busse et al., 2006; Larrieu et al., 2002; Petersen, 2004) . This may be attributable to heterogeneous underlying pathologies of this population (DeCarli, 2003) . Rapid development of molecular imaging has enabled the detection of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), a hallmark of AD pathology, using positron emission tomography (PET) in living patients, both in the MCI as well as the dementia stages.\nPrevious studies have shown that 40-60% of MCI patients are A\u03b2 positive (A\u03b2 +) on PET;\nthese patients are classified as MCI due to AD, with evidence of 40% to 80% risk of conversion to AD within 3 years, a level that is 4 to 9 fold higher than their A\u03b2 negative counterparts (Doraiswamy et al., 2014; Okello et al., 2009; Wolk et al., 2009) .\nAlthough A\u03b2 is an AD-specific pathology, A\u03b2 burden is not linearly correlated with symptom severity. AD biomarker modeling shows that tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), hypometabolism and brain atrophy, as more downstream biomarkers, are more closely associated with clinical symptoms. In fact, a recent AV-1451 PET study (Maass et al., 2017) , which investigated NFT burden in the brain, reported that A\u03b2+ MCI patients exhibit in-vivo Braak stages ranging from I/II to V/VI. Also, previous studies have shown that higher CSF ptau levels (Buerger et al., 2002; Ewers et al., 2007) , hippocampal atrophy (Jack et al., 1999) , and hypometabolism measured by [F18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET are able to significantly predict conversion to AD in MCI patients (Drzezga et al., 2003) as well.\nTherefore, it would be reasonable to expect that A\u03b2+ MCI patients could be classified into fast and slow decliners according to their downstream biomarker status. However, most A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 6 previous studies have included all MCI patients regardless of A\u03b2 status. As abnormal neurodegeneration markers such as hypometabolism and hippocampal atrophy can be observed even in non-AD conditions, these multimodal biomarkers might not be able to specifically reflect the prognosis of A\u03b2+ MCI patients. Also, it is not known whether neocortical A\u03b2 burden and presence of APOE4 genotype are associated with disease progression in specifically A\u03b2+ MCI patients. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate the importance of these multimodal biomarkers as predictors for clinical outcomes specifically in the A\u03b2+ MCI population.\nThe predictive power of these multimodal biomarkers is particularly important, because while drugs targeting A\u03b2 have been developed and actively applied in clinical trials in AD dementia, most have ended in failure. In this regard, many recent clinical trials have focused on A\u03b2+ population, not yet demented, as a target group. However, it is still not clear how long of a delay exists from the beginning of A\u03b2 deposition to dementia development, although a previous study showed that this delay may be decades long (Villemagne et al., 2013) . Therefore, narrowing the range of best candidates even among A\u03b2+ MCI patients is clinically essential. Specifically, identifying the A\u03b2+ MCI patients subjects likely to progress most rapidly is critical to early treatment decisions as well as to stratified enrollment in clinical trials.\nIn this study, we aimed to develop a model to predict the risk of fast decliners in the A\u03b2+ MCI population using multimodal biomarkers. To promote the application of this prediction model to the clinical setting, we used a nomogram method, which is graph-based, simple, and easy to quickly interpret. We hypothesized that not only a combination of neurodegeneration markers such as reduced hippocampal volume on MRI, hypometabolism measured by FDG PET and increased CSF tau levels, but also A\u03b2 burden or APOE4 would be associated with disease progression, because it is possible that A\u03b2 burden and APOE4 might contribute to A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 7 disease progression through a pathway independent of tau or neurodegeneration. We also expected that a nomogram featuring these markers could intuitively predict the possibility of A\u03b2+ MCI patients being fast decliners at an individual level."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner (Weiner et al., 2010) . Our study population primarily consisted of subjects from ADNI Go and ADNI-2. The major goal of ADNI has been to reveal the progression of MCI and AD using MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment. Full inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in detail at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/. Briefly, all subjects were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, had completed at least 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, and were free of any other significant neurologic diseases. MCI participants had a subjective memory complaint with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 (Petersen et al., 2010) . The stage of MCI (early and late) patients are determined using the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory II; Early MCI (EMCI) subjects must have education adjusted scores between approximately 0.5 and 1.5 SD below the mean of Cognitively Normal (on delayed recall of one paragraph from WMS Logical Memory II). All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "8\nIn this study, we included MCI patients who underwent 3.0T MRI scanning and 18F-AV45 (florbetapir) PET at baseline. As of 24 th January 2018, a total of 463 patients met this qualification, and their baseline diagnoses were EMCI (n = 305) and late MCI (LMCI, n = 158). Among these, we included in the present study 254 patients with A\u03b2 positivity on AV45 PET, which we defined as standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) above a cutoff value of 1.11 (Landau et al., 2013; Landau et al., 2012) (145 EMCI and 109 LMCI).\nPatients were followed up at 6-to 12-month intervals with clinical diagnostic assessments.\nConversion to AD was established at individual recruitment sites (Landau et al., 2011b) , and we defined fast decliners as patients who converted to AD within three years of follow-up after baseline PET and MRI scans. A total of 53 patients who were followed up for less than three years with no AD conversion were excluded, and 15 additional patients were excluded from analyses because of missing data at baseline (11 for missing CSF data, three for missing hippocampal volume, and one for missing FDG SUVR). Thus, 74 fast and 112 slow decliners (patients who converted after 3 years (n = 18) or did not convert during the 3-year follow-up (n = 104)) were included in analyses ( Fig. 1 ).\n10 Nomograms were formulated based on the results of multivariable analysis using R 3.4.3(http://www.r-project.org) with rms packages. Detailed methods about nomogram construction have been described previously (Jang et al., 2017) . To validate the predictive accuracy of a prediction model developed using the training dataset, we quantified nomogram performance by discrimination and calibration. In discrimination step, predictive performance was determined with a concordance index (C-index, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), which quantifies the level of concordance between predicted probabilities and the actual chance of having the event of interest. Internal validation of performance was estimated with a bootstrapping method (1000 replications) and a 10-fold cross validation of the training dataset, and the testing dataset. Calibration was graphically assessed with the relationship between the actual observed probabilities and predicted probabilities (calibration curve).\nFinally, we tried to show that final prediction models we constructed had best model fitness and predictive performance compared with others. Therefore, we compared the fitness and predictive performance of different models with various combinations of biomarkers using the likelihood ratio test and 95% CI for AUC, respectively. We made several models by adding, one by one, independent variables (in the order of easiness of access in clinic \n15 neurofibrillary tangle burden (Buerger et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2003) , which itself is well correlated with disease progression in AD, it is reasonable to expect that elevated CSF p-tau could predict the risk of A\u03b2+ MCI patients being classified as fast decliners. This is because, while all participants have elevated brain A\u03b2, they might exhibit variable Braak stages from I/II to V/IV (Maass et al., 2017) , and more detailed information regarding p-tau could more specifically inform risk of future decline. Furthermore, our results show that nonspecific AD neurodegeneration markers, such as hippocampal atrophy or hypometabolism (representing synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss), are also strongly associated with clinical deterioration once patients have elevated A\u03b2 deposition on PET.\nAs expected, CSF A\u03b2 levels and AV45 PET SUVR were not associated with fast decliners in the multivariable analyses. The previous study suggested that a combination of CSF A\u03b2 and CSF tau had better predictive accuracy for AD conversion in MCI patients than On the contrary, we included only A\u03b2+ MCI patients at the first place, CSF A\u03b2 were not found to be associated with being fast decliners in multivariable analysis. Likewise, considering that the amyloid cascade hypothesis states that A\u03b2 accumulation leads to a cascade of events including tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal degeneration as downstream processes, A\u03b2 load on AV45 PET scans would not be related with being classified as fast decliners after adjusting for CSF tau, neurodegeneration markers, and cognition (as MCI stage). In this study, we also found that APOE4 carriage was a significant predictor for fast decliners group status among A\u03b2+ MCI patients, which suggests that the effect of APOE4 on disease progression in the A\u03b2+ MCI population may be as important as its effect on A\u03b2 deposition in normal individuals (Risacher et al., 2015) . This might be\n16 because APOE4 affects cognition in A\u03b2 independent as well as A\u03b2 dependent mechanisms, by inducing tau hyperphosphorylation, and undergoing neuron-specific proteolysis subsequently leading to mitochondrial energy disruptions and cell death (Mahley et al., 2006) .\nOur final major finding was that the predictive model using multimodal AD biomarkers showed an excellent predictive performance (90%) on validation with the testing dataset for predicting who would be fast decliners among the A\u03b2+ MCI population. Although clinical information such as MCI stage was found to be an important predictive variable, we demonstrated that the model with MCI stage alone performed worse than the model with MCI stage and additional multimodal biomarkers, in terms of predictive performance and model fitness. Therefore, we could insist that implementing these multimodal biomarkers in clinical practice ensure more accurate prediction for disease progression in A\u03b2+ MCI population. Importantly, the nomograms we constructed in this study are easy to apply to clinical data. In the present study, we used the ADNI dataset; ADNI is a large cohort of wellcharacterized subjects, and clinical and imaging data are based on standardized protocols and analyses. Therefore, as shown in Figure 3 , we could easily apply our nomograms to ADNI datasets to predict the probability of being fast declines. In terms of classification of patients, we expect that this prediction model may provide additional risk stratification information, which is helpful to optimize the selection of patients who may benefit from A\u03b2+ targeting therapies in clinical trials.\nWe were able to conduct this study because of the availability of various clinical data through ADNI. However, there are several limitations in this study. First, the definition of fast or slow decliners was based on the diagnosis with respect to conversion to AD, not on the trajectories of objective neuropsychological test results. However, it is meaningful to predict which patients are closest to clinical deterioration in a clinical setting. Second, we used an a priori established SUVR cutoff for A\u03b2 positivity, despite the clinical utility of visual assessment. However, a quantitative SUVR cutoff is more sensitive compared to visual assessment to predict at-risk patients (Schreiber et al., 2015) , and we could easily obtain SUVR values from the ADNIMERGE dataset, which enables agreement with many other ADNI studies in terms of the study methods."}, {"section_title": "Clinical data collection", "text": "Basic demographics and clinical data were extracted from the ADNIMERGE dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)) from CSF drawn at baseline.

We then compared clinical and biomarker characteristics between these groups and developed predictive models for fast decliners group status using multivariable analysis with multimodal biomarkers as potential predictors. Our major findings were as follows: 1) about 40% of A\u03b2+ MCI patients progressed to dementia within three years, and were classified as fast decliners; 2) advanced MCI stage (LMCI), higher CSF t-tau or p-tau, lower HV, hypometabolism in AD signature regions (=lower FDG SUVR), and the presence of APOE4 were significantly predictive of fast decliners group status among A\u03b2+ MCI patients; 3) the predictive model for being classified as fast decliners that we developed using these biomarkers showed an excellent predictive performance (90%) on validation with the testing dataset.\nOur first major finding was that about 40% of A\u03b2+ MCI patients progressed to dementia within three years. In the present study, the conversion rate among A\u03b2+ MCI patients seems to be lower than previously reported (Okello et al., 2009; van Rossum et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2018) , as prior studies have shown that 50-80% of A\u03b2+ MCI patients convert to dementia in 3 years. In this study, about half the study subjects (104 of 186) were diagnosed with EMCI at the time of AV45 imaging, which might have contributed to a low dementia conversion rate; a previous study demonstrated that EMCI patients take longer to progress to dementia compared with LMCI (Jessen et al., 2014) . This is also consistent with our study finding that LMCI has a 15-fold higher risk of being fast decliners. Therefore, this finding suggests that even A\u03b2+ MCI patients have varied clinical courses. Additionally, we investigated the dementia conversion rate in A\u03b2-MCI patients using the same ADNI dataset, although we did not include it in the present study. The result was that, among 158 patients who were followed up for 3 years, 152 patients (96.2%) were slow decliners while only six patients (3.8%) were fast decliners, from which we concluded that A\u03b2-MCI patients have a much lower chance of dementia conversion in three years than A\u03b2+ patients.\nOur second major finding was that higher CSF t-tau or p-tau, lower HV, hypometabolism in AD signature regions, and the presence of APOE4 were significantly predictive of A\u03b2+ MCI patients being classified as fast decliners.
