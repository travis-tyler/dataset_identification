[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family that emerged in late 2019 and has caused morbidity, mortality, and economic disruption on a global scale with few precedents.1 The Coronaviridae family includes four species/strains that are endemic in the human population\u2014HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43 (Betacoronavirus 1 species)\u2014and are usually associated with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, although they can cause severe illness in immunocompromised patients.2 Two other species, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, have recently emerged and cause severe disease in humans. Like the other human-infecting CoVs (HCoVs),3\n,\n4 SARS-CoV-2 infection can elicit a robust antibody response in humans,5\n,\n6 and this response represents a major focus of widespread efforts to develop accurate diagnostics and strategies for passive and active immunization against infection.7, 8, 9 Existing serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity generally use full-length viral proteins or domains\u2014Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S\u2014as antigenic baits, followed by enzyme-linked or fluorescent detection.9 These assays provide a single measure of antibody reactivity, which represents a composite signal across many epitopes, and are able to detect viral exposure with a range of accuracies.10\n,\n11 Neutralization assays using either native or pseudotyped viruses have also been developed.12 It remains to be seen how these different assays will perform as diagnostics or correlates of the protection conferred by infection or vaccination.\nRelative to protein-based analyses of the humoral response, epitope-level assays have the potential to add several layers of information. First, although SARS-CoV-2 proteins are generally distinct from other HCoVs, some regions of strong conservation exist,1\n,\n13 meaning that there is the potential for immune cross-reactivity that can only be resolved at the epitope level. It was recently demonstrated that a large fraction of non-exposed individuals have T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating cross-reactivity with existing responses, possibly those generated against homologous peptides from endemic HCoVs.14 In the case of antibody responses, cross-reactivity has been described between the more closely related SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.15\n,\n16 Epitope-resolved analyses therefore have the potential to identify antigens that may discriminate related CoVs, leading to more specific diagnostic assays. High levels of sequence conservation may also indicate functional essentiality; therefore, by highlighting potentially cross-reactive epitopes in conserved regions of the proteome, epitope-level assays can identify antibodies and targets with therapeutic potential, against which viral escape may be more difficult.17\n\nA second rationale for generating epitope-resolved views is that antibody recognition of different protein regions can have divergent functional consequences, including neutralization potential. For CoVs, antibodies binding the surface-exposed, receptor-binding S protein exhibit the greatest neutralizing potential,18\n,\n19 but these antibodies can recognize a wide variety of epitopes within the protein, each with the potential for different functional consequences. This likely accounts for the imperfect correlation between the titers of S-binding antibodies and viral neutralization activity across individuals.20 Due to its interaction with the host entry receptor (the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]), the RBD of S represents the predominant target of vaccination and monoclonal antibody development strategies, and a growing number of antibodies against this domain have been described.20, 21, 22, 23 However, the RBD is one of the less conserved regions of the CoV proteome, and antibodies against epitopes outside the RBD have also been shown to have neutralizing activity21\n,\n24; these may act in various ways, including by preventing important protease cleavage events and/or conformational changes required for successful entry into cells. However, antibodies that recognize epitopes within the N protein, which coats the viral genome and is contained within mature viral particles, likely provide little or no neutralization potential, but may be useful signatures for differentiating vaccine responses from those resulting from natural virus infection, a strategy already used for other viruses.25\n,\n26 In addition to the different neutralization potential, it is possible that unfavorable distributions of epitope reactivity can contribute to immunopathology\u2014for example, through antibody-dependent enhancement,27, 28, 29 although this phenomenon remains to be demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2.30\n\nPeptide sub-sequences have been used for decades as probes to detect antibodies recognizing linear epitopes within the full-length proteins from which they are derived.31\n,\n32 Although unable to detect antibodies whose binding depends on elements that are discontinuous in the primary sequence, this strategy has the advantage that it enables the parallel design, synthesis, and assay of thousands of epitope-level antigen baits. In its simplest format, peptides can be used individually\u2014for example, in separate wells in an ELISA. A recent study used this approach to identify two linear epitopes in S protein that were targeted by neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors.24 More powerful assays involve sets of peptides that are assayed in multiplex using either spatial addressing, in the case of peptide arrays,33 or DNA indexing, in the case of phage display libraries.34 Using the latter approach, the highly multiplexed and epitope-resolved detection of antibodies to viruses has been demonstrated with high sensitivity and specificity.35\n\nHere, we present a synthetic biology approach to highly multiplexed peptide-based serological assays (PepSeq) in which libraries of peptide baits, each covalently coupled to a DNA barcode, are synthesized from high-complexity DNA pools using a simple and fully in vitro approach. Library synthesis takes advantage of in vitro transcription and translation, including an intramolecular coupling mediated by puromycin,36\n,\n37 and the DNA-barcoded peptides can then be used to probe antibodies using a high-throughput sequencing readout. We use this platform to synthesize libraries of overlapping 30-mer peptides covering all HCoV proteomes and assay these against sera from prepandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors. Our results demonstrate the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and reveal multiple recurrent antibody epitopes, including two Spike epitopes at which antibody responses cross-react between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more endemic HCoVs. We further demonstrate that these cross-reactive antibodies preferentially bind to endemic HCoV peptides, suggesting that the response to SARS-CoV-2 at these regions is shaped by previous CoV exposure."}, {"section_title": "A highly multiplexed peptide assay to evaluate CoV antibody responses ::: Results", "text": "To generate a broad and high-resolution view of the antibody response to HCoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, we designed and synthesized 2 separate DNA-barcoded 30-mer peptide libraries (PepSeq) using the method described previously36 (Figure 1\nA). Each library began as a pool of DNA oligonucleotide templates, which was modified using bulk enzymatic steps consisting of transcription, ligation of a puromycin-containing adaptor oligo, translation, and reverse transcription. One library was focused on SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) and contained 2,107 peptides representing the Spike and Nucleocapsid\u2014the 2 most immunogenic CoV proteins\u2014at high redundancy, with an average of 38 peptides covering each amino acid position (Figure 1B). The other library (human virome [HV]) comprised 244,000 peptides designed to cover the full proteomes of all of the viruses known to infect humans, as of the end of 2018. Therefore, HV included peptides from the complete proteomes of 6/7 HCoVs: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C). The SCV2 library also included 373 positive control peptides that we have previously shown are commonly recognized across the human population (unpublished data). These controls represent a subset of the HV peptides and were designed from 55 different virus species.\nIn total, we assayed and analyzed 55 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent and 69 SARS-CoV-2-negative (both pre- and postpandemic) serum/plasma samples using the SCV2 and/or HV PepSeq libraries (Tables 1\nand S1); 96% of the convalescent samples (53/55) and 94% of the negative samples (65/69) were assayed separately with both libraries. For each assay, we incubated our PepSeq probes overnight with serum/plasma (or buffer as a negative control), captured the immunoglobulin G (IgG) on protein G beads, washed away the non-binding library members, eluted binders, and then performed PCR and high-throughput sequencing on the DNA tags to identify the distribution of bound peptides. Each sample was run in duplicate, and we observed strong signal concordance between technical replicates of the same sera, including those run on different days (Figure S1). Comparative analysis of peptide abundance between serum/plasma and buffer-only negative controls revealed a strong correlation in abundance for the majority of peptides, while a subset of peptides showed distinctly higher relative abundance in each serum/plasma sample (Figure 1D). These latter peptides are those that have been enriched by binding to serum IgG. To quantify peptide enrichment, we calculated Z scores for each peptide in each sample. For each peptide, relative abundance was normalized to the corresponding value for the buffer-only negative controls, and this normalized value was compared among peptides with similar abundance in the buffer-only controls. Each Z score corresponds to the number of standard deviations away from the mean. For a peptide to be considered enriched, we also required a minimum fold-change compared to buffer-only controls and a minimum normalized read count. Z score, fold change, and read count thresholds were chosen to minimize false negatives based on the analysis of buffer-only controls."}, {"section_title": "Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antibody epitopes ::: Results", "text": "As expected, multiple positive control peptides were found to be enriched in every serum sample that we tested (Figure 2\nA), and there was no significant difference between convalescent and negative samples in the number of enriched control peptides (t test, p = 0.47). In contrast, we detected significantly more SARS-CoV-2 peptides enriched in convalescent samples compared to controls in both target proteins (t test; S: p = 2.2e\u22127, 6.2-fold difference; N: p = 1.9e\u22126, 15.7-fold difference) (Figure 2A). We observed at least 1 enriched SARS-CoV-2 peptide from 50/55 convalescent samples (91%), with an average of 18 enriched peptides per sample; while enriched SARS-CoV-2 peptides were only observed in 25/68 (37%) negative samples, with an average of 2 enriched peptides per sample. For the convalescent donors, there was no correlation between the number of enriched control and SARS-CoV-2 peptides (p = 0.94). Therefore, the absence of SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in some convalescent samples does not appear to be related to sample quality or a generally low concentration of IgG. We also did not observe a significant effect of gender in overall SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in convalescent donors (t test, p = 0.56), nor a significant correlation between SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and the number of days between PCR diagnosis and sample collection (Pearson correlation = \u22120.13, p = 0.35) (Figure S2). Notably, however, the five convalescent donors without detectable SARS-CoV-2 peptide enrichment (Table S1) were well below the median age of the full convalescent donor population (22\u201343 versus 50). In fact, overall, we observed a significant positive correlation between age and the number of enriched SARS-CoV-2 peptides in convalescent donors (Pearson correlation = 0.33, p = 0.014), while a weak trend in the opposite direction was observed for the number of enriched control peptides (Pearson correlation = \u22120.21, p = 0.13), indicating that this pattern was not due to an overall higher level of reactivity in samples from older patients.\nIn total, we identified IgG reactivity (i.e., peptide enrichment) against 229 and 95 SARS-CoV-2 peptides in convalescent and negative control samples, respectively; 70 of these peptides were enriched in both sample types. The peptides enriched in convalescent samples clustered together into 10 putative epitopes within the S protein and 9 putative epitopes within the N protein (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S2). These epitopes were recognized at a range of prevalences across the sampled population. The 6 most widely recognized epitopes\u2014S positions 560\u2013572, 819\u2013824, and 1,150\u20131,156 and N positions 166\u2013169, 223\u2013229, and 390\u2013402\u2014were each detected in 13%\u201349% of the convalescent samples tested (median = 28.2%, n = 55), and all of the convalescent samples with at least 1 enriched SARS-CoV-2 peptide were reactive to at least 1 of these 6 immunodominant regions (Figures 2B and 2C). Notably, we also observed the enrichment of peptides from 4/6 of these immunodominant regions in negative control samples, although at much lower rates (1.5%\u201320% reactive, median = 2.2%, n = 68). At the other extreme, 9 (47%) of the observed epitope regions were each detected in only a single convalescent donor. Overall, relatively little reactivity was detected to peptides within the RBD, suggesting that these epitopes require protein conformations that are not well represented by linear 30-mer peptides.\nTo evaluate the potential for the highly recurrent S protein epitopes to be targeted by neutralizing antibodies, we evaluated these within the context of the structure of the protein. The inferred core regions (i.e., sequences present in all enriched peptides from assays of convalescent donors) of each of these epitopes were mapped onto a rendering of the three-dimensional structure of the native S trimer (Figure S3A). All three epitope regions are accessible for antibody binding on the surface of the trimer. The most widely recognized region (1,150\u20131,156) is located within the \u201cstem helix\u201d just upstream and partially overlapping with the heptad repeat region 2 (HR2). This region is proximal to the transmembrane domain and unresolved in the native structure; however, comparison of pre- and postfusion structures indicated that the HR2 epitope lies within a region that undergoes a dramatic conformational rearrangement during fusion (Figure S3B). The second epitope (819\u2013824) resides near the S2\u2032 cleavage site, spanning the fusion peptide (FP), whose exposure and incorporation into the host membrane are essential steps in virus entry into cells. Based on their proximity to these important functional sites, these epitopes are hereafter referred to as HR2 and FP, respectively. Finally, the 560\u2013572 epitope occurs in the subdomain SD1 region (in the S1 subunit but C-terminal of the RBD).\nTo explore the diagnostic potential of the six highly recurrent S and N epitopes, we compared the maximum Z scores per epitope across the full set of convalescent and negative samples (Figure 2D). Across all six epitopes, we observed an overall shift toward higher Z scores in convalescent samples, which suggests the presence of additional antibody reactivity at these epitopes that is below our current enrichment thresholds. In fact, at 5/6 of these epitopes, we observed a significant difference in the mean of the Z score distributions between convalescent and negative samples (t test, S560: p = 0.001, FP: p = 0.036, HR2: p = 0.008, N223: p = 0.043, N390: p = 0.008). To estimate the combined diagnostic performance of these six epitopes, we built logistic regression models using the maximum peptide Z score for each of the epitopes as features and the donor status (convalescent versus negative) as the predicted outcome. Cross-validated models each trained on a randomly selected subset of 70% of donors and tested on the remaining 30% gave a mean area under the curve of 0.92 (Figure 2E)."}, {"section_title": "Conserved antibody epitopes across the HCoVs ::: Results", "text": "The observation of reactivity against several SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in a small subset of negative donors (Figure 2) suggests the presence of cross-reactive antibodies raised in response to other antigens. We hypothesized that some of these responses may be explained by exposure to conserved protein regions of the related endemic HCoVs. To test this hypothesis, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 reactivity profiles with patterns of reactivity to 244,000 peptides designed from hundreds of other human-infecting viruses, including all of the endemic HCoVs (HV library). Specifically, we performed comprehensive pairwise correlations of reactivity for the 6 immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes detected using the SCV2 library (described above) versus each of the 244,000 peptides of the HV library, across all convalescent and negative donors (Figure 3\nA). For 3 of these epitopes (FP, HR2, and N166), we detected a subset of HV peptides whose reactivity was strongly correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 response. Almost exclusively, these highly correlated responses corresponded to CoV peptides with homology to the focal epitope, in each case including peptides from the closely related but non-endemic SARS-CoV. For the N166 epitope in the Nucleocapsid protein, only the homologous SARS-CoV peptides were highly correlated with detected SARS-CoV-2 reactivity, indicating a lack of cross-reactivity with homologous regions in endemic HCoVs. In contrast, at the HR2 epitope, in addition to SARS-CoV peptides, the reactivity profile of SARS-CoV-2 strongly correlated with those of 3 homologous peptides from the more distantly related Betacoronavirus 1 species, which includes HCoV-OC43. This is consistent with the presence of antibodies that cross-react with both SARS and HCoV-OC43 peptides. Finally, we observed evidence for broad cross-reactivity across CoVs at the FP epitope. At this epitope, the SARS-CoV-2 response correlated strongly with 18 homologous CoV peptides, including peptides from all 4 endemic HCoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and Alphacoronavirus 1.\nIn further support of antibody cross-reactivity, the observed correlations in reactivity were generally consistent with the patterns of sequence conservation between species at each epitope (Figures 3B and 3C). The FP epitope, for example, is highly conserved across members of both the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera (Figure 3B). This is also the epitope at which we observed correlated reactivity across all of the included CoV species. However, the HR2 epitope is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 (all members of Betacoronavirus), but not with HCoV-229E (Alphacoronavirus) (Figure 3B), again consistent with the detected patterns of correlation. Despite modest amino acid-level conservation between SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic HCoVs at N166, we did not observe any evidence of cross-reactivity with endemic species; however, correlation with SARS-CoV peptides at this epitope is consistent with perfect conservation between the 2 SARS viruses at this region. Finally, the complete lack of sequence conservation between SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic CoVs at the S560, N223, and N390 epitopes is consistent with the absence of any evidence of cross-reactivity. However, the lack of a correlated response against SARS-CoV peptides at these three epitopes was unexpected. Although these regions are still highly conserved across these emergent CoVs, they are the least conserved of the six primary SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and the divergence between viruses in this region may be sufficient to affect antibody affinity. This absence of SARS-CoV reactivity could also be partly related to the overall reduction in sensitivity that we observed for the HV library compared to the SCV2 library at the FP, HR2, and N166 epitopes (Figure S4). This reduced sensitivity is not surprising because (1) the increased complexity of the HV library (2 orders of magnitude greater than SCV2) resulted in a lower concentration of each peptide within the assay and (2) the HV library contains fewer unique peptides covering each epitope of interest.\nThese data reveal the existence of 2 distinct classes of linear SARS-CoV-2 epitopes: (1) those that are highly conserved across CoV species and likely elicit cross-reactive antibodies (discussed in more detail below) and (2) those that are not highly conserved and therefore appear to elicit antibodies that uniquely bind to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Notably, for some of the epitopes contained in this second category, we did observe independent signatures of antibody reactivity to homologous regions of several endemic HCoVs, in both convalescent and negative donors. This is true, for example, for two commonly reactive epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein: N223 and N390 (Figure 3E). In fact, within our negative control sample set, we observed enriched peptides, overlapping both of these epitopes, from all four endemic HCoVs, with several of these homologous reactivities observed in >10% of the assayed samples. This finding suggests that despite the lack of sequence conservation, there are general commonalities in the immunogenic features of these protein regions between species. Furthermore, despite the lack of evidence for cross-reactive antibodies that target the S560 and N166 epitopes, we observed rare but significant reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides from these regions in prepandemic serum samples. This finding suggests that non-CoV and potentially non-viral antigens may also have the potential to elicit antibodies that cross-react with common SARS-CoV-2 antibody epitopes."}, {"section_title": "Interspecies cross-reactivity profiles of antibodies binding Spike S2 epitopes ::: Results", "text": "Our results revealed two immunodominant antibody epitopes that likely elicit antibodies that are reactive across CoV species. Both epitopes are located in the S2 subunit of Spike and both exhibit high sequence conservation across multiple CoV species. Furthermore, at both sites, we observed (1) SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in negative control subjects, (2) strongly correlated reactivity across donors between peptides designed from SARS-CoV-2 and endemic CoVs, and (3) a markedly elevated frequency of reactivity to homologous regions of endemic CoVs in convalescent subjects relative to negative controls (Figures 3D and 3E). These observations highlight an apparently bidirectional cross-reactivity: prior endemic exposures appear to generate reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 exposure elicits increased reactivity against the endemic CoVs. To conclusively determine whether the same antibodies are capable of binding to both the pandemic and endemic antigens, we selected three to six convalescent donors who had a high level of reactivity at each epitope and selectively depleted antibodies that bind the SARS-CoV-2 epitope using bead-bound peptides. We then re-assayed these depleted samples with both the SCV2 and HV PepSeq libraries (Figure 4\nA). As expected, depletion using SARS-CoV-2 HR2 or FP peptides resulted in a marked loss of signal for all of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 peptides that were enriched in the non-depleted samples (HR2: 2- to 380-fold decrease, median = 13; FP: 8- to 267-fold decrease, median = 42), but no consistent decrease in signal for SARS-CoV-2 peptides outside the depleted epitope. Notably, depletion with the respective SARS-CoV-2 peptides also caused a similar loss of signal for all previously enriched homologous peptides from other endemic and pandemic CoVs: HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV peptides for the HR2 epitope and HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV peptides for the FP epitope. The loss of reactivity to endemic CoV peptides following antibody depletion with SARS-CoV-2 peptides directly demonstrated the existence of cross-reactive antibodies and showed that these cross-reactive antibodies are the primary contributors to the signal we observed for these endemic CoV peptides.\nHaving confirmed their cross-reactivity, we studied the species-reactivity profiles of these responses by comparing reactivity in the HV library to peptides designed from SARS-CoV and the two most common endemic HCoVs (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) at both of the Spike S2 epitopes (as well as N166, which served as a control for which we see no evidence of pandemic/endemic cross-reactivity). As the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes are 100% identical across each of these epitopes, this strategy allowed a stringent comparison between endemic and pandemic reactivities without the potentially confounding effect of differences in sensitivity between the HV and SCV2 libraries. For both the FP and HR2 epitopes, we observed that the maximum reactivity across the endemic homologs was almost universally, and often substantially, higher than the maximum reactivity to the corresponding SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 peptides, across both the convalescent and negative control donors exhibiting evidence of epitope-specific enrichment (FP: 3- to 19-fold difference, median = 5.3; HR2: 0.7- to 2,358-fold difference, median = 8.3) (Figure 4B). However, we observed a very different pattern at the N166 epitope, at which SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was universally higher for strongly reactive samples, including both convalescent and negative control donors. Thus, even though SARS-CoV-2 was likely to be the most recent CoV exposure in the majority of the convalescent donors, the fine-level specificity of the responding Spike S2 antibodies appears to be imprinted by previous exposure to endemic CoVs.\nTo more precisely resolve the specificity of the cross-reactive Spike S2 antibodies between the various endemic CoVs, we selected subsets of convalescent donors with strong reactivity in each of the FP, HR2, and N166 epitopes, and then used the HV data to apportion their relative reactivity across 3 viruses: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and SARS-CoV (Figure 4C). This was accomplished by normalizing reactivity across the three species using the peptide with the highest Z score from each. As expected for an epitope without endemic CoV cross-reactivity, the N166 response showed a SARS-dominant profile, with relatively minor reactivities to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E homologs. In contrast, the magnitude of the FP response was primarily dominated by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, with the relative loadings varying across samples, and a substantially smaller SARS-CoV component, consistent with the conservation of this epitope across the 3 species, but indicating stronger recognition of the 2 endemic homologs. Finally, the HR2 response showed an HCoV-OC43-dominant pattern with a SARS-CoV component that varied across donors, again indicating a response likely shaped primarily by previous exposure to an endemic virus and reflecting the strong conservation of this region between SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43, but not HCoV-229E (Figure 3B)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of study ::: Discussion", "text": "Our study is limited by a reliance on 30-mer peptides that contain no posttranslational modifications and are expected to be generally unable to form conformational structures. Therefore, we expect that some CoV-binding antibodies will be missed using our approach. Furthermore, although we observe a number of immunodominant epitopes, our cohort size (n = 55 convalescent donors) may leave some rarer epitopes undetected. In addition, our SARS-CoV-2 PepSeq library focused only on two proteins, S and N, which have generally been shown to be the targets of most anti-CoV antibodies. Nonetheless, this limitation prevents us from drawing conclusions regarding the potential for cross-reactive antibodies that recognize other CoV proteins.

For our human virome (\u2018HV\u2019) peptide library, we sought to include sequences from all viruses known to infect humans. For viruses with RNA genomes, we obtained a list of 214 virus species from Woolhouse and Brierley.52 NCBI taxonomy IDs were obtained for each of these species using the \u201cnames.dmp\u201d file from the NCBI \u201cnew_taxdump\u201d downloaded on November 19, 2018 [note: \u201cBovine viral diarrhea virus 1\u201d (NCBI:txid11099) was replaced with the corresponding species, \u201cPestivirus A\u201d (NCBI:txid2170080)]. Taxonomy IDs for human viruses with DNA genomes were obtained using the \u201chost.dmp,\u201d \u201cnodes.dmp\u201d and \u201cfullnamelineage.dmp\u201d files from the NCBI \u201cnew_taxdump\u201d downloaded on November 26, 2018. In total, we identified 289 taxonomy IDs annotated as virus species with DNA genomes that are known to cause human infections; however, 31 of these were excluded from our design because they clearly belonged to unclassified adenovirus strains, rather than distinct virus species. Finally, we included two taxonomy IDs associated with the Jingmenvirus group, members of which have recently been associated with human infections in China.53\n\nOn November 19, 2018, we downloaded all viral protein sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (\u201cuniprot_sprot_viruses.dat\u201d and \u201cuniprot_trembl_viruses.dat\u201d from https://ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/taxonomic_divisions/) and extracted the sequences annotated with one of our 474 target species taxonomy IDs. NCBI BLAST was used to identify sequences with non-viral components (i.e., recombinant), specifically those containing common reporter and therapeutic proteins: ubiquitin, luciferase, green fluorescent protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, LacZ, GusA and GusB. These sequences were excluded from the assay design. To identify taxonomically misclassified proteins, we downloaded all of the proteins annotated in the NCBI RefSeq database for our target species, when available (342/474 target species IDs). We then used NCBI BLAST to identify the best matching RefSeq protein for each UniProt protein, and flagged instances when the top hit was \u201cstrong\u201d and to a RefSeq protein from a different genus (\u226580% nt identity) or species (\u226595% nt identity). All of the flagged UniProt proteins were manually investigated, including an additional BLAST to the NCBI nt database, and sequences confirmed to be misclassified were either removed completely or taxonomically relabeled. Finally, we removed all sequences < 30 amino acids in length and collapsed identical sequences to a single representative using a custom python script (https://github.com/LadnerLab/Library-Design/blob/master/scripts/one_hundred_rep.py).\nFollowing our length, identity and taxonomy filters, we were left with 1,300,994 target protein sequences assigned to 443 distinct species-level taxonomy IDs. However, a small subset of viral species contributed the vast majority of protein sequences. For example, 49% of the proteins were from human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 16% were from influenza A virus. To ensure more even representation of viruses within our assay design, we randomly subsampled the overrepresented species, including no more than 2000 and 4000 protein sequences for viruses with RNA and DNA genomes, respectively. Additional protein sequences were allowed for DNA viruses because they often contain larger genomes and proteomes (i.e., more distinct genes). When down-sampling, priority was given to proteins from the Swiss-Prot database, which have been manually reviewed. Our final down-sampled target set included 148,215 proteins and 88.78 M amino acids.\nIn order to optimize potential epitope coverage in as few peptides as possible, we utilized a greedy set cover algorithm in which all potential linear epitopes contained within our target sequences were treated as our \u201celements of interest\u201d and \u201csets\u201d were defined as the collection of all potential epitopes contained within a potential peptide probe. Each round, a score was calculated for each potential peptide probe, which corresponded to the sum of the frequencies of each contained epitope within the full target set of proteins, and the highest scoring peptide was added to our design. In the event of a tie, a peptide was randomly chosen from the highest scoring subset. All of the potential epitopes contained within the added peptide were then excluded from the calculation of scores in the next round. This procedure was repeated until a targeted proportion of total epitope diversity was contained within the selected peptides. This algorithm was implemented with custom software (https://github.com/LadnerLab/Library-Design). For our design, we focused on optimizing 9-mer (i.e., 9 amino acids long) epitope coverage using 30-mer peptides.\nTo reduce the runtime and memory requirements of the algorithm, we partitioned our target protein sequences according to taxonomy prior to running our peptide design algorithm. We generated subsets of our target proteins by first dividing according to viral family and finally by genus, if the family-level partition contained > 500,000 unique 9mers. Due to the random nature of peptide selection in the event of a tie, our algorithm is not deterministic. Therefore, we independently ran the design for each partition 5-20 times (depending on the size of the partition), and in each case, we selected the result with the fewest number of chosen peptides.\nFor a subset of species with low numbers of UniProt sequences per annotated protein, we added unique protein sequences present in GenBank to our list of targets. Additionally, for these species and one other with low overall epitope coverage in our set cover design (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, taxID = 1933190), we redesigned peptides using a sequence-level (i.e., no alignment) sliding window approach (step = 19) in order to optimize epitope coverage. We also included 15 \u201cpositive control\u201d peptides, which included epitopes known to be broadly reactive in the human population based on preliminary, unpublished data, and 223 \u201cnegative control\u201d peptides designed from an assortment of eukaryotic proteins of exotic species (e.g., coelacanth, coral, great white shark).\nIn total, this HV design included 244,000 unique 30-mer peptides, and represents approximately 70% of all potential 9-mer epitopes contained within the target protein sequences. Each of these peptides was represented by a single nucleotide encoding. This design does not contain any peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2, but does contain full proteome coverage of the other six CoVs known to infect humans: Human coronavirus 229E (NCBI taxID: 11137), Human coronavirus NL63 (277944), Human coronavirus HKU1 (290028), Betacoronavirus 1 (694003, includes Human coronavirus OC43), Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (694009, SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (1335626, MERS).\nOur second design (SCV2) focused almost entirely on SARS-CoV-2, including high density tiling of peptides across the two most immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 proteins: the spike glycoprotein (S) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). As targets for this design, we utilized 2303 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences downloaded from GISAID on April 3rd, 2020 (Table S3), along with six locally generated sequences. Using these genomes, we first generated consensus amino acid sequences for the S and N proteins. In our design, we included all of the unique 30-mer peptides contained in these consensus sequences, equivalent to a 1-step sliding window approach.54 Additionally, we used the same epitope-centric set cover design algorithm used for HV in order to capture amino acid-level polymorphisms present within our full set of target genomes. This aspect of the design ensured that 100% of the unique 16-mer peptides present in the S and N proteins from the 2309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were represented in our design. In total, this design included 1550 30-mer peptides from the S protein and 557 30-mer peptides from the N protein. Each of these peptides was represented by three different nucleotide encodings. This design also included a set of 373 control peptides. These controls represent a subset of the HV peptides, which we have determined are commonly recognized by IgG antibodies in human sera (unpublished results). Therefore, we expect that some fraction of these controls will be recognized by antibodies in each blood sample tested. Collectively, these peptides were designed from 55 different virus species, including the four endemic human CoVs."}, {"section_title": "PepSeq library synthesis and assay ::: Method details ::: STAR\u2605Methods", "text": "Libraries of covalently-coupled peptide:DNA conjugates were prepared from pools of DNA oligonucleotide templates in bulk enzymatic reactions. Pools of ssDNA templates (Agilent) were PCR-amplified and the dsDNA products were used as templates for in vitro transcription (Ampliscribe).

Constructs bearing mRNA \u2013 comprising of (i) mRNA, (ii) mRNA+adaptor, (iii) mRNA+adaptor+peptide \u2013 were captured using magnetic beads coated with a biotinylated DNA oligo complementary to a 30 nt sequence in the mRNA constant region.

The data analysis included three primary steps: 1) demultiplexing and assignment of reads to peptides, 2) calculation of enrichment Z scores individually for each assay and peptide and 3) identification of enriched peptides for each sample based on the consistency of Z scores and fold-change across replicates.\nDemultiplexing and assignment of reads to peptides was done using the demux module of PepSIRF,57 allowing up to 1 mismatch within each of the index sequences and up to 2 mismatches with the expected DNA tag (90 nt in length). Z scores were calculated using a method adapted from Mina et al.58 This process involved the generation of peptide bins, each of which contained \u2265 300 peptides with similar starting abundance in our PepSeq assay. Starting abundance for each peptide was estimated using buffer-only controls. In total, 8-13 independent buffer-only controls were used to generate the bins for this study. The raw read counts from each of these controls were first normalized to reads per million (RPM) using the column sum normalization method in the norm module of PepSIRF. This was to ensure that independent assays were weighted evenly, regardless of differences in the depth of sequencing. Bins were then generated using the bin PepSIRF module.\n\nZ scores were calculated using the zscore PepSIRF module, and each Z score corresponds to the number of standard deviations away from the mean, with the mean and standard deviation calculated independently for the peptides from each bin. It is important that the mean and standard deviation reflect the distribution of unenriched peptides within a bin. Therefore, these calculations were based on the 75% and 95% highest density interval of read counts within each bin for the SCV2 and HV libraries, respectively. Prior to Z score calculation, RPM counts for each peptide were further normalized by subtracting the average RPM count observed within our buffer-only controls. This second normalization step controlled for variability in peptide starting abundance within a bin. Finally, the p_enrich module of PepSIRF was used to determine which peptides had been enriched through our assay. This module identifies peptides that meet or exceed minimum thresholds, in both replicates. For the SCV2 library, we used a minimum Z score threshold of 8 along with a minimum RPM fold-change of 4. For the HV library, we required a minimum RPM count of 10, a minimum RPM fold-change of 4 and we used a 2-tier Z score threshold, with one replicate needing a Z score \u2265 10 and both replicates needing a Z score \u2265 6. All of these thresholds were selected to minimize the number of false positive determinations of peptide enrichment based on the analysis of buffer-only negative controls. For both the SCV2 and HV libraries, we examined a range of thresholds using four buffer-only negative controls (analyzed as 6 pairs of replicates), none of which were considered in the creation of the bins. In both cases, the chosen thresholds resulted in only a single enriched peptide being called in 1/6 of the analyzed pairs.\nMinimally reactive regions for each epitope were identified as the linear peptide sequences shared by all enriched peptides across convalescent donors. To compare the relative level of reactivity at each epitope to SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43/Beta1 and HCoV-229E (Figure 4C), we first identified all of the peptides, designed from each of these species, that overlapped the minimally reactive epitope regions. For each epitope, we then identified the maximum Z score for each sample/species pair and then normalized these values by dividing by the sum of the three species-specific Z scores, with negative Z scores converted to 0 prior to normalization.\nLogistic regression was performed using the glm function in R using log-transformed Z scores for each of the 6 focal epitopes (peptide with maximum Z score for each epitope was used) as features to predict convalescent or negative donor status. Cross-validated AUC was calculated by randomly partitioning the data 100 times in 70:30 training:test sets. To quantify correlations between the patterns of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes detected by the SCV2 library versus virome-wide peptides in the HV library, we used the cor.test function in R to generate all pairwise Pearson product moment comparisons based on log-transformed Z scores."}]
