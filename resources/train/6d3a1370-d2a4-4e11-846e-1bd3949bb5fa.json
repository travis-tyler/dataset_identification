Unfortunately, the success of antidepressant treatment varies amongst individuals and can take weeks to months in those who respond. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), generally prescribed for the most severely depressed and when standard treatments fail, produces a more rapid response and remains the most effective intervention for severe depression."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Exploring the neurobiological effects of ECT is thus an ideal approach to better understand the mechanisms of successful therapeutic response. Though several recent neuroimaging studies show structural and functional changes associated with ECT, not all brain changes associate with clinical outcome. Larger studies that can address individual differences in clinical and treatment parameters may better target biological factors relating to or predictive of ECT-related therapeutic response. We have thus formed the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC) that aims to combine longitudinal neuroimaging as well as clinical, behavioral and other physiological data across multiple independent sites. Here, we summarize the ECT sample characteristics from currently participating sites, and the common datarepository and standardized image analysis pipeline developed for this initiative. This includes data harmonization across sites and MRI platforms, and a method for obtaining unbiased estimates of structural change based on longitudinal measurements with serial MRI scans. The optimized analysis pipeline, together with the large and heterogeneous combined GEMRIC dataset, will provide new opportunities to elucidate the mechanisms of ECT response and the factors mediating and predictive of clinical outcomes, which may ultimately lead to more effective personalized treatment approaches."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Depressive disorders are now the single leading cause of disability worldwide (Whiteford et al., 2013) . Though several treatments for depression are available, these are not successful in all individuals (Rush et al., 2006) . Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is the most effective acute treatment of major depressive episodes (Carney et al., 2003) , but remains stigmatized (Aoki et al., 2016) . Clinical indications and other criteria for ECT are well articulated by various international scientific and professional bodies (APA, 2001; Kennedy et al., 2009; NICE, 2009 ). Due to the potential for cognitive side-effects and limited availability, ECT is typically only considered indicated for the most severely depressed or in otherwise treatmentresistant patients. Research aimed at targeting changes in brain function and morphology with ECT, which elicits a more rapid onset of action than standard therapies, may help resolve the complex mechanisms underlying successful clinical response as well as those accounting for side-effects. Specific knowledge on how ECT alleviates depression, and its impact on brain anatomy and function, should help clinicians and patients make informed choices regarding the use of ECT to treat the illness, and reduce the stigma associated with the treatment. More importantly, new knowledge may lead to the development of better and more targeted personalized treatments.\nLongitudinal neuroimaging studies, i.e. with imaging of patients before-and after ECT, have already shown that ECT has effect on specific brain regions and circuits."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "6\nThe first of such MRI-studies appeared in the late 1980s (Coffey et al., 1988; Figiel et al., 1989; Mander et al., 1987) . Hindered by poor resolution (typical slice thickness 5-12 mm, inter slice interval 1-2.5 mm), low field strength (0.08, 1 or 1.5 T), and limited tools for quantification or automated image processing, these studies were primarily focused on disproving the hypothesis that ECT causes brain damage. Structural changes or gross evidence of harmful effects was not found (Coffey et al., 1988; Figiel et al., 1989; Pande et al., 1990; Puri et al., 1998) . However, ECT-induced changes in tissue parameters, such as an increase in T1-and T2 relaxation times (Mander et al., 1987; Scott et al., 1990) were reported. As these findings may be related to increased brain water content, it was speculated that changes in T1 relaxation time could be caused by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier or related to anesthesia (Mander et al., 1987) , but partial volume effects with CSF, causing an apparent change in T1-or T2 relaxation times could not be ruled out (Scott et al., 1990) . Subsequent investigations showed conflicting results, confirming (Diehl et al., 1994) and not confirming (Girish et al., 2001; Kunigiri et al., 2007) the change in T2 relaxation times. One study also reported an increase in the number of T2\nhyperintensities, a finding related to atherosclerotic small vessel disease, for a few elderly patients 6 months after treatment (Coffey et al., 1991) .\nInterestingly, after the first high-resolution (1 mm 3 ) MRI study identified ECT-induced structural changes by detecting increased volume of the hippocampus (Nordanskog et al., 2010) , several subsequent studies have confirmed that ECT induces structural changes in the hippocampus as well as other brain areas (Abbott et al., 2014; Bouckaert et al., 2016a; Dukart et al., 2014; Jorgensen et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2016; Ota et al., 2015; Redlich et al., 2016; Sartorius et al., 2016; Tendolkar et al., A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Mackay, and Ebmeier 2013; Peng et al. 2016; McKinnon et al. 2009; Koolschijn et al. 2009; Kempton et al. 2011; Hamilton, Siemer, and Gotlib 2008; Du et al. 2014; Cole et al. 2011; Campbell et al. 2004; Bora et al. 2012; Boccia, Acierno, and Piccardi 2015; Arnone et al. 2016 ). However, with meta-analyses, the methodology across studies is under less control, individual-subject level data is lacking and it is more difficult to perform additional analyses to explore novel hypotheses. In megaanalysis, on the other hand, data from each individual patient is combined in a single database for common analysis. This requires relative homogeneity of the data quality across studies and is usually a more time consuming approach. However, the added\nadvantage is that all subject level data are present in the same database which allows investigators to address a much broader set of hypotheses, and in studies where multivariate data is handled (eg. genetics, neuroimaging, clinical, etc.) refining a model by incorporating a new covariate (e.g. age or total intracranial volume) can be easily achieved. In addition, studies on individual patient diagnosis, prognosis or prediction, e.g. machine or deep learning approaches, are possible. In Table 1 we summarize relevant differences between single site studies, meta-and mega analysis for the study of ECT-related brain effects. Large international multi-center research studies such as the Alzheimers's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Jack et al., 2008) , and the wide availability of common analysis tools, such as FreeSurfer, has paved the way for some general standardization of acquisition protocols and analysis methods. That is, contemporary structural MRI data is typically acquired with high resolution 3D sequences, which allows for standardized processing pipelines, even without additional a priori defined and standardized imaging sequence parameters. This allows large numbers of subjects to be analyzed with consistent analysis pipelines, which is an objective of GEMRIC. Consequently, rigorous testing of the relationship between the \"experimental\" manipulation (e.g. ECT parameters), and brain and health effects may be examined.\nBelow we present our process of identifying potential contributors for this international collaboration and the roadmap for establishing goals for future investigations and new collaborations. Finally, we characterize our current GEMRIC dataset, describe the tools for common data analysis and evaluate our initial processing pipeline for handling data collected across MRI systems.\n19"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 11", "text": "The methods for setting up the GEMRIC included 1) identifying contributing investigative groups, 2) establishing collaborative and data sharing agreements, 3) developing a common data portal, 4) developing and testing a structural image preprocessing pipeline, and 5) standardization of multi-site clinical data.\nTo identify contributing groups, a systematic search in Medline, Embase and\nPsycInfo was undertaken (September 2014) to target studies that included imaging measurements before and after ECT (see Inline Supplementary Material for exact search terms); 2153 papers were identified of which 94 included imaging measurements both before and after ECT. Of 34 studies that used MRI, four different modalities were used; structural (T1, T2; 15), functional (Bold fMRI; 5), spectroscopy (H MRS; 11) and diffusion (DWI/DTI; 3). In total 13 studies included volumetric T1 acquisitions with a minimum resolution of 1.3 mm in any direction (see Inline Supplementary Figure 1 ), and the 11 corresponding authors of these papers were contacted by email in November 2014.\nTo facilitate data sharing, guidelines and agreements for collaboration were established under the guidance of site-specific institutional review boards (IRBs).\nNext, a common data portal was created to allow individual sites to import raw DICOM data to a common server. An advantage of processing raw data on a common portal (versus transferring processed data) is that differences in software installations are eliminated, and quality control are the same across independent datasets (Bartsch et al., 2014) . A processing pipeline for automated longitudinal analysis of individual patient data was then set up on this common analysis platform.\nThe pipeline includes corrections for scanner-specific effects using a gradient unwarp tool that corrects 3D T1 data for effects of scanner-dependent gradient field nonlinearities (Jovicich et al., 2006) . Then the individual brain MRI is processed using automated FreeSurfer preprocessing steps (version 5.3;\nsurfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), which includes segmentation of subcortical white matter, deep gray matter structures and automated parcellation of the cerebral cortex (Dale and Sereno, 1993; Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl et al., 2004) .\nNext, unbiased, within-subject assessment of longitudinal changes of regional brain volumes is performed using Quarc (Holland et al., 2009; Holland and Dale, 2011; Holland et al., 2012) . In summary, this pipeline builds on lessons from prior studies (notably ADNI) by correcting for scanner-specific distortions and using methods that maximize power for longitudinal change estimation while avoiding bias (Fox et al., 2011; Holland et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011) .\nThe current GEMRIC sample is described in the results section. (Faul et al., 2007) , and for these analyses\nCohen\u00b4s d was calculated from the mean of the estimated regional anatomical change from the left and right hemisphere.\nFinally, since different sites included different mood rating scales from completed or current investigations, methods were implemented to allow for the standardization of multi-site clinical data for GEMRIC."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Forming the collaboration", "text": "After identifying potential contributors to the GEMRIC through the literature search described above, 7 of the 11 contacted authors joined the collaborative group.\nThrough additional contacts within this set of investigators, an additional 8 sites agreed to participate so that currently 15 independent groups -including the imaging core at UCSD -make up the GEMRIC (Figure 1) .

Details of rules and regulations differ between institutions and countries. While some sites had consent forms that included information about sharing of de-identified data and already had the necessary approvals, others needed to contact their local IRB. A standard, generic consent-form that may be used for sharing data to GEMRIC was developed.\nThis form is used when local IRBs require new consent from each study participant.\nHowever, re-consent from patients is not always possible or necessary, and several other steps were suggested that could help fulfill local IRB requirements. Currently, for GEMRIC a) individual data is provided with new patient-IDs, b) each site retains the right to their own raw data, c) information about study site is hidden on the common server and in data analysis. In this large multi-site collection of subjects, the possibility of re-identifying individual study participants is thus very diminished. In such situations, data may for practical purposes be considered anonymous (Helsedirektoratet, 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T 20", "text": "The Regional Ethic Committee South-East in Norway approved the inclusion of data from 500 individuals to the GEMRIC server located at the University of Bergen (2013/1032 ECT and neuroradiology, June 1 st 2015).

The security level of our system, to our knowledge, exceeds that of similar systems, and the Data Portal software has been successfully used in other studies, e.g. the Pediatric\nImaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study (Jernigan et al., 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Structural imaging preprocessing, FreeSurfer and Quarc analysis", "text": "In the pilot data described above used to test multi-site image preprocessing, the effect of distortion correction (Fig 2A; single subject; scanner 1) was largest towards the apex of the skull where the manually measured dura-dura distance changed by ~8% (p=0.003) and 2% (p=0.005) for scanner 1 and 2, respectively ( Fig 2D) . The calculated ECT-induced hippocampal volume change, based on automated FreeSurfer analysis, before and after correction was (\u00b5l, n=12) 254 \u00b1 304 (p=0.01) and 339 \u00b1 232 (p=0.0004), representing a relative change of 3.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The reduced SD after corrections suggests reduced variance, which can also be appreciated in Fig 2B. While ECT-induced hippocampal volume change was expected, the estimated intracranial volume was not changed after treatment.\nHowever, the variance seemed somewhat reduced after correction with a SD (in \u00b5l) of 26921 and 17838 before and after correction, respectively ( Fig 2C) . Significance (P-value) assessed by two-tailed t-test. [ Figure 2D is adapted from conference poster ISMRM 2015 abstract 705 (Oltedal et al., 2015b) ].\nRegional anatomical change in longitudinal brain scan studies can be estimated using several available software packages. We have implemented Quarc which compares favorably with other methodologies for estimating structural change (Holland et al., 2012) . An example is shown in Fig 2D, illustrating regional change at the single subject level. This example corresponds with results found with FreeSurfer, and agrees well with visual inspection of accurately rigid-body coregistered slices from intra-individual T1 volumes before-and after ECT (not shown).\nEstimates of ECT induced volumetric change was further evaluated and compared to a group of healthy controls. The effect size (Cohen\u00b4s d) of Quarc estimated regional cortical and subcortical change were typically in the range 0.5 -2 ( Figure 3 , Table 3 ).\nThe pattern of change was broadly distributed, but the larger effect sizes were lateralized to the side of the ECT stimulus (all patients received right unilateral ECT); e.g. the volume change of the left and right temporal pole was 2.6 % (p<0.05) and 4.9 % (p < 0.001), respectively (n=19), compared to controls (n=9). The mean standard deviation of change across ROIs for healthy controls (i.e. the \"noise level\"), scanned at time intervals similar to patients was ~ 0.8 %. If scan corrections were not performed this value was ~0.9 %; however, all controls were scanned on scanner 2, which has less geometric distortions than scanner 1, and this estimate will vary with scanner type. For the patient group both scanners were used, and we noticed that the effect of scan correction was larger for scanner 1 compared to scanner 2; the mean standard deviation across ROIs was 2.0 and 2.6% (n=6) versus 1.8 and 1.9 % (n=13), for data with and without scan correction for scanner 1 versus scanner 2, respectively. Based on the data from the Bergen sample ( Figure 3) we estimated sample sizes that will be needed to detect differences between groups for a few selected ROIs for effect sizes equal to Cohen\u00b4s d, 25% of d and 10% of d. Estimates based on results from Quarc were compared with estimates based on corresponding results from the FreeSurfer longitudinal pipeline (Table 3) . performed (G*Power version 3.1.9.2) for t-tests of difference between to independent means for groups with identical size. The error probability (\uf061) was set to 0.01 and the power (1-\uf062) was set to 0.8."}, {"section_title": "ROI, methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GEMRIC projects", "text": "The common processing pipeline described above is used for initial harmonization and processing of GEMRIC imaging data. As specified in the GEMRIC data . These collaborations were used as a model to systematically establish the GEMRIC, the first international collaboration for longitudinal investigations of ECT that utilizes MRI. Our goal is to increase the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of ECT. To better understand the consequences and full width of structural brain changes with ECT, large sample sizes are needed. The current combined data pool is approximating a ten-fold increase relative to that of any single participating study, and more sites are expected to join in the near future. In our multi-site data set with individual-subject level data, we take advantage of standardized image processing and statistical tools to eliminate image analysis methods as a source of variance.\nTo reduce variance and scanner artefacts, the use of standardised processing streams is critical for pooled analysis of multi-centre data (Cannon et al., 2014) . One of the main causes of spatial distortions in MRI scans is non-linearity in the gradient fields that is used for spatial encoding. For longitudinal studies, correcting for gradient field distortions is important even for single-site studies, as the distortions depend on the position of the head within the main magnetic field. We have adapted automated correction procedures, developed at the Multi Modal Imaging Laboratory at UCSD, to correct for scanner specific effects (Jovicich et al., 2006) which may otherwise introduce bias and / or variance in the measures of anatomical change (Jernigan et al., 2016) . Analysis of data from one site suggests that this processing step will reduce noise in measurements of longitudinal change. The method for estimating longitudinal change (Holland and Dale, 2011) calculates displacement maps bidirectional with respect to imaging time point, and avoids the inherent bias subject to some longitudinal change analysis methods (Fox et al., 2011; Holland et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011) . By applying the pipeline to data from one site we\nshow that large effect sizes of ECT-induced structural changes are achieved, with\nCohen\u00b4s d in the range 0.5 -2. For comparison, the largest cross sectional metaanalysis of major depressive disorder to date found an effect size of -0.14 for patients' hippocampus volume relative to that of controls (Schmaal et al., 2016) . In line with prior investigations (Holland and Dale, 2011; Holland et al., 2012) , we use unbiased methods that maximizes the power for longitudinal anatomical change estimation. Using these methods, the current GEMRIC sample size should allow detection of differences in volume change that are at or above 25% of the effect sizes found in the Bergen sample (which is compared to healthy controls). Hence, we can take advantage of the heterogeneity of the sample (e.g. stimulus and treatment parameters, age, comorbidities, gender) to assess how site-or subject specific factors can modulate brain changes and health effects seen with ECT. We have presented our initial processing pipeline for structural data, but intend to include other modalities as well as alternative analysis approaches in the future.\nFinally, the large combined sample size, with individual-subject data will be available to the collaboration and allow a rich set of hypothesis to be tested. Individual-subject data is a prerequisite for future investigations of ECT outcome prediction (Redlich et al., 2016) , which may impact clinical patient care (Abbott et al., 2016) , possibly enabling a more personalized approach to treatments.\nThis study is supported by Western Norway Regional Health Authority, Haukeland "}]
