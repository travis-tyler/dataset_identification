[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "White matter microstructure can be measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While increasing age is a predictor of white matter (WM) microstructure changes, roles of other possible modifiers, such as cardiovascular risk factors, APOE \u03b54 allele status and biological sex have not been clarified.\nWe investigated 665 cognitively normal participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (age 50-95, 56.7% female) with a total of 1384 DTI scans. WM microstructure was assessed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). A vascular burden score was defined as the sum of five risk factors (hypertension, obesity, elevated cholesterol, diabetes and smoking status). Linear mixed effects models assessed the association of baseline vascular burden on baseline and on rates of change of FA and MD over a mean follow-up of 3.6 years, while controlling for age, race, and scanner type. We also compared DTI trajectories in APOE \u03b54 carriers vs. noncarriers and men vs. women.\nAt baseline, higher vascular burden was associated with lower FA and higher MD in many WM structures including association, commissural, and projection fibers. Higher baseline vascular burden was also associated with greater longitudinal decline in FA in the hippocampal part of the cingulum and the fornix (crus)/stria terminalis and splenium of the corpus callosum, and with greater increases in MD in the splenium of the corpus callosum. APOE \u03b54 carriers did not differ from non-carriers in baseline DTI metrics but had greater decline in FA in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Men had higher FA and lower MD in multiple WM regions at baseline but showed greater increase in MD in the genu of the corpus callosum. Women showed greater decreases over time in FA in the gyrus part of the cingulum, compared to men.\nOur findings show that modifiable vascular risk factors (1) have a negative impact on white matter microstructure and (2) are associated with faster microstructural deterioration of temporal WM regions and the splenium of the corpus callosum in cognitively normal adults. Reducing vascular burden in aging could modify the rate of WM deterioration and could decrease age-related cognitive decline and impairment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Altered white matter microstructure has been associated with agerelated cognitive decline and dementia (Bendlin et al., 2010; Charlton et al., 2010; Di Paola, Spalletta and Caltagirone, 2010; Kennedy and Raz, 2009a,b; Mielke et al., 2012; Nir et al., 2013) . A vascular etiology has been proposed and the prevalence of vascular diseases increases with age (Lakatta and Levy, 2003; Thom et al., 2006) . Therefore, understanding the relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and white matter degeneration in cognitively normal older adults is important, as it may highlight possible targeted interventions designed to reduce vascular burden and slow/prevent white matter damage before there are cognitive consequences.\nMicrostructural properties of cerebral white matter can be assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging technique (Basser et al., 1994) . Two commonly used DTI metrics are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). FA is used to quantify the directionality and MD is used to quantify the magnitude of water diffusion within brain tissue. In the white matter, axons, myelin sheaths and neurofilaments restrict both direction and magnitude of diffusion, leading to highly directional diffusion running in parallel with the white matter structures. This leads to high levels of FA in the white matter compared to cerebral grey matter (Pierpaoli et al., 1996) . Age-related decreases in FA and increases in MD have been widely reported from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and are thought to reflect age-related microstructural damage Charlton et al., 2006; Kennedy and Raz, 2009a,b; Salat et al., 2005; Sexton et al., 2014) .\nA review of DTI studies in vascular disease concluded that DTI metrics are sensitive to vascular disease related changes, can serve as surrogate markers of white matter microstructure and be used to monitor disease progression (Alves et al., 2012) . Various cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, obesity, elevated total cholesterol, diabetes and cigarette smoking have all been shown to negatively impact white matter regions including association, projection, commissural and limbic fibers (Hoogenboom et al., 2014; Hsu et al., 2012; Karlsson et al., 2013; Maillard et al., 2012; McEvoy et al., 2015; Papageorgiou et al., 2017; Reijmer et al., 2013) . However, these studies are often limited by small sample sizes, are typically cross-sectional designs and often consider only a single vascular risk factor.\nWhile cross-sectional investigations have revealed promising insights into the relationships between white matter microstructure and cardiovascular risk factors, they are limited to providing between-person comparisons. To directly estimate the effect of vascular burden on within-person change in brain structure, longitudinal studies are required. However, there are few longitudinal studies that have assessed the impact of vascular risk factors on trajectories of white matter microstructure in cognitively normal adults. de Groot et al. (2015) found that cardiovascular risk factors were largely unrelated to longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure except for higher total cholesterol which was associated with faster increases in MD over a two-year follow-up. Bender and Raz (2015) found that the effects of cardiovascular risk were limited to faster decline in FA over a two-year period in the body of the corpus callosum and the dorsal cingulum bundle. Longer follow-up time on larger data sets may improve the statistical power to assess the impact of vascular risk factors on white matter microstructural changes.\nInvestigating the impact of cardiovascular risk factors is complicated by the fact that many risk factors co-exist, e.g. associations between type 2 diabetes and obesity. This makes it difficult for studies to evaluate the individual contribution of an isolated risk factor, but it also makes it necessary to explore additive and cumulative effects of risk factors. Cumulative vascular risk factor scores have previously been shown to be related to increased risk of dementia (Luchsinger et al., 2005) and amyloid pathology (Gottesman et al., 2017) and may prove to be useful tools in evaluating the cumulative impact of vascular risk factors on white matter microstructure.\nTwo additional, non-modifiable factors that may affect age-related changes in white matter microstructure are Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, i.e., APOE \u03b54 allele status, and sex. Cross-sectional results assessing the impact of the APOE \u03b54 allele on FA and MD are inconclusive, with Patel et al. (2013) reporting no differences in FA in carriers versus non-carriers, while (Honea et al., 2009) found evidence of reduced FA in the left parahippocampal gyrus in carriers compared to non-carriers. In longitudinal analysis, de Groot et al. (2015) found counterintuitive decreases in MD in carriers compared to non-carriers, while Teipel et al. (2010) found no significant differences between carriers and non-carriers.\nSex differences in DTI measures are not well understood. In several cross-sectional studies, no sex differences in DTI in global white matter or regions of interest (ROIs) were reported (Inano et al., 2011; Kennedy and Raz, 2009; Kennedy and Raz, 2009a,b; Lee et al., 2009; Ota et al., 2006) . However, other studies have reported significant sex differences, with men having higher FA in the corpus callosum, thalamus, cingulum and frontal white matter (Menzler et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2007; Szeszko et al., 2003) . Longitudinal studies of sex differences in DTI trajectories are limited; however, Sexton et al. (2014) found no sex differences in the rate of decline in FA.\nThe primary aims of the current study were to investigate associations of the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors, individual cardiovascular risk factors, and APOE \u03b54 carrier status with white matter macrostructural change in cognitively normal adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline vascular burden, cardiovascular risk factors, and APOE \u03b54 status with white matter microstructure and also report effects of age and sex. Given few longitudinal DTI studies in cognitively normal aging adults, we present this work as an exploratory analysis to investigate regionally specific associations. While DTI metrics vary across regions, they are highly correlated within individuals. Therefore, results were not corrected for multiple comparisons across ROIs."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "This study uses data from participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a long running study of physical and psychological aging in community-dwelling adults (Shock, 1984) . Participants were included in the current analyses if they were over the age of 50, had undergone a DTI scan between 2009 and 2016 and had concurrent neuropsychological data. 665 participants had DTI data; of these, 406 participants had longitudinal data (two or more DTI scans). Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, Parkinson's disease or a history of stroke. The participants were also free of significant health conditions that could affect brain structure (i.e. closed head injury, brain surgery, malignant cancer, meningiomas and cysts with brain tissue displacement, seizure and bipolar disorders). Participants were excluded if they had these conditions at baseline or, if they developed these conditions during the follow-up interval; any visits after the onset of a condition were removed. MCI status was determined using the Petersen criteria (Petersen, 2004) for MCI, dementia and AD, respectively, were determined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, third edition, revised (DSM-III-R) (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (McKhann et al., 1984) .

Using a similar approach to Gottesman et al. (2017) , the cumulative vascular burden score was a summed score of the total number of cardiovascular risk factors present for each participant. Cardiovascular risk factors included hypertension (systolic blood pressure !140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure !90 mm Hg or treatment with antihypertensive medications), obesity (body mass index ! 30), elevated total cholesterol (!200 mg/dl), diabetes (HbA1C ! 6.5 or self-report of taking medication to treat diabetes), and smoking status (ever vs never). In statistical analysis, the vascular burden score was treated as a continuous variable. As there were few participants with 4 or 5 cardiovascular risk factors, the score was capped at 3 or more risk factors to ensure a normal distribution.\nAPOE \u03b54 status, defined as having at least one \u03b54 allele, was also evaluated as a binary score comparing carriers vs. non-carriers.

Briefly, diffusion-weighted volumes were affine co-registered to b0 image target to correct for eddy current and physiological motion effects. The gradient tables were corrected for the identified rotational component using finite strain (Alexander et al., 2001) . To combine the two DTI sessions that had different unknown intensity normalization constants, each diffusion-weighted image was normalized by its own reference image prior to tensor fitting. To improve robustness, iteratively reweighted least squares fitting with outlier rejection (in the form of RESTORE (Chang et al., 2005) from the Camino toolkit (Cook et al., 2006) ) was used to estimate tensors on a voxel-wise basis. Note that the RESTORE processing removes outlier gradients during the fitting process, but the number of removed data points varies by spatial location and scan. The quality assurance reports were visually examined to assess for motion/artifact, corrupted scans or other acquisition abnormalities and excluded subjects who had more than 5 corrupted volumes per scan. Additionally, all quantitative quality metrics were exported and outliers (>2 standard deviations) were visually assessed to identify processing failures. In total, there were 1404 sessions with two diffusion tensor imaging acquisitions.\nQuality assurance review identified concerns for 20 sessions, and these sessions were removed from further analyses, leaving 1384 good quality DTI sessions for analysis."}, {"section_title": "White matter regions of interest", "text": "To segment white matter regions of interest (ROIs), the Eve white matter atlas (Mori et al., 2008a,b) was combined with corresponding white matter labels from a multi-atlas segmentation using 35 manually labeled atlases from NeuroMorphometrics with the BrainCOLOR protocol (Klein et al., 2010) , and FA mapped MRI. The white matter labels were intersected with the white matter segmentation and the resultant labels were iteratively grown to fill the remaining white matter space from the multi-atlas labels. The white matter ROI labels obtained from the T1-weighted image for each visit were affine registered to the FA and MD images and used to extract average FA and MD values for each ROI. Fig. 1 shows the 16 ROIs used.\nThe ROIs investigated here were chosen based on findings related to the effects of vascular risk factors on regional white matter microstructure described in the introduction. These include eight association white matter ROIs: Superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), superior frontooccipital fasciculus (SFO), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), sagittal stratum (SS), cingulum gyrus (CGC), cingulum (hippocampus) (CGH), fornix/stria terminalis (FX/ST), and the column and body of the fornix (FX); three commissural white matter ROIs: genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), body of the corpus callosum (BCC), and the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC); and five projection white matter ROIs: anterior corona radiata (ACR), superior corona radiata (SCR), posterior corona radiata (PCR), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC). FA and MD values from all ROIs were averaged across left and right hemispheres. Reliability of DTI measures has been established by many studies (Bonekamp et al., 2007; Pfefferbaum et al., 2003; Vollmar et al., 2010) .

Longitudinal trajectories in DTI metrics within all ROIs were analyzed using linear mixed effects models (LME). An initial base model was used to assess the effects of age and sex on longitudinal trajectories of DTI measures. The predictors included mean-centered age at baseline DTI visit, sex (male vs. female), race (non-white vs. white), scanner (scanner one and two vs. scanner three), time (follow up time in years since baseline), age*time, and sex*time. In model one, the effects of the vascular burden (model 1a), individual vascular risk factors (models 1b-1f), and APOE \u03b54 carrier status (carrier vs. non-carrier) (model 1g) were analyzed separately by adding the factor of interest and its time interaction to the base model. Model two included both vascular burden score and APOE \u03b54 to assess the independent effects of each predictor, while controlling for the other. We also assessed the following additional interactions: vascular burden*APOE \u03b54 and vascular burden*APOE \u03b54*time. As this analysis was exploratory, we did not correct for multiple comparisons in our analysis and report all results as significant at p < 0.05. However, we also indicate when results were significant at a more stringent value of p < 0.01. Effect sizes for the baseline crosssectional effects were computed by dividing the beta coefficients by the standard deviation of baseline data, and effect sizes for the longitudinal effects were computed by dividing beta coefficients by the standard deviation of longitudinal rates of change. It should be noted that for vascular burden, the effect size represents the effect of one-unit change in the burden score, i.e. the effect for each additional vascular risk factor. All LME models were conducted using the lme function from the nlme package in R (Bates, 2007) . Table 1 shows sample characteristics at baseline. On average, participants were 71.3 years old (SD \u00bc 9.9, range \u00bc 50-95), 56.7% were female, and 23.6% were APOE \u03b54 carriers.

While Honea et al. (2009) also reported a limited impact of APOE \u03b54 on white matter microstructure located in the parahippocampal gyrus, Patel et al. (2013) found no differences between APOE \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers. In our longitudinal analysis, we found that APOE \u03b54 carriers exhibited faster rates of decline in FA in the GCC and the SCC. However, when we controlled for vascular burden the association with FA in the SCC was lost. As APOE \u03b54 is associated with cardiovascular disease (Song et al., 2004) it is possible that the effect is due to vascular damage in the SCC. However, as the vascular burden effect on FA in the SCC was also lost in model 2, and given the small changes in the beta values between models 1a/lg and model 2, it is more likely that the loss of significance is due to statistical power constraints as a result of adding more covariates and three-way interactions rather than showing a true mediation effect. de Groot et al. (2015) found faster increases in FA in carriers compared to non-carriers in the centrum semiovale and lower global MD in carriers compared to non-carriers. The authors suggested that this counterintuitive effect may be due to a short follow-up and limited power for longitudinal analyses. With a longer follow-up time, we found that APOE \u03b54 carriers exhibited faster rates of decline in FA in the GCC and the SCC. The same pattern of reduced FA in the GCC and SCC while the BCC is spared has also been reported in MCI and AD patients compared to cognitively normal controls (Di Paola et al., 2010) . Therefore, we may be observing early increases in the rate of change in the CC microstructure associated with increased risk of AD.\nThe finding that APOE \u03b54 status was not associated with DTI metrics in more white matter ROIs is consistent with the minimal associations found by others (Honea et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2013) . The lack of associations with APOE \u03b54 status may also be due to the fact that our study focused on cognitively normal individuals. For example, in studies of regional GM atrophy related to APOE \u03b54 status, widespread associations are found in AD patients with APOE \u03b54 alleles (Bigler et al., 2000; Geroldi et al., 1999) but associations are less consistent in cognitively normal adults (Cherbuin et al., 2008; Den Heijer et al., 2002; Reiman et al., 1998) .

These areas included ROIs involving association fibers connecting the frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal lobes (SLF, SFO, and SS), fibers within the limbic system (FX/ST, and FX body), commissural fibers (GCC, BCC, and SCC) and projection fibers (ACR, SCR, ALIC and PLIC). In the longitudinal analysis the vascular burden score was associated with greater decline in microstructure in the limbic system (CHG, and FX/ST) and part of the corpus callosum (SCC). The widespread effect of vascular burden on white matter microstructure at baseline is supported by previous reports that similar summary scores of vascular risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome or the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, are associated with multiple white matter regions (Alfaro et al., 2018; Segura et al., 2009; Shimoji et al., 2013; Uiterwijk et al., 2018) . Furthermore, lower FA in the Cingulum and Fornix and has previously been shown in MCI and AD patients compared to controls (Bozoki et al., 2012; Mielke et al., 2012) . There is also evidence that the accumulation of multiple vascular risk factors elevates the risk developing AD (Luchsinger et al., 2005) . Therefore, targeting vascular risk factors for early intervention in cognitively normal adults may prevent or slow this decline in white matter microstructure and prevent or delay the onset of clinical symptoms.\nPrevious longitudinal results are more limited. Bender and Raz (2015) found that vascular risk was associated with greater change in FA in the body of the corpus callosum and the dorsal cingulum over 2-year follow-up. In a subsequent analysis over a follow-up period of up to seven years in 38 adults (Bender et al., 2016) , did not assess multiple vascular risk factors, but did examine the effect of hypertension on white matter microstructure and found no significant relationships with longitudinal change. We found that obesity and hypertension were the two risk factors associated with the largest number of white matter ROIs at baseline and appeared to drive the associations with vascular burden score in our data. Similar relationships have been reported in previous studies, although these tend to be in studies with relatively small sample sizes compared to the present study or include younger participants (Karlsson et al., 2013; Maillard et al., 2012; McEvoy et al., 2015; Papageorgiou et al., 2017) . However, two cross-sectional studies of aging reported that hypertension exacerbates the effects of aging on white matter microstructure in posterior white matter regions (temporal and occipital lobes) (Kennedy and Raz, 2009a,b) , and that increased mean arterial blood pressure is associated with reduced FA in multiple white matter regions, even in normotensive participants (Salat et al., 2012) .\nWe found that diabetes was not related to white matter microstructure in many ROIs, although it was related to faster increases in MD in the ACR over time. There were no significant relationships between diabetes and FA. This finding contrasts with other studies that have found reduced FA in subjects with diabetes compared to healthy controls (Hoogenboom et al., 2014; Hsu et al., 2012; Reijmer et al., 2013) . One reason for the difference between studies may be that there was only a small percentage of participants with diabetes in the BLSA DTI sample (9%). The effect of elevated total cholesterol was also limited, with decreased FA in the SCR at baseline, but slower rates of change in FA in the ACR and SCR over time suggesting a positive effect of total cholesterol on longitudinal change in FA. However, there is cross-sectional evidence that higher cholestrol is associated with poorer white matter microstructure . Smoking also showed a limited impact on white matter microstructure in this study."}, {"section_title": "Sex differences", "text": "We found baseline sex differences that agree with and extend the findings of several reports of sex differences in white matter microstructure in which men show higher levels of FA in regions including the corpus callosum, cingulum and frontal white matter (Menzler et al., 2011; Oh et al., 2007; Szeszko et al., 2003) . In the longitudinal analysis, we found evidence for greater decline in FA in women compared to men in the CGC, but conversely observed greater increases in MD in men within the GCC. This contrasts with Sexton et al. (2014) who reported no sex differences in the rate of change in FA or MD in voxel-wise analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics of healthy participants over a wider age range. Sexual dimorphisms in the white matter appear during puberty and are thought to be moderated by sex hormones.

Results are from the same model controlling for baseline age, sex, race, and scanner. age-related increases (De Bellis et al., 2001; Lenroot et al., 2007; Perrin et al., 2008) , and boys have higher FA and lower MD than girls in a wide range of white matter regions (Herting et al., 2012) . In boys, testosterone predicts white matter microstructure while in girls, estradiol is associated with FA of the white matter (Herting et al., 2012) . While the baseline sex differences we report are consistent with sex differences earlier in life, the longitudinal results are less clear, and more work is required to understand how sex may play a role in age-related white matter microstructural decline."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "As with previous studies Charlton et al., 2006; Kennedy and Raz, 2009a,b; Salat et al., 2005; Sexton et al., 2014) , we found widespread effects of age on white matter microstructure. Age was the strongest predictor of FA and MD. Older baseline age was not associated with greater rates of change in FA. However, we did find that older baseline age was associated with greater increases in MD in several white matter regions. This contrasts with Sexton et al. (2014) who reported faster rates of decline in FA and increases in MD associated with increasing age in voxel wise analysis. Despite the strong effects of age on baseline white matter microstructure, the effects of vascular burden remained significant in models controlling for age. This suggests that minimizing vascular burden in older individuals could be protective against white matter microstructural damage."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The results of this study should be considered with some limitations in mind. While we sought to investigate the impact of various cardiovascular risk factors on white matter microstructure, it should be noted that participants in the BLSA benefit from close medical observation during the study, and therefore diseases such as diabetes and hypertension tend to be detected and treated promptly. As such, treatment effects in this cohort may be a confound and the effects of these cardiovascular risk factors on white matter microstructure may, in fact, be more severe in other populations. Furthermore, the mean age at baseline in our sample was relatively old (71.3 years), and it is well established that midlife vascular risk factors can have a negative impact on white matter earlier in life (Debette et al., 2011; Knopman et al., 2011; Vuorinen et al., 2011) . This may explain why we observed more wide spread effects at baseline compared to longitudinal analysis as the baseline effects may reflect damage that was already present and the longitudinal changes may reflect more subtle ongoing damage associated with vascular risk factors in later life.\nDue to the large DTI data set analyzed, we used an atlas-based approach to extract regionally specific DTI metrics using the state-ofthe-art Eve white matter atlas (Mori et al., 2008a,b) for this exploratory analysis. However, DTI tractography methods have the potential to produce more accurate, subject-specific renderings of white matter tracts. Our findings will guide selection of a smaller number of regions of interest to apply tractography in future work and explore the impact of vascular burden and APOE on DTI metrics in greater detail. Tract based spatial statistics (Smith et al., 2006) also offer a way of conducting voxel-wise analysis that would be complimentary to the work presented here and could be used to confirm our findings. In the present analysis, we did not include white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as a dependent variable or a covariate in our models. While microstructural decline as measured by DTI is highly related to macrostructural damage as measured by the extent of WMH (Seiler et al., 2018) , future work should asses the relationships between the regional distribution of WMH and the risk factors assessed here. In this study, we treated the analysis as exploratory and did not correct for multiple comparisons when looking at associations across 16 ROIs as DTI metrics across ROIs that are highly intercorrelated. We acknowledge that this may increase the risk of type I errors but believe the use of a less stringent significance threshold Table 4 The associations between vascular burden and APOE identifies relationships of interest for future research."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, in a large longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal older adults, we found that higher vascular burden is associated with diffuse white matter microstructural decline and faster rates of decline in temporal lobe and commissural white matter regions. These findings suggest that interventions designed to lower vascular burden in older individuals may have a positive impact on white matter microstructure integrity which could decrease the risk of cognitive impairment. Future work should assess the longitudinal associations between changes in white matter microstructure and decline in cognition and how risk factors may mediate such associations. The recent report of a 19% reduction in MCI and decreased white matter damage following intensive blood pressure lowering in the SPRINT-MIND trial is encouraging in this regard (Nasrallah, 2018; Williamson, 2018) .
