[{"section_title": "Rationale ::: INTRODUCTION", "text": "In December 2019, Chinese authorities announced an emergence of severe pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan. This was later named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease-2019.[1] This infection is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 from the coronavirus family similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but with a higher transmissibility rate.[2] Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection show symptoms of fever, coughing sneezing, fatigue, vomiting, and severe pneumonia.[3] Studies reported person-to-person, droplet, and aerosol transmission of 2019-nCoV.[2] In January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 crisis as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d[4] In March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, with a total of (118,319) confirmed cases worldwide.[5] In the month of June 20, 2020 to be precise, the submission date of this review, the infection has affected (8,385,440) cases globally with the highest cases reported in the United States (2,149,166) followed by Brazil (955,377) with a total number of (450,686) reported deaths worldwide.[6]\nThis COVID-19 outbreak epidemic crisis has placed a substantial strain on the healthcare system in numerous countries.[7] Healthcare providers are struggling with the rising number of infected patients demanding hospitalization.[8] Studies are increasingly reporting 2019-nCoV cross-transmission to healthcare providers exceeding 3,387 cases with 22 confirmed deaths.[89] The nature of dental settings requires proximity between dentist and patient during operational work.[10] This could violate the recommended one-meter safe distance between individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak.[11] The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is up to 14 days, during which, the virus is still contagious.[12] This rings the alarm bell about possibility of asymptomatic patients visiting general dental clinic and spreading infection. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 was found in silent carriers and children,[13] amongst the majority of patients in pediatric and orthodontic clinics that puts orthodontists and pediatric dentists at a great risk.\nConsidering the recent inception of COVID-19, the literature concerned with risk and precautions within the dental setting is limited. Furthermore, high transmissibility and pandemic nature of the disease amplifies the importance of formulating a consensus within dental community to fight this emerging threat."}, {"section_title": "OBJECTIVE ::: INTRODUCTION", "text": "The aim of this systematic review was to provide dentists and dental auxiliary with insights regarding risk and precautions during COVID-19 crisis. This could help decision-makers in handling this pandemic infection and build consensus among dental community during the COVID-19 outbreak."}, {"section_title": "PROTOCOL AND REGISTRATION ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "This systematic review was developed following The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.[14] PROSPERO only registers systematic reviews with health-related outcomes thus, this systematic review was not eligible for registration at PROSPERO."}, {"section_title": "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "All publications in English and non-English languages that matched the search terms were included in this review. Considering the recent discovery and announcement of the virus in late December 2019, the search included all publications from inception up to March 19, 2020."}, {"section_title": "INFORMATION SOURCES ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Studies included in this review were identified by searching the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19 2020),[15] which contains all COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research from PubMed, WHO, bioRxiv and medRxiv pre-prints (Update published on March 13th, 2020). An updated literature search was performed lastly on March 19th, 2020 on the following databases: WHO\u2019s COVID-19 Research Database,[16] NIH\u2019s LitCOVID,[17] Dimensions COVID-19 Research Export File publications,[18] MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The search was comprehensive with no restrictions to any language. Non-English papers and abstracts were translated. The search was developed and conducted by both authors of this study."}, {"section_title": "SEARCH STRATEGY ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "The search strategy was designed following PICOS approach to include all studies that discuss dental considerations including risk, prevention, standard of care, and recommendations during the COVID-19 outbreak. For this, a number of search terms were used in all databases which comprised of: COVID; COVID-19; COVID-2019; 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2; Corona; oral; mouth; dental; dentist; dentistry; dentition; stomatology; stomatognathic; teeth; tooth; gingiva; periodontal; periodontium; saliva; and salivary.\nThe main search was carried out using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19 2020), which includes (29,506) research studies and was last updated on March 13, 2020. The studies included any of the following terms: oral; mouth; dental; dentist; dentistry; dentition; stomatology; stomatognathic; teeth; tooth; gingiva; periodontal; periodontium; saliva; salivary; COVID; COVID-19; COVID-2019; 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2 or Corona were retrieved. Then duplicate articles were eliminated. Later, the titles of the selected articles were screened followed by reviewing the abstracts of the selected studies. This was done by two independent researchers to determine the studies\u2019 eligibility and relevance to the research question. Lastly, all articles that were published prior to 2020 were eliminated, and the remaining articles were retrieved in full text."}, {"section_title": "STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Considering the novelty of the disease, all studies that matched the search terms were included. Studies were expected to be heterogenous, which is acceptable as the aim was to provide a comprehensive overview and answer questions related to COVID-19. The search was performed by two calibrated researchers independently, and any disagreement in data collection was resolved by consensus meeting."}, {"section_title": "PATIENT\u2019S PRECAUTIONS ::: RESULTS", "text": "Zhang and Jiang[29] recommended triage personnel to follow grade-1 medical protection in addition to wearing goggles and gowns."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "As a result of the high transmissibility rate of COVID-19 and lack of unproven cure, it has been escalated as a global pandemic outbreak.[6] Cross-infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that are less transmissible than 2019-nCoV within the dental facility has been reported, with recommendations to resume dental care one month after recovery.[36] Ricci et al.[37] reported a cross-transmission of pneumonia resulting from contaminated dental unit waterline. Although COVID-19 cross-transmission within the dental facility has not been documented so far, yet the disease is still emerging, and this should not be eliminated.\nStudies included in this systematic review highlighted various aspects of risks and general precautions within dental facilities. These studies focused on reinforcing infection measures as a standard of care and minimizing human-to-human contact during the outbreak.[2] Dentists need to maintain a high level of personal protection including PPE, face mask,[38] preferably N95 with aerosol-generating procedures, and face shield to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.[129] Overall, the consensus is to screen all patients prior to initiating any dental procedure and restricting dental care to emergency cases only.[22] However, this could create an increased demand in future for routine dental care, which amplifies the burden on dental healthcare system when the COVID-19 threat is resolved. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to remain viable in aerosol up to 3 h with an estimated half-life of 5.6\u20136.8 h on stainless-steel and plastic respectively.[39] Thus, complying with strict infection control measures and minimizing aerosol generation with special attention to operatory ventilation and surface disinfection is crucial.[404142] COVID-19 medical wastes are considered highly infectious and should be handled in accordance with medical waste management regulations.[23] The WHO[43] recommends using an autoclavable leak-proof yellow plastic bag marked with a biohazard symbol and tagged as highly infectious. This should be placed in container and collected once a day or when three-quarters of the plastic bag is filled.\nA good coordinated referral system between dental offices and hospitals that are prepared for COVID-19 patients is mandated with special care to identify suspected asymptomatic cases.[24] Cognitive behavioral therapy is beneficial to distressed dentists, dental team and dental patients.[4445] In addition, with the fourth industrial evolution, integrating robotics, artificial intelligence, and teledentistry to the dental education and practice became a necessity for the twenty-first century.[4647] This could help in maintaining continuity of dental care without straining resources or jeopardizing safety, in the case of occurrence of a future public emergency of a similar scale.\nOne of the limitations of the included studies in this review is the fact that most of these studies are done within a single country, and they follow Chinese rules and regulations which could potentially introduce the risk of reporting and regulatory bias. WHO[48] and CDC[49] recommendations for hand hygiene and infection control measures could be considered. Another limitation is the scarcity of literature within this consistently emerging disease, which requires further investigations and the development of a global consensus in the fight against this pandemic crisis."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ::: CONCLUSION", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP ::: CONCLUSION", "text": "Not applicable."}, {"section_title": "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ::: CONCLUSION", "text": "All authors declare no conflict of interest relevant to this article."}, {"section_title": "AUTHORS CONTRIBUTIONS ::: CONCLUSION", "text": "Both Khawlah A.
