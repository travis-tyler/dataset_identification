[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Sandy Hook is a barrier spit that extends northerly for about 18 km (Fig. 1). The northernmost 10 km comprises the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area. The southern 12 km of Sandy Hook is lined with a massive seawall that eventually terminates within the Park. Because of a negative sediment budget and the impacts of the seawall, the area immediately to the north of the end of the seawall (Critical Zone) has had a history of erosion (Psuty and Pace, 2009). At times, components of the Park infrastructure (buildings, utilities, parking, the only road in this location) have been damaged as erosion has narrowed this portion of the spit and threatened to create an inlet. Approximately 5 km to the north of the Critical Zone, the orientation of the spit trends to the north-northwest and ambient wave energy decreases. The result of the change is a reduction of the transport capacity of the inshore waves and currents to produce an area of sediment accretion at Gunnison Beach (Fig. 1). In a unique project to balance the sediment budget in the eroding Critical Zone, a pipeline has been constructed from Gunnison Beach to the Critical Zone with the intent to pump a sand slurry updrift and move sediment from the site of accumulation to the site of erosion (Fig. 1). Although it is intended to extract the sand from the recreational beach at Gunnison and place primarily in the recreational beach at the Critical Zone, there is a possibility that the sediment transfers may alter some of the feeding zones of the piping plover habitat that adjoins the recreational beaches (Goldin, 1993). The piping plover is on the New Jersey list of endangered species. It is a shorebird that nests in the habitat between the primary dunes and beach face. In order to determine the magnitude of the possible impacts of the sediment manipulation and beach changes on plover feeding habitat, a baseline characterization of the diversity and abundance of beach macrofauna is being conducted prior to any sediment movement. This report describes the data gathered over twenty seven months of monitoring prior to the beginning of the pipeline activity, currently planned for late fall 2011. "}, {"section_title": "SAMPLING PROCEDURE", "text": "The major feeding area of the shorebird habitat is the beach face (Elias, et al., 2000) where the birds, such as the piping plover, forage for food during most of their life cycle. Their primary prey on this dynamic portion of the beach are marine macrofauna , consisting of worms, crustaceans, mollusks, insects, etc. (O'Brien, et al., 2006). Therefore, sampling of the beach face macrofauna was conducted at Gunnison and at the Critical Zone to provide a characterization of the ambient assemblages. Six full sampling campaigns were accomplished over a period from July 2008 to September 2010. The field and laboratory methodology used to conduct the sampling, processing, and identification of macrofauna followed the guidelines provided on the Protocol to Monitor the Intertidal Macrofauna: Quantifying Piping Plover Habitat Quality on Renourished Beaches at Sandy Hook Unit, GNRA (Psuty, et al., 2009). In addition, because testing of the slurry pipeline was scheduled to begin in November 2009, a limited sampling campaign supplemented the seasonal collection prior to the proposed pumping operation. The brief window permitted only one sampling campaign during the spring-tide, low tide position on the profile. This location tended to have the greatest abundance of macrofauna in the past sampling campaigns and was chosen in preference to other zones on the beach face. This was the only zone sampled prior to the testing of the pipeline. Eventually, because of stormy and very cold weather, along with mechanical problems, the late fall operation of the slurry pipeline occurred during a very few days and very little impact was accomplished either at Gunnison or the Critical Zone."}, {"section_title": "BEACH TOPOGRAPHY AND SAMPLING POSITIONS", "text": "Three transect areas on the beach face were selected for monitoring in the Critical Zone as well as at Gunnison Beach. In the Critical Zone, the transects are located in the recreational beach, Transects P7 and PE2 , and in the shorebird protected area updrift (P3) of the potential sand slurry emplacement ( Fig. 2). At Gunnison Beach, a transect is located at the site of sediment extraction (G3) and in the shorebird protected areas both updrift and downdrift (G1 and G5, respectively) of the pipeline intake ( Fig. 3). Specific elevations of the samplings were related to tide levels derived from the NOAA tide gauge at Sandy Hook. The beach face sampling locations are indicated by color-coded brackets corresponding to the swash zones of the tidal-position water-levels described in Figures 5 through 16. All of the beach profiles incorporate mean sea level (MSL at the Sandy Hook tidal station) as the vertical reference, relative to NAVD88. The collections of beach topographical surveys in the Critical Zone and at Gunnison beach are part of an ongoing monitoring project. The beach topographical surveys conducted nearest the date of macrofaunal sampling were used to create the profile at each transect and to plot the locations of the macrofaunal sampling ( Figures 5-12). Collecting was accomplished in late spring/early summer when the shorebirds were nesting and feeding, and in the early fall when the shorebirds were leaving the sites. The goal was to determine macrofauna diversity and abundance in the beach face at the time of the reproductive life cycle of the piping plovers and at the end of their presence at Sandy Hook. Three of the campaigns occurred near the beginning of the nesting season and three were done near the end of the plover presence on-site. An additional campaign was accomplished immediately prior to testing of pipeline toward the end of 2009:   The swash line present at four different tidal-position water-levels defined where the sampling occurred on the beach face ( Fig. 4): 1. The highest of the predicted high tides -Spring Tide High Tide (STHT) 2. The lowest of the predicted high tides -Neap Tide High Tide (NTHT) 3. The highest of the predicted low tides -Neap Tide Low Tide (NTLT) 4. The lowest of the predicted low tides -Spring Tide Low Tide (STLT) "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The results of the several field campaigns are summarized below. The complete data set is presented in an appendix to this report, organized by site and in chronological order."}, {"section_title": "MACROFAUNA", "text": "The transect profiles illustrate the areas collected during each of the sampling campaigns and their relationship to the beachface topography and mean sea level. The counts of organisms encountered are summarized in Table 1 by class and by a number of groupings: beach face location (tidal level swash zone), month and year, protection status (nesting or non-nesting area), sampling area (extraction/emplacement), and transect.     * Samples collected in December 2009 are from the STLT beach face location only. The organisms in the class malacostraca consisted of amphipods (sand fleas) and decapods (sand crabs); the former preferring the dry upper beach face (STHT and NTHT) and the later the wet lower beach face (STLT and NTLT). Insects, mostly winged, were found on the upper beach face. September's exceptionally high number of malacostraca was primarily composed of sand crabs. Sand crabs are usually found in groups and not evenly distributed in the beach face."}, {"section_title": "MACROFAUNA DATA SUMMARY", "text": "The data indicate that macrofaunal assemblages are greater in number later in the year. This is due to an increase in the count of organisms belonging to the class Malacostraca (sand crabs and sand fleas). The vast majority of these are sand crabs less than 1 cm in length. The data indicate that the organisms are more concentrated at the low tide positions throughout the sampling periods. Both polychaete worms and sand crabs are the primary organisms found at this section of the beach face. It is also noted that non-nesting areas had about 70% more organisms than nesting areas. Of all organisms found, the vast majority (over 82%) are from the class Malacostraca (sand crabs and sand fleas)."}, {"section_title": "SEDIMENTS", "text": "Each sample was processed to generate a series of descriptive statistics. The statistical values include mean grain size, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The data are reported in Phi units utilizing the Wentworth classification of sediment size classes illustrated in Table 2. Most of the sediments on the beach face have a mean grain size in the medium sand category, 1 to 2 Phi (Table 3). However, many of the sediment samples in the lower portion of the beach face, those areas in the low tide zones, have mean grain sizes that are in the category of fine gravel, -1 to -2 Phi, or coarse to very coarse sand, 1.0 to -1.0 Phi. Standard deviation is a measure of the sorting of the sediment sample. Well-sorted sediments have a tight grouping about the mean measure, small standard deviation, whereas poorly sorted sediments have a very broad distribution of sizes, a higher standard deviation value. Well-sorted sediment samples have a standard deviation value less that 0.5, whereas moderately well-sorted and moderately sorted sediments have values range to 1.4, and poorly-sorted sediments are greater than 1.4. Sorting is poorest at the low tide levels on the profiles. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the sample, with positive values indicating an abundance of coarser sediments and negative values representing a shift toward finer sediments. Most of the samples have very minor skewness values except for the samples from the low tide position. They tend to have the largest skewness of sediments on the profile for the sampling period, indicative of the largest admixture of coarse sediments in the sample.   /SUM  GB  G3  N  NTHT  2  0  195  5/14/2009  SPR/SUM  GB  G3  N  NTHT  3  0  196  5/14/2009  SPR/SUM  GB  G5  Y  NTHT  1  0  197  5/14/2009  SPR/SUM  GB  G5  Y  NTHT  2  0 /FAL  GB  G3  N  STLT  1  30  245  9/18/2009  SUM/FAL  GB  G3  N  STLT  2  18  246  9/18/2009  SUM/FAL  GB  G3  N  STLT  3  18  1  247  9/19/2009  SUM/FAL  CZ  P3  Y  STLT  1  4  6 Special  CZ  P7  N  STLT  3  1  295  12/2/2009  Special  GB  G1  Y  STLT  1  296  12/2/2009  Special  GB  G1  Y  STLT  2  297  12/2/2009  Special  GB  G1  Y  STLT  3  2  298 12 Grain-size data are organized by location, Gunnison Beach or the Critical Zone, and by Profiles in each of these sites.
