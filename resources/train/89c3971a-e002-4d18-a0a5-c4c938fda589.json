[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Agriculture on the American Great Plains has been constrained by historical water scarcity. After World War II, technological improvements made groundwater from the Ogallala aquifer available for irrigation. Comparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties, groundwater access increased irrigation intensity and initially reduced the impact of droughts. Over time, land-use adjusted toward water-intensive crops and drought-sensitivity increased; conversely, farmers in water-scarce counties maintained drought-resistant practices that fully mitigated higher drought-sensitivity.\nLand values capitalized the Ogallala's value at $26 billion in 1974; as extraction remained high and water levels declined, the Ogallala's value fell to $9 billion in 2002.\nJEL: N52, Q54 * For many helpful comments and suggestions, we thank seminar participants at Bocconi, Brown,"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Water resources are critical to agricultural development in many arid regions, such as the Western United States (Coman 1911; Hansen, Libecap, and Lowe 2011) and India (Rao 1979; Shah 1993; Moench 1996; FAO 1999; Schoengold and Zilberman 2007; Keskin 2009 ). Water scarcity is often exacerbated by inefficient water allocation, and much research has focused on common pool externalities and the institutional structure for water allocation (Gisser 1983; Ostrom 1990; Provencher and Oscar 1993; Blomquist 1994; Aggarwal and Narayan 2004; Foster and Rosenzweig 2008; Sekhri 2008; Rosegrant et al. 2009; Ostrom 2011; Libecap 2011) .\nGroundwater resources are being depleted as agricultural economies grow and become increasingly dependent on groundwater irrigation. Future climate change may affect precipitation, temperature, and the incidence of extreme drought. Yet, it is difficult to identify how agricultural land-use and drought sensitivity adapt to water availability in the short-run and, of more interest, evolve over many decades. In general, the economic impacts of environmental change depend on how economic agents adjust in the long-run to mitigate short-run impacts (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw 1994; Schlenker, Hanemann, and Fisher 2006; Deschenes and Greenstone 2007; Guiteras 2009; Schlenker and Roberts 2009; Dell, Jones, and Olken 2011; Olmstead and Rhode 2011; Hornbeck forthcoming) . Historical changes in groundwater availability provide a unique opportunity to identify long-run agricultural adjustments and how land-use evolves to accommodate water resources and climates.\nThis paper analyzes the impacts of groundwater on agricultural land-use and drought sensitivity, exploiting local variation in Plains counties' access to the Ogallala aquifer. The Ogallala was formed by ancient runoff from the Rocky Mountains, trapped below the modern Great Plains, and it maintains distinct irregular boundaries that cut across modern soil groups and natural vegetation regions. The Ogallala was first discovered in the 1890s, but it remained mainly inaccessible. Following World War II, improved pumps and center pivot irrigation technology made Ogallala groundwater available for large-scale irrigated agriculture.\nThe baseline empirical specifications compare counties over the Ogallala with nearby counties in the same state and soil group, controlling for longitude, latitude, average precipitation, and average temperature. Historical county-level data are drawn from the Census of Agriculture and merged with a United States Geological Survey map of the Ogallala's original boundary. Extended empirical specifications estimate the interaction between groundwater and climate, using annual data on crop yields and drought severity. Ogallala counties and non-Ogallala counties had similar characteristics prior to improved groundwater availability, lending support to the identification assumption that Ogallala counties would otherwise have been similar to non-Ogallala counties.\nGroundwater has theoretically distinct short-run and long-run impacts when farmers adjust production methods faster than crop choice. In the short-run, farmers increase irrigation intensity, causing crop yields to become less sensitive to drought. In the long-run, farmers shift land toward water-intensive crops, causing yields to become more sensitive to drought. The net impact of groundwater is theoretically ambiguous, depending on relative adjustment along the intensive (short-run) and extensive (long-run) margins. 1 In each period, the net present value of access to groundwater is capitalized in agricultural land values. Following the introduction of improved pumps and center pivot irrigation technology, irrigated farmland increased substantially in counties over the Ogallala, both in absolute terms and relative to nearby similar counties. Farmers increased irrigation first along the intensive margin, shifting non-irrigated farmland to irrigation, before somewhat expanding total farmland.\nIn the production of crops, farmers' initial response was to increase the irrigation intensity of corn and wheat. Irrigated corn acreages and irrigated wheat acreages increased, while total corn and wheat acreages were mostly unchanged. In later periods, farmers shifted land toward the more water-intensive corn.\nConsistent with the model, farmers' short-run adjustments reduced the impact of drought on water-intensive corn yields. In the long-run, changes in land allocations increased the impact of drought on corn yields. Conversely, farmers in nearby water-scarce counties have maintained drought-resistant agricultural practices that fully mitigate their naturally higher sensitivity to drought.\nGroundwater access remains a valuable agricultural asset, however, improving crops' drought-resistance in the short-run and enabling the production of higher value crops in the long-run. Estimated land value premiums capitalized the Ogallala's peak value at $26 billion in the 1970's and, as extraction rates remained high and water levels declined, the Ogallala's estimated value fell to $9 billion in 2002. The impact on agricultural revenues has been increasing over time, particularly as farmers adjusted toward high-value water-intensive corn. In the modern period, declining land values and rising revenues are consistent with expectations that many areas will lose access to Ogallala groundwater. As the region loses access to groundwater, the estimates predict short-run increases in drought sensitivity before long-run adaptations increase resistance to drought.\nThe economic impacts of groundwater and its interaction with climate are difficult to observe in modern settings, as short-run data do not capture the extent of long-run agricultural adaptation. Agricultural adaptation can reverse estimated short-run impacts, as adoption of drought-resistant practices reduces drought impacts in areas lacking groundwater access. Losing access to groundwater is costly, but it need not increase vulnerability to drought in the long-run. For settings in which long-run historical perspective is unavailable, the Ogallala provides a stark example of agricultural adaptation to groundwater and climate."}, {"section_title": "I Background on the Ogallala Aquifer", "text": "The Ogallala aquifer is one of the world's largest underground freshwater sources. It was formed by ancient runoff from the Rocky Mountains, trapped amidst accumulated sand, gravel, clay, and silt. The Ogallala is a closed aquifer, essentially a nonrenewable resource, that receives less than an inch of annual recharge due to minimal rainfall, high evaporation, and low infiltration of surface water (Zwingle 1993; Opie 1993; McGuire et al. 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "The Ogallala underlies 174,000 square miles of the Great Plains from the Texas panhandle to South Dakota. The Ogallala's boundaries are sharply defined by the location of ancient valleys and hills, which have long since been covered and obscured on the surface."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The Ogallala was first discovered by the United States Geological Survey in the 1890s, but was considered of limited agricultural importance (Webb 1931; US Department of Commerce 1937). Windmill pumps could only provide small quantities of water, approximately enough to irrigate 5 acres or provide for 30 cattle (Cunfer 2005) . In a 1928 bulletin, the Nebraska Agricultural Extension Service highlighted the need for improved irrigation methods to supplement scarce rainfall and streams; while \"the underground water supply is abundant,\" there are insufficient means of \"lifting it to the surface and applying it to the land\" (Weakley and Zook 1928) . Groundwater irrigation was thought to be of great potential value, particularly in raising corn yields, but pumps were small and/or expensive (Weakly 1932; Weakly 1936) . \"Most of the pumps are operated by the general-purpose tractor, which is used principally for other farm work;\" \"irrigation pumps are considered as equipment for emergency use by a large proportion of Nebraska owners\" (Brackett and Lewis 1933) .\nAfter World War II, automobile engines were adapted to power improved pumps, lifting groundwater cheaply and in larger volumes. In the 1950's, Nebraska Agricultural Exten-sion Service bulletins discuss the growing importance of groundwater irrigation pumps (Epp 1954) . Thorfinnson and Epp (1953) report that pump irrigation increases corn yields and \"serves as partial insurance against the hazards of drought.\" Rhoades et al. (1954) discuss how, as lands become irrigated, farmers can adjust corn \"production practices to take full advantage of irrigation water.\" To guide adaptation in sub-humid Plains areas, Gertel et al. (1956) draw lessons from a local Nebraska river basin: through production adjustments, irrigation allows a higher-value crop rotation, with an emphasis on corn, and provides partial insurance against drought.\nIn these early years, groundwater was mainly pumped into open irrigation furrows. Sprinkler systems were not widely adopted due to technical limitations and high capital and labor costs (Bonnen et al. 1952) .\n4 In Texas, agricultural bulletins in 1952 focused on wheat production, for which irrigation \"is generally a practice of supplementing the natural rainfall and is not an intensive irrigation of the crop\" (Porter et al. 1952) . \"Only a limited amount of corn is grown\" and \"practically all of the corn acreage is under irrigation because of the low natural rainfall\" (Rogers and Collier 1952) .\nGroundwater irrigation increased substantially with the subsequent introduction and adoption of center pivot technology. Originally invented in 1949 by a Colorado farmer, Frank Zybach, the \"self-propelled sprinkling apparatus\" combined recent advances in turbine pumps, steel and aluminum pipes, and lawn sprinklers.\n5 Center pivot technology was particularly suited to the Great Plains: able to direct water to plants with minimal evaporation in dry windy weather and able to accommodate large fields with hilly or sandy land. Zybach's patent was granted in 1952 and he moved home to Nebraska and partnered with a local businessman to begin manufacturing prototypes. Yet early center pivot machines were unreliable; in 1954, they sold the patent to the Nebraska-based Valley Manufacturing Company, who improved the design and began large-scale production and distribution. Competition increased after Zybach's original patent expired in 1969, though Nebraska remains the hub of the center pivot irrigation industry.\nAs pumping and center pivot irrigation technologies were improved and adopted, Ogal- Bonnen et al. (1952) , \"Use of Irrigation Water on the High Plains,\" Texas Bulletin 756: \"A few operators have attempted to overcome the disadvantage of steep slopes and extremely sandy soils through the use of sprinkler systems. These have the advantage of providing an even distribution of water on land difficult to water by other means. The practice has not been widely adopted partly because of a greatly increased investment, higher pumping costs, the additional labor involved in moving the system over the land, the difficulty of applying water rapidly enough especially during periods of high temperatures, and the uneven wetting of the soil during periods of windy weather.

There has been little strict regulation of water-use, though some states and local water management districts have increasingly limited new wells, restricted \"wastage,\" and explored well-metering.

(2001), Peterson and Ding (2005) , and Pfeiffer and Lin (2010) analyze Ogallala farmers' adoption of irrigation technology and changes in groundwater extraction.\n7 Ogallala groundwater is also used for drinking water, though much of the Plains population has access to alternative drinking water sources. Ogallala water does not meet EPA drinking water standards in a few counties (Guru and Horne 2000) . 8 In the corners of plots, farmers either accept lower yields or plant less water-intensive crops. Less often, farmers install more-costly irrigation equipment that also reach the corners. Torrell et al. (1990) compare the market value of irrigated and non-irrigated farms in the Ogallala region, though irrigation decisions may be correlated with unobserved land and farm characteristics.\n9 There is mixed evidence on whether irrigation broadly affects downwind precipitation (see DeAngelis et al. 2010 for a recent study).\n10 Underground water flows vary in speed throughout the Ogallala, but in no area do individual farmers internalize a meaningful portion of their private water extraction. soon drawn from distant sources. Standard plot sizes begin at 160 acres on the US Plains, much larger than in India, so wells have less temporary effect on neighboring wells.\n13 Large plot sizes also imply that fixed costs of digging a well are relatively less important than the marginal costs of water extraction. Because farmers' water extraction is almost entirely an externality, there is little local variation in the degree of externality, and this paper focuses on other questions concerning land-use adaptation and drought sensitivity. For this set of questions, a relative advantage to studying Ogallala groundwater is that the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has detailed maps on the Ogallala's location; thus, it is not necessary to infer groundwater availability from constructed wells or other agricultural decisions. In addition, the annual availability of groundwater is not directly affected by drought and agricultural landuse, because the Ogallala is a large closed aquifer. Over time, water levels are affected by agricultural activity, so the empirical analysis assigns groundwater availability using USGS pre-development Ogallala boundaries."}, {"section_title": "II Agricultural Adaptation to Groundwater and Climate", "text": "Technological innovations substantially increased water availability for agriculture over the Ogallala. In this simple model, farmers can adjust the water-intensity of production on the intensive margin (within crops) and the extensive margin (between crops). Depending on the relative speed and magnitude of adjustment on the intensive and extensive margins, groundwater access has different short-run and long-run impacts on the sensitivity of agricultural production to drought.

Over time, aquifer water flows underground to equalize levels.\n14 In particular, we introduce three assumptions. First, the marginal product of water is higher for the first crop: \u2202y 1 /\u2202w 1 > \u2202y 2 /\u2202w 2 > 0. Second, the marginal product of water declines slower for the first crop:\nThird, water and land are complementary for both crops, but weakly more so for the first crop:\nand extensive margins:\nOn the intensive margin, the farmer uses more water for the water-intensive crop.

In a dynamic setting, agricultural adjustment may be delayed on the intensive margin and/or extensive margin, as after the Dust Bowl in this region (Hornbeck forthcoming) . The increase in groundwater availability may also be gradual, as pumping and center pivot irrigation technologies improve. Agricultural rents increase as production adjusts along both margins. Agricultural land values increase immediately in anticipation of later rent increases, to the extent that increases in water endowments are unexpected."}, {"section_title": "II.B Adaptation to Drought Risk and Groundwater", "text": "Of further interest is how a farmer adapts to drought risk, particularly when there is a change in groundwater availability.

Given optimal allocations of water and land, the impact of drought is given by:\nOf particular interest, an increase in the water endowment has an ambiguous effect on the impact of drought:\nOn the intensive margin, an increase in water mitigates the impact of drought on each crop (the first term). On the extensive margin, however, land shifts toward the more drought-15 Changes in water usage for the less water-intensive crop (\u2202w * 2 (w)/\u2202w) can be positive or negative, depending on the production function parameters.\n16 In practice, a farmer may partially adjust inputs when a drought occurs; for the model, it is only necessary that a farmer is less able to adjust inputs after a drought is known than before the season began.\n17 In particular, we introduce two additional assumptions. First, drought decreases the productivity of land for both crops, but drought has a larger negative effect on the water-intensive crop: \u2202 2 y 1 /\u2202L 1 \u2202d < \u2202 2 y 2 /\u2202L 2 \u2202d < 0. Second, drought increases the productivity of water for both crops, but more so for the water-intensive crop:\nsensitive crop (the second term). The water-intensive crop may also become more sensitive to drought as the land allocation shifts (e.g., growing corn in the Texas panhandle). If land allocations are constrained in the short-run, an increase in the water endowment only increases water usage on the intensive margin and mitigates the impact of drought. In the long-run, however, as land allocations adjust, drought has more impact and may even affect agricultural production more than before. Refer to the Theory Appendix for a proof of this general case.\nFor a stark example, consider a plausible special case in which a farmer maximizes\nAfter an increase in the water endowment, in the short-run, per-acre crop water usage increases and the impact of drought is mitigated. In the long-run, however, the farmer shifts land to the water-intensive crop (\u2202L * 1 (w)/\u2202w > 0) and per-acre crop water usage is unchanged (\u2202w * 1 (w)/\u2202w = \u2202w * 2 (w)/\u2202w = 0). Thus, in the long-run, an increase in the water endowment magnifies the impact of drought. Refer to the Theory Appendix for a proof of this special case.\nThe comparative statics are intuitive for a symmetric loss in groundwater. In the shortrun, crop choice remains fixed and there is less available water, so drought has a larger impact on production. In the long-run, crop choice shifts toward the drought-resistant crop and the impact of drought is mitigated. If there is sufficient change in crop choice, then the impact of drought may become even less than before the loss in groundwater. In the cross-section, areas without groundwater may sufficiently adapt toward non-water-intensive crops to fully mitigate their naturally higher impact of drought."}, {"section_title": "III Data Construction and County Differences by Ogallala Share", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "III.A Census Data and Spatial Patterns", "text": "Historical county-level data are available every five years from the US Census of Agriculture (Gutmann 2005; Haines 2005) .\n18 The main variables of interest include: irrigated acres and total acres of agricultural land, harvested acres and bushels of corn and wheat, value of agricultural revenue, and value of agricultural land. The empirical analysis focuses on a balanced panel of 368 Plains counties, from 1920 to 2002, for which data are available in every period of analysis. To account for occasional changes in county borders, census data are adjusted in later periods to maintain 1920 county definitions (Hornbeck 2010) . Figure 1 maps the Ogallala aquifer, overlaid with county borders in 1920. The shaded area represents the USGS's estimated original boundary of the aquifer, prior to intensive use for agriculture. The sample is restricted to counties within 100 kilometers of the aquifer 18 We thank Haines and collaborators for providing additional data. The empirical research design exploits spatial variation in access to Ogallala groundwater, comparing counties over the Ogallala with nearby similar counties. To focus on comparisons among \"nearby similar counties,\" the empirical specifications control for average differences by state, soil group, longitude, latitude, average precipitation, and average temperature. States, mapped in Figure 1 , capture differences in region, state agricultural extension services, and other state-level policies.\nFigure 4 displays major soil groups in the Plains, as defined by the Soil Conservation Service in 1951. The 1951 SCS map was scanned, traced in GIS software, and merged to 1920 county borders to assign each county the fraction of its area in each soil group. These soil groups proxy for detailed regional determinants of agricultural production. For example, \"Alluvial Soils\" occur along major rivers and predict higher irrigation in 1935. Conversely, \"Sand and Silt\" in North-Central Nebraska is unproductive for agriculture. The Ogallala boundary cuts across major soil groups; importantly, as the analysis effectively compares Ogallala and non-Ogallala counties within the same soil group.\nClimate and geographic location may also influence agricultural production, even withinstate and within-soil group.

The Ogallala boundary cuts across the two largest vegetation regions (\"Short Grass\" and \"Tall Grass\") and more-wooded river areas (\"Oak-Hickory\"). Table 1 reports estimated differences between Ogallala counties and non-Ogallala counties, prior to the increased availability of Ogallala groundwater for intensive agricultural use. Column 1 reports average sample county characteristics in 1920, or in the earliest year available.

After controlling for state and soil group, there are no substantial or statistically significant differences between Ogallala counties and non-Ogallala counties in 1920. These estimates lend support to the identification assumption that Ogallala and non-Ogallala counties would have been similar in later years, if not for access to Ogallala groundwater.\nThe empirical specifications do not control for pre-differences in county agricultural outcomes, as early differences may be partly attributed to the Ogallala. Ogallala groundwater was available to farmers on a limited scale through the use of early pumps, windmills, and irrigation techniques. Expected improvements in Ogallala access may also influence farmers and land speculators."}, {"section_title": "III.C Changes in County Characteristics by Ogallala Group", "text": "For a preliminary view of the data, Figure 5 plots average outcomes over time for two groups of sample counties: counties less than 10% over the Ogallala, and counties more than 90% over the Ogallala.\n21 By contrast, the main empirical specifications use continuous variation in counties' Ogallala share and control for other differences among sample counties.\n20 In later years, residual scatterplots indicate that the Ogallala's impact is roughly linear in the fraction of county land over the Ogallala. The county means and regressions are weighted by county acres, as the empirical analysis is focused on changes for an average acre of land over the Ogallala.\n21 Average outcomes for the in-between counties are between the averages for the two groups shown, but this third category is omitted from the figure for increased clarity.

In this way, the research design exploits the sharp spatial discontinuity created by the Ogallala's irregular boundary. Robustness checks limit the sample to counties that intersect the Ogallala boundary.\nThe Ogallala's impact may vary over the analyzed region. For example, the Ogallala may have less impact in areas with unproductive soil and more impact in areas with productive soil and water deficiencies. For simplicity, the analysis reports the impact of the Ogallala on the average acre of land over the Ogallala. For this purpose, the regressions are weighted by county size.\nDifferences in the estimated \u03b2's, from one year to another year, report the average change for an Ogallala county relative to a non-Ogallala county over that time period. Differencing the estimated coefficients is numerically equivalent to estimating equation (3) with county fixed effects. 24 The standard error of the difference is generally 20-40% lower than the standard error of the two cross-sectional coefficients due to positive serial correlation in county-level outcomes. The change in \u03b2's can be interpreted as the changing impact of the Ogallala, under the weaker identification assumption that sample counties would have had the same average changes if not for the Ogallala. For the statistical inference, standard errors are clustered at the county level to adjust for heteroskedasticity and within-county correlation over time. When allowing for spatial correlation among sample counties, the estimated standard errors increase by approximately 10-30%. 26 By 1950, irrigation was a statistically insignificant 1.3 percentage points higher in Ogallala counties than in non-Ogallala counties. As groundwater irrigation technology improved and agricultural production adjusted, this difference increased to 11.3 percentage points by 1978. Ogallala counties maintained substantially higher irrigation levels through 1997. Column 2 reports the estimated impact of the Ogallala on acres of total farmland per county acre. The fraction of county land in farms was similar in Ogallala and non-Ogallala counties through 1959, though higher in some periods. Since the 1960's, the fraction of county land in farms has been consistently higher by 5 to 7 percentage points in Ogallala counties. This small relative increase mainly reflects a slower absolute decline in farmland than in non-Ogallala counties.\nComparing the estimates in column 1 and column 2, initial adjustments in agricultural 24 Differencing and fixed effects are equivalent for two time periods; for this multi-period regression, the specification is essentially separable for any two time periods. The explanatory variables are fully interacted with time, such that the impact of each variable is allowed to vary in each year. The sample is also balanced in each regression, such that every county has data in every analyzed period. Thus, the estimated coefficients in any one year are not influenced by county outcomes in any other year.\n25 Spatial correlation among counties is assumed to be declining linearly up to a distance cutoff and zero after that cutoff (Conley 1999) . For a distance cutoff of 100 miles or 200 miles, the estimated Conley standard errors are approximately 10-30% higher than the standard errors when clustering at the county level, depending on the outcome variable.\n26 Note that the first row of coefficients for each outcome are the same coefficients reported in column 5 of Table 1 .\nproduction were mainly on the intensive margin. Farmers increased irrigation of existing farmland, shifting land from dryland farming. Subsequently, farmers both increased irrigation and relatively expanded production along the extensive margin of total farmland.\nV.B Corn and Wheat: Irrigated and Total Acreages Table 3 examines the Ogallala's impact on corn and wheat acreages, which are the two major crops in this region with data availability over many years. Irrigated corn and irrigated wheat acreages became higher in Ogallala counties from 1950 through 1964 (columns 1 and 3). Total corn and wheat acreages did not increase over this period (columns 2 and 4); thus, as in Table 2 , initial increases in irrigated corn and wheat represented a shift on the intensive margin away from dryland farming of corn and wheat.\nBy 1978, however, there was a substantial increase in irrigated corn acreages and total corn acreages. Irrigated wheat acreages continued to increase, while total wheat acreages declined.\nIn the context of the model, as groundwater became increasingly available, both corn and wheat initially became more water-intensive. After some delay, crop production shifted toward corn, which is typically more water-intensive and drought-sensitive than wheat."}, {"section_title": "V.C Agricultural Land Values and Revenues", "text": "The model predicts that higher land values over the Ogallala capitalize the net present value of agricultural rents from groundwater. In each period, land values reflect: (1) current agricultural rents, (2) expected increases in rents from future improvements in pumping and irrigation technology, (3) expected increases in rents from adjusting agricultural production, and (4) expected decreases in rents from exhaustion of groundwater.\nIn the 1950's, after the introduction of improved pumping and irrigation technologies, the value of agricultural land and buildings became consistently higher in counties over the Ogallala (Table 4 , column 1).\n27 The land value premium peaks at 51% in 1964 (0.415 log points), and has since declined to 19% in 2002 (0.178 log points).

From 1900 to 1940, when data are available separately for land and buildings, the value of land is the much larger component.\n28 The coefficient \u03b2 implies that land values would decline by (e \u03b2 \u22121) e \u03b2 percent, on average, in the absence of Ogallala groundwater. This percent decline is multiplied by the total value of land over the Ogallala, estimated as the sum of each county's total land value multiplied by its share of land over the Ogallala. The estimates' t-statistics are approximately the same as in column 1; they would be identical, but the estimated log point differences are converted to percent differences. the value of Ogallala groundwater rises from $8.9 billion in 1950 to a peak of $26 billion in 1974, and declines to $9.0 billion by 2002.

An alternative interpretation is that the marginal value of water has declined in recent periods (e.g., declining relative prices of water-intensive crops). While agricultural rents are not directly observable, agricultural revenues provide a useful proxy.\n30 Table 4 , column 5, reports that agricultural revenues have been higher over the Ogallala since the late 1940's, but increased substantially in the 1970's as agriculture shifted toward greater corn acreages over the Ogallala. The impact on revenues has increased in recent periods, as land values have declined, suggesting that the marginal return to water remains high and decreased land values reflect market expectations of exhaustion."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "The estimated Ogallala premiums in land values and revenues may reflect the combination of a variety of factors, including: (1) increased allocation of land to high value crops, (2) increased crop yields, (3) decreased irrigation costs, (4) general increases in yields of waterintensive crops, and (5) general increases in prices of water-intensive crops. In particular, the introduction of hybrid corn or increased corn prices may increase the Ogallala's value if the Ogallala enables counties to grow corn. It is appropriate that the marginal return to water reflect relative changes in the prices and productivity of water-intensive activities. For example, as policymakers consider the risk of an oil pipeline contaminating Ogallala groundwater, these five factors jointly contribute to the policy-relevant valuation of Ogallala groundwater for agricultural production.\nHigher land values over the Ogallala do not appear to reflect increased demand for land in the urban sector. In contrast to other areas of the United States, the sample region is predominately rural and there is less impact of urban expansion on agricultural land values. The Ogallala is not estimated to increase log county population or the fraction of population living in urban areas (i.e., places with population greater than 2500). Further, the estimated 29 The land value price index is defined as the 2002 value of land in sample counties with zero Ogallala share, divided by that year's value of land in sample counties with zero Ogallala share.\n30 If the agricultural production function were Cobb-Douglas, then percent differences in revenue equal the percent differences in unobserved agricultural rents. However, Ogallala counties' higher irrigation expenses suggest that factor shares may not be constant and higher revenues are likely to overstate the impact on rents.\n31 The estimated market valuation of the Ogallala may understate its potential value, to the extent that groundwater extraction externalities induce inefficient water-use. The estimates may overstate the value of groundwater, to the extent that groundwater access encourages greater fixed investments that are capitalized in the value of agricultural land and buildings. land value premiums are similar or higher when restricting the sample to 253 counties with zero urban population in 1920 or 287 counties with less than 25% urban population in 1920."}, {"section_title": "V.D Robustness and General Equilibrium Spillovers", "text": "The empirical results appear robust to changes in the particular empirical specification, as suggested by the unadjusted data reported in the maps (Figures 2 and 3) and aggregate changes by Ogallala share (Figure 5) . The results are generally insensitive to changing the included control variables and/or their functional form. The results are also similar when narrowing the main 368 county sample to 186 counties on the Ogallala boundary, i.e., with Ogallala shares strictly between zero and one.\nThe estimated relative differences in Ogallala counties may not reflect the aggregate impact of the Ogallala if there are spillover effects on non-Ogallala counties. There are minimal direct spillovers in access to water, as Ogallala water is not directly transferred to non-Ogallala counties for agricultural use. The Ogallala may also have limited indirect effects on agricultural prices because the Ogallala region represents a small share of national and world agricultural production. However, to the extent that some markets are more local, nearby non-Ogallala counties may be affected by changes in factor availability and terms-of-trade.\nTo explore local spillover effects, a placebo test compares counties near the Ogallala to counties further from the Ogallala. Restricting the sample to counties with zero Ogallala share, equation (3) is modified to estimate the impact in each year of distance to the Ogallala boundary. For ease of interpretation, distance is measured in units of 100km and made negative. The estimated coefficients are interpreted as the impact of the Ogallala on the nearest sample counties, relative to the impact of the Ogallala on the furthest sample counties. Table 5 reports estimates from this placebo test. For each of the main outcome variables, there is no substantial or statistically detectable relative impact of the Ogallala on nearby non-Ogallala counties. When expanding the sample to counties 200km from the Ogallala boundary for increased statistical power, there remains little detectable impact of the Ogallala on nearby counties relative to further counties."}, {"section_title": "VI Groundwater and Drought: Short-run and Long-run Interaction Effects", "text": "The impact of groundwater on drought sensitivity depends on the relative speed and magnitude of land-use adjustment on the intensive and extensive margins. In response to increased availability of Ogallala groundwater, farmers are estimated to have initially increased wateruse mainly on the intensive margin. Irrigated farmland, irrigated corn acreage, and irrigated wheat acreage became higher in Ogallala counties; in contrast, there was little initial change in total farmland, total corn acreage, and total wheat acreage. In later periods, farmers in-creased total corn acreage, with some small increases in total farmland and small decreases in wheat acreage.\nGiven these findings, the model predicts an initial decline in the sensitivity of corn yields to drought. This effect is predicted to dissipate once total corn acreage increases, expanding into arid drought-sensitive lands. An alternative interpretation is that non-Ogallala counties have adapted to water scarcity by maintaining acreage in drought-resistant crops.\nTo explore the short-run and long-run impact of groundwater on drought sensitivity of corn and wheat yields, annual county-level data are drawn from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In contrast to Census data on harvested acreages, the NASS provides data on planted acreages of corn and wheat. Drought-damaged cropland is often not harvested, so it is important to define crop yields as the log number of bushels produced per planted acre. In the sample region, corn and wheat yields are only available in each year for a limited number of counties between 1940 and 1993. 32 Drought is defined according to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and annual county-level PDSI data are drawn from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).\n33 The PDSI uses cumulative rainfall and temperature to determine dryness or wetness, relative to the local average climate. To focus on drought, the PDSI is set equal to zero in wet years and the index ranges between zero and 7.22 with a 1.16 standard deviation. For ease of interpreting the empirical estimates, we normalize this drought measure to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. Focusing initially on non-Ogallala counties, from 1940 to 1993, background specifications regress log crop yields on drought, with year fixed effects or state-by-year fixed effects. Drought is estimated to have a large negative impact on corn yield and a moderate negative impact on wheat yield. Irrigated crop yields are less-affected by drought than non-irrigated crop yields, particularly for corn. These estimates are consistent with expectations that corn is more water-intensive and drought-sensitive than wheat (Brower and Heibloem 1986; Pimentel et al. 1997) .\nThe main empirical specifications use variation in access to Ogallala groundwater, over space and time, to estimate interaction terms between drought and the Ogallala. Based on previous results, the 54 years of data are split into three 18-year eras: before widespread use of Ogallala irrigation for corn and wheat (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) (1944) (1945) (1946) (1947) (1948) (1949) (1950) (1951) (1952) (1953) (1954) (1955) (1956) (1957) , after increases in the water-intensity of corn and wheat (1958) (1959) (1960) (1961) (1962) (1963) (1964) (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) , and after a shift toward the more water-intensive corn (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) .

After 1993, NASS data is available for fewer counties within these states. 33 We thank Hansen, Libecap, and Lowe (2011) for providing PDSI data.\nand third eras, relative to the first era, conditional on a number of control variables."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "Formally, log crop yield Y in county c and year t is regressed on the triple interaction between a county's Ogallala share, normalized drought index, and a dummy for the second era or third era (Ogallala c \u00d7 Drought ct \u00d7 1(e = 2) and Ogallala c \u00d7 Drought ct \u00d7 1(e = 3)).

In addition, the coefficients \u03b2 3 and \u03b2 4 indicate how the Ogallala affects yields during average weather in the second and third eras, relative to the first era. The sample is balanced in each regression, such that every county included has data in each period. There are fewer counties in each sample, and the states with available data are reported along with the number of county observations. The regressions continue to be weighted by county size, and standard errors are clustered at the county level. Table 6 , panel A, reports estimates from equation (5) for corn yields. In the second era, from 1958 to 1976, the Ogallala substantially mitigated the impact of drought on corn yields. In years when drought was one standard deviation higher, Ogallala counties experienced a 34% to 45% productivity advantage over non-Ogallala counties (0.29 log points to 0.38 log points), relative to average county-level differences in drought sensitivity. Because the sample is restricted to 134 counties over 54 years in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa, Column 1 imposes a restriction on the control variables that \u03b4 4 = \u03b4 5 = \u03b4 6 = 0, column 2 restricts only \u03b4 6 = 0, and column 3 presents the full specification from equation (5). During this second era, there was little change in corn yields during average weather conditions (-0.02 log points to -0.05 log points).\nIn the third era, from 1977 to 1993, the Ogallala lost most of its effect on corn yields during drought (-0.05 log points to 0.08 log points). Yields increased slightly during average weather conditions from the second era to the third era (0.10 log points to 0.13 log points). During this third era, as revenues increased substantially, the Ogallala's main impact was enabling expansion of high-value corn cultivation without inducing severe drops in yields during average weather conditions or droughts. Similarly, by limiting corn cultivation, nonOgallala counties have maintained average yields and drought-resistance despite higher water scarcity.\nBy comparison, panel B, reports estimates from equation (5) for wheat yields. The Ogallala had little detectable impact on wheat yields, which is more drought-resistant than corn and did not experience the same large changes in acreage."}, {"section_title": "VII Conclusion", "text": "Following engineering improvements in pumping and center pivot irrigation, counties over the Ogallala gained access to groundwater amidst the arid Great Plains. Farmers responded initially on the intensive margin by shifting from dryland farming to increase the irrigation intensity of farmland, corn, and wheat. For corn production, which is relatively waterintensive and drought-sensitive, greater irrigation initially decreased the sensitivity of yields to drought.\nOver time, Ogallala farmers expanded corn acreage into new areas and yields again became sensitive to drought. Agricultural revenues increased, along with water extraction rates, and the groundwater table declined. In 2002, the remaining value of Ogallala groundwater had fallen to $9 billion from a peak of $26 billion in 1974.\nLacking access to Ogallala groundwater, nearby counties have maintained agricultural practices that are less water-intensive and more drought-resistant. Agricultural production has adapted to groundwater availability such that, over time, non-Ogallala counties are no more sensitive to drought than heavily-irrigated Ogallala counties.\nAs Ogallala counties lose access to groundwater, corn yields may become more sensitive to drought in the short-run; yet, over time, adoption of neighboring counties' land-use practices can re-establish drought-resistance. Agricultural production will become less valuable without Ogallala groundwater, but neighboring counties illustrate the scope for long-run agricultural adaptation.\nIn the Great Plains and in other arid regions, groundwater resources are becoming exhausted even as climate change threatens to increase drought. The impact on vulnerable agricultural economies depends on the degree of agricultural adaptation; yet, in modern settings, it is difficult to observe adaptation to groundwater access and climate. The history of farming over the Ogallala aquifer reveals the influence of both short-run and long-run agricultural adaptation to groundwater and climate."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1.
