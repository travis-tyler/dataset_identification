[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "El Ni\u00f1o events have worldwide influence and important socioeconomic consequences, and understanding the changes in the properties of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been a longstanding issue. The classical El Ni\u00f1o events occur in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and are referred to as the eastern-Pacific (EP) El Ni\u00f1o. In the 1990s and 2000s, there were frequent occurrences of a new type of El Ni\u00f1o, with a maximum warm anomaly occurring in the central equatorial Pacific, known as the central-Pacific (CP) El Ni\u00f1o (Kao and Yu, 2009;Yu and Kim, 2010). This new type of El Ni\u00f1o, the CP-El Ni\u00f1o, has been receiving more attention in recent Corresponding author: ZHENG Fei, zhengfei@mail.iap.ac.cn years because its increasing intensity in the past three decades has significant implications on the climate variability and change under global warming scenarios (e.g., Lee and McPhaden, 2010). Many of the previous studies have focused on the different teleconnections and climatic impacts of the two types of El Ni\u00f1o (e.g., Weng et al., 2009;Kim et al., 2009;Ashok and Yamagata, 2009), but their other related physical processes have been less focused on in the past. Indeed, as a key indicator of the ocean circulation and hydrological cycle (Lagerloef, 2002), ocean salinity can play an active role in the tropical climate dynamics and ENSO through its influence on horizontal pressure gradients, stratification, and the equatorial thermocline (e.g., Fedorov et al., 2004;Huang et al., 2008). More recently, based on the Argo profiles, Zheng and Zhang 2012\u2460 1 highlighted the contributions of salinity to modulate the development of ENSO events through its effects on the interannual anomalies of density, mixed layer depth (MLD), and stratification in the western-central equatorial Pacific. As unprecedented three-dimensional salinity data become available from Argo profiles, a unique opportunity exists to investigate the role of the salinity effect in the modulation of the two different types of El Ni\u00f1o events. In this work, various data are utilized to trace the differences associated with the two different types of El Ni\u00f1o events. Direct observations from surface and subsurface salinity observations are analyzed to quantify the relative contribution of interannual variations in salinity."}, {"section_title": "Datasets and methods", "text": "Various observed and diagnosed oceanic fields are utilized to illustrate their coherent relationships during the evolution of El Ni\u00f1o. A global monthly ENSEMBLES (EN3) quality controlled ocean dataset containing subsurface ocean temperature (T) and salinity (S) profiles is provided by the Met Office Hadley Centre, and the profile data are sourced from the World Ocean Database 2005 (WOD05), the Global Temperature and Salinity Profile Project (GTSPP), the Argo project, and the Arctic data compiled within the Arctic Synoptic Basin-wide Ocean- ography (ASBO) project. Quality-controlled profiles and background fields are used to create spatially complete 3-D objective analyses of T and S for each month. These gridded fields have a 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 horizontal resolution and 42 vertical levels and cover the period from 1980 to 2009 (Ingleby and Huddleston, 2007). A number of additional oceanic fields are diagnosed from the three-dimensional salinity and temperature fields, including the potential density, the MLD, and the Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency squared (N 2 ). A standard routine in Gill (1982) is used to calculate the potential density (relative to the sea surface) and N 2 . The MLD at each grid point is defined through the threshold method with a variable density criterion (Sprintall and Tomczak, 1992) in which the depth of the mixed layer (ML) is defined as the depth where the density increase compared with the density at a depth of 10 m equals a density increase equivalent to a temperature decrease of 0.2\u00b0C. The climatological means for both the observed and diagnosed oceanic fields are derived directly from their respective 30-year monthly fields. To assess the salinity effects, some diagnostic calculations are made to separate the relative contributions of interannually varying or climatological salinity fields to the interannual anomalies of interest (Zheng and Zhang, 2012) \u2460 . The effect of the salinity variability can be highlighted by comparing two computations of these three fields (potential density, MLD, and N 2 ), specifically, one in which the observed salinity profiles are used and a second in which these profiles are replaced by the climatological profiles of salinity. In this way, the interannually varying salinity impact is defined by the difference between the two computations of these fields. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oceanic Ni\u00f1o index (ONI, http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitori ng/ensostuff/ensoyears.shtml), which is defined as a three-month running mean of SST anomalies over five consecutive months in the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 region (5\uf0b0N-5\uf0b0S, 90-150\uf0b0W), nine El Ni\u00f1o events can be identified from 1980 to 2009. Yeh et al. (2009) classified an event as a CP-El Ni\u00f1o event if the Ni\u00f1o-4 index exceeded the Ni\u00f1o-3 index for the December-January-February (DJF) average (i.e., the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1o events). Lee and McPhaden (2010) classified the 1991-92, 1994-95, 2002-03, 2004-05, and 2009-10 events as CP-El Ni\u00f1o, and the 1982-83, 1986-87, 1997-98, and 2006-07 events were classified as EP-El Ni\u00f1o. In this work, the composites for all anomalous fields are performed as the September-October-November (SON) average for the first year of the events (i.e., the developing phase of the El Ni\u00f1o events).  . Similar to previous studies (e.g., Kao and Yu, 2009;Yeh et al., 2009;Yu and Kim, 2010), the CP-El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 1a) is characterized by a maximum anomalous SST located near the dateline in the central equatorial Pacific; however, the center of maximum SST in the EP-El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 1b) is in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The large difference of anomalous mean SSTs between the two types of El Ni\u00f1o events results in changes in the total ENSO pattern in the tropical Pacific (Yeh et al., 2009). Figures 1c and 1d display the composite SSS corresponding to the CP-El Ni\u00f1o and the EP-El Ni\u00f1o. For the EP-El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 1d), the center of maximum anomalous SSS is observed around the dateline; for the CP-El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 1c), the center is shifted westward to approximately 160\uf0b0E with a larger spatial distribution. It is clear that the anomalous SSS is largely enhanced in the central and western equatorial Pacific and is reduced in the eastern equatorial Pacific during the CP-El Ni\u00f1o compared with the EP-El Ni\u00f1o. Also, the enhancement of salinity is not limited to the sea surface but penetrates far below the ML during the developing phase of the CP-El Ni\u00f1o (Figs. 1e  and 1f)."}, {"section_title": "Observational evidence for the different spatial patterns of salinity", "text": "Zheng and Zhang 2012\u2460 performed a new comprehensive data analysis to illustrate the significant effects of interannual salinity variability using three-dimensional temperature and salinity fields from Argo profiles. These researchers' results illustrated the significant effects induced by a negative salinity anomaly in the central basin during an El Ni\u00f1o event (Fig. 2). The negative salinity anomaly tends to decrease the ocean density in the ML, which acts to stabilize the upper ocean and reduce mixing. These negative salinity anomaly-induced oceanic processes tend to warm the surface layers in the western-central basin, leading to enhanced warming during El Ni\u00f1o. Because there are such large differences in the spatial distributions of salinity between the two types of El Ni\u00f1o, the effects of salinity on the El Ni\u00f1o evolution are expected to be different for the two types of El Ni\u00f1o, and they are verified and compared in the next section."}, {"section_title": "The salinity effects on the two types of El Ni\u00f1o: A diagnostic analysis", "text": "The upper panels of Fig. 3 compare the composite SON density for the two types of El Ni\u00f1o. Due to the salinity effects on density, both composite densities are characterized by a negative anomaly in the central equatorial Pacific (Figs. 3a and 3b). These effects are not limited to the sea surface but penetrate far below the ML (i.e., upper panels of Fig. 4). For example, a large negative density anomaly is seen in the equatorial Pacific (Figs. 4a  and 4b). However, the effects of interannually varying salinity on the density field are distinguishably different for the two types of El Ni\u00f1o. During the development phase of the CP-El Ni\u00f1o, the negative density anomalies cover from 140\uf0b0E to 150\uf0b0W in the equatorial Pacific (Fig.  3a), and the effects of interannually varying salinity are below 100 meters (Fig. 4a). These results are obtained because the far more obvious salinity variations can be observed during the CP-El Ni\u00f1o event (Figs. 1c and 1e), while during development phase of the EP-El Ni\u00f1o, the effects of salinity on density are much weaker and are concentrated around the dateline and the upper 70 meters. The effects on the MLD are presented in the lower panels of Fig. 3. During the development phase of El Ni\u00f1o, interannual variations in the MLD are characterized by a shallow ML in the central basin and a deeper ML in the east (Figs. 3c and 3d). During the CP-El Ni\u00f1o event, the interannual anomalies of salinity make a large contribution to those of the MLD, whereas the contribution of the salinity anomalies is less significant in the EP-El Ni\u00f1o event. For example, the shoaling of the ML in the central Pacific during the CP-El Ni\u00f1o is two times larger than that during the EP-El Ni\u00f1o. As the ocean density in the ML decreases as a result of the effects of the negative salinity anomalies, the effects on N 2 are expected, which represent the stratification stability in the upper ocean. Similar verifications are made with the stability of the stratification, as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 4 for the vertical distributions of the interannual anomalies of N 2 . During the CP-El Ni\u00f1o event (Fig. 4c), a large posi-tive anomaly is seen in the equatorial Pacific from 120\uf0b0E to 160\uf0b0W and from the surface to 150 meters, which indicates that the decreased density acts to induce a more stable stratification in the upper ocean. The interannual anomalies of N 2 during the EP-El Ni\u00f1o event are less obvious ( Fig. 4d). Thus, the negative salinity anomalies in the western-central region during the CP-El Ni\u00f1o events play a significant and enhancing role in stabilizing the upper layers in the region, which further modulates the development of the CP-El Ni\u00f1o. The oceanic processes related to the negative salinity anomalies during the EP-El Ni\u00f1o events are less remarkable than during the CP-El Ni\u00f1o events."}, {"section_title": "Concluding remarks", "text": "These diagnostic analyses clearly demonstrate that salinity fields play a significant role in modulating density and MLD fields in the western-central basin during the development phase of CP-El Ni\u00f1o events. In particular, interannual variations in salinity make a surprisingly large contribution to the interannual variations of density, MLD, and stratification in the upper ocean west of the dateline. These fields directly affect the vertical mixing and entrainment at the base of the ML, which, in turn, affects SST. These fields are also shown to exert a significant influence on interannual variability associated with ENSO, indicating that the salinity effect might be one important contributor to the development of CP-El Ni\u00f1o events. As a consequence of the prominent global warming, significant changes in rainfall patterns over the tropical Pacific are also found in both climate models and satellite obser- Figure 4 Vertical distributions of SON composite interannual anomalies of potential density (top panel) and N 2 (below panel) in the equatorial region (averaged between 2\u00b0S and 2\u00b0N) for CP-El Ni\u00f1o (left column) and EP-El Ni\u00f1o (right column) during 1980-2009, due to the impact of salinity variability on these fields.

Further studies are underway to understand the effects of salinity on climate variability and change within the context of global warming. However, in this paper, the salinity-related effects are estimated on enhanced ENSO cycles by modulating local oceanic density, MLD, and vertical stability, which are based purely on diagnostic analyses. Further experiments are needed to isolate the direct effect of the salinity-related feedback (i.e., fresh water flux) and its sole contribution to SSS and SST (e.g., Zhang et al., 2010). At the same time, the effect of the interannually variable salinity on the ocean dynamic height is another important physical process that highlights the non-local modulations of interannual salinity on ENSO variations (e.g., Maes, 2000), and this effect should be further explored."}]
