[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We compared three implementations of single-shot arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging: two-dimensional (2D) pulsed ASL (PASL), 2D pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL), and background-suppressed (BS) 3D PCASL obtained in a cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls. Study subjects also underwent 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET). While BS 3D PCASL showed the lowest (P < 0.001) gray matter-white matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) contrast ratio, it provided the highest (P < 0.001) temporal signal-tonoise ratio. Mean relative CBF estimated using the PCASL methods in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and hippocampus showed hypoperfusion in the MCI cohort compared to the controls consistent with hypometabolism measured by 18 F-FDG PET. BS 3D PCASL demonstrated the highest discrimination between controls and patients with effect size comparable to that seen with 18 F-FDG PET. 2D PASL did not demonstrate group differentiation with relative CBF in any ROI, whereas 2D PCASL demonstrated significant differences only in PCC and hippocampus. Mean global CBF values did not differ across methods and were highly correlated; however, the correlations were significantly higher (P < 0.001) when either the same labeling (PCASL) or the same acquisition strategy (2D) was used as compared to when both the labeling and readout methods differed. In addition, there were differences in regional distribution of CBF between the three modalities, which can be attributed to differences in sequence parameters. These results demonstrate the superiority of ASL with PCASL and BS 3D readout as a biomarker for regional brain function changes in MCI.

A number of different strategies exist for magnetic labeling of arterial blood and for measuring the effects of labeling on brain signals, and combinations of these techniques can give rise to various acquisition protocols. Among the labeling approaches, pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL) [Dai et al., 2008] is currently the recommended strategy [Alsop et al., 2015] because of its superior efficiency and compatibility with modern MR hardware. On the other hand, pulsed ASL (PASL) [Wong et al., 1998 ] has been available for almost 2 decades and is more widely employed due to its ease of implementation. ASL MRI has frequently been carried out using a two-dimensional (2D) single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) readout because of its speed and sensitivity, though the effects of ASL can be measured with any method. Three-dimensional (3D) readout schemes such as 3D GRASE [Gunther et al., 2005] and 3D spiral [Dai et al., 2008] can be optimally combined with background suppression (BS) techniques of static brain water Garcia et al., 2005; Maleki et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2000] to increase ASL temporal signal-to-noise ratio [Vidorreta et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2000] by reducing physiological noise [Wu et al., 2009] .\nASL MRI has demonstrated sensitivity to regional alterations in brain function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [Alsop et al., , 2000 Chao et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011b; Dai et al., 2009; Du et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2007] . Significant hypoperfusion has been demonstrated in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal, and lateral prefrontal cortices and the effects are largely independent of underlying gray matter atrophy [Hu et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2005; Mattsson et al., 2014; Wolk and Detre, 2012] . Hypoperfusion has also been reported in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [Johnson et al., 2005; Xekardaki et al., 2015] , which is a heterogeneous clinical category consisting of individuals with prodromal AD, and a significant minority of subjects who have cognitive deficits from other etiologies and will not demonstrate pathological evidence of AD in the future. However, hypoperfusion in this population is less pronounced than in AD, and a few studies have also reported increased perfusion in the medial temporal lobes of patients with MCI and early AD Dai et al., 2009] . Areas of hypoperfusion largely overlap with regions of hypometabolism reported for 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET) [Chen et al., 2011b; Verfaillie et al., 2015] , leading to the notion that ASL MRI might provide a less invasive and less costly substitute for 18 F-FDG PET as a measure of regional brain function in AD.\nPrevious studies have compared various ASL implementations. PCASL was shown to have higher SNR than PASL and higher tagging efficiency than continuous ASL (CASL) . It was also reported to have superior test-retest reliability than CASL and PASL [Chen et al., 2011a] . Vidorreta et al. [2013] compared 2D PCASL with 3D PCASL methods (GRASE and spiral acquisitions, with and without BS), demonstrating that BS 3D methods provide higher temporal and spatial SNR in healthy subjects. More recently, PCASL with 3D GRASE demonstrated better reproducibility than 2D EPI acquisition for scans acquired 4 weeks apart, though 2D EPI demonstrated better, although not statistically significant spatial correlation with 15 O H 2 O PET CBF [Kilroy et al., 2014] . Comparisons have also been made between ASL with 18 F-FDG PET. Perfusion measured by 2D PCASL was found to correlate well with glucose metabolism measured by PET in a healthy cohort, albeit with significant regional variability [Cha et al., 2013] . In patients with AD, good agreement in hypoperfusion and hypometabolism measured by 2D PCASL and 18 F-FDG PET, respectively, was demonstrated [Chen et al., 2011b; Musiek et al., 2012] . High agreement was also reported between 18 F-FDG PET hypometabolism and BS PCASL with 3D spiral acquisition hypoperfusion patterns in patients with frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [Verfaillie et al., 2015] .\nIn this study, we compared ASL MRI data acquired from patients with MCI and elderly control subjects using single-shot PASL acquired with 2D EPI using parameters matched to the ASL data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://adni.loni.usc.edu), PCASL with 2D EPI readout using parameters previously demonstrated to be sensitive to regional CBF changes in Alzheimer's disease [Chen et al., 2011b; Musiek et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2012] , and PCASL with BS 3D spiral imaging, from here on referred to as 2D PASL, 2D PCASL, and BS 3D PCASL, respectively. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of different labeling and acquisition strategies on individual subject data and the sensitivity of the methods in detecting group differences between MCI patients and controls. The methods were also compared to 18 F-FDG PET, which represents a more established method for distinguishing between control and patient groups based on regional neural activity."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohort", "text": "A sample of 24 amnestic MCI patients and 22 controls were recruited from the Penn Memory Center specifically for this study. As part of their evaluation, each participant underwent an extensive evaluation, including medical history and physical examination, neurological history and examination, and psychometric assessment. All patients had at least the following neuropsychological measures: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [Folstein et al., 1975] (reported in Table I ); Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III [Wechsler, 1987] ; Category fluency (animals) [Spreen and Strauss, 1998 ]; Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Memory (WLM) test [Morris et al., 1989] ; Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B [Reitan, 1958] ; and a 30-item version of the Boston Naming Test (BNT) [Kaplan et al., 1983] . Additionally, relevant blood work and brain imaging studies were evaluated. Almost all patients had structural imaging available, usually MRI, that was used as part of the clinical decision-making, largely to rule out other causes of MCI. Clinical diagnosis was determined by review of the above data at a consensus conference attended by neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists. The scans obtained as part of the study presented here were not used for making the clinical diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of amnestic MCI was made following the criteria outlined by Petersen and others [Petersen, 2004; Petersen et al., 2009; Winblad et al., 2004] . Patients had to have a memory problem, generally intact cognitive functioning and activities of daily living, objective evidence of memory impairment on cognitive testing, and not qualify for a diagnosis of dementia. There was no strict cutoff for the degree of memory impairment as clinical judgment accounting for the premorbid status of the patient and performance on other cognitive tests weighs into decisions of objective impairment [Petersen, 2004] . However, in general, these patients performed around 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below age-adjusted means on verbal and/or nonverbal memory tests. Controls were defined by an absence of significant cognitive complaints, normal performance on ageadjusted cognitive measures, and consensus conference designation as \"normal.\" Inclusion criteria included age between 50 and 85, >7 years of education, and English speaking at an early age. Participants were excluded if they had a history of clinical stroke, significant traumatic brain injury, alcohol or drug abuse/dependence, prior electroconvulsive therapy, and any significant disease or medical/psychiatric condition that was felt to impact neuropsychological performance.\nThe human subjects' research in this study was performed in compliance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and the standards established by the Institutional Review Board and the National Institutes of Health. All subjects provided informed consent for this study."}, {"section_title": "MRI and PET Data Acquisition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "F-FDG PET and MRI scans of 19 patients and 6 controls were obtained on the same day. One patient and one control had their MRI scan obtained 6 days after and 13 days before their PET scans, respectively.

Participants were instructed not to eat for at least 4 h prior to their PET scan. Blood glucose levels were tested and individuals with blood glucose level >180 mg/dl were excluded from the study. Participants then received an intravenous injection of 5.0 6 0.5 mCi of 18 F-FDG as they rested quietly in a dimly lit room with their eyes open but with minimal sensory stimulation. Approximately 30 min after the injection, a 30-min 3D emission scan was obtained (256 mm FOV, 128 3 128 matrix, 2 3 2 3 2 mm 3 voxel size). Line-ofresponse row-action maximum likelihood algorithm reconstruction using sharp setting was performed followed by CT attenuation correction.\nPET images were coregistered to the T1 images using SPM8 with normalized mutual information objective function similar to the ASL data and the quality of the coregistration was manually verified. Thereafter, the images were normalized to the MNI space using the DARTEL template following a procedure similar to the mean CBF maps described above. This involves smoothing by an isotropic Gaussian kernel with FWHM 5 8 mm and use of subjectspecific gray matter masks to restrict the analysis within the gray matter. Finally, SUVR maps were generated using whole cerebellum as reference tissue. Regional uptake was measured from SUVR maps using the same methods applied to the CBF maps.\nF-FDG PET displayed significant differences in metabolism between control and MCI groups for all three regions. Similarly, both PCASL methods displayed relative hypoperfusion in the MCI cohort compared to controls. Group differences in BS 3D PCASL were statistically significant in all three ROIs, while only the PCC and hippocampus were significant with 2D PCASL. No regions displayed a significant difference with 2D PASL. In fact, the precuneus was the only region in which MCI was associated with lower perfusion than the controls in absolute terms. As evident from the box plots, the variability of the relative mean CBF values in BS 3D PCASL was much lower compared to the 2D methods, and was comparable to PET."}, {"section_title": "MR Imaging and Processing", "text": "MR images were acquired on a 3 T Siemens Trio MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a product 32-channel head coil.

Forty label-control pairs were acquired. A separate M0 image was obtained without any magnetization preparation for CBF quantification."}, {"section_title": "MR Image Processing", "text": "Image processing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK), ASL toolbox and custom MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) scripts. First, the raw time series volumes for each method were realigned to correct for head motion using the method proposed by Wang [2012] . Briefly, the method consists of estimating a 6-parameter rigid-body transformation for each volume to align it to the first volume of the series. Thereafter, the spurious motion component caused by systematic label/control switching is regressed out from the estimated parameters before applying the transformation to the volumes. Next, the mean control images were automatically coregistered to the high-resolution T1 images using SPM8 with normalized mutual information objective function, and the registrations were manually checked and corrected using a boundary-based approach [Greve and Fischl, 2009] in the case of errors. Misregistrations were mostly noted in the case of 3D PCASL ($43%) and were much less common in 2D PCASL ($20%). The PASL mean control images showed poor tissue contrast and unidentifiable boundaries, making manual modification challenging. Instead, results of the automated coregistration algorithm were used. The resulting transformations were then applied to the corresponding label and control images. In parallel, the structural images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue probability maps (TPMs) using the \"New Segment\" tool in SPM8. The GM and WM TPMs were subsequently resliced to the native space, smoothed by an isotropic Gaussian kernel with FWHM 5 5 mm and then thresholded to 0.75 to construct binary masks to be used to extract mean CBF in GM and WM. In addition, to create a mask to extract whole-brain CBF, the sum of smoothed gray matter and white matter TPMs was thresholded to 0.75. Finally, the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) method [Ashburner, 2007] in SPM8 was implemented to create a group-specific template combining each subject's segmented gray and white matter TPMs. The created template was subsequently registered to the MNI152 space using a linear affine transformation. The two transformations were later used to map the CBF maps and gray matter TPM to the MNI space.\nCBF quantification for each control-label pair was obtained using for PASL and PCASL, respectively. In these equations, DM is the control-label difference, k is the brain/blood partition coefficient, x is the post labeling delay, T 1blood is the T 1 of blood, a is the labeling (tagging) efficiency, M 0 is the equilibrium magnetization of the brain, and s is the labeling duration. Assumed parameter values followed the recommendations in Alsop et al. [2015] . In particular, k 5 k mean 5 0.9 ml/g (mean k for gray and white matter), T 1blood 5 1650 ms. For PASL, x 5 1.9 s, s 5 700 ms and a 5 0.98 [Alsop et al., 2015] , and M 0 was made equal to the mean of the control images. For the PCASL techniques, x 5 s 5 1.5 s. The labeling efficiencies for 2D PCASL and BS 3D PCASL were assumed to be 0.85 [Alsop et al., 2015] and 0.72 [Vidorreta et al., 2013] , respectively. Similar to PASL, M 0 was made equal to the mean of the control images for 2D PCASL. In the case of BS 3D PCASL, the separately acquired M 0 was coregistered to the mean control image. In each case, the M 0 images were smoothed using a 5 mm isotropic kernel to avoid misregistration errors [Alsop et al., 2015] before being used in the CBF calculation. The resulting CBF time series data was then averaged over time to obtain the mean CBF map. A binary mask comprising of gray matter, white matter, and ventricular CSF was created and applied to the mean CBF map to set out-of-brain voxels to zero. The CBF maps and the GM TPMs were mapped to the MNI space using the DARTEL template and affine transformation. Images in MNI space were smoothed with a FWHM 5 8mm isotropic Gaussian kernel to better account for errors due to voxel mismatching with normalization across subjects.

Hence, in addition to computing tSNR, we counted the number of outliers present in the CBF time series and compared the results across methods. A volume was considered an outlier if its mean CBF was 1.5 interquartiles below the first quartile or above the third quartile of the time series [Tukey, 1977] . The goal of this analysis was twofold: First, we wanted to assess if non-BS techniques are more susceptible to have outlier label/control pairs compared to BS techniques. The second goal was to assess the rate of outliers in the BS 3D implementation, as that provides an indication of potential challenges in multishot 3D acquisitions, where there is less flexibility of discarding contaminated volumes. The number of outliers for each acquisition method was compared using Friedman test. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon signed rank test."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of gray matter to white matter contrast ratio", "text": "The mean CBF within gray matter and white matter was extracted from the mean CBF maps in native space and their ratio was computed.

Statistical tests for determining the significance of the difference in correlation coefficients were performed using the method described by Steiger [1980] and evaluated using the software developed by Lee and Preacher [2013] . The method converts each correlation coefficient into a z-score using Fisher's r-to-z transformation, computes the asymptotic covariance of the estimates, and subsequently uses the quantities in an asymptotic ztest. We also compared the regional distribution of CBF between the three modalities based on the control subjects, as prior studies-e.g., Lovblad et al. [2015] -showed that differences in labeling can lead to regional variability and difference in signal intensity.\nComparison of sensitivity to differentiate MCI patients from controls between the three ASL methods and PET Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for PET images were computed by dividing each voxel's SUV by the mean SUV within the cerebellum. In the case of ASL, cerebellum is often not in the area of coverage and, hence, the mean CBF within the cortical GM was used for computing the relative CBF. The mean relative CBF and mean SUVR within PCC, precuneus, and hippocampus were extracted for ASL and PET for each subject. These ROIs have most consistently been shown to be sensitive to AD .

The sequence performance results obtained in this clinical population are generally consistent with those previously reported in young controls [Vidorreta et al., 2013] , though, as expected, the tSNR values were lower, which is likely attributable to lower CBF and higher physiological noise in patients and elderly controls considered for this study. Across control and patient cohorts, there was good agreement between global CBF values obtained from each method. However, agreement on an individual subject level for different ASL schemes were found to be higher when using either the same labeling strategy (PCASL) or the same imaging strategy (2D EPI), and was significantly reduced when both the labeling and the data acquisition strategy differed. Thus, while data acquired with different ASL implementations are in general agreement, as they all measure the same physiological parameter (i.e., CBF), differences in labeling and imaging strategies cumulatively impact the degree of agreement. Multisite and multiplatform studies using ASL as a biomarker for neurodegeneration would clearly benefit from closely matched or identical ASL implementations, as has previously been suggested for normative data [Mutsaerts et al., 2015] . In particular, absolute CBF from significantly different ASL protocols should be compared, combined, and interpreted with caution.\nBS 3D PCASL showed higher variability in CBF across subjects. A possible explanation is that the labeling efficiency at the labeling offset of 8 cm used in 3D may be more variable than the offset of 9 cm used in the 2D protocol. More recent data suggested that a lower labeling location provides more consistent results [Vidorreta et al., 2017] . Note that this higher variability does not affect the group discrimination analysis, which was performed using relative CBF.\nObserved hypoperfusion in PCC, precuneus, and hippocampus in the MCI cohort using the PCASL methods was consistent with the levels of hypometabolism as measured by PET, although this difference did not reach significance with 2D PCASL in the precuneus. Overall, PCC seemed to be the most sensitive ROI for differentiating MCI patients and elderly controls with PCASL. A similar observation was made previously [Xekardaki et al., 2015] , where PCC predicted cognitive deterioration in controls destined to develop MCI. In the case of PASL, ROI data failed to show group differences within the sample, likely reflecting the relatively poor sensitivity of this ASL variant, potentially compounded by coregistration errors due to poor tissue contrast that precluded manual correction. On the other hand, BS 3D PCASL demonstrated the largest effect sizes among the ASL variants (Table III) . The dispersion of the relative CBF values in BS 3D PCASL from Figure 5 appeared lower compared to 2D PCASL and 2D PASL methods and comparable to PET. Effect sizes were mostly medium (0.3-0.5), which is likely due to the low severity of disease in the MCI cohort studied. Indeed, effect sizes of the BS 3D PCASL were very similar to the \"gold standard\" TSNR in the control cohort was significantly higher than in the patient group, which we attribute to a combined effect of higher signal (CBF) in controls and higher physiological noise in patients, likely due to motion. Although motion differences across groups did not reach significance, the translations and rotation values were indeed higher in the MCI patients and the observed correlations between tSNR and motion parameters further suggests its impact on tSNR. Higher tSNR in controls versus patients has also been reported previously in stroke patients . Outlier volumes were also detected in the CBF time series of each acquisition protocol, with greater numbers in the patient group, again likely due to increased physiological noise, and despite greatly increased tSNR in BS 3D PCASL data, outlier volumes were still present. While many 3D ASL methods use multishot acquisitions to improve image quality and resolution, an advantage of single-shot acquisitions is the increased ease and efficiency of identifying and excluding outlier volumes in postprocessing of ASL time series.\nManual coregistration was needed to correct errors in the automatic coregistration produced by SPM, particularly for 3D PCASL data. SPM8 relies on intensity-based methods for intermodal image registration using a normalized mutual information criterion. To provide optimal registration, the algorithm requires different tissues to have a distinct mean intensity. In EPI readouts, the betweentissue contrast is primarily driven by the amount of T2* contrast accumulated at the echo time (TE). In ASL, the typically employed TE in EPI is shorter than in conventional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) EPI acquisitions, resulting in lower contrast between tissues, which can occasionally cause errors in the registration output as observed in our data. In instances where tissue contrast was insufficient for successful automatic coregistration, registration was manually corrected using a boundary-based approach [Greve and Fischl, 2009] . For 3D PCASL, the through-plane blurring presents additional challenges for the coregistration algorithm and hence required more manual correction. On the other hand, in PASL the effect of the FAIR inversion pulse together with the shorter TE (compared to 2D PCASL) resulted in poorly identified tissue boundaries precluding manual registration, so automatic coregistration results from SPM were used without additional correction. As a result, the PASL data may have had greater coregistration errors than the other methods, which could ultimately have influenced ROI results and the discrimination between controls and MCI patients.\nWe conducted our analyses using relative CBF to facilitate comparison with PET, for which standard analysis uses normalization of 18 F-FDG uptake to cerebellum to account for differences in dose and overall cerebral delivery of 18 F-FDG between subjects. In addition, mean CBF in gray matter or whole brain is highly variable even in healthy populations , and use of relative CBF eliminates this variability. Moreover, absolute CBF change within a specific ROI reflects both global and local CBF effects. While use of relative CBF obviously precludes detection of absolute CBF changes, which have also been observed with ASL in AD and MCI [Asllani et al., 2008] , it enables comparing regional changes in CBF in diseasespecific patterns [Chen et al., 2011b] . In particular, reduction of relative CBF within specific ROI demonstrates lower metabolic function in that region that cannot be explained by global reduction in CBF. While cortical normalization of PET may have been more equivalent to the CBF measurements, this reference yielded a lower effect size for group differences within a priori ROIs compared to cerebellar normalization, as has been reported previously [Dukart et al., 2010] . As 18 F-FDG was being used in this context as a \"gold standard,\" we chose the more optimized cerebellar normalization.\nThe nominal PLD in this study was shorter than the recently recommended PLD of 1.8-2 s in an ASL white paper [Alsop et al., 2015] . It should be noted that the recommended PLD was for BS ASL acquisitions, which have higher signal compared to their non-BS counterparts. In the case of non-BS 2D acquisitions, the choice of a shorter PLD represents a tradeoff between two factors: (i) vascular transit artifacts and/or underestimation of CBF if the PLD is too short compared to the arterial transit time (ATT) and (ii) loss of sensitivity because the signal strength decreases due to T1 decay of the spin label during the PLD. Furthermore, as the 2D acquisition occurs slice by slice from inferior to superior direction, the last slice was acquired $800 ms after the initial post labeling delay, making the effective PLD in the superior slices much longer than the nominal value, with the mean PLD across the brain approximately 1.9 s. Although 1.5 s might be lower than the ATT for watershed regions of the brain that are supplied by the most distal branches of their arteries, particularly in elderly patients, those are not the regions of interest for this study. Instead, the ROIs we considered were located in the medial temporal and parietal regions, which are characterized by relatively shorter ATT [MacIntosh et al., 2010] . We did not observe any visible transit artifacts when inspecting the mean CBF maps from each subject. Finally, we based our analyses on mean CBF values in relatively large ROIs and the mean CBF within an ROI would not change as long as the blood supplying the microvasculature has arrived within the ROI, even if intraarterial [Qiu et al., 2012] .\nThe spatial distribution of CBF was different in the three methods. PASL showed higher CBF in the posterior circulation, cerebellum, and basal ganglia and lower CBF in the frontal lobe whereas BS 3D PCASL had an exactly opposite distribution. Although much of this difference can be attributed to the different labeling and acquisition schemes , differences in effective PLD and their mismatch with ATT also likely contributed. ATT can be measured experimentally, and would be highly r Dolui et al. r r 5270 r beneficial for optimal accuracy in CBF quantification. Methods for rapidly measuring ATT have recently been described [Dai et al., 2013; von Samson-Himmelstjerna et al., 2016] .\nThe study had few limitations. First, the ASL sequences evaluated not only differed with respect to the labeling and the presence of background suppression, but the voxel sizes were also different, which could have confounded comparisons between methods. Our choice of voxel dimensions was based on the previous literature and our own experience in ASL. The PASL resolution was matched to ADNI ASL protocol to facilitate interpretation of our findings with respect to ADNI data. However, the 2D PCASL replicated a protocol we had successfully applied to Alzheimer's disease in prior work [Chen et al., 2011b; Musiek et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2012] . For single shot 3D PCASL, the voxel size was chosen to be smaller than 2D PCASL in the z direction because of its characteristic blurring in that direction. As our analysis focused on CBF in relatively large ROIs and not at individual voxels, the SNR should be largely independent of voxel resolution as smaller voxels have lower SNR but a larger number is required to cover the same spatial extent. However, some residual effects of voxel size may still be expected due to differences in partial volume contamination and physiological noise.\nA second limitation is that PET data of several subjects were separated from ASL acquisition by more than a year. Although this does not undermine the comparison between the concurrent ASL strategies, which was our primary goal, it could confound the comparison of ASL with PET. In particular, as the ASL data for 4 MCI patients were obtained later in the course of their disease than the PET data, group comparisons might be biased to show a greater effect size for ASL. We repeated the group analysis after excluding data from the 4 MCI patients whose ASL data was acquired one year later than the PET data. The restricted comparison did not appreciably change the findings.\nFinally, no separate M0 image was acquired for the 2D acquisition techniques, so we used mean of the control images to quantify CBF from control-label perfusion difference; however, we corrected for this error using the method suggested by Alsop et al. [2015] to account for incomplete relaxation of tissue magnetization. In addition, CBF quantification was obtained with a fixed value of T1 blood and its variability can introduce errors Hales et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2010] , though any such errors are unlikely to affect comparison significantly between the ASL variants.\nIn conclusion, both PCASL and background suppression improve the sensitivity of ASL over PASL acquisitions for detecting group differences between MCI and elderly controls. In particular, despite increased blurring in the slice dimension, BS 3D PCASL showed the highest discrimination between MCI and control groups, and provided comparable discrimination to 18 F-FDG PET. Thus, BS 3D PCASL methodology may provide an alternative to 18 F-FDG PET that can be obtained during routine MRI in clinical practice and research, and accelerated 3D ASL acquisitions can be used to reduce readout times and blurring."}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE/CONFLICT OF INTEREST", "text": "There is no financial interest in relation to the work described in this paper."}]
