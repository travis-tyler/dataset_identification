Growth"}, {"section_title": "77.77-FT\"", "text": "During the 1998 academic year (July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998), U.S. universities awarded a total of 42,683 research doctorate degrees,3 marking the thirteenth straight year in which the absolute number of doctorates increased. The annual growth rate from 1997 to 1998, 0.3 percent, was the same rate as for the preceding year.4 Over the past few years, the rate of increase has become markedly smaller than earlier in the decade. (See table 1.) In absolute numbers, 42,683 represents an increase of 2,882 doctorates over the number for 1993 and is 9,183 more than in 1988.5 For the 10-year interval between 1988 and 1998, U.S. universities collectively awarded almost 400,000 doctorates (397,048), as compared to a total of 316,413 for the preceding 10-year period. U.S. institutions have awarded more than one million doctorates (1,174,442) over the last 40 years, of which 33.8 percent were granted within the last 10 years (figures 1 and 2). The aggregate figure for 1998 is the largest number ever for any single academic year: an increase of 2,882 doctorates or 7.2 percent higher than 5 years ago and 9,183 or 27.4 percent more than 10 years ago. Only the 17-year interval between 1957 and 1974 was a longer period of consecutive annual growth. (See figures 1 and 2.) In general for the 1998 academic year, 58.2 percent of doctorate recipients were male, about two-thirds were U.S. citizens, and 62.7 percent were white. The typical recipient was slightly under 34 years of age at the time the degree was awarded. About three in ten recipients (29.2 percent) had never been married; 6.9 percent were either widowed, divorced, or separated; and 63.9 percent (66.0 percent for men and 60.9 percent for women) were currently married or 3.13  1957 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 Year See living in a marriage-like relationship.6 A decade ago the corresponding figures were higher percentages male, white, and U.S. citizenship; smaller percentage married; and the same approximate age at doctorate award. (See tables 7, 8, 11, A-3a and Summary Report 1988.7) Doctorate-granting Institutions, Doctorates per Institution, and Geographical Distribution During the 1998 academic year, 387 colleges and universities in the United States and Puerto Rico awarded at least one research doctorate, as compared with 382 institutions granting doctorates in the 1997 academic year. The number of institutions increased steadily from the early 1960s (174 in 1961) until 1988 but has remained relatively level for the last few years. (See table 2.) The mean number of doctorates awarded per institution in 1998 was 110, and the median was 45. As the difference between mean and median suggests, a relatively small number of institutions grant a disproportionately large number of doctorates. For example, only 115 institutions awarded more than the mean in 1998, but these 115 institutions granted an average of 296 doctorates each, accounting for 79.8 percent of all Ph.D.s earned in that 12-month period. The remaining 272 institutions awarded 32 doctorates on average in 1998. In terms of quartiles, the top 18 institutions accounted for 25 percent of all doctorates, the second quartile contained the next 29, the third quartile included 52 universities, and the remaining 288 were in the fourth quartile.8 The University of Texas at Austin granted 834 doctorates, or just under 2 percent of all doctorates awardedthe most Ph.D.s of any U.S. institution. The University of  and the University of California-Berkeley (748) were second and third. These same three universities, in the same order, also were the top doctorate-degree producers in 1997. The University of Minnesota (Twin Cities), University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana), Ohio State University, University of Michigan, and UCLA round out the list of the top eight doctorate producers in recent years. Generally, either Harvard or Stanford follows the top eight in granting the next largest number of doctorates, the most for a private institution. In 1998 the leading 10 universities awarded 16.2 percent of all doctorates. (See table 3 and appendix table A-7.) Ten years ago the largest number of doctorates was awarded by the University of California-Berkeley (758), and the top 10 institutions together granted 17.7 percent of the 33,456 doctorates awarded. With respect to broad field, the University of California-Berkeley awarded the most doctorates (156) in the physical sciences. MIT granted the most engineering doctorates (229), while the University of Wisconsin-Madison led all universities in granting doctorates in the life sciences (185). Nova Southeastern University awarded the most doctorates in both the social sciences (149) and education (298). Nova also granted the largest number of degrees in the smaller, heterogeneous, \"professional/other\" category (58). The University of Texas-Austin was the leading granter of humanities doctorates (151). (See table 3 for the top 20 ranked institutions in each broad field.) Doctorates granted by the top 10 institutions are concentrated in certain broad field areas. While these institutions accounted for 16.2 percent of all doctorates, they granted 19.1 percent of all Ph.D.s in the physical sciences, 27.7 percent in engineering, 18.1 percent in life sciences, 22.9 percent in humanities, and 21.0 percent in education. The lowest concentration was in the social sciences, in which the top 10 universities produced 15.4 percent of the doctorates. For their doctoral studies, 68.4 percent of all new Ph.D.s attended public universities (for U.S. citizens that figure was 68.5 percent); 59.4 percent of the 1998 recipients who were U.S. citizens had earned their undergraduate degrees at public institutions.9 The 89 institutions in the Carnegie Research I classificationl\u00b0 awarded 67.6 percent of all doctorates in 1998; the 37 Research II universities granted 11.2 percent of all Ph.D.s. In 1998, 10.5 percent of new Ph.D.s received their degrees at Doctoral I institutions; for Doctoral II institutions, the figure was 4.8 percent. The set of \"other\" Carnegie institutions awarded 5.8 percent of all doctoral degrees in 1998. (See figure 3.) California universities awarded 4,731 doctorates (11 percent of the total). New York institutions granted the next highest number of doctorates (3,784), followed by institutions in Texas (2,736), Illinois (2,260), and Pennsylvania (2,234). These five states accounted for 36.9 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1998. Appendix table A-7 shows the aggregate and subfield distribution of 1998 doctorates by individual institution and state. Ten years ago, the top five states (with Massachusetts in place of Pennsylvania) accounted for 39.9 percent of the 33,456 doctorates awarded that year."}, {"section_title": "Doctorates by Broad Field", "text": "The SED classifies research doctoral degrees into some 290 fields of specialization (these are listed on pp. 8 and 9 of the questionnaire included in appendix D). For presentation purposes here, these are grouped into seven broad fields: physical sciences,\" engineering, life sciences,12 social sciences (including psychology), humanities, education, and a heterogeneous group of professional and other fields. The latter includes mainly business-related and public administration doctorates; and communications research, law, social work, theology, and library science. Information about the levels and trends by these broad fields of study is of particular interest to Federal sponsors of doctoral research, academic administrators, and professional associations, among others. These groups need such specialized data to make informed policy decisions influencing graduate education and the nation's labor force. All seven broad fields show substantial gains in the number of doctorates for the 10-year interval of 1988-98. (See figures 4 and 5.) Although the overall rate of growth in Ph.D.s was 27.4 percent for that period, doctorates granted in the humanities field increased 54.7 percent (or 1,944 more doctorates), followed by engineering with a 41.4 percent increase (1,732) and the life sciences with a 38.5 percent increase (2,376). For the previous five-year interval (1993 -98), doctorates awarded in five of the broad fields increased but in education and the professional/other category, the number declined. The four broad fields that together constitute \"sciences and engineering (S&E)\"-physical, life, and social sciences and engineering -showed a 1.9 percent annual increase in doctorates granted, an 8.2 percent gain over the past five years, and 31.9 percent more than were awarded in 1988. In 1998, these four fields yielded 66.2 percent of all Ph.D.s, a figure that has stayed fairly constant for the last four decades (it was 64.1 percent in 1968, 57.3 percent in 1978, and 64.0 percent in 1988).13 Thirty years ago, in 1968, more doctorates were awarded in physical sciences than in any other broad field, with education second. In 1978 and 1988, the largest number of doctorates were granted in education, with social sciences second in 1978 and life sciences second in 1988. For the 1998 academic year, life sciences was the broad field in which the most doctorates were awarded, followed by social sciences. (See figures 4, 5, and 6.) In terms of groupings familiar to some graduate school deans-whose purview as academic administrators may not extend to engineering, education, and professional programs-65.3 percent of the 42,683 doctorates awarded in 1998 were in the \"arts and sciences,\" a figure that has hovered around 65 percent for the last 40 years. Between 1997 and 1998, the physical and life sciences showed a 3.3 percent increase, compared with a 2.2 percent gain for the humanities and social sciences. Over 5-and 10-year intervals, the physical and life sciences showed gains of 10.0 percent and 33.2 percent versus 14.0 percent and 34.7 percent for the humanities and social sciences. The absolute numbers and comparable percentage changes over the last decade for 25 selected subfields are given in table 6. In all instances the number of doctorates grew, although the amount of growth in these individual academic areas varied widely: from lows of 1.9 percent in the agricultural sciences and 9.9 percent in chemistry to a more than doubling in the neurosciences (155.9 percent) and molecular biology (104.7 percent). Within all four of the major engineering subfields-chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical-the number of doctorates awarded also increased. Chemical engineering had the smallest percentage increase  1968197319781983Year 198819931998 See Table 5. Source: NSF/NIH/NEH/USED/USDA, Survey of Earned Doctorates Figure 5.

In 1998, women received 17,856 Ph.D.s, the highest one-year total ever and a 1.4 percent gain over 1997. (See figure 7.) Females received 41.8 percent of all doctorate degrees granted, again the highest percentage ever; 1998 was the third consecutive year in which the representation of women was at least 40 percent. The absolute number of males earning doctorates declined for the second straight yearthe 1998 total of 24,653 is 787 less than for 1996and 1998 was the ninth consecutive year in which the overall male percentage declined. Over the last 40 years, from 1958 (when only 911 doctorates were awarded to women) to 1998, the rate of growth for male doctorates has The increase in absolute numbers and in percentage terms for women occurred in virtually every broad field. In the physical sciences, the area with the second smallest representation of women (the fewest women are in engineering), female doctorate recipients increased by 11.0 percent. Men showed percentage increases in four of the seven broad fields, although only in education was the male increase greater than the increase for females.  In spite of both recent gains and the longer term trend, the distribution of doctorates by sex across the major fields remains decidedly bi-modal. In 1998, women received just 18.8 percent of all doctorates in physical sciences and engineering combined; across the other five fields they were, on average, in the majority-51.7 percent for all five combined. (See figure 8.) 700/c Figure 8. Female doctorate recipients by broad field, 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998 60%- Within the subfields, representation by sex varies widely. (See table 6.) For example, in the physical sciences field, women received 31.3 percent of chemistry doctorates in 1998 but only 17.0 percent in computer sciences; in the life sciences, females earned 67.1 percent of all Ph.D.s in the health sciences (and 96.4 percent in nursing alone) but only 39.0 percent in ecology; within the major social science disciplines, the proportion of female doctorate recipients ranged from 27.4 percent in economics to 66.9 percent in psychology; and in the humanities, women received 75.0 percent of all art history doctorates compared with 29.4 percent in philosophy. (See table 6 and appendix table A-1 for additional subfield distributions by sex.) Doctorates by Race/Ethnicity For U.S. citizens the aggregate number of minority doctorate recipients rose between 1997 and 1998, from 3,845 to 4,014 (or by 4.4 percent),I4 This number is 35.8 percent higher than 5 years ago, 89.3 percent higher than 10 years ago, and more than double the 1978 figure (104.1 percent higher). If both U.S.-citizen and permanent-resident minority recipients are counted, the increases are 32.3 percent higher than 5 years ago, 94.1 percent higher than 10 years ago, and 111.2 percent higher than in 1978. These sizable increases are even more impressive when compared to the growth of doctorates earned by white U.S. citizens over the same period: Minority U.S. citizens received 2,047 more doctorates in 1998 than in 1978, while white U.S. citizens earned only 1,527 more. (See figures 9 and 10.) While the overall rate of increase in doctorates between 1997 and 1998 was 0.3 percent, the number of doctorates decreased by 2.2 percent for U.S. citizens and permanent residents who were members of a racial or ethnic minority. However, that aggregate decline is misleading, as the percentage increased sizably for American Indians (13.9 percent), blacks (7.5 percent), and Hispanics (10.8 percent). The observed decline is due to a decrease in doctorates earned by Asian U.S. citizens (9.9 percent) and the even more pronounced decrease for permanent-resident Asians (14.4 percent).15 (See appendix tables A-2 and B-2a as well as figure 9.) Minority women earned 52.3 percent of Ph.D.s granted in 1998 to minority U.S. citizens. In three of the four groupings, female U.S. citizens earned slightly more than 50 percent of doctorates awarded to minorities-55.0 percent for American Indian women, 55.1 percent for Asian women, and 50.9 percent for Hispanic women. Black women, however, earned 64.6 percent of doctorates awarded to blacks. (See figure 11.) Overall in 1998, 42.9 percent of doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents were granted in the three broad fields of physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences. However, 69.8 percent of Asians receiving doctorates earned them in those three fields, as did more than 75 percent of non-U.S. citizens on temporary visas, the majority of whom are from Asian nations. By contrast, blacks accounted for only 23.2 percent of the doctorates awarded in these three fields. One broad field-education-accounted for 40.7 percent of doctorates received by blacks. More American Indians also earned doctorates in education (26.5 percent) than in any other field. The social sciences were the most popular field for Hispanics-23.8 percent of all doctorates awarded to Hispanics were in the social sciences. (See figure 12.) 14 The SED questionnaire asks respondents to classify themselves as Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, black, or white. In this report, references to Asians include Pacific Islanders, and references to American Indians include Alaskan Natives. 15 More than 90 percent of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians who earned doctorates are U.S. citizens, but only 42.9 percent of Asian doctorate recipients are U.S. citizens-the majority (57.1 percent) are permanent residents. Thus, when tracking race/ethnicity trends, one must distinguish between U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Year See Table 8 Source: NSF/NIH/NEH/USED/USDA, Survey of Earned Doctorates Figure 10. Percentages of doctorates earned by minority U. S. citizens, 1978 and 1998 Among U.S. citizens, Asian doctorate recipients increased between 1997 and 1998 only in the humanities; they declined in the other six broad field areas. Blacks showed increases in the physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and education. The number of Hispanics receiving doctorates was larger in 1998 relative to 1997 in all four S&E fields and in education. The numbers for American Indians, while small, increased in all seven fields. By contrast, for white U.S. citizens, the total number of doctorates awarded between 1997 and 1998 increased in three fieldsphysical sciences, social sciences, and the humanitiesand fell in the other four. Table 10 lists the universities that awarded the most doctorates to each of the four minority groups over the last five years and the absolute number awarded. Three California institutions and two in BostonBerkeley, UCLA, Stanford, Harvard, and MITgranted the most Ph.D.s (18 percent) to Asian U.S. citizens over the 1993-98 time period. Nova Southeastern and Howard together granted 7.6 percent of all doctorates awarded to blacks in the last five years. Hispanics earned more doctorates at the University of Texas-Austin than at any other institution over this period. Ten universitiestwo in Texas, three in California, two in Puerto Rico, two in Arizona, and Harvardawarded almost one-fourth (23 percent) of all doctorates to Hispanics. Oklahoma and Oklahoma State Universities led all institutions in the number of doctorates awarded to American Indians. The concentration of doctorates earned by U.S. minority students from these particular institutions is much higher than the concentration by entire population, citizenship, or broad field. Although the overall top 10 institutions awarded 16.2 percent of all doctorates (see appendix table A-7), the top 10 institutions in each racial/ethnic category accounted for 28.5 percent of Asian doctorate recipients, 41.0 percent of black recipients, 21.0 percent of Hispanic recipients, and 20.4 percent of American Indian recipients. (See table 10.)"}, {"section_title": "Doctorates by Citizenship", "text": "Approximately one-fifth of all doctorates granted in 1998 were awarded to non-U.S. citizens in this country on temporary visas. In absolute numbers, this group earned 8,642 doctorates. (See appendix table A-4.) However, of the 42,683 total doctorates awarded, citizenship is unknown in 3,127 cases. Consequently, the 8,642 figure is 20.2 percent of all doctorates and 21.8 percent of doctorate recipients whose citizenship is known. If all of the \"unknowns\" were on temporary visas, which is highly unlikely, the percentage would rise to 27.6 percent. These three percentages bound the true representation of international students earning doctorates at U.S. institutions. The corresponding percentages were similar in 1997: 19.9 percent of all doctorate recipients, 21.6 percent of recipients of known citizenship status, and 27.5 percent of all recipients assuming all unknowns were on temporary visas. Ten years ago, these percentages were 18.5 percent, 19.9 percent, and 25.6 percent. The trend over the last decade is consistentthe percentage of non-U.S. citizens earning doctorates from U.S. universities has inched up modestly. By contrast, in the decade before (1978-88), the increase in international doctoral students was much larger. For 1978 those same percentage bounds ranged from 11.1 percent to 13.7 percent, or about half of the 1998 figures."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "Stated another way, while the number of U.S. citizens receiving doctorates in 1998 was approximately 3,000 higher than the corresponding total in 1978, the number of doctorates awarded to students on temporary visas in 1998 was more than 5,000 higher than 20 years earlier. (See table 11.) Permanent U.S. residents (that is, non-U.S. citizens on permanent visas, or holding a \"green card\") have also increased in absolute and relative terms among the doctorate population. In 1978 they represented 4.5 percent of all doctorate recipients with known citizenship; in 1988 that percentage was 5.2 percent, and in 1998 it was 6.8 percent. Although temporary visa holders were 21.8 percent of doctorate recipients whose citizenship was known, their percentages by broad field varied considerably. For example, these non-U.S. citizens earned 44.2 percent of all engineering doctorates, 32.6 percent of the physical sciences doctorates, and 24.4 percent of the life sciences doctorates. (See table 11 and appendix table A-2.) For the S&E fields as a whole, non-U.S. citizens made up 27.9 percent of the doctorate population. Viewed from a different perspective, the numbers indicate that 27.7 percent of all doctorate recipients on temporary visas earned their degrees in engineering, followed by 23.6 percent earning doctorates in the physical sciences and 22.5 percent in life sciences; 84.4 percent of all doctorates granted to non-U.S. citizens on temporary visas were earned in S&E fields. The People's Republic of China continues to outdistance other nations as the country of origin for non-U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients. Fully 6 percent, or 2,571, of all doctorate recipients in 1998 were citizens of China. India was second (with 1,259, or just under 3 percent), followed by Taiwan, Korea, and Canada. Fifteen percent of all doctorate recipients were citizens of these five countries, and they constituted more than 50 percent of all non-U.S. citizens receiving doctorates. The top 30 countries of origin of doctorate recipients who were non-U.S. citizens on temporary visas in 1998 are listed in table 12. "}, {"section_title": "Doctorates by Parental Education Background", "text": "In addition to the distribution of doctorate recipients by sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship, the SED categorizes new Ph.D. recipients by family and personal background: geographic origins (see a discussion of this topic in the section on postgraduate plans), marital status and dependents, disability status, and the level of educational attainment by recipients' parents. Only the last is discussed in this section. In 1998, of doctorate recipients as a whole, 28.3 percent came from families in which the father had a high school education or less; for 37.1 percent of recipients, the mother had a high school education or less. More than 40 percent (40.3) of the fathers of doctorate recipients had an advanced degree,I6 compared with 27.9 percent of the mothers. In 23.4 percent of the households, both parents held advanced degrees, but in a comparable number of families-23.0 percentboth the father and mother had high school education or less. (These percentages  and all of the discussions that follow are based on data from table 15.) These distributions vary widely by citizenship. For example, the percentage of doctorate recipients who had fathers and/or mothers with a high school education or less is lowest for U.S. citizens and highest for students holding temporary visas. As might be expected, the opposite is true for families in which parents held advanced degreesU.S. citizen students had the highest percentage of parents holding advanced degrees and students studying on temporary visas had the lowest percentage. Comparing by race/ethnicity, white doctorate recipients had the lowest percentages of fathers (27.0 percent) and mothers (34.3 percent) with a high school education. Black doctorate recipients had the highest percentage of fathers with a high school diploma or less (53.1 percent). Hispanics (52.6 percent) and blacks (51.9 percent) showed the highest percentages of mothers with a high school diploma or less. Male and female doctorate recipients come from families in which the parents had similar educational backgrounds. For the families of male doctorate recipients, 29.0 percent of the fathers had a high school education or less, whereas 39.4 percent of the fathers held advanced degrees. For female Ph.D.s, those percentages are 27.5 percent having fathers with a high school education or less and 40.9 percent of fathers holding advanced degrees. Slightly more of the mothers of female doctorate recipients, as compared to mothers of male Ph.D.s, held advanced degrees (28.9 percent versus 26.7 percent) and fewer of the mothers had high school education or less (34.5 percent versus 39.2 percent). The educational attainment of parents differs among students in the various broad fields. Doctoral recipients in the humanities and social sciences had the highest percentage of fathers with advanced degrees (46.5 percent and 45.7 percent), while doctorate recipients in the field of education had the lowest percentage of fathers with advanced degrees (29.1 percent). The distributions rank in the same order for mothers of recent Ph.D.s."}, {"section_title": "Time to Degree", "text": "The median 1998 doctorate recipient graduated from high school in 1980, at age 18, was about 34 (33.7) years of age when receiving his or her doctoral degree, and had been enrolled on a full-time basis for 6 years in the doctoral program. Women were, on average, about 18 months older than their male counterparts (34.8 years of age versus 33.1 years for males). While twothirds (67.9 percent) of recent Ph.D.s received their high school diploma at 18 years of age, 3.8 percent were 16 years old or younger, and 2.4 percent were at least 20 years old. The amount of time taken by doctoral students to earn their degrees can be expressed in several ways. The survey collects data on three statistics in particular: (1) the elapsed time between receipt of the baccalaureate and conferring of the doctorate; (2) the number of years actually registered in a doctoral program; and (3) the age at which the doctorate was awarded. None of these \"clock times\" is necessarily an accurate measure of the time and effort required to complete a doctorate, for each measure can be affected by such factors as the job markets for new doctorates, child care responsibilities, or requirements governing access to loans (and the repayment schedule) and health insurance through the university. Nevertheless, taken together, these three offer a complementary picture of the path and process of doctoral study. (Tables 16,  17, and 18 and figures 13 and 14 provide the data and graphical illustrations for the discussion on time to degree below, both for 1998 levels and longitudinal comparisons.)  Doctorate recipients in the physical sciences had the shortest total time to degree (8.0 years) for students in any of the seven broad fields of study, with engineering Ph.D.s second (8.9 years); both fields had the lowest registered time (6.7 years). Within the general arts and sciences areas, humanities students took the longest median time to earn their doctorates (11.6 years), and they were registered for the longest period as well (8.7 years). Overall, education doctorate recipients had the longest average time to degree (20.0 years), although they were actually registered in their doctoral program for less than half of that time (8.4 years). (See figures 13 and 14.) 29 Figure 14. Age distribution at doctorate by broad field of study  Table 18 Source: NSF/NIH/NEH/USED/USDA, Survey of Earned Doctorates"}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "For 1998 doctoral recipients, the median number of years from the baccalaureate to the Ph.D. was 10.4 years (compared with 10.5 years for the 1997 doctoral cohort and 10.8 years in 1996). The registered time to degree was 7.3 years; it was also 7.3 years in 1997 and was 7.2 years in 1996. Because males and females, U.S. citizens and non-citizens, and members of various ethnic/racial groups are not distributed in the same proportions across academic disciplines, total and registered times can vary by sex, race/ethnicity and citizenship. For example, males are more likely to be in the physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences, where both total and registered times to degree are lower than in other areas; females are overrepresented in the social sciences, humanities, and education, where both time-to-degree medians are higher. The aggregate difference in total time to degree (9.9 years for males versus 11.3 years for females) or registered time to degree (7.2 years for men versus 7.6 years for women) is largely attributed to the distributions by sex across these fields of study; within a specific field, median times are higher for women in some areas and lower in others. Distributions by actual age at receipt of the doctorate are consistent with the other two time-to-degree measures. For the physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences, the modal age grouping is 26-30 years of age; for the social sciences and humanities, it is 31-35 years; and for education, it is the open-ended \"over 45 years\" category. (See table 18 and figure 14.) Overall, non-U.S. citizens holding temporary visas have shorter total and registered times to degree (9.5 years and 7.0 years) than do U.S. citizens or permanent residents. (See table 17.) Again, this is a function of the distributions by citizenship status across the various fields. Because of their disproportionate representation in the S&E fields, non-U.S. citizens holding temporary visas on average complete their degrees when they are about two years younger than U.S. citizens. However, for each individual S&E category, total time to degree is shorter for U.S. citizens than for those on temporary visas; that pattern generally (but not universally) holds true for registered times as well. Within the U.S citizen category, Asians have the shortest and blacks the longest total and registered times, but there are no systematic differences within field by race/ethnicity."}, {"section_title": "[Financial Resources in Support of Doctoral Recipients", "text": "Nearly one-third (32.2 percent) of 1998 doctorate recipients reported that their \"own resources\" was the primary source of financial support for their doctoral programs. These resources include loans; personal savings; non-academic personal earnings during graduate school; and earnings or savings from spouse, significant other, or family. More than half (60.6 percent) reported their primary financial support as a program-or institution-based source: fellowship or dissertation grant (16.3 percent), teaching assistantship (17.8 percent), and research assistantship/traineeship (26.5 percent). Those reporting foreign government (2.5 percent), employer (3.1 percent), and other sources (1.6 percent) make up the remainder. (See figure 15.) Overall, a higher percentage of women than men reported \"own resources\" as their primary financial source (41.1 percent versus 25.8 percent). U.S.-citizens (40.1 percent) were more likely than permanent residents (20.2 percent) or those on temporary visas (11.3 percent) to primarily rely on personal resources. Among the racial/ethnic groups (including whites) of U.S. citizens, the percentages citing personal resources as their primary support fell in a narrow band between 40 and 46 percent, except for Asians, for whom the percentage was 24.2 percent. However, the observed distributions are largely a function of field of study and underlying public policies, so comparisons at this level of aggregation must be further clarified. For example, within the physical sciences only 10.4 percent of men and 10.7 percent of women listed their own funds as their primary source of support; both sexes had access to teaching and research assistantships and fellowships in almost identical proportions. By contrast, in the social sciences almost half of the female doctorate recipients (47.9 percent) and 37.3 percent of their male counterparts listed personal resources as the primary financial source; in the humanities the percentages were 38.9 percent females and 38.5 percent males. At 69.0 percent, education led all broad fields in students' own resources as the primary means of support. International students are more heavily concentrated in fields where the majority of doctoral students traditionally receive institution-and/or program-based financial aid; consequently, it is not surprising that they rely less than do U.S. citizens on personal resources to support themselves in graduate school. However, within each of the seven broad fields, the percentage of U.S. citizens relying on their own financial resources exceeded that for their noncitizen counterparts, with permanent residents falling between in every instance. Three constraints influence the distribution of aid by citizenship status: (1) students on temporary visas are not eligible for many Federal or state sources of graduate assistance, such as USDA fellowships or traineeships from NIH and NSF; (2) international students, and in most cases their spouses, are not legally allowed to hold many forms of employment in the United States; and (3) non-U.S. citizens are excluded from most Federal loan programs. These constraints are coupled with the requirement that approval of visa applications is assured only for international students who demonstrate full, guaranteed financial resources to 22 Figure 15.

In the year immediately prior to being awarded the Ph.D., 46.4 percent of the 1998 doctorate recipients held a fellowship or assistantship at their graduate institution; 12.4 percent were employed elsewhere part time; and 7.6 percent classified themselves as unemployed. About one-third (33.6 percent) were employed full-time during that year, divided in equal proportions across business/industry, college/university faculty or non-faculty, elementary or secondary school teaching/administration, and other (or unspecified) occupations.' 7 Borrowing as a source of financial support for doctoral students is discussed in the special section on indebtedness."}, {"section_title": "Postgraduate Plans, Employment and Location", "text": "The SED questionnaire includes a number of questions about the graduates' immediate plans for work or further study.I8 The responses provide a useful overview of the numbers planning to enter academic positions, government and industry, and postdoctoral positions of research and further study.

The Summary Report 1998 examines three aspects of postgraduation plans. First is whether the new Ph.D. has a definite or indefinite commitment for employment or postdoctoral position, as categorized by broad field of study, sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity (tables 20 and 21). The second aspect examined is the distribution between career employment and postdoctorate research and study programs of doctorate recipients with definite plans. These data are also categorized by broad field of study (table 22), sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity (table 23), as well as by visa status and anticipated location (foreign versus U.S.) for non-U.S. citizens (tables 24 and 25).

In the humanities, only 58.8 percent have a definite commitment. The percentage of recipients with definite commitments also differs little by demographic groups (table 21).

The historical trend is generally away from immediate career employment in favor of postdoctoral programs. Differences among demographic subgroups are evident in table 23. Men are slightly more likely than women to have definite plans for a postdoctorate appointment (30.4 percent versus 27.3 percent), but international students are much more likely than U.S. citizens to have a postdoctorate lined up. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Asian students are more likely to plan on pursuing a postdoctorate; black and American Indian doctorate recipients are the least likely to report obtaining postdoctorates.

The areas having the highest concentrations of non-U.S. citizens who plan to stay in the United States are chemistry (87.8 percent), biology (83.0 percent), computer sciences (81.8 percent), and physics (80.6 percent).

The historical trend is a slight reduction in academic endeavors and government employment, coupled with increases in the industry and the self-employment sectors. Among U.S. racial and ethnic groups, Asian doctorate recipients are more prone to go into industry or self-employment and less likely to immediately enter academe than those in the other racial and ethnic groups. Industry also is the main destination of non-U.S. citizens with definite plans to remain in the United States after graduation. (See table 26.)

California (47.1 percent) and Texas (46.7 percent) have the highest immediate \"return\" or \"stay\" rates of all the states. Graduates of Puerto Rican high schools were most likely to return to or remain in Puerto Rico after completion of their doctoral studies (50.3 percent). Wyoming (5.6 percent), Vermont (7.8 percent), and New Hampshire (8.4 percent) had the lowest rates of return. (See table 28.)

At the other end, 46.6 percent of doctorate recipients in the field of education indicated postgraduate plans in their home state. For the other five broad fields, the percentages of doctorate recipients returning home are tightly clustered around 25 percent. (See table 28.)

This special section focuses on the indebtedness of U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients. Less attention is paid to non-U.S.-citizen students for two reasons: (1) an overwhelming percentage of international students did not complete their undergraduate education in the United States, so they were subject to a wider variety of, and for purposes of this report largely unknown, methods of financing during those years of study, and (2) non-U.S. citizens are not eligible to participate in the most frequently utilized loan programsStafford (formerly known as Guaranteed Student Loans [GSL]) and-Perkins (formerly National Direct Student Loans [NDSL]) for graduate and professional study in this country. Furthermore, approval of visa applications requires that international students demonstrate adequate financial resources. Loans are not an allowable source of support, and many forms of employment are denied the student, as well as the spouse. Consequently, graduate financial aid to non-U.S. citizens is far more likely to be provided through university fellowships and teaching and research assistantships than through formal loan programs. Our knowledge about the extent of borrowing by 1998 doctorate recipients to finance their education is derived from three questions in the survey instrument (see appendix D). On two questions, respondents note whether student loans were a source of financial support during graduate school and indicate which of the various financial aid alternatives were the primary and secondary sources. The discussion on financial aid found in the main report, as well as tables 29 and 30, place student loans in context. The descriptions and analyses in this special section focus on the responses of doctorate recipients to the third question, which concerns whether the respondent's education financing is related to borrowing. This special section includes mapping the question's one-dimensional answer to the variables of sex, broad field of study, race/ethnicity, and institution type, among others. The exact wording of the question is: \"When you receive your doctoral degree, how much money will you owe that is directly related to your undergraduate and/or graduate education (tuition and fees, living expenses and supplies, transportation to and from school)?\" Of the 1998 doctoral cohort, 49.1 percent incurred some debt over the course of their undergraduate and graduate studies. The median level of indebtedness upon completion of doctoral studies for those with outstanding loans was just over $15,000. (See the financial section in the main report and tables 29 and 30.) This question (as asked currently and in recent years) makes no distinction between borrowing for undergraduate education as opposed to graduate studies, or even asks explicitly about borrowing to finance a doctoral program versus other graduate-level programs. Amounts that a doctoral student may have borrowed over the years and how much money is still owed are not specifically requested; that is, no information is asked about partial repayment of existing debt due to funds being available from the student's earnings or through spousal earnings, an inheritance, or a monetary gift. Responses may be somewhat ambiguous, depending on how respondents perceive indebtedness \"directly related to [their] undergraduate and/or graduate education,\" and how they treat borrowing from parents and/or other family members, credit card balances, and the interest due on their debt.22"}, {"section_title": "Recent Historical and Current Debt Levels", "text": "In 1998, 43.8 percent of U.S. citizens receiving research doctorates reported no outstanding indebtedness upon graduation. That aggregate percentage has not changed significantly since five years ago, when the percentage was 44.6 percent. (See table 30 and Summary Report 1993.23) The percentage of respondents having educational indebtedness of less than $5,000 has fallen since 1993 (from 13.7 percent to 10.0 percent in 1998). However, the percentage reporting at least $30,000 in loans has steadily increased, from 6.7 percent five years ago to 13.3 percent in 1998. By combining data for U.S. citizens, we see that in 1998, while 43.8 percent of doctorate recipients reported no outstanding loans, 27.3 percent owed $15,000 or less and 28.9 percent owed more than $15,000 (table 2-2).24 The percentages for men and women are about the same, but as might be expected, the figures differ significantly by field of study. Those in the S&E fields have the lowest percentage of indebtedness in general and also the smallest percentage owing more than $15,000. For the social sciences and humanities, the opposite situation holds more doctorate recipients in these fields than any others have some amount of indebtedness and the largest percentage owes more than $15,000 (table 2-2). Doctorate recipients in the field of education display the highest level of being debt-free. Many education students pursue their doctorates on a part-time basis, funding their studies out of personal resources and support from their school districts. In addition, since the median age of doctorate recipients in the field of education is 45, the many years of intervening professional employment may be the primary reason those graduates show so little indebtedness. (See tables 18 and 2-2.) The question on indebtedness was first included in the SED in 1987, and since then the wording and the response categories have remained exactly the same. Summary Report 1988 states that of the 30,254 respondents to the debt question in 1988, over half (53 percent) reported finishing their doctoral programs free of debt related to their education and that the median level owed for those with accumulated educational debt was approximately $7,500. Ten years later, the percentage with no debt has decreased, and the average amount owed has increased. With an adjustment for inflation (which has reduced the real value of the indebtedness at a rate of about 3 percent per year), the median level owed is about 50 percent higher. Because students are incurring an increasing amount of debt (i.e., undergraduate plus graduate loans) along the path to their doctorate degrees, postgraduate career and personal decisions (such as family formation) may be affected."}, {"section_title": "Indebtedness by Race/Ethnicity", "text": "Among U.S. racial/ethnic minorities, Asians reported the lowest indebtedness levels-47.2 percent had no loans to repay upon receipt of the doctorate.

Among those who did have outstanding loan balances, whites (12.6 percent) and Asians (11.4 percent) had the lowest percentages of those owing more than $30,000; however, 22.4 percent of black doctorate recipients owed more than $30,000.

This finding is very likely an effect of the education doctorate recipients funding their educations out of their own resources and therefore graduating without any debt (see tablel9). Those who had been primarily supported by teaching or research assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships had fewer numbers graduating free of debt. However, 33.2 percent of the group supported by their own resources owed more than $15,000, one of the highest proportions of those in debt. (See table 2-4.) Variation was also seen by postdoctoral plans for the 1998 cohort. U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients who plan to work in the academic sector reported the highest percentage of debt (58.3 percent) and also the highest proportion owing more than $15,000 (31.6 percent).

U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients can be divided by baccalaureate institution into four populations: (1) those who received their B.A.s from public colleges or universities and also earned doctorates at public institutions; (2) those who were undergraduates at public institutions but earned their Ph.D.s from private universities; (3) those with B.A.s from private colleges or universities and doctorates from public institutions; and, (4) those who spent both their undergraduate and doctoral years at private institutions. Table 2-6 shows the doctorate population divided into those four mutually exclusive categories. The data reveal that the level of indebtedness, including having no loans to repay, is independent of the type of institution that conferred the baccalaureate and doctorate. Very little variation exists across the three indebtedness levels by the four populations; regardless of enrollment pattern, approximately 42-45 percent of doctorate recipients had no outstanding loans; between 25 and 30 percent owe less than $15,000; and 25 to 30 percent owe more than $15,000. (See table 2-6.)"}, {"section_title": "Indebtedness by Demographic Background", "text": "Borrowing by U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients appears to be independent of parents' levels of education, which serves in this analysis as a crude proxy for family income. (See table 2-7.) No discernable pattern is evident by the level of education reached by fathers, mothers, or both parents for members of the 1998 doctorate cohort having no indebtedness; the variation by parental education level is remarkably small. The same pattern holds for 1998 doctorate recipients at the other end of the spectrumthose owing more than $15,000. The level of indebtedness, however, is not independent of marital status and number of dependents. For U.S. citizens, more married (47.5 percent) doctorate recipients (including those in a marriage-like relationship) reported having no outstanding education debt, as compared with those widowed, separated, or divorced (36.1 percent) and those who had never been married (38.1 percent). A spouse may well represent, on average, a source of support and a net financial asset to the doctorate recipient. (See table 2-8). The effect of dependents on indebtedness is ambiguous.26 The survey instrument (see appendix D) merely asks for the total number of those who receive at least one-half of their support from the respondentit does not distinguish between spouse/partner and children; nor provide ages for the children. Neither does this question distinguish between doctorate recipients and their spouses providing over half of the financial resources for their households. If the spouse supported the household, the respondent may have answered zero dependents even though married. A comparison of the survey responses showed 62.9 percent of all U.S.-citizen doctorate recipients were married or living in a marriage-like relationship, but 55.0 percent reported having zero dependents.27 Of these respondents with no dependents, 42.1 percent reported no indebtedness, as compared with 43.2 percent of degree earners with one dependent, 47.7 percent of recipients with two dependents, and 47.9 percent of those with three or more dependents. (See table 2-8.) 26 Improvements in the question wording and an additional question for the 2001 survey instrument should resolve or lessen the ambiguity on this point. 27 Overall, 55.0 percent of recipients responded no dependents; 19.9 percent responded one dependent; 12.7 percent, two dependents; and 12.4 percent, three or more dependents.

Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by Federal sponsors of the SED. Terms requiring definition are as follows: Percentage with Master 's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is obtained by subtracting the month/year of birth from the month/year of doctorate. (See note on next page.) Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to the total calendar time elapsed between the month/year of baccalaureate and the month/year of doctorate. \"Registered Time\" refers to the actual time in attendance at colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and the doctorate. NOTE about medians: The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations; medians presented in earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results than are obtained by the old method. While variation is small (usually one or two decimal places), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. Postgraduation Plans: Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items B1 through B9 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is awarded, a recipient's plans are subject to change. However, comparisons with the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) have shown SED data to be a reasonable indicator of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate, although results vary by sector. (The SDR is a follow-up employment survey of a sample of doctorate recipients in science, engineering, and, until 1995, humanities fields.) In Table A-3 the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment after Doctorate\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 28.0 percent of all psychology doctorate recipients had postdoctoral study plans, 54.2 percent planned to be employed, and 17.8 percent did not report their post-graduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The study rows is further subdivided by type of study or appointment (fellowships, research associateships, traineeships, and other study). The percentages in these subdivisions sum to the percent of respondents in the given column who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to percentage of respondents in the given column who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item B 1: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item B 1: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but 70 8 2 have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire. (Note that the rows on specific postdoctoral study and employment plans discussed earlier include individuals whose plans were not definite.) Revisions to the questionnaire format beginning in 1990 resulted in higher rates of nonresponse to the item on work activity through 1993, when the rate was 15.1 percent. The questionnaire was revised again in 1994, and nonresponse subsequently dropped to 11.9 percent in 1994 and 10.7 in 1995. A final revision in 1995 dropped the nonresponse for this item to just 3.4 percent in 1997. The racial/ethnic question has undergone several revisions over the years. In 1977 it was modified to correspond to a standard question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in Federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. (Note: Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to the Asian category.) In 1980 the item was further revised in two ways: (1) the Hispanic category was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and other Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category. (Before 1980 doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race.) The item was modified again in 1982 to separate the questions on race and ethnicity. Since then respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic. In Table A-4, doctorate recipients who reported Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial designation, are included in one of three Hispanic groups: Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or other Hispanic. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. (Note: doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as American Indian in this report.) NOTE about median age and time lapse (to doctorate): The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations; medians presented in earlier reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results. While variation is small (usually one or two decimal places), the reader should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in this report with those in earlier reports. See explanatory information on Table A-3 for further description. In the section of \"Doctoral Program Support\" a recipient counts in more than one category if support was received from multiple sources. Because a student counts more than once for sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. See the explanatory note on Appendix Table A-5 for further detail. (Data on the primary source of support for doctorate recipients are presented in the body of the report.) The other sections in Table A-4 correspond to many of those in Appendix Table A-3.

Self-report rates for 1980-98 are determined from the \"source of response\" indicator in the doctorate records. Because this indicator was not coded prior to 1980, survey forms for 1965-79 are assumed to be self-reported if \"month signed\" or \"marital status\" is present. \"Marital status\" is not available from sources other than the doctorate recipient. As shown in the table above, 91.5 percent of 1998 U.S. doctorate recipients completed survey forms. This percentage is what has been referred to as the \"self-report\" rate. For the remaining doctorate recipients, \"skeleton\" records were created using basic information obtained from doctorate-granting institutions or from commencement programs. This skeleton information includes Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, Ph.D. year, and sex of Ph.D. recipient. It should be noted that the sex variable was not always available, even for survey respondents. Every effort was made to obtain this information for as many respondents as possible, but for a small percentage, this could not be done with confidence. Thus, you will notice that there are missing data for many of the tabulations involving sex in this year's report. Prior to 1997, whenever sex was missing, the data were assigned to \"male.\" In 1997, it was decided to discontinue this practice. The tabulations involving sex for 1997 and 1998 exclude missing cases except where noted otherwise. Wherever possible this report includes data from all Ph.D. records whether complete or skeletal; thus the reported total number of Ph.D. recipients for 1998 (42,683) includes both respondents and non-respondents. It should also be noted that, in keeping with the practice of earlier data collection cycles, counts for previous years were corrected by the addition of data from surveys received after the close of data collection for a given year. In this year's cycle, this will particularly affect the 1997 data and analysis because, in addition to the changes engendered by adding data from questionnaires for 1997 doctorate recipients that arrived after the 1997 closing date, 150 cases originally coded as 1997 doctorate recipients were determined actually to have received their doctorates in the 1998 academic year and were recoded accordingly. This has an effect not only on the overall count of doctorate recipients for 1997 but on the response rates and analyses of individual variables, most notably on the variable PHDFIELD, which indexes field of doctorate. The reader will therefore note differences in the values reported for 1997 in the trend tables of this year's summary report compared to the 1997 Summary Report. For comparison, both the original and revised response rates for 1997 are included in the table of response rates shown below."}, {"section_title": "II.

Since then, respondents have been asked to first check one of the four racial group categories (American Indian, Asian, black, or white) and then indicate whether or not they are Hispanic.

(Note: Doctorate recipients who checked the category \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" are identified as \"American Indian\" in this report.) Time to Doctorate Total time to degree (TTD): TTD measures the total elapsed time between the baccalaureate and the doctorate (including time not enrolled in school). TTD can be computed only for individuals whose baccalaureate year is known. Baccalaureate year is often obtained from commencement programs or doctorate institutions when not reported by the recipient. Months are now included in the computation (see note below). Registered time to degree (RTD): RTD gauges the time in attendance at colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and the doctorate. Enrollment may include years of attendance not related to a recipient's doctoral program. RTD can only be computed for individuals who provided all years of college attendance after the baccalaureate. Months are now included in the computation (see note below). Note about medians: The method of computing medians has been revised. Beginning with Summary Report 1994, months (of birth, baccalaureate, and doctorate) are included in the calculations whenever available; if months are missing, only years are used in the calculations. (However, medians are not computed for years prior to 1969 because doctorate month is unavailable for all doctorate recipients.) Medians presented in previous summary reports were based only on years. Some medians would be the same regardless of the method of computation, but the new method generally computes slightly different results. While differences are small (usually one-or two-tenths of a year), readers should consider these differences when comparing medians presented in the report with those in earlier reports."}, {"section_title": "IV.

However, the category \"2-Separated, divorced, widowed\" from the previous questionnaire has been separated into two categories in the new version, \"3-Widowed\" and \"4-Separated/divorced.\" Also, the category \"0-Single, never married\" has been recoded as \"5-Never married.\""}, {"section_title": "Source of Funding Variables (Questions All, Al2)", "text": "Before the 1998 SED, the source of funding variables, SRCE(A-M), SRCEPRIM, and SRCESEC, took 35 possible numeric values, indicating specific funding sources that supported the respondent's graduate education. A number of these numeric codes keyed to specific Federal programs (e.g., Patricia Roberts Harris scholarships, NIH traineeships, etc.). The new code frame reduces the respondent's available choices to 13 and presents options as broad categories of funding sources (e.g., \"Federal government\"), rather than specific programs (e.g., \"NIH traineeship\"). The number of closed-ended answer choices offered at Question All corresponds with the total number of sources of financial support variables recorded on the DRF. To make the analysis of these data easier, SRCE(A-M) were converted to Yes/No/Don't Know questions, replacing numerical coding of specific college funding programs. Data users can perform straightforward frequencies on each source of funding variable, rather than running frequencies on 13 variables and summing the results to get the number of cases receiving funding from each of 35 sources. To preserve consistency in coding over the two form types for 1998 SED, the coding system shown in the table below should be used to map the older code frame into the new code frame.  In addition, the tabulations in this report further collapse the 13 new categories into 7 as follows. 1998 Summary Report Table Category  Raw  Because the new source of support variable code frame groups these sources somewhat differently than in the past, users should approach generalizations on trends in financing doctoral education with caution. For example, the table below breaks down the categories further. It pinpoints the source of the decline in the \"Own Resources\" category: the double-digit drop in the \"Other personal earnings in graduate school\" category. At the same time, it shows that the increase in doctorate recipients indicating they received fellowships accounts for almost all of the increased proportion of doctorate recipients in the category \"Fellowships/Dissertation Grants.\" While the earlier years' data suggests a slight increase in the proportion of doctorate recipients indicating \"Fellowships/Dissertation Grants\" as their primary source of support, the one-year increase of more than 5 percent from 1994-97 to 1998 raises questions. Again, data from another National Science Foundation survey, The Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, suggest that proportion of graduate students relying on fellowship aid has remained relatively flat since the early 1980s.
