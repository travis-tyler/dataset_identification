Predicting cognitive performance of subjects from their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures and identifying relevant imaging biomarkers are important research topics in the study of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, the multitask learning (MTL) methods with sparsity-inducing norm (e.g., \u2113 2,1 -norm) have been widely studied to select the discriminative feature subset from MRI features by incorporating inherent correlations among multiple clinical cognitive measures. However, these previous works formulate the prediction tasks as a linear regression problem. The major limitation is that they assumed a linear relationship between the MRI features and the cognitive outcomes. Some multikernel-based MTL methods have been proposed and shown better generalization ability due to the nonlinear advantage. We quantify the power of existing linear and nonlinear MTL methods by evaluating their performance on cognitive score prediction of Alzheimer's disease.

It accounts for 60-70% of age related dementia, affecting an estimated 30 million individuals in 2011 and the number is projected to be over 114 million by 2050 [2] . The cause of AD is poorly understood and currently there is no cure for AD. AD has a long preclinical phase, lasting a decade or more. There is increasing research emphasis on detecting AD in the preclinical phase, before the onset of the irreversible neuron loss that characterizes the dementia phase of the disease, since therapies/treatment are most likely to be effective in this early phase. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) has been facilitating the scientific evaluation of neuroimaging data including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), along with other biomarkers and clinical and neuropsychological assessments for predicting the onset and progression of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and AD. Early diagnosis of AD is key to the development, assessment, and monitoring of new treatments for AD.\nRecently, rather than predicting categorical variables in the classification, various studies started to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. Therefore, instead of classifying a subject into binary or multiple predetermined categories or stages of the disease, regression focus is on estimating continuous values which may help to assess patient's disease progression. The most commonly used cognitive measures are Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) cognitive total score, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses were commonly used to predict cognitive scores from imaging measures. The relationship between commonly used cognitive measures and structural changes with MRI has been previously studied by regression models and the results demonstrated that there exists a relationship between 2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine baseline MRI features and cognitive measures [3, 4] . For example, Wan et al. proposed an elegant regression model called CORNLIN that employs a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to predict multiple cognitive scores based on 98 structural MRI regions of interests (ROIs) for Alzheimer's disease patients. The polynomial model used in CORNLIN can detect either a nonlinear or a linear relationship between brain structure and cognitive decline [3] . Stonnington et al. adopted relevance vector regression, a sparse kernel method formulated in a Bayesian framework, to predict four sets of cognitive scores using MRI voxel based morphometry measures [4] . One of the biggest challenges in the prediction of inferring cognitive outcomes with MRI is the high dimensionality, which affects the computational performance and leads to a wrong estimation and identification of the relevant predictors. To reduce the high dimensionality and identify the relevant biomarkers, the sparse methods have attracted a great amount of research efforts in the neuroimaging field due to its sparsity-inducing property. Ye et al. applied sparse logistic regression with stability selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection [5] and successfully predicted the conversion from MCI into probable AD and identified a small subset of biosignatures.\nIt is known that there exist inherent correlations among multiple clinical cognitive variables of a subject. However, many works do not model dependence relation between multiple tasks and neglect the correlation between clinical tasks which is potentially useful. When the tasks are believed to be related, learning multiple related tasks jointly can improve the performance relative to learning each task separately. Multitask learning (MTL) is a statistical learning framework which aims at learning several models in a joint manner. It has been commonly used to obtain better generalization performance than learning each task individually [6, 7] . The critical issues in MTL are to identify how the tasks are related and build learning models to capture such task relatedness. The most recent studies [6, 8, 9] employed multitask learning with \u2113 2,1 -norm [7] regularization and aimed to select features that could predict all or most clinical scores. The \u2113 2,1 -norm is chosen to be the regularization. Thus, the \u2113 2,1 -norm regularized regression model is able to select some common features across all the tasks. However, in these learning methods, each task is traditionally performed by formulating a linear regression problem, in which the cognitive score is a linear function of the neuroimaging measures.\nKernel methods have been studied to model the cognitive scores as nonlinear functions of neuroimaging measures. Recently, many kernel-based classification or regression methods with faster optimization speed or stronger generalization performance have been proposed and investigated by theoretically analyzing and experimentally evaluating [10, 11] . Multiple kernel learning (MKL) [12] , which learns the optimal kernel for a given task by a weighted, linear combination of predefined candidate kernels, has been introduced to handle the problem of kernel selection. The multiple kernel learning method not only learns an optimal combination of given base kernels but also provides a flexible framework to exploit the nonlinear relationship between MRI measures and cognitive scores.\nIn building the predictive model for classification or regression in AD, kernel has been widely used; therefore, it is important to extend the existing kernel-based learning methods to the case of multitask learning. In this paper, we propose two nonlinear multikernel-based multiple learning methods in [13] for building regression models, to exploit and investigate the nonlinear relationship between MRI measures and cognitive scores. Moreover, an \u2113 \u2113 1 -norm is used to extend the traditional \u2113 2 \u2113 1 -norm. The goal of our work is to (1) predict subjects' cognitive scores in a number of neuropsychological assessments using their MRI measures across the entire brain, (2) identify what the performance of the nonlinear method is compared with the linear \u2113 \u2113 1 -norm MTL and other MTL methods with different assumption. No previous studies have systematically and extensively examined the prediction performance by linear MTL and nonlinear MTL methods, and (3) identify what the learning capacity of the multikernel framework on fusing multimodality data is.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a description of the multitask learning formulation. A linearized MTL and two multikernel-based MTL methods with \u2113 \u2113 1 -norm are provided in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the experimental results and compare the performance of linearized and kernelized MTL methods from the ADNI-1 dataset. The conclusion is drawn in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Multitask Learning", "text": "Consider a multitask learning (MTL) setting with tasks. Let be the number of covariates, shared across all the tasks, and be the number of samples. Let \u2208 R \u00d7 denote the matrix of covariates, \u2208 R \u00d7 be the matrix of responses with each row corresponding to a sample, and \u0398 \u2208 R \u00d7 denote the parameter matrix, with column . \u2208 R corresponding to task , = 1, . . . , , and row \u210e. \u2208 R corresponding to feature \u210e, \u210e = 1, . . . , .\nThe MTL formulation focuses on the following regularized loss function:\nwhere (\u22c5) denotes the loss function and (\u22c5) is the regularizer. In the current context, we assume the loss to be square loss; that is,\nwhere y \u2208 R 1\u00d7 and x \u2208 R 1\u00d7 are the th rows of and , respectively, corresponding to the multitask response and covariates for the th sample. We note that the MTL framework can be easily extended to other loss functions. Base on some prior knowledge, we then add penalty (\u0398) to encode the relatedness among tasks.\nComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine The \u2113 2 \u2113 1 -norm was popularly used in multitask feature learning [14] . All the existing algorithms for multitask feature learning assume a linear relationship between MRI features and cognitive scores and aim to learn a common subset of features for all tasks. Since the \u2113 2 \u2113 1 -norm regularizer imposes the sparsity between all features and nonsparsity between tasks, the features that are discriminative for all tasks will get large weights. However, the \u2113 2 \u2113 1 -norm is a fixed nonadaptive penalty. To obtain an adaptive regularization and better suit different data structures, we extend the \u2113 2,1 -norm to a larger class of mixed norm \u2113 \u2113 1 that can be adapted to the data. The objective function of linear \u2113 \u2113 1 -MTL is formulated:\nWhen = 1, problem (3) reduces to the \u2113 1 -regularized problem; when = 2, problem (3) reduces to the \u2113 2,1 -regularized problem.\nAn efficient algorithm is based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the \u2113 \u2113 1 -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of larger than 1.\nFirst, construct the following model for approximating the composite function M(\u22c5) at the point \u0398 ( ) :\nwhere > 0. In the model M ,\u0398 ( ) (\u0398), apply the firstorder Taylor expansion at the point \u0398 (including all terms in the square bracket) for the smooth loss function (\u22c5), and directly put the nonsmooth penalty (\u22c5) into the model. The regularization term ( /2)\u2016\u0398 \u2212 \u0398 ( ) \u2016 2 prevents \u0398 from walking far away from \u0398 ( ) , and thus the model can be a good\nThe accelerated gradient method is based on two sequences {\u0398 ( ) } and {\u0393 ( ) } in which {\u0398 ( ) } is the sequence of approximate solutions and {\u0393 ( ) } is the sequence of search\nand \u0398 ( ) as\nwhere ( ) is a properly chosen coefficient.

In [15] , the method can be used for ease of different independent groups; that is, 1 \nwhere G is the independent groups. In our paper, we focus on how the method deals with multitask learning problem in (7), where G is equal to , and each group denotes the corresponding feature shared across the multiple tasks. Thus, the optimization in (7) decouples into a set of independent \u2113 -regularized Euclidean projection problems:\nThen, the optimal solution * \u210e. of (8) can be gotten as follows:\nwhere = /( \u2212 1), and thus and satisfy the following relationship: 1/ + 1/ = 1, * is the unique root of ( ) = \u2211 \u210e=1 max(|V \u210e. | \u2212 , 0) \u2212 , and (\u22c5) is an auxiliary function, defined as\nwhere\ndata into a nonlinear feature space by kernel embedding. In this section, we consider the case that \u2113 2,1 -norm regularized MTL is extended to kernel method. Let us define the kernel function (x) : R \u2192 R\u0302, which maps the data samples from an input space to a feature space (a high-dimensional Hilbert space H), where\u0302denotes the dimensionality of the feature space and x is a sample from the input space. A kernel function is capable of attaining the inner product of two mapped datasets in H: (x, x ) = (x) \u22c5 (x ) in the original space without explicitly computing the mapped data. The associated Gram matrix has entries ( , ) = (x, x ).\nThe most suitable types and parameters of the kernels for a particular task are often unknown, and the selection of the optimal kernel by exhaustive search on a predefined pool of kernels is usually time-consuming and sometimes causes overfitting. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) attempts to achieve better results by combining several base kernels instead of using only one specific kernel. MKL assumes that x can be mapped to different Hilbert spaces, x \u2192 (x ), = 1, . . . , , implicitly with nonlinear mapping functions, and the objective of MKL is to seek the optimal kernel combination\u0302(x, x ) = \u2211 =1 ( , ), \u2265 0, \u2211 =1 = 1, where d is the kernel weight vector. The primal objective function of multiple kernel regression model is written as follows:\nMKL learns both the weights of the kernel combination d and the parameters of the regression\u0303by solving a single joint optimization problem.\nUsing to denote the Lagrange multipliers, the objective value of the dual problem of (10) can be written as follows:\nwhereK = \u2211 =1 K is the combined Gram matrix and , = 1, . . . , , is the given set of base kernels."}, {"section_title": "\u2113 \u2113", "text": "We follow the multiple kernel learning scheme and use the \u2113 ,1 -norm to model the relationship between the tasks to learn a common kernel representation by imposing sparsity constraint on the kernel weight.

Such a model is the lack of capability to capture nonlinear predictive information from the features. Although the \u2113 \u2113 1 -MKMTL builds the nonlinear relationship for the features and task by mapping to high-dimensional space, it considers that tasks to be learned share a common subset of kernel representations without capturing the interrelationships between different cognitive measures over the feature space.\nTo overcome the weaknesses of the previous two methods, we project the original feature vectors to a highdimensional space using multiple nonlinear mapping functions for performing regression task in a nonlinear manner and utilize multitask learning in the multiple kernel spaces for modeling the disease's cognitive scores with a joint \u2113 2,1 -\u2113 sparsity-inducing regularizers. Moreover, we construct new features as orthogonal transforms of the given features, that is, L ( ), where L is an orthogonal matrix which is to be learned.
