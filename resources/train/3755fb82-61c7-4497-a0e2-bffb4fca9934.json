[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Income disparities by gender are a persistent problem throughout the world. These disparities place women at risk for economic insecurity both while working and in retirement. Education and continued skill upgrading are key to reducing income disparities, but it is well documented that both older men and women are less likely to participate in adult education and training (AET) than their younger counterparts.

Also, given the increasing use of technology, technologyrelated problem-solving skills are compared across these four nations. In addition, we discuss current, and potentially new, country level policies and practices that facilitate the provision of AET over the second half of the life course. Yamashita and colleagues use data from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to provide an overview of AET participation, income, and technology-related problem-solving skills by sex and age groups in the four countries. Vickerstaff and van der Horst use data from five different organizations in the United Kingdom to examine attitudes of older workers about participation in training and the extent to which these attitudes result from self-imposed ageism. Taylor presents survey data from Australia that analyzes types of training women are undertaking, factors associated with participation in training, and the importance of employer support. Finally, Harrington and Cummins use PIAAC data to analyze age variations in AET participation and gender differences in employer sponsored training in Canada."}, {"section_title": "TRAINING AT WORK: THE IMPACT OF INTERNALIZED AGEISM", "text": "Sarah A. Vickerstaff, 1 and Mariska F. van der Horst 2 , 1. University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, United Kingdom, 2. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands It is well documented that seniors receive less work based training than younger counterparts. Studies have assessed the extent to which managers afford access to training because of stereotypes about older workers being less trainable or interested in training. Less is known about the degree to which individuals have internalised age stereotypes and self-stereotype which impacts their attitudes about training. In this work place based study, through analysis of interviews with older workers we examine the extent to which internalised ageism is an inhibitor for seeking further training. We examine the role of gender and work setting. The data includes 185 participants in five different UK organisations in blue collar, white collar, managerial, manufacturing and services sectors. There is some evidence that older workers may feel that they are less deserving and less capable of training and development with implications for policy in this field."}, {"section_title": "OLDER AUSTRALIAN WOMEN'S HUMAN CAPITAL: PERCEPTIONS OF SKILL LEVELS AND PARTICIPATION IN LEARNING ACTIVITIES", "text": "Philip Taylor 1 , 1. Federation University Australia, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia While business cases for older workers' employment stress their value it is well-known that they participate less in training activities than younger workers. Women are at particular risk of not accessing training opportunities. Drawing on a survey of 2500 women aged over 50 we report a fine-grained analysis of the types of training women were undertaking and the factors associated with participation in training. The analysis indicates that training is infrequently undertaken in preparation for a new job and large majorities of women see no need to and are not interested in retraining. This is observed across occupational groups, but more commonly among those with low educational levels. A lack of employer support is much less commonly reported as a barrier to older women's participating in training. The findings suggest that it is primarily at women themselves that efforts aimed at promoting human capital development need to be directed."}, {"section_title": "ADULT EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CANADA: OPPORTUNITIES, FUNDING, AND GENDER GAPS A. Katherine Harrington, 1 and Phyllis Cummins 1 , 1. Scripps Gerontology Center, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, United States", "text": "Labor force participation rates for middle-aged and older Canadians have increased substantially over the past two decades, with increases for women outpacing men. Given the importance of adult education and training (AET) to stay competitive in later career, we used a mixed methods approach to examine gender differences. Our analysis of the 2012 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data indicated that, for ages 55-65, rates of AET participation are similar for both men and women. However, women are less likely than men to have AET funded by their employers. Findings suggest that women are more likely to need alternate funding sources for AET, such as other organizations or through self-funding. In addition, our review of literature, policy-related documents, and key informant interviews identified possible changes in policies and practices for the promotion of AET for middleaged and older Canadians. Income disparities by gender have been a persistent problem in economically-developed countries for decades, with income gaps often widening over the adult life course. We use data from the 2012 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to examine relationships among problem solving skills in technology-rich environments (PSTRE), income, sex, and age in Australia, Canada, England/Northern Ireland and the United States. Women age 35 to 44 in the middle-tohigh (i.e., 50th -75th percentile) income group had significantly higher PSTRE scores than their male counterparts in Australia and Canada. For the same income group, women ages 55 to 65 had significantly higher.
