The average educational loan debt still owed by the students in early 1992 was about $5,300, but the amount varied considerably by the level and control of institution attended. This debt ranged from about $3,300 at public less-than-4-year institutions to more than $8,000 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. The receipt of financial aid was directly related to persistence and attainment in postsecondary education: the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students wi io received financial aid were less likely to have left postsecondary education by 1992 without completing a program than those who received no aid. While dependent students from low-income (under $20,000) families were more likely, overall, than those from high-income (over $60,000) families to have left postsecondary education by 1992, dependent financial aid recipients from low-income families were no more likely than unaided dependents from high-income families to have left postsecondary education by 1992."}, {"section_title": "Work Experiences", "text": "Of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who worked while enrolled (87 percent of all students), 76 percent considered their primary role to be that of a student who worked and 24 percent considered their primary role to be an employee who studied.

It describes their economic and demographic characteristics, their educational aspirations, the types of institutions they attended, their experiences while enrolled, and their persistence and attainment through the spring of 1992. In addition, this report describes the work experiences of these first-time students, both while enrolled and after they left postsecondary education. The data for this report were drawn from the first followup of the 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study conducted in the spring of 1992. The BPS sample was drawn from first-time students who participated in the 1990 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of graduate and undergraduate students. The BPS Study provides data about enrollment, persistence, and attainment in postsecondary education. The first followup collected information on students' experiences during the period between the 1990 NPSAS and the spring of 1992. The second followup, which will be conducted during the spring of 1994, will update the information reported here. The 1989-90 BPS Study included not only students who enrolled immediately after high school, but also students who delayed their postsecondary studies. Thus, this study is a departure from previous National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) longitudinal studies of high school cohorts, in that it provides information for a steadily growing segment of the postsecondary student populationthose who delay continuation of their education due to family responsibilities, military service, lack of financial resources, or other reasons. Students in all types of programs (e.g., academic, vocational, or technical) are represented in the survey. Some of these first-time students identified their primary role in postsecondary education as that of an employee attending postsecondary education for career advancement or personal enrichment. In this report, their work experiences are treated separately from those of students who worked to pay educational expenses or to earn extra spending money. In addition to describing the educational and employment experiences of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students, this report also contains information on patterns of family formation, political and civic participation, and participation in noncredit educational programs. The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:90/92 Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS is a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables from the BPS data.

beginning postsecondary students who ever received financial assistance from parental contributions, parental loans, or contributions from a spouse or relatives during the academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92, by level of primary institution attended in 1989-90 Introduction Background More than 2.5 million students enrolled in some type of postsecondary education for the first time during the 1989-90 academic year, choosing from a wide variety of types of public and private institutions, including 4-year colleges and universities, 2-to 3-year community colleges, and less-than-2-year institutions providing vocational training.' These students were a diverse group. Historically, the typical first-year postsecondary student was an 18-or 19year-old who had just graduated from high school who was financially dependent on his or her parents. In contrast, the 1989-90 cohort of beginning postsecondary students included individuals from a wide range of age groups. In addition to recent high school graduates, it included many older students who had delayed entry into postsecondary education in order to work, raise a family, or serve in the military. It also included students who had not completed high school in their teens but later decided to return for additional formal education.2 Most of these older students were financially independent of their parents.3 The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) instituted the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS) to provide information about the changing composition of postsecondary students and their patterns of persistence, progress, and attainment froth initial entry into postsecondary education through leaving and entering the work force. While earlier longitudinal studies, such as the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) and the High School and Beyond (HS&B) study collected similar information about postsecondary and early labor market experiences, these earlier studies were limited to members of a single high school class. BPS, in contrast, includes first-time postsecondary students of all ages, thus providing the first opportunity to examine the experiences of students who delay entry into postsecondary education. The sample for BPS consisted of all first-time postsecondary students who were part of the 1990 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90), a large, nationally representative study of more than 60,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in postsecondary education.' Thus, the 1989-90 NPSAS served not only as a study of all postsecondary students enrolled in 1989-90 but also as the base year for the longitudinal BPS. Approximately 7,900 first-time postsecondary students met the criteria for participation in BPS, and more than 6,500 of them were surveyed in 1992 for the first BPS followup (BPS:90/92). For the BPS survey, \"beginning postsecondary students\" included only students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90, not all students who were in their first year of a .postsecondary program in 1989-90. For example, an individual who completed a vocational course at a less-than-2-year institution some time before 1989-90 and then enrolled as a freshman in a 4-year baccalaureate program in 1989-90 would not have been considei:td a beginning postsecondary student. Similarly, an individual who enrolled in a 4-year program some time before 1989-90, dropped out after a few -nonths, and returned in 1989-90 still as a first-year student would not have been included in the BPS sample. A parttime student who was in the second year of postsecondary education in 1989-90, but who had not accumulated enough credits to advance to second-year status, also would not have been included. Throughout this report, the term \"beginning postsecondary students\" refers only to those who were first-time, beginning postsecondary students in ! 989-90. In 1989-90, approximately 14 percent of all undergraduate postsecondary st'Adents were beginning postsecondary students; another 37 percent were first-year/freshman students, but they were not enrolledin postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90.5 The BPS:90/92 data provide information on enrollment and attainment of beginning postsecondary students through February 1992. For the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in 4-1 ear institutions in 1989-90, these data are most valuable for the information they provide on patterns of persistence in postsecondary education, since few students would have earned a baccalaureate degree within the time period covered by the survey. For the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in less-than-4-year institutions in 1989-90, however, the data also provide valuable information on attainment, because many students would have had time to earn some type of postsecondary credential, such as a certificate, license, or associate's degree. BPS:90/92 also provides information on how beginning postsecondary students financed their education, their experiences in the labor market during their postsecondary studies (and after, if they were not enrolled the entire time), their patterns of =triage and family formation, and their involvement in civic and voluntary organizations. The purpose of th s report is to describe the experiences of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students through February 1992 and to examine how these experiences varied according to the students' characteristics and the types of institutions they attended. All variables used in the rows or columns of the tables are defined in the Glossary in appendix A.

Chapter 2 describes the types of programs the beginning postsecondary students participated in and their patterns of enrollment, persistence, and attainment. Chapter 3 describes the types and amounts of financial aid beginning postsecondary students used to pay for their education and examines the relationship between financial aid and student persistence. Chapter 4 examines their employment experiences while they were enrolled and afterwards (for those who had left postsecondary education).

This pattern varied by raceethnicity, age, and SES: Hispanics, older students, and students in the bottom SES quartile were especially likely to start in less-than-4-year institutions. For example, 66 percent of Hispanic beginning postsecondary students enrolled in 2-to 3-year institutions, compared with 48 percent of white, non-Hispanic and 48 percent of black, non-Hispanic beginning postsecondary students. Hispanics were less likely than white, non-Hispanics and Asians to begin their postsecondary education in a 4-year institution (26 percent for Hispanics compared with 44 percent for the other two groups). Older beginning postsecondary students (age 24 or older) were much more likely than their younger counterparts to enroll first in less-than-2-year institutions (17 percent to 23 percent compared with 6 percent) or 2-to 3-year institutions (67 percent to 73 percent compared with 46 percent). Relatively few beginning postsecondary students age 24 or older started in a 4-year institution (9 percent to 14 percent compared with 48 percent of those age 23 or younger). It is important to keep in mind that this does not mean that older students are unlikely to ever attend a 4-year institution, but simply that they are more likely to start at a less-than-4-year institution. For example, among all students age 30 or older, not just beginning postsecondary students, 27 percent were enrolled in 4-year institutions.' Beginning postsecondary students in the bottom SES quartile were more likely to be enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution (62 percent) than those in the top quartile (38 percent) (figure 1.2). On the other hand, low SES students were less likely than beginning postsecondary students in the middle and top SES quartiles to enter a 4-year institution (17 percent compared with 35 percent and 59 percent). 'Throughout this report references to 4-year institutions include both doctoral and nondoctoral granting institutions.   Beginning postsecondary students in the bottom SES quartile were more likely to be enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution (62 percent) than those in the top quartile (38 percent) (figure 1.2).

However, these characteristics themselves are interrelated in important ways that the reader should keep in mind when interpreting the data. When educe. anal or employment experiences, for example, appear to vary by type of institution, it is important to note that the differences may be attributable at least in part to differences in the characteristics of the students who attend each type of institution. Similarly, when experiences appear to vary by student characteristics, such as SES. and age, it is important to remember that the differences may be attributable in part to the type of institution attended, because different types of institutions have different student compositions.

Finally, the fact that student characteristics themselves, such as raceethnicity and SES, are interrelated is also important to remember. Table 1.1 illustrates how beginning postsecondary students with certain characteristics were distributed among the different types of institutions. Table 1.2 shows the relationships between institutional and student characteristics and SES and age. As shown in table 1.2, less-than-2-year institutions enrolled the greatest percentage of beginning postsecondary students from the bottom SES quartile (36 percent compared with 19 percent in 2-to 3-year institutions and 6 percent in 4-year institutions) and the greatest percentage of beginning postsecondary students age 30 or older (22 percent compared with 14 percent in 2-to 3-year institutions and 3 percent in 4-year institutions). Four-year institutions had more than one-half (56 percent) of their beginning postsecondary students from the top SES quartile, and 95 percent were age 23 or younger. Among beginning postsecondary students, raceethnicity and SES were interrelated. White, non-Hispanics and Asians were more likely than black, non-Hispanics or Hispanics to be in the top SES quartile. At the same time, white, non-Hispanics were less likely than black, non-Hispanics, Hispanics, or Asians to be in the bottom SES quartile."}, {"section_title": "Timing of First Enrollment", "text": "Seventy percent of all 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students were immediate entrantsthat is, they enrolled in postsecondary education within 12 months of completing high school (table 1.3). The other 30 percent had delayed their entry into postsecondary education for more than 12 months. Among the younger beginning postsecondary students (age 23 or younger), 83 percent were immediate entrants and 17 percent were delayed entrants. As one would expect, almost all of the older students were delayed entrants, although a small percentage (6 percent to 13 percent) were immediate entrants who did not finish high school at the usual 18 or 19 years of age but eventually found their way into the postsecondary education system. Beginning postsecondary students in the bottom SES quartile were considerably more likely than those in the middle and top SES quartiles to be delayed entrants (68 percent compared with 34 percent and 10 percent). The overwhelming majority (88 percent) of students who began their postsecondary education in 4-year institutions were immediate entrants (figure 1.3), which is not surprising given that students in 4-year institutions tend to be younger and from the higher SES quartiles (see table 1.2). Less-than-2-year and 2-to 3-year institutions had proportionately more delayed entrants, reflecting their older and lower SES student populations. An imnwdiate entrant is a student who began postsecondary education within 12 months of high school completion. A delayed entrant is a student who began more than 12 months after high school.

Some of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who were not enrolled in February 1992 would have completed their educational programs, and some would have left without a degree or certificate. Attainment is discussed in chapter 2. The most important determinant of status in February 1992 was, of course, the level of the institution attended. Over 75 percent of beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in 4-year institutions in 1989-90 were still enrolled in February 1992 (figure 1.4). Of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1989-90, 45 percent were still enrolled in February 1992. This percentage might seem high given that most programs last 2 years or less, but about one-half (49 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students in 2-to 3-year.institutions were enrolled part time and therefore would 'The term unemployed infers not working and looking for employment. have been expected to take more than 2 years to complete their programs.' In addition, some may have stopped out and returned, and some may have completed their programs and enrolled in 4-year institutions for further education (see chapter 2). Of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in less-than-2-vear institutions in 1989-90, only 10 percent were enmllee. in February l992. Enrollment status varied by race-ethnicity. age. and SES hut these patterns reflect for the most part variations in the types of institutions attended by beginning postsecondary students. For exampl beginning postsecondar) stbdents who were age 23 or younger and in the top SES quartile were the most likely to be still enrolled as of February 1992, but they were also the most likely to have been enrolled in 4-year institutions in 1989-9() (table 1.4 and table 1.1). However. Asian and white, non-Hispanics were about equally likely to have enrolled in 4-year institutions in 1989 -90 (44 percent for both), hut Asians were more likely' to he enrolled in postsecondary education in February 1992 (80 percent compared with 55 percent).

Variation by type of institution attended and student characteristics are examined.' Since those enrolled in 4-year institutions would not normally be able to complete a baccalaureate degree within the survey period, the discussion of attainment focuses on the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in less-than-4-year institutions in 1989-90.\nFinancing the cost of postsecondary education may involve the use of various sources of funds:22 contributions from parents, spouses, or relatives; the student's own earnings and savings; personal loans from parents or other family members; and funds awarded through formal programs of financial aid administered by the federal and state goveinments, the institution attended, or some other foundation or organization. This chapter will examine all these aspects of financing educational costs, with a special emphasis on how the funds available through programs of financial aid were distributed among the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students. In this chapter. the term \"financial aid\" will only be used to refer to federal, state, institutional, or other programs that provide educational funds to students, primarily through grants, scholarships. and student loans?' The term \"student loan\" will refer to funds borrowed through these programs, as opposed to loans from parents or relatives. Financial assistance through contributions from parents, spouses, or relatives will be discussed separately, and this kind of assistance is not included in references to \"financial aid.\" In 1989-90, the total amount of financial aid available to all students in postsecondary education was approximately $27 billion. The federal government provided by far the largest share, including $12 billion in federally guaranteed student loans, nearly $5 billion in Pell grants, and about $3 billion through other programs. The institutions themselves (primarily private, not-for-profit institutions) awarded another $5 billion in grants and scholarships, and the states appropriated almost $2 billion in grants and scholarships. Overall, the federal government provided nearly all of the student loan funds and about half of the grant and scholarship funds available to students in postsecondary education during the academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92.24 Nearly all of the federal financial aid and most of the institutional and state funds are awarded on the basis of financial needthat is, they take into account the ability of the student and the student's family to pay in relation to.the cost of attending a particular postsecondary institution. Although some of the institutional and state funds are awarded as merit scholarships (usually based on academic or athletic achievement), the majority of students who receive financial aid must demonstrate need by filing an application that discloses family income and other relevant information about the family's circumstances. This chapter begins by describing the distribution of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students by the type of institution attended and students total cost of attendance during their first year of enrollment according to a selected set of student and institutional characteristics. This section includes a discussion of the average cost of attendance and the average amount of financial aid these students received during the 1989-90 academic year, which is the only year for which institutional data on tuition and financial aid were collected. The proportion of the students who received financial aid during the 1989-90 academic year is then described. Next, the changes that occurred in the beginning postsecondary students' participation in financial aid programs over the next 2 academic years are discussed first by presenting the percentages of enrolled,students who received financial aid in each of the following 2 years (annual participation rates), and second by showing the cumulative percentages of all the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who ever received financial aid. The next section looks at student borrowing in general, focusing not only on student loans from financial aid programs but also on borrowing from parents and others over the 3 academic years. Financial assistance from parents, spouses, and relatives (which is not included in \"financial aid\") and the reported use of personal savings are then described. The last section of this chapter examines the relationship between financial aid and persistence by comparing the proportions of aided and unaided beginning postsecondary students who had either attained a credential, were still enrolled, or had left postsecondary education by 1992."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment After 1989-90", "text": "Overall, 69 percent of the students who began their postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90 enrolled again in 1990-91, and 60 percent enrolled in 1991-92 (table 2.1). Naturally, the likelihood of students enrolling in subsequent. academic years depended On the type of institution in which they started, with students in longer programs more likely to continue their enrollment. Thus, continued enrollment is best examined by institution type. About one-half (49 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a less-than-2-year institution in 1989-90 enrolled again in 1990-91, and 15 percent enrolled in 1991-92 (figure 2.1). Although less-than-2-year institutions offer primarily short-term vocational programs that can be completed within a year, there are a number of reasons why students might have re-enrolled. First, some programs do take longer than a year to complete, and students enrolled in these programs would have reenrolled in 1990-91. Second, 12 percent of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions attended part time in 1989-90, and therefore may well have needed more than a year to finish.\" Third, some students may have left before completing their program and returned later. Finally, some of the students who enrolled in a less-than-2-year institution in 1989-90 may have completed the program they started and enrolled in another program, such as an associate's or bachelor's degree program. The group of beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a less-than-2-year institution in 1989-90 but were not enrolled in subsequent years would have included some who completed their program and some who left without a degree or certificate. (Attainment of certificates and degrees is discussed later in this chapter.) '\"All references to institution in this and succeeding chapters refer to students' \"primary\" institution. The \"primary\" institution level was the highest level of institution attended during an academic year. See appendix A for more detail.

Although most programs in this type of institution are 2 years or less, One reason that so many 1989-90 beginners were enrolled in 1991-92 (three years after entry) is that 49 percent of them began their enrollment in 1989-90 on a part-time basis.' Also, some may have stopped out and returned, and still others may have completed an associate's degree or certificate and enrolled in another program. Transfers among institution types and intensity of enrollment are discussed later in this chapter. In 1990-91, 84 percent of the beginning postsecondary students who had enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1989-90 were enrolled, and in 1991-92, 80 percent were enrolled. The drop in enrollment was greatest in the first year: 16 percent did not enroll in 1990-91, and 4 percent more (for a total of 20 percent) did not enroll in 1991-92. Among beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1989-90, those enrolled in a private, not-for-profit institution were more likely than those enrolled in a public institution to be enrolled in 1990-91 (87 percent compared with 83 percent). Many students apparently either changed or delayed their educational plans after enrolling in postsecondary education. Of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who reported in 1989-90 that they aspired to 2 or more years of college (but not a baccalaureate degree), 47 percent did not enroll for a second year in 1990-91 (figure 2.2). Many of those who aspired to a bachelor's or advanced degree left postsecondary education within a year as well: 30 percent and 19 percent, respectively, did not, enroll in 1990-91. Table 2.1 shows that the likelihood of L?,ing enrolled in 1990-91 and 1991-92 varied according to the background characteristics of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students, but much of this variation is also reflective of the types of institutions they attended. Variation in persistence and attainment by student characteristics controlling for institution level is discussed later (see table 2.6)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment by Institution Level and Control", "text": "The enrollment of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students at different types of institutions shifted over the period of the survey as students completed, stopped out, or dropped out of programs and transferred among types of institutions. Most of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who were enrolled in 1990-91 remained at the same level, and most of those who were enrolled in 1991-92 remained at the same level as the one they were in during 1990-91 (table 2.2 and figure 2.3).\" However, some transferred from one level to another, most often from a lower level to a higher level. For example, 14 percent of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1990-91 enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1991-92. Nevertheless, some transferred to a lower level institution. For instance, 7 percent of those who enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1989-90 enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution the following year, and 4 percent of the 1989-90 beginners who enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1990-91 enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1991-92. About 20 percent of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who did not enroll in 1990-91 returned the following year, primarily to 2-to 3-year institutions (12 percent returned to this type of institution). Although some students may have transferred because their aspirations changed and some may have transferred for financial or personal reasons, some also transferred because the institution they attended in 1989-90 was not the highest level that they expected to attend. For example, as shown in chapter 1 (table 1.1), 55 percent of the students who aspired to a bachelor's degree and 35 percent of those who aspired to an advanced degree when they began their postsecondary education in 1989-90 enrolled first in a 2-to 3-year institution. The majority of beginning postsecondary students enrolled in public institutions in 1989-90 (table 2.3). About three-quarters (74 percent) attended public institutions; 16 percent attended private,not-for-profit institutions; and 10 percent attended private, for-profit institutions. These proportions varied markedly by level. At the less-than-2-year level, beginning postsecondary students were concentrated in private, for-profit institutions (76 percent), and at the 2-to 3-year level, in public institutions (89 percent). At the 4-year level, more beginning postsecondary students enrolled in a public institution (69 percent) than in a private, not-for-profit One (32 percent).  Almost all of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a public institution in 1989-90 either stayed in a public institution the following year (65 percent) or left postsecondary education (32 percent). Only 1 percent transferred to a private, not-for-profit institution, and only 2 percent transferred to a private, for-profit institution. Transferring from the private, not-for-profit sector to the public sector was much more cornmon. Among those who enrolled in a private, not-for-profit institution in 1989-90, 14 percent enrolled in a public institution in 1990-91; and among those who were enrolled in a private, not-for-profit institution in 1990-91, 11 percent transferred to a public institution in 1991-92. About 20 percent of the 1989-90 beginners who did not enroll in 1990-91 enrolled again in 1991-92. Most (16 percent) enrolled in public institutions."}, {"section_title": "Intensity of Enrollment", "text": "The intensity of student enrollment affects the time it takes students to earn a degree, the likelihood of earning a credential, and the cost of postsecondary education.' For the purposes of this analySis, the measure of intensity of enrollment takes into account whether students attended full time or less than full time and whether they attended for all or only part of an academic year. The categories used to classify intensity of enrollment were \"continuous full-time,\" defined as continuous, full-time enrollment for at least 8 months during the academic year (September to May); \"other continuous,\" defined as at least 8 months of continuous enrollment, but less than full time for some or all of their attendance; and \"noncontinuous,\" a residual category that includes students who were enrolled for less than 8 months. These noncontinuous students might have been enrolled full time, part time, or a mix of full and part time. More than one-half (56 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students were enrolled continuously full time in 1989-90. Another 16 percent were enrolled continuously less than full time, and 28 percent were noncontinuously enrolled (table 2.4). This pattern varied by institution level. Among the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students, those in 4-year insiitutions were more likely than those in 2-to 3-year and less-than-2-year institutions to be enrolled continuously full time (77 percent compared with 41 percent and 28 percem., respectively). Among the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in 4-year institutions in 1989-90, those in private, not-for-profit institutions were more likely than those in public institutions to be continuous full time (82 percent compared with 75 percent). More than onehalf (57 percent) of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students in private, for-profit institutions (which offer mainly short-term vocational programs) were noncontinuously enrolled by the definition used here.

One-third of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1989-90 reported that they were enrolled in a vocational program (table 2.5). In private, for-profit institutions, however, 66 percent were in vocational programs. The percentages enrolled in academic and vocational programs varied with student characteristics. For example, those whd-aspired to an advanced degree and those who were in the top SES quartile were less likely than those with lower aspirations and from Other SES quartiles to choose a vocational program in 1989-90. Older students were more likely than younger students to choose a vocational course of study. Fifty percent of the beginning postsecondary students age 30 or older enrolled in a Vocational program in 1989-90, compared with 28 percent of those age 23 or younger."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Attainment", "text": "At the time of the first BPS followup in spring 1992, 41 percent of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students were enrolled in postsecondary education, either having been continuously enrolled or having left and returned (table 2.6). Another 18 percent. had left by that time with a degree or certificate. The rest had lefteither permanently or temporarilywithout any kind of postsecondary award. Approximately one-half of those who left without a degree or certificate left during their first year (that is, before July 1990). The 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who earned a degree or certificate and then enrolled in another postsecondary program appear in table 2.6 in the \"attained\" column, not the \"still enrolled\" column.'s Attainment was, of course, closely related to institution type. One would expect a relatively large proportion of the beginners who enrolled in a less-than-2-year institution in 1989-90 to have completed their studies, but would expect a relatively small proportion of those in 4-year institutions to have done so. That was indeed the case. Among the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a less-than-2-year institution in 1989-90, 57 percent had earned a degree or certificate by spring 1992, while among those who enrolled in a 4year institution in 1989-90, only 5 percent had done so (figure 2.4). However, it should be noted that some 4-year institutions offer certificates and degrees below a baccalaureate, and that 27 percent of the beginners who enrolled in a 4-year institution were enrolled in sThe categones shown in table 2.6 were constructed as follows: Students were first divided into those who reported that they had earned any type of postsecondary credential and those who reported they had not. Among .those who repmed that they had not earned a credential, students who were still enrolled were separated from those who were no longer enrolled. This latter group was then allocated to one of three categories based upon their last month of enrollment in postsecondary education.

Of those enrolled in associate degree programs, 14 percent had earned a postsecondary award. Among beginning postsecondary students who chose a 2-to 3year institution in 1989-90, 23 percent had earned some type of postsecondary award. The beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1989-90 were less likely than those who enrolled in a less-than-4-year institzlion to leave during the first year (table 2.6). Twelve percent left in their first year without completing, compared with 28 percent of those who started in a 2-to 3-year institution and 25 percent of those who started in a less-than-2-year institution. Variation by student characteristics could not be examined in less-than-2-year institutions because relatively few beginning postsecondary students attended less-than-2-year institutions (9 percent) and, because of the short length of most of the programs, 57 percent had completed by 1992. In 2-to 3-year institutions, 23 percent of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1989-90 had attained some postsecondary award by spring 1992, and 27 percent were still enrolled. Another 28 percent had left in the first year, and the rest left later. This pattern varied with student and institutional characteristics. For example, females were more likely than males to have earned a degree or certificate (28 percent compared with 18 percent), as were students who had received mostly As (36 percent) compared with those who had received mostly Bs and Cs or lower (5 percerlt to 18 percent). Beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in 2-to 3year public institutiols in 1989-90 were less likely to have earned a degree or certificate (20 percent) than were those who enrolled in private, not-for-profit institutions (40 percent) or private, for-profit institutions (51 percent). Age and SES affected the likelihood of leaving in the first year. Beginning postsecondary students age 30 or older were more likely than those age 23 or younger to have left postsecondary education by July 1990 (43 percent compared with 23 percent), as were those from the bottom SE1 quartile when compared with those in the top SES quartile (37 percent compared with 21 percent). The majority (62 percent) of the beginning postsecmdary students who enrolled in a 4-year institution in 1989-90 were enrolled in spring 1992.\" Twelve percent had left in their first year (before July 1990), 7 percent in their second year (before July 1991). and 14 percent during their third year (between July 1991 and spring 1992). As was true for beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a 2-to 3-year institution in 1989-90, the educational experiences of those who enrolled in a 4-year institution varied with student and institutional characteristics. Asians were more likely than white or black, non-Hispanics to he enrolled in spring 1992 (79 percent compared with 62  \nBeginning postsecondary students who received any kind of financial aid during the 3 academic years under consideration were less likely to leave postsecondary education before 1992 without completing a program and were more likely to attain a certificate or degree than those who never received any financial aid (table 3.8a and figure 3.5). Overall, nearly onehalf (48 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students who never received any financial aid left postsecondary education, compared with about one-third (35 percent) of those who did receive financial aid at some time while enrolled. In addition, beginning postsecondary studerds who received aid were more likely to attain a credential or degree than those who never received any aid (22 percent compared with 14 percent). and those who were aided were also somewhat more likely to be enrolled in postsecondary education during the spring of 1992 (43 percent compared with 39 percent). Both being enrolled and having attained a degree or other credential are positive indicators of persistence: classification in one category or the other largely depends on the duration of the programs offered by the institution and whether or not the student is .maintaining a full-time enrollment status. Regardless of the type of institution attended, the beginning postsecondary students who received financial aid had higher rates of persistence and attainment than did those who never received such aid. At the institutions offering lessthan-2-year pmgrams (which are primarily private, for-profit). 62 percent of those who received aid had attained a credential by 1992, compared with only 46 percent of the unaided. and a higher percentage of those who were unaided had left without completing a program (52 percent of the unaided compared with 36 percent of the aided). At 2-to 3-year institutions (which are primarily public community colleges), the aided beginning postsecondary students were twice as likely to have attained a degree or certificate as the unaided (33 percent compared with 16 percent), and those who were unaided were also more likely to have left prior to the spring of 1992 (55 percent of the unaided compared with 40 Figure 3.5Percentage of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who had left postsecondary education, were enrolled, or had attained a postsecondary award in February 1992, by whether they had or had not ever received financial aid percent of the aided). At 4-year institutions, on the other hand, the differences in persistence between aided and unaided beginning postsecondary students were quite small, although those who were unaided were somewhat less likely to persist. By the third year, 30 percent of the aided beginning postsecondary students had left postsecondary education at the time of the interview in 1992, compared with 35 percent of those who had never received aid. The pattern that aided beginning postsecondary students were less likely to have left postsecondary education than those who never received aid held for both males and females, for dependents and independents, and for all dependent student family income levels below $60,000. The impact of financial aid in reducing attrition among dependents with the lowest incomes was especially evident. After 3 years, about one-third (34 percent) of the dependent beginning postsecondary students with family incomes Inder $20,000 who received financial aid had left postsecondary education without attaining a credential; this was the same rate of attrition as that of the unaided from families with incomes over $60,000 (34 percent). For the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students at 2-to 3-year institutions, the effect of financial aid on the attainment of a certificate or degree by early 1992 is of special interest, and overall the effect was positive (table 3.8b). Attainment for those receiving financial aid was 33 percent compared with 16 percent for those who received no financial aid at any time. Most of the beginning postsecondary students at 2-to 3-year institutions were enrolled in public institutions (89 percent), but some attended private, for-profit (8 percent) and private, not-for-profit (3 percent) institutions (table 3.1). At the public and the private, not-for-profit institutions, those who received financial aid were more likely to have attained a credential than those who did not, while at the private, for-profit institutions there was no difference in attainment between the aided and the unaided. Among beginning postsecondary students at 2-to 3-year institutions, the overall rates of attainment for those with low and moderate incomes were about twice as high for those who received aid as for those who did not receive financial aid. This included dependents with family incomes under $20,000 (28 percent compared with 11 percent) and with family incomes of $20,000$39,999 (40 percent compared with 22 percent), as well as independents with incomes under $10,000 (38 percent compared with 14 percent) and with incomes of $10,000$19,999 (37 percent compared with 4 percent). The rates of persistence for the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who were enrolled in 4-year institutions are,kshown in table 3.8c. Since the beginning postsecondary students would not normally have completed a 4-year degree program by early 1992, the percentage enrolled at that time is especially relevant to assessing the effect of financial aid. At the 4-year public institutions, those who had received financial aid were somewhat more likely to be enrolled in 1992 than those who had received no aid (66 percent compared with 59 percent). There was no difference between the percentages of the aided and unaided who were enrolled in 1992 at the 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions (63 percent for both). The positive effect of financial aid on persistence at 4-year institutions was greatest for dependent students from low income families (under $20,000): nearly two-thirds (64 percent) who received financial aid were enrolled in 1992, compared with less than half (44 percent) of the low income dependents who never received financial aid. Moreover, aided and unaided neginning postsecondary students were equally likely to be enrolled arta 3 years regardless of tuition and fees or total cost of $4,000 or more. Financial aid therefore appears to have offset the potentially adverse effect on persistence of the higher costs of 4-year institutions.

While the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in public and private, not-for-profit institutions in 1989-90 were equally likely to be enrolled in spring 1992 (62 percent), those who selected a public institution in their first year were more likely to leave during their first year than those who chose a private, not-for-profit institution (13 percent compared with 9 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Academic and Social Integration", "text": "One of the unique strengths of BPS is the inclusion of a number of items that are related to assessing academic and social integration.'9 While most empirical studies of academic and social integration have been based on either a single institution or a limited number of institutions.

However, 16 percent aad earned an associate's degree, and 9 percent had received a certificate that took less than 2 years to complete (table 2.8). Some students appeared to have changed their goals after enrolling. Of the beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in associate's degree programs in 1989-90, 19 percent had earned an associate's degree, but another 7 percent had instead earned a less-than-2-year certificate. 2 percent had earned a 2-or 3-year vocational certificate, and 1 percent had earned a less-than-2-year license. In addition. 16 percent of those who originally entered a certificate program had earned an associate's degree instead. Some of these students may have always aspired to an associate's degree but started in a certificate program, while others may have changed their goal while enrolled. There were some gender differences in attainment. Females were more likely than males to have earned any award and were more likely to have earned an associate's degree. Twentyone percent of females had earned an associate's degree, compared with 12 percent of males. There were also differences by type of institution. Beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in a private, for-profit 2-to 3-year institution in 1989-90 were considerably more likely than those in a public or private, not-for-profit institution to earn a less-than-2-year certificate (27 percent compared with 7 percent and 9 percent, respectively).

In general, student costs were higher in public 4-year institutions than in public institutions offering less-than-4-year programs: they were also usually higher in privately controlled institutions than in public institutions. Students attending public less-than-4-year institutions were the most likely to report costs under $4,000, and those attending public 4-year institutions were the most likely to report costs of $4,000$7,999. However, those attending private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions were the most likely to report costs of $12,000 or more. In addition to the tuition and fees charged directly by the institution attended, the cost of attending a postsecondary institution includes the costs required to meet living expenses while enrolled, such as rent, food, transportation, books, and miscellaneous other personal expenses. Independent students, who often live off campus and may have dependent children to support, typically report living expenses that are higher than the amount reported by dependent students. For example, although independent students were more likely to attend public less-than-4-year institutions, which charge relatively low tuition, than were dependent students (61 percent compared with 38 percent). they were less likely to report total costs under $4,000 (17 percent of the independent students compared with 34 percent of the dependent students). As shown in table 3.2, the average total costs reported in 1989-90 hy independent students were about $3,000 higher than those reported by dependent students, both for beginning postsecondary students who received no financial aid ($8,696 compared with $5,683) and for those who were aided ($10,528 compared with $7.793). Family income was related to the level and control of the institution attended and to the students' total cost of attendance. Dependent students from families with incomes of $60,000 or more were more likely to attend public 4-year and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions than were those from families with incomes under $20,000. This pattern is also reflected in the distribution of the dependent students by their total costs. Low income (under $20,000) dependent students were more likely to have costs under $4,000 than were high income ($60,000 or more) students, while high income students were more likely to have total costs of $12,000 or more than low income students. As shown in table 3.2, the average educational costs for high income dependent students were approximately $3,000 more than for the low income dependent students ($7,143 compared with $4,325 for unaided students; $10,183 compared with $6,997 for aided students). High income dependent students also paid higher tuition and fees than low income dependents ($3,173 compared with $935 for the unaided; $6,080 compared with $3,239 for the aided), but this was not true for independent students. Among aided independent students, for example, the average tuition and fees for high income students ($20,000 or more) were about $1,400 less than for low income students (under $10,000). As shown in table 3.1, more than 40 percent of independent students with incomes of $20,000 or more reported attendance costs of $12,000 or more, even though over 70 percent of them were attending public lessthan-4-year institutions. Unlike the dependent students, higher income independent students were more likely to attend public less-than-4-year institutions than were low income independent students (71 percent compared with 52 percent). Table 3.2 shows the average tuition and.fees and total costs of attendance in 1989-90 for those beginning postsecondary students who received no financial aid in the first year of enrollment compared with those who were awarded aid. Overall, the average total cost for those students who received financial aid was about $2,200 higher than it was for those who received no aid ($8,562 compared with $6,407). Aided students had higher educational costs at all income levels than did unaided students, except for independent students with family incomes of $20,000 or more. The average total amount of aid students received was directly related to the level of tuition and fees and to their total cost of attendance. In 1989-90, the average grant or scholarship awarded to beginning postsecondary students was $2,478; the average student loan amount was $2,528; and the average total amount of financial aid awarded was $3,795. The average amount of grant and scholarship aid awarded at private, not-for-profit institutions ($4,232) was twice as much as that awarded at public or private, for-profit institutions ($1,79.1 and $1,982, respectively) . The average amount of aid and the average costs for aided students is shown by type of institution attended in Figure 3.1. The ratio of total aid to total costs is shown in the last column of table 3.2. In 1989-90, financial aid covered nearly one-half (48 percent) of the average cost of attendance for those who received financial aid, ranging from 36 percent at public less-than-4-year institutions to 56 percent at public 4-year institutions. The percentage of total costs covered by aid at 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions (54 percent) was about the same as that at 4-year public institutions."}, {"section_title": "S 0", "text": "Although the avera.cte amount of financial aid increased at each higher level of total costs, the percentage of total costs covered by the aid decreased. Aided students with total costs under $4,000 were able to cover 62 percent of their educational costs with financial aid, while those with total costs of $12,000 or more received enough aid to coveran average of 36 percent of costs. The ratio of aid to costs was inversely related to income for both dependent and independent students. For dependent students with family incomes under $20.000, financial aid covered nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of the costs of attendance, compared with 38 percent of the costs for aided students with family incomes of $60,000 or more.  The proportion of beginning postsecondary students who received financial aid in the 1989-90 academic year is shown in table 3.3a. This table includes the percentages of enrolled students who received any kind of financial aid, those who specifically received a grant or scholarship, and those who took a student loan. During their first year of enrollment, nearly one-half (45 percent) of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students received some kind of financial aid, and they were almost twice as likely to receive a grant or seholarship (38 percent) as they were to take a student loan (20 percent). The need analysis that is used to award financial aid in most programs takes into account both the student's financial circumstances and the educational costs at the postsecondary institution that the student attends. The higher the cost, the more likely it is that a student will qualify for some financial aid. The percentage of beginning postsecondary students receiving financial aid during their first year of enrollment was directly related to the level of tuition and fees in 1989-90: less than 20 percent of students who were charged under $500 in tuition and fees received any financial aid compared with more than 70 percent of those charged $4,000 or more. A direct relationship between ft level of tuition and fees and the receipt of financial aid existed for both grants and loans, but students were much more' likely to receive grants than loans at lower tuition institutions. For example, at institutions charging between $500$999 in tuition and fees in 1989-90, 31 percent of the students received grants or scholarships, but only 7 percent had student loans. There were similar direct relationships between financial aid and total educational costs. The proportion of beginning postsecondary students receiving financial aid in their first year was strongly related to the type of institution they attended. More than 70 percent of students at 4-year private, not-for-profit and at private, for-profit institutions received some financial aid, compared with 47 percent of those at public 4-year institutions and 28 percent at public less-than-4-year institutions. There was a large difference between the proportions of students attending private, not-for-profit and private, for-profit institutions who used student loans to finance their education. For example, at the 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions, 41 percent of the students took out student loans, a much smaller percentage than the 67 percent who received grants or scholarships. On the other hand, at the private, for-profit institutions, 58 percent of the students borrowed, which was virtually the same as the percentage receiving grants or scholarships at those institutions. There was an inverse relationship between family income and the receipt of financial aid among beginning postsecondary students. In 1989-90, 66 percent of the dependent students from families with incomes under $20,000 received financial aid. The percentage of dependents receiving any aid dropped in each successively higher income category to 21 percent for the students from families with incomes of $60,000 or i tore. A similar pattern existed for the awarding of grants and scholarships, but not for student loans. Dependent students in the $20,000$40,000 income category were just as likely to borrow as those with family incomes under $20,00e (26 percent and 28 percent, respectively). The receipt of financial aid in 1989-90 was also related to the enrollment patterns of the beginning postsecondary students during their first year. Those enrolled full.time for a full academic year (at least 8 months) are classified as \"continuous full-time\" students; those enrolled for a full academic year but not always full time are classified as \"other continuous\" students; those enrolled for less than 8 months, either full time or part time, are classified as \"noncontinuous\" students. Continuous full-time students were much more likely to receive any aid (53 percent) than were other continuous (part-time) students (32 percent) or noncontinuous students (38 percent). This may reflect the full-time enrollment eligibility requirement for most state and institutional grant and scholarship programs, as well as the fact that about 60 percent of the students who were not enrolled continuously full time attended the lower cost public less-than-4-year institutions (table 3.1). The percentage of beginning postsecondary students receiving financial aid in their second and third years of enrollment, which is shown in tables 3.3b and 3.3c, was about the same as that in the first year. In the 1990-91 academic year, 43 percent of the enrolled beginning postsecondary students were awarded financial aid, 33 percent with grants or scholarships and 22 percent with student loans. The percentages were similar for those enrolled in the following academic year. Because the annual financial aid award rates shown in tables 3.3a, b, and c are based on the number of enrolled students during the given academic year, the size and composition of the sample under consideration change each year. In chapter 2 it was shown that in the second year only about 70 percent of the beginning postsecondary students in the original cohort were.enrolled, while in the third year about 60 percent were enrolled."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative Proportions Ever Aided", "text": "Another measure of the amount of participation in financial aid programs is the cumulative percentage of beginning postsecondary students who were aided at any time throughout the 3 academic years. Using this approach, the denominator is all beginning postsecondary students in 1989-90 whose financial aid and enrollment status is known for all 3 academic years (95 percent of the 1989-90 bc;ginning postsecondary students). The cumulative rates will increase whenever a student receives aid for the first time in the second or third year of enrollment. Table 3.4 shows the cumulative percentage of beginning postsecondary students who had received any aid, any grants or scholarships, and any student loans at some time while enrolled. By 1992, more than one-half (55 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students had received financial aid at some time since 1989; 46 percent had received grants or scholarships; and 29 percent had received student loans. The cumulative percentages of beginning postsecondary students who had ever received aid throughout the 3 academic years varied by the level and control of the primary institution they attended (figure 3.2), which in turn reflected the distribution of educational costs shown in table 3.1. Students at 4-year private, not-for-profit or private, for-profit institutions (78 percent and 83 percent) were much more likely to ever receive any aid than those at public 4year institutions (57 percent) or those at public less-than-4-year institutions (39 percent). However, beginning postsecondary students at private, for-profit 4-year institutions were more Figure 3.2Percentage of all 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who ever received any financial aid, grants, or student loans during the academic years likely to receive student loans than those attending private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (69 percent compared with 51 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Borrowing", "text": "Although student loans from federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs were the major source of borrowed funds for the beginning postsecondary students, loans from parents and others were also an important source. During the first year of enrollment, 20 percent of the beginning postsecondary students took out loans through one of the financial aid programs, and 14 percent reported borrowing from their parents to meet educational costs (table 3.5). Dependent beginning postsecondary students were twice as likely to borrow from their parents as those who were independent (15 percent compared with 8 percent). In mid-1990, 31 percent of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students reported that they had borrowed to meet expenses for the first year of enrollment, and 26 percent reported that they still owed some amount of the loan. In early 1992, nearly one-half (49 percent) of those interviewed had borrowed during the previous 3 years, and 32 percent reported an outstanding debt. As shown in table 3.5, the percentage of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who had ever borrowed by early 1992 was directly related to the control of the institution they attended and to the cost of attendance. At the public institutions, 41 percent had borrowed some time in the 1989-92 period, while 60 percent of those attending private, notfor-profit institutions and 83 percent of those attending, private, for-profit institutions had done so. Thirty percent of beginning postsecondary students at institutions with very low tuition charging under $500 in 1989-90 had borrowed; one-half (49 percent) of those at institutions with tuition between $1,000 and $2,000 had borrowed; and 69 percent of those at high tuition institutions charging over $4,000 had borrowed. Cumulative borrowing was inversely related to family income. Dependent beginning postsecondary students with family incomes under $20,000 in 1989-90 were twice as likely to have borrowed as those with incomes of $60,000 or more (62 percent compared with 32 percent). The average amount beginning, postsecondary students had borrowed from all sources in the first year was almost $2,800; by the third year of enrollment, the average amount they had borrowed doubled to $5,700 (table 3.6). The average amount still owed by those who had an educational loan debt outstanding was $2,617 in 1991 and $5,345 in 1992. The major differences in the amount borrowed and owed hy 1992 were related to the , type of institution attended, the duration of the programs, and the cost of education. Figure  3.3 shows the average debt for educational loans from both family and nonfarnily sources by the level and control of the institution students attended in the first year of enrollment. The average amount owed in 1992 by those formerly or currently enrolled at public less-than-4year institutions was $3,271; $4,291 at. private, for-profit institutions; $5,232 at public 4-year institutions; and $8,087 at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. As shown in table 3.6, the average amount beginning.postsecondary students had borrowed was also directly related to the amount of tuition and fees charged in 1989-90 and to the total educational costs. Beginning postsecondary studenN with tuition and fee charges between $500$999 in 1989-90 had borrowed about $4,000 during the years 1991-92, while those attending institutions with tuition of $4,000 or more had borrowed nearly double that amount ($7,857)."}, {"section_title": "Assistance from the Family", "text": "The parents of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students were a major source of the funds used to meet educational costs, but there was a large difference in parental financial support by dependency status. In the first year, 73 percent of the dependent students reported assistance from parents compared with only 13 percent of the independent students; after 3 years, 87 percent of the dependent and 26 percent of the independent beginning postsecondary students reported ever receiving parental assistance to meet educational costs (table 3.7). Figure 3.3Average amount of educational loans from any source owed by  beginning postsecondary students in February 1992, by level and control of primary inStitution attended in 1989-90 As would he expected, among dependent beginning postsecondary students, the percentage who received parental assistance through 1991-92 way directly related to their parents' income. Nevertheless, more than three-quarters (77 percent) of dependents from families with incomes under $20,000 reported some parental assistance. For dependents from families with incomes of $40,000 or more, over 90 percent reported parental assistance. Independent students whose Own incomes were under $10,000 were much more likely to receive some parental financial assistance (39 percent) than were those with incomes of $10,000$20,000 (20 percent). Because the difference in the extent of parental assistance by dependency status is so large, institutions that enroll large proportions of independent students will have a lower percentage of students receiving parental assistance. Figure 3.4 shows that at 4-year institutions, where a majority of the beginning postsecondary students were dependent. nearly  90 percent received parental assistance: at less-than-2-year institutions, where the majority were independent, only one-half received parental assistance. In addition to direct (non-loan) financial assistance, about one-quarter (26 percent) of the beginning postsecondary students reported receiving a loan from their parents at some time during the 3 academic years to pay educational expenses (table 3.7). Dependents were almost twice as likely to borrow from their parents as independents (29 percent compared with 15 percent). Even though the proportions of beginning postsecondary students receiving parental assistance varied widely, there was very little difference in the proportions reporting loans from parents at various institufions by either level or control. Seventeen percent of all students (married and unmarried) reported that spouses or relatives other than parents were a source of financial assistance in their first year, and 33 percent of all beginning postsecondary students reported spouses or other relatives as a source by their third year of enrollment. Females were more likely than males to have received assistance from spouses or relatives by 1992 (36 percent compared with 29 percent), and independent beginning postsecondary students were more likely to have received such assistance than were those who were dependent (42 percent compared with 30 percent). The latter reflects the hi2her prOportion of married beginning postsecondary students among those who were independent. About one-third (36 percent) of students reported that they had used personal savings for their education in 1989-90. Twice as many dependent students as independent students used personal savings to pay for their educational costs in the first year (42 percent compared with 18 percent). By 1992, however, 86 percent of all beginning postsecondary students reported having used personal savings, including 80 percent of those who were independent. This could have included savings accumulated either before the first year or any time after beginning enrollment.."}, {"section_title": "73", "text": ",1 Table 3.6-Average amount borrowed by 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who borrowed in academic year 1989-90, the cumulative amount borrowed through academic year 1991-92, and the loan amounts still owed in 1990 and 1992, by selected student and institutional characteristics  Table 3.6-Average amount borrowed by 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who borrowed in academic year 1989-90, the cumulative amount borrowed through academic year 1?q1-92, and the loan amounts still owed in 1990 and 1992, by selected student and institutional characteristics-Continued   Table 3.7-Percentage of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who received financial assistance from their families or used their own savings to meet educational costs in academic year 1989-90, and cumulative percentage who ever received such assistance during the academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92, by selected student and institutional characteristics-Continued     Table 3.8b-Percentage distribution of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students initially enrolled in 2-to 3-year institutions who in 1992 were enrolled, had attained some postsecondary award, or had left postsecondary educath:in by whether or not they had ever received financial aid, by selected student and institutional characteristics-Continued  115 Table 3.8c-Percentage distribution of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students initially enrolled in 4-year institutions who in 1992 were enrolled, had attained some postsecondary award, or had left postsecondary education by whether or not they had ever received financial aid, by selected student and institutional characteristics-Continued "}, {"section_title": "C; Introduction", "text": "Almost 90 percent of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students worked at one time or another while enrolled in postsecondary education during the 3 academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92. Work, however, served different purposes for these students. For some, work was mainly a means to pay for postsecondary education expenses or to earn spending money. These individuals viewed their primary role in postsecondary education as that of students; work was a secondary activity. For others, work represented a more important focus in their lives, and enrollment in postsecondary education was often a way to improve job skills, enhance career opportunities, or simply further develop personal interests.. These individuals viewed their primary role in postseconddry education as that of employees, and postsecondary education was'a secondary function.

The final section presents additional information on all students who worked, as well as unemployment rates for all 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students during the 1990 and 1991 calendar years."}, {"section_title": "Working While Enrolled in Postsecondary Education and After Leaving", "text": "During the 3 academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92, 87 percent of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students worked at least some of the time they were enrolled (table 4.1). As displayed in figure 4.1, those who enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions in 1989-90 were much less likely to work than students attending 2-to 3-year or 4-year inStitutions (68 percent compared with 87 and 90 percent, respectively). Despite the strong occupational focus of most less-than-2-year institutions, this pattern probably reflects at least two factors. First, students attending less-than-2-year institutions often do so because they lack specific job skills and have not had much success in the labor market. Hence, they are less likely to find employment while enrolled. Second, students attending less-than-2-year institutions are probably more likely to devote a shorter, more concentrated time to attending school, suspending or postponing work until completion of their short-term studies. The percentage of beginning postsecondary students working while enrolled did not differ markedly between 2-to 3-year institutions and 4-year institutions. Nor was there much difference between public and private, not-for-profit institutions. Students in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile were less likely to work while enrolled than were those in the middle and high SES quartiles. This result could reflect a number of factors, including greater likelihood among low SES students of receiving financial aid, as well as the higher   concentrations of low SES students in less-than-2-year institutions (see table 1.1) where the short-term nature of attendance makes working while enrolled less likely. Of those 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who left school sometime between 1989-90 and 1991-92, 76 percent worked after leaving. Students w'io had worked while enrolled in postsecondary education were especially likely to work after leaving: 89 percent of students who had worked to pay expenses, 83 percent of students who had worked for spending money, and 94 percent of students who had considered their primary role that of an employee worked after leaving postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Students Who Work And Employees Who Study", "text": "Of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who worked while enrolled (87 percent of all students), 76 percent considered their primary role to be that of a student who worked and 24 percent considered their primary role to be that of an employee who studied (table 4.2). Among those working who considered their primary role to be a student, about two-thirds worked to pay expenses and one-third worked to earn spending money. Among students working while enrolled at less-than-2-year institutions, 50 percent considered their primary role to be an employee, compared with 37 percent at 2-to 3-year institutions and 10 percent at 4-year institutions. This pattern, of course, reflects the greater occupational focus of most of the less-than-2-year institutions7--especially the private, for-profit sectoras well as the emphasis on vocational education at many of the 2-to 3-year institutions. As one would expect, older students were much more likely to view their primary role in postsecondary education as that of an employee rather than a student. Thus, 82 percent of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students age 30 or older considered their primary role while enrolled to be an employee, compared with 17 percent of students age 23 or younger. Similarly, 64 percent of independent students who worked while enrolled considered themselves primarily employees, in contrast to 14 percent of dependent students."}, {"section_title": "Students Who Worked While Enrolled Primarily as Students", "text": "As previously noted, 76 percent of the 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who worked while enrolled considered their primary role to be that of a student.

In 1989-90, 28 percent of these students reported working 20 hours or less during a typical week; 49 percent said they worked between 21 and 35 hours; and 24 percent worked more than 35 hours (table 4.3b). As displayed in figure 4.2,1989-90 beginning postsecondary students in 4-year institutions who worked while enrolled worked fewer hours per week on average (26), than did students who enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions (30 hours) or 2-to 3-year institutions (27 hours). Students who worked while enrolled in 4-year institutions were more likely than their counterparts in 2to 3-year institutions to work no more than 20 hours per week (and were less likely to work 21 to 35 hours per week). In part, this pattern reflects the fact that beginning postsecondary students in 4-year institutions were more likely than those in 2to 3year institutions to be enrolled full time (88 percent compared with 51 percent).25 Beginning postsecondary students in less-than-2-year institutions and 4-year institutions were about equally likely to be enrolled full time (83 percent and 88 percent), but those in less-than-2year institutions were considerably less likely to work 20 hours or less per week (14 percent compared with 33 percent).

NOTE: Four-year institutions include institutions offering 4-year and higher programs.  Table 4.4 displays the types of jobs held by 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who worked at any time while enrolled primarily as students. The table summarizes the work experiences of students enrolled at any time during the 3 academic years 1989-90 through 1991-92. Although these students worked mainly to cover expenses or to earn spending money, about one-fifth held jobs that were in some way related to their course of study. Twelve percent of the students participated in cooperative programs, internships, or apprenticeshipsmore formal efforts to link classroom instruction with work-based learning. On-campus jobs were an important source of employment for students at 4-year institutions. About 4 in 10 students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions held jobs oncampus, as did 28 percent of the students enrolled in public 4-year colleges and universities. On-campus employment was a less frequent type of job for students at 2-to 3-year institutions; 11 percent of the students aaending these institutions worked on-campus. Additionally, lowest income dependent students were more likely than the highest income dependent students to-have an on-campus job. This finding is consistent with the practice at many institutions of using on-campus employment as one form of financial aid through iorkstudy programs. Females were more likely than males to have worked in a job related to their course of study (26 percent compared with 19 percent), and they were also more likely to have had at least one on-campus job (26 percent compared with 21 percent). Students who were considered independent for financial aid purposes were also more likely than those who were dependent to have held jobs related to their areas of study. About 32 percent of independent students held jobs related to their studies, compared with 22 percent of dependent students. Virtually all (95 percent) of the students who worked while enrolled primarily as students held a job off-campus during their tenure as students. Additionally, 18 percent held more than one job at a time while enrolled. Persistence and Attainment by Type of Work Experience of Those Who Worked While Primarily Enrolled as Students Table 4.5 displays information about the relationship between different types of work experience'and persistence and attainment of selected 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who worked. Among the beginning postsecondary students enrolled in 2-to 3-year institutions who worked and considered their primary role to be that of a student, 40 percent were enrolled in 1992 and 28 percent had attained some postsecondary award. The data suggest that the relationships between working and these two types of postsecondary outcomes ate complex. For example, 5 percent of students who worked 15 hours or less when enrolled in 1989-90 left before July 1990 without an award, compared with 14 percent of those who worked more than 35 hours. Similarly, 11 percent of students who worked 15 hours or less in 1989-90 left 89 between July 1990 and July 1991 without an award, compared with 18 percent of students who worked more than 35 hours per week. Finally, 42 percent of those who worked 15 hours or less in 1989-90 attained an award by spring 1992, compared with 21 percent who worked more than 35 hours. If in fact the pattern is true, it suggests that working long hours while enrolled in 2-to 3-year institutions may be incompatible with persistence and timely attainment. On the other hand, the type of job a student held, in some instances, appeared to have a positive association with attainment. For example, 37 percent of beginning postsecondary students at 2-to 3-year institutions iiho held a job related to their studies attained a postsecondary award by spring 1992, compared with 25 percent of students who also worked but not in a studies-related position. Similarly, 41 percent of students who had at least one co-op or apprentice job attained an award bY June 1992, while 26 percent of those with no co-op or apprenticeship position did so. Students who had at least one on-campus job were also appeared more likely to attain an award than were those who did not. These last two comparisons, however, were not statistically significant. With regard to students enrolled at 4-year institutions, insufficient time had passed by the time of the 1992 survey to make useful analyses of the relationship between attainment and working. Only 5 percent of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students at 4-year institutions who worked and considered their primary role as that of a student had attained some award by 1992. However, with respect to persistence, 78 percent of students with an on-campus job were enrolled in 1992, compared with 68 percent who had not worked on-campus.

Therefore, the types of institutions that older students enroll in, and the education programs in which they participate (in greater proportions than younger students), will reflect the age association with marriage and family formation.

In this table, it is apparent that among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students who had not married by February 1992, almost all (96 percent) were 23 or younger. The same was true for those who had never had a child: 94 percent were 23 or younger.

The probability of selection accounted for the probability of selecting the institution, subsampling the institutions and requesting lists of students for the four time points in the academic year, and selecting students from the lists obtained. A multiplicity adjustment was incorporated into the weight for students that attended more than one institution during the 1989-90 academic year. Weight adjustments were implemented to compensate for noiiresponse of sample institutions to the request for students lists, for nonresponse of institutions in the student record abstractions, and for nonresponse by the students themselves in the telephone survey. The final step in the weight adjustment process was a post-stratification adjustment based on the number of Pell grant recipients. Defining Weight Adjustment Cells NPSAS:90 yielded an initial set of 11,700 potential FTB students, which contained 10,566 students who had been selected as undergraduate students, and 1,134 students who were later identified as graduate or first-professional students as discussed above. The fielded BPS:90/92 sample consisted of 10,624 members. Response and eligibility status were defined for each of the 10,624 members of the fielded BPS sample as shown in table 1. Sample-based adjustment cell weighting was used to compensate for BPS nonresponse and ineligibility. Population-based adjustment cell weighting was not proposed because there were no external population totals for FTB students that were believed to be more accurate than the BPS estimates. BPS sample members were classified as eligible if they were found to satisfy all of the following conditions: (1) first-time, beginning student during the 1989-90 academic year; (2) eligible for NPSAS:90 (i.e., enrolled in a course for credit in a qualifying postsecondary institution during the 1989-90 academic year); and 3not deceased at the time of the 1992 BPS follow-up survey. Any student who was found to not satisfy any one of the above conditions was classified as ineligible for BPS. Those students for whom the eligibility determination process could not be completed were classified as having undetermined eligibility status. BPS sample members were classified as respondents if they completed at least one question beyond those needed to determine eligibility status. Becatracing students and determining their eligibility for BPS was a complex process and bf -use the response rule was quite liberal, most of the BPS nonrespondents were sample students whose eligibility status could not be determined. The distribution of students with known eligibility status at the conclusion of BPS data collection (eligible or ineligible) is shown in table B.1. Thus, the unweighted percent of the BPS sample who were respondents for eligibility determination was 85.4 percent (61.5 percent eligibles plus 23.9 percent ineligibles). The weighted percent responding at this phase of data collection (i.e., the estimated percent of the population represented by the sample of students for whom eligibility could be determined using the BPS procedures) was 85.8 percent. Both the weighted and unweighted percentages of respondents among the sample students known to be eligible for BPS were 99.7 percent. Therefore, the weighted and unweighted BPS tesponse rates (products of the above response rates for eligibility determination and BPS interviewing) were 85.5 percent and 85.2 percent, respectively. Since nonresponse occurs primarily at the stage of eligibility determination, that was the focus of the nonresponse adjustments. Because BPS nonresponse occurs at two stagesdetermination of eligibility and survey response among those who were eligibleweight adjustments for nonresponse were implemented in two corresponding stages. Since over 99 percent of students who were determined to be. eligible were also classified as respondents, the adjustment for nonresponse 2 2 ; 166 among students known to be eligible was a single overall weight adjustment.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors arise because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations.

Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students and institutions refused to participate, and some students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpretation of questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors in collecting, processing, sampling, and estimating missing data. The accuracy of a survey result is determined by the effect of sampling and nonsampling errors.

Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex threestep procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level.

This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates for columns are not independent (for example, when comparing the percentages of students across a percent distribution such as those in different age groups), a covariance term is added to the denominator of the t-test formula. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, large t statistics appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a.large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison is that, when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable (for example, different levels of income), the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability of error for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together must be applied. 35The BPS sample is also not a simple random sample; therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling crror cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.
