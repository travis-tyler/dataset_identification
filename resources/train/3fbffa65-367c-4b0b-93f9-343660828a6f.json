Many studies have been published that examine the extent, nature, policies, learning outcomes, and other issues associated with online instruction. While much of this literature focuses specifically on postsecondary education with approximately three million students presently enrolled in fully online courses [1], not as much has been published about students enrolled in fully online and blended courses in primary and secondary schools. This is one of the first studies to collect data on and to compare fully online and blended learning in K-12 schools. The purpose of this study was to explore the nature of online learning in K-12 schools and to establish base data for more extensive future studies. Issues related to planning, operational difficulties, and online learning providers were also examined. This study does not necessarily answer all of the issues raised but hopefully will promote further discussion and study of them."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "On November 9, 2006, the Sloan Consortium issued its fourth annual report on the extent of online learning in American colleges and universities [1] . Based on a national survey, this report provided information on student enrollments, operational concerns, and planning issues as seen through the eyes of chief academic officers. The report confidently estimates that 3 million students are registered for fully online courses in colleges and universities. An online course was defined \"as 80 percent of the course is delivered online.\" The chief academic officers to whom the survey was sent also reported that online learning was becoming a \"critical\" part of their long-term planning strategies. This was true especially for those in public colleges and universities where student access to an education is a critical part of their mission.\nEarlier in 2006, on March 17th, Penn State University hosted the Sloan K-12 Higher Education Collaboration in Online Learning, a meeting that was held at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in Washington, DC. Thirty-five individuals were invited to discuss issues related to collaboration in online learning between K-12 schools and colleges and universities. All of the individuals invited had experience or expertise in online learning and represented a wide spectrum of K-12 schools, colleges and online learning providers. While the discussions during this meeting were rich in possibilities for collaboration, the need for more data on online learning in K-12 schools became increasingly apparent. While estimates were discussed, concerns were expressed that hard data were not readily available and that the last major national study done by the U.S. Department of Education that focused on generic distance education, was based on data that were four years old.\nThere are a number of underlying reasons why these data are not available. First, there are minimal if any requirements in many states to collect data on their online students. A number of states have not established any specific guidelines or data collection processes for online students, and those policies that do exist, are inconsistent. Watson, in a study of state policies on online learning in 2005, observed that many \"state policymakers have moved \u2026 slowly\" [2, p. 10] .\nSecond, there is some confusion related to definitions of online learning and distance education. Distance education is not equivalent to online learning. Other instructional modalities not directly related to the Internet, such as videoconferencing and televised courses, are still quite popular in many areas of the country. Furthermore, within the online environment, definitions and terms such as \"fully online\", \"blended courses\", \"virtual courses\", \"e-learning\", \"hybrid courses\", \"mixed-mode\", \"asynchronous learning\", \"distributed learning\", \"Web-facilitated\", and \"Web-enhanced learning\" abound; contributing to confusion among many educators. Problems of definition are not new especially when dealing with rapidly evolving instructional technologies.\nThe Sloan-C study conducted by Allen & Seaman [1] distinguished and defined three types of online courses:\nOnline -Course where most or all of the content is delivered online. Defined as at least 80% of seat time being replaced by online activity. Blended/Hybrid -Course that blends online and face-to-face delivery. Substantial proportion (30 to 79%) of the content is delivered online. Web-Facilitated -Course that uses web-based technology (1 to 29% of the content is delivered online) to facilitate what is essentially a face-to-face course [1] .\nThese definitions meet the needs of the Sloan Consortium study well, where consistency of terminology is absolutely essential to ensure the data collected reflect the same activities from year to year.\nFor research and data collection in K-12 schools, similar definitions need to be discussed and established. Without clearly defined terms, activities that can be considered online learning can significantly overlap and might confuse serious study, rather than add to our knowledge. For example, a high school student enrolled in a fully online Advanced Placement English course at a nearby college and another student who does a Webquest as a research assignment in a history course that meets face-to-face might both be engaged in online learning, yet their learning activities are significantly different. Using the definitions established by Allen & Seaman, the former scenario qualifies as a fully online course with student and teacher physically separated and minimally, if ever, meeting face-to-face; the latter would be considered a Web-enhanced course with student and teacher meeting in a regular classroom, as would any other faceto-face course. Unfortunately, generally accepted definitions have not been established.\nThird, some of the difficulty in data collection can also be attributed to the significant growth in the number of public, private and for-profit providers of online services, many of which operate outside of the traditional school district structure. These include:\n\u2022 Other school districts that provide online learning courses While the growth in online learning providers is indicative of the popularity of online learning, it complicates the collection of accurate data by moving students partially or fully outside the school district for educational services. It also allows online learning providers to operate across state lines. In some cases, where the school district pays for the services, it is acutely aware of which students are enrolled. In other cases, school districts have little if any knowledge of the number of students taking advantage of online learning from an outside provider. During a follow-up telephone discussion to the present study with one high school principal, he indicated that his school district administration has no mechanism in place for collecting data on online students.\nFourth, the home schooling movement is alive, well and growing and operates almost as a \"subculture\" with minimum oversight other than meeting compulsory attendance regulations. [4] Many home schoolers use online service providers for a portion of their course work without any need to report same to any educational agency or authority. The data on this population of online students is perhaps the least known of any K-12 population.\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the nature of online learning in K-12 schools and to establish base data for more extensive future studies. Issues related to planning, operational difficulties, and online learning providers were examined. This study will not necessarily resolve all of the issues raised but will hopefully promote further discussion of them."}, {"section_title": "II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE", "text": "Berge and Clark provide an appropriate starting point for examining issues related to online learning in K-12 schools [5] . Their book, Virtual Schools: Planning for Success, contains a number of important chapters identifying case studies, best practices, and important planning issues related to K-12 online learning. However, on page one, the authors referred to a study done in 2001 by one of the authors [6] that estimated K-12 online learning at 40,000 to 50,000 students. In all likelihood, by 2005 when the Berge and Clark book was published, this enrollment estimate was too low but exemplified the paucity of research and the need for more accurate and timely data. The authors recommended that a national survey be conducted of K-12 schools. The authors also referred to a pending report by the U.S. Department of Education that might shed more light on K-12 online learning.\nWatson, in a national study of state policies on K-12 online learning conducted in 2005 reported that a number of states had not formally established policies on online learning. Furthermore, while there had been explosive growth in online learning, \"relatively little was known about the [K-12] programs that conducted online learning.\" [2, p. 10] .\nIn 2005, the U.S. Department of Education [7] issued the first comprehensive examination of distance education in the K-12 schools, entitled Distance Education Courses for Public Elementary and Secondary School Students: 2002-03 . This report, referred to by Berge and Clark above, was based on data collected during the 2002-2003 academic year and reported that one-third (36%) of public school districts and nine percent of public schools had students enrolled in distance education courses in 2002-03. In this study, distance education referred to courses taken for credit and offered to elementary and secondary school students where the teacher and student are in different locations. It included any technology or modality for delivering distance education to K-12 schools and did not concentrate exclusively on online learning. Questionnaires for the survey on which the report was based were mailed to a representative sample of 2,305 public school districts in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The findings in the report were organized under: distance education for public school students; technologies used for delivering distance education courses; entities delivering distance education courses; reasons for having distance education courses; and future expansion of distance education courses. Key findings from the survey included:\n\u2022 A greater proportion of large districts than medium or small districts had students enrolled in distance education courses (50% vs. 32% and 37%, respectively). In addition, a greater proportion of districts located in rural areas than in suburban or urban areas indicated that they had students enrolled in distance education courses (46% compared with 28% and 23%, respectively).\n\u2022 The percentage of schools with students enrolled in distance education courses varied substantially by the instructional level of the school. Overall, 38 percent of public high schools offered distance education courses, compared with 20 percent of combined or ungraded schools, 4 percent of middle or junior high schools, and fewer than 1 percent of elementary schools.\n\u2022 In 2002-03, there were an estimated 328,000 enrollments in distance education courses among students regularly enrolled in public school districts. Students enrolled in multiple courses were counted for each course taken. Thus, enrollments may include duplicated counts of students.\n\u2022 Of the total enrollments in distance education courses, 68 percent were in high schools, 29 percent were in combined or ungraded schools, 2 percent were in middle or junior high schools, and 1 percent were in elementary schools.\n\u2022 There were an estimated 45,300 enrollments in Advanced Placement or college-level courses offered through distance education in 2002-03. This represents 14 percent of the total enrollments in distance education.\n\u2022 The proportion of all distance education enrollments that are in Advanced Placement or college-level distance education courses is greater in small districts compared to medium or large districts (24% vs. 10% and 7%, respectively).\n\u2022 When asked which technology was used to deliver the greatest number of distance education courses, 49 percent of districts reported two-way interactive video, more than any other technology.\n\u2022 Of those districts with students enrolled in distance education courses in 2002-03, about half (48%) had students enrolled in distance education courses delivered by a postsecondary institution. Thirty-four percent of districts had students enrolled in distance education courses delivered by another local school district, or schools in other districts, within their state.\n\u2022 Seventy-two percent of districts with students enrolled in distance education courses planned to expand their distance education courses in the future.\n\u2022 Thirty-six percent of districts that were planning to expand their distance education courses selected course development and/or purchasing costs as a major factor preventing their expansion [7] .\nApproximately 50 percent of the total distance education course enrollments of 328,000 or 164,000 were Internet-based or online. However, because students might be taking courses in multiple or mixed modalities, the actual estimates cannot be considered exact. Also because the data collected were based on course enrollments and not on students enrolled, it is likely that the number of students enrolled in K-12 online courses was substantially lower. The rationale is that a student who takes a full academic program online might be enrolled in multiple and as many as six courses in a semester. While accurate as a course enrollment estimate, these data are not equivalent to the number of students enrolled in online learning.\nBased in part on the U.S. Department of Education data reported above as well as several other studies, Smith, Clark, and Blomeyer projected that K-12 online enrollments would be as high as 600,000 students in 2005 [8] . They indicated that this number was an estimate based on other studies and not on primary data that they had collected. Compared to the 164,000 online course enrollments reported by the U.S. Department of Education for 2002-2003 [7] , this estimate seems high but it is not necessarily inaccurate.\nAnother report in Education Week in 2006 estimated the number of online enrollments at more than one million students based on reports from The Peak Group and WestEd [9] . This estimate also seems high as compared to the U.S. Department of Education data for 2002-2003. Smith, Clark, & Blomeyer aptly concluded that there were significant barriers to research on K-12 online learning, the first of which was limited access to accurate and timely data [8] .\nWhile student outcomes are not the specific foci of this study, one major study by Cavanaugh, Gillan, Kromey, Hess, & Blomeyer [10] is worth mentioning. They completed a meta-analysis of fourteen studies focusing specifically on student outcomes. Their conclusion was: Students can experience similar levels of academic success while learning using telecommunications and learning in classroom settings. While distance learning as it is practiced in today's virtual schools uses technology that is less than ten years old and advances rapidly, the literature has shown that a student's education online can be as effective as it is in a classroom,\u2026\nThe result shows variation in the degree of success students have experienced, and a need for more information if firm conclusions are to be drawn. [10, p. 21-22 ].\nThe findings in Cavanaugh et al. were similar to other studies conducted on online learning in both K-12 and higher education in which \"no significant difference\" was found in student learning in online courses versus face-to-face courses. It would appear that a body of research is developing on student performance in individual, case study online courses while research on broader issues of the nature of online learning in the larger K-12 universe is less available.\nAs a conclusion to this review of the literature, the present researchers believe that a study that looks at issues across a broad spectrum of K-12 education will be useful in understanding how online learning is being deployed and more importantly perceived by chief school administrators as a viable option for delivering instruction."}, {"section_title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "text": "This study of K-12 instruction used descriptive analysis relying extensively on a survey instrument (see Appendix A) designed specifically for the project. The instrument was patterned after a similar instrument used by The Sloan Consortium to conduct national surveys of chief academic officers in American colleges and universities. Follow up telephone discussions were also conducted with selected respondents in an attempt to verify and gain further insights into what was reported on the survey. This survey was conducted for the 2005-2006 academic year.\nThe \"universe of interest\" for this study included all public school districts in the United States that operate schools (16,098). Information on these districts was taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD) from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ccddata.asp).\nThe study used three outreach efforts: 1. A postcard invitation to participate in the survey was sent to a random sample of 7,700 school districts using the postal mailing addresses in the federal data. Each post card contained a brief description of the survey, a URL where they the survey could be completed and a unique Survey ID number for the respondent to use to activate their survey form. 2. An email invitation was sent to randomly selected school districts using a commercial source for email addresses. The commercial source was able to provide email addresses for approximately one-half of all the school districts. A reminder email message was sent two weeks after the first message. Both the invitation and the reminder message contained a unique URL that, when clicked, would open up the survey form in a web browser and pass the unique survey ID. 3. Approximately 1,200 randomly-selected school districts were sent a paper copy of a letter of invitation along with a paper copy of the survey form and a business reply envelope. These respondents were also presented with a web-based option to respond. Both the paper and web-based version of the survey contained a unique survey identification number.\nAll potential respondents were informed of the funding source for the study (the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation), who was conducting it (\"researchers at Hunter and Babson Colleges\") and that \"All responses will be held in strictest confidence and at no time will districts or respondents be identified by name.\" The survey form was composed of two portions, one that applied to all respondents and a second section to be completed only by those districts with online or blended course offerings. The invitation letter and the survey form itself were carefully worded to encourage responses from all school district representatives, regardless of whether they were involved with online learning or not.\nAll data collected were entered into an online database, either directly by the respondent or, in the case of paper-based responses, by the researchers. Each entry included the unique survey ID number that was used to link the response to the description data of that school district contained in the Education's National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data. The data linked from this source included location information (city, town, state, urban/rural), the grade range in the district, the number of students in the district, and the number of teachers in the district.\nAll data were investigated for missing or out of range values. All missing data were coded as either structural missing (the question did not apply to the respondent) or as non-response missing (the question did apply, but the respondent did not provide any data). After the survey data were merged with the CCD data, cleaned, and all missing value codes added, they were input into the SPSS statistical package for analysis.\nThe analysis data set contains 366 records (N=366), representing 2 percent of all school districts of interest. Responses were received from school districts in forty-four states.\nThe major research questions that guided this study were: 1. What is the nature and extent of online and blended learning in K-12 schools in the United States? 2. What is the perceived importance of online and blended learning for K-12 school programs? 3. What are the issues and barriers that impede the development of online and blended learning in K-12 schools? 4. Who are the major providers of online and blended learning courses to K-12 schools?\nIn conducting this survey, it was determined that there needed to be a separation of online from blended learning courses. In the absence of any standard definitions for online and blended learning, the definitions used by Allen & Seaman for the Sloan Consortium studies of American higher education were adopted, namely:\nOnline -courses where most or all of the content is delivered online. Defined as at least 80% of seat time being replaced by online activity. Blended/Hybrid -courses that blends online and face-to-face delivery where a substantial proportion (30 to 79%) of the content is delivered online.\nThe separation of online and blended courses is important and distinguishes this study from the research previously cited that focused specifically on generic distance education or fully online learning."}, {"section_title": "IV. FINDINGS A. Respondent Characteristics", "text": "The population that participated in this survey represents a cross section of American K-12 education. Three hundred and sixty-six (N=366) out of a total universe of 16,000 school districts in the United States responded to this survey. The school districts responding represent approximately 3,632 schools, 2 million students, and 67,000 FTE teachers from every region (New England, Middle Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, North Central, Southwest, Mountain, and West Coast) of the country. The locale of these school districts is presented in Table 1 . Definitions of these locales are based on the U.S. Department of Education National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) codes (see Appendix B for definitions). Table 2A shows that 57.9 percent of the school districts reporting had at least one student who had taken an online course in [2005] [2006] . It also shows that an additional 24.5 percent of those which did not have any students enrolled in an online class planned to have at least one student take an online course within the next three years. Table 2B indicates that 32.4 percent of the school districts reporting had at least one student take a blended course. It also indicates that an additional 27.1 percent of those which did not have any students enrolled in a blended course planned to have at least one student take a blended course within the next three years. Nearly two thirds of all districts (63.1%) currently have students taking either online or blended courses with another 20.7 percent planning to introduce them over the next three years. These data clearly reflect that the majority of American school districts are providing some form of online learning for their students and many more plan to do so within the next three years. As a follow-up question to the above, respondents in school districts already enrolling students in online or blended courses were asked if they anticipated growth in enrollments over the next two years. A majority of the respondents anticipated growth (60.1% of districts expect growth in their fully online course enrollments and 66.0% expect growth in their blended enrollments). Districts predict that the number of students taking online courses will grow by 18.6 percent and those taking blended courses will grow by 22.9 percent over the next two years. Table 3 shows the grade levels of the students taking online courses as categorized by fully online and blended/hybrid courses. Not surprisingly, the data show that much higher percentages of students are enrolled in online courses in the upper levels with the majority at the high school level. An important goal of this study was to estimate the number of K-12 students enrolled in online learning and to help establish baseline data through comparisons with other research. The respondents in this study reported that the total number of students enrolled in fully online courses was 17,349 and the total number of students enrolled in blended courses was 11,093 for a grand total of 28,442 students. An extrapolation of these figures estimates that approximately 700,000 students for the entire population of 48,000,000 public school students were enrolled in online and blended learning courses. This figure is close to the projected 600,000 students enrolled in online courses for 2005 made by Smith, Clark, and Blomeyer [8] . Based on the data collected in this study for 2005-2006 and the Smith, Clark, and Blomeyer study for 2005, an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 K-12 public school students were enrolled in online learning for [2005] [2006] . It is likely that the higher figure is more accurate given that the data in this study is more current and extends into 2006, a year longer than Smith, Clark, and Blomeyer. A caution needs to be mentioned regarding this estimate. This estimate is based on data collected from public schools only. Approximately six million private school students and one million home-schooled students were not included in the sample. This would indicate that the number may be higher but determining to what extant is beyond the scope of this study."}, {"section_title": "Frequency Percent", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B.

A number of funding issues were expressed especially in districts where limited available resources would have to flow out of the district to pay for online courses."}, {"section_title": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": "A. Online Learning: Will the Growth Continue?\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this study, Berge and Clark cited an estimate of 40,000 to 50,000 students enrolled in online courses in 2001 [5] . Data collected in this study and supported by an estimate by Smith, Clark and Blomeyer [8] put the number of students at closer to 700,000 for [2005] [2006] . These data indicate that online learning in K-12 schools has increased more than tenfold in six years. Furthermore, data collected from the respondents in this study indicate that the growth will be sustained. The majority of school districts now offering online learning options to their students anticipate growth over the next three years, while those not currently offering online learning options to their students state that they will likely do so in the next three years. This growth pattern mimics the experiences in higher education which became more involved in online learning a good five to six years before K-12 schools. Approximately three million students or almost 20 percent of the total higher education population were enrolled in online courses in 2005-2006 [1] , almost double the number reported in 2002. If this pattern were duplicated in K-12 over the next five or six years, the enrollment in online courses would easily approach several million students.\nThere are, however, issues reported in the findings of this study that will slow growth but not necessarily impede it completely. Concerns about the quality of online courses, costs, and teacher development are important but resolvable. These same issues exist in higher education where they have been and continue to be addressed. Online technology is permeating American society beyond commercial endeavors. Hospitals, governmental agencies, and higher education are rapidly retooling their services to take advantage of online technology in all aspects of their enterprises. Undergraduates in most colleges and universities will probably experience at least one online or blended course by the time they finish their programs. Graduate and professional development programs including those sponsored by labor unions and professional organizations such as the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association are increasingly making use of online learning. Every indication is that once committed to online instruction, these organizations will continue its expansion to meet the needs of students who are either geographically dispersed or constrained by time because of family or professional commitments.\nAdditionally, major policy changes in federal, state and local education governing bodies can influence and perhaps accelerate online learning in K-12 schools. The federal government and specifically the U.S. Department of Education has been enthusiastic in its support regarding online learning. The National Education Technology Plan (2004) congratulates best practices in online learning among the states and observes:\nAbout 25 percent of all K-12 public schools now offer some form of e-learning or virtual school instruction. Within the next decade every state and most schools will be doing so [11, p. 34] .\nThis report trumpeted \"we may well be on our way to a golden age\" in American education because of the infusion of technology including online learning into primary and secondary schools.\nAs reported by one respondent in this study, the state of Michigan in 2006 passed the new Michigan Merit Curriculum that requires all high school graduates either to complete a fully online course or to have online learning substantially integrated into their basic high school coursework (e.g., blended learning). A number of states such as Florida, Kentucky, and Illinois have funded and established statewide virtual schools designed to meet the needs of large numbers of students. The Florida Virtual School founded in 1997 enrolled more than 31,000 students in 2005-2006 [12] . State governing bodies have also tried to develop equitable funding formulae usually through subsidies that allow school districts throughout the state to enroll their students in these virtual schools at reasonable tuition rates. These arrangements, however, have not been perfect and as respondents in this study have indicated, there needs to be further work in many states on the way school districts receive funding and pay tuition for online students.\nLarge school districts and school district consortia likewise are beginning new virtual school initiatives to serve students in their own districts or regionally. Clark County which includes Las Vegas, Nevada, for instance, established the Clark County School District (CCSD) Virtual High School (VHS) in 2004, which evolved from the Clark County Distance Education Program [13] . Other school districts and regional consortia with established distance education programs are likewise considering whether and how to reorganize themselves in light of the ubiquity of online communications in schools, homes, and places of business. Many of these will likely formally reorganize into virtual schools or at least substantively change their current distance education programs to online formats.\nBefore concluding this section on enrollment growth in K-12 online learning another brief mention regarding home-schooled students is in order. The U.S. Department of Education estimated that approximately 1.1 million students in the United States are home-schooled and that this number is growing [14] . Many states have little if any data on these students but it is likely that some of them are doing course work online. No attempt was made in this study to collect data on the home-schooled population and the estimates provided would likely increase if this population were considered."}, {"section_title": "B. The Needs of Small Rural School Districts -Lessons for Other Districts?", "text": "Perhaps the voices heard most clearly in this survey were those of respondents representing small rural school districts. For them, the availability of online learning is most important in order to provide students with course choices and in some cases, the basic courses that should be part of every curriculum. Shortages of teachers in high-demand secondary school subject areas such as science, mathematics, and foreign languages have historically been a serious problem for rural school districts. While the data analysis of questions in this study dealing with participation in and plans for developing online learning did not indicate any major differences on the part of rural school districts versus other districts (urban, suburban, large towns), a review of the respondents' comments provided a consistent voice expressing the needs of these districts.\nRural school districts, because of modest property tax bases, generally have the lowest per pupil expenditures compared to urban and suburban districts and need to use financial resources as wisely and effectively as possible. Online learning not only provides many more options for these districts in terms of being able to offer courses where teacher shortages might exist but also does so in a way they see as affordable. In addition, small rural districts have smaller student populations so if they are able to find teachers in high demand subjects, the small number of students that might enroll in their courses would result in very low student to teacher ratios and hence higher per course costs. Online learning provides these districts with a cost beneficial method of providing courses for students that otherwise would require the hiring of teachers who would not have enough students to justify their salaries. This would be particularly true for electives and enrichment subjects and perhaps for required courses as well in some situations.\nThe online approach to teacher shortages in small rural districts may be an example that other districts with similar teacher shortages might want to consider. Inner city urban districts, for instance, frequently have difficulty attracting and keeping secondary school teachers in science, mathematics, and foreign languages. One common approach to solving this problem has been to have teachers work out of license; teachers who are credentialed in other subject areas such as social studies or language arts teach science and mathematics. Might not an online course where some, if not all, of the content could be taught by credentialed science and mathematics educators be a viable option? A blended course might be particularly appealing where an online teacher credentialed in the subject area would work with a face-toface teacher not credentialed in the subject area. The two teachers could then work with and support each other: one delivering specialized online content and the other face-to-face instruction, tutoring, and handson activities. Online learning provides options for all school districts to consider as they try to meet best the needs of their students."}, {"section_title": "C. Online or Blended: Which Way Do We Go?", "text": "The data in this study indicate that fully online courses are more popular in terms of enrollment than blended courses. The results also indicate that many school districts continue to have concerns about quality, student readiness, and staff development related to online education. It may be that blended instruction is a better option for districts with these concerns. In an interview, Julie Young, the founder and president of the Florida Virtual School, when asked about her vision for the future of her school and online learning, commented: \"Within five years, there will be lots of blended models such as students going to school two days a week, and working at home three days a week. Another blended model \u2026 is where a student takes five [face-to-face] courses at school and two virtual courses\u2026\" [15] .\nThe data in this study indicate that respondents perceive that students need to be ready and \"more disciplined\" to succeed in online courses. Even in higher education, the readiness of students to participate and succeed in an online course has been well-established as a concern. In K-12 schools, especially at the primary and middle school level, the social and emotional development of students is an important aspect of the overall school experiences, so student readiness is legitimately of equal if not of greater concern. A blended approach can ease this concern by providing some face-to-face time.\nA focus on blended courses can also ease the process of converting courses to online for those districts that choose to create and deliver their own offerings. Converting a single high school or middle school course into a fully online format is a substantial task for a novice. However, moving portions of a course from face-to-face to online, by starting with a small module and then moving on to the next, is a standard course development approach that can ease the development process for the teacher. Professional development might also be easier and more palatable for teachers who can begin to use online learning in a blended approach that provides them an initial comfort zone of some face-to-face contact with students."}, {"section_title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "The purpose of this study was to explore the nature of online learning in K-12 schools and to establish base data for more extensive future studies. Issues related to planning, operational concerns, and online learning providers were examined. In line with most research dealing with relatively new and ever changing technology, this study adds a little more to our collective knowledge about online learning in the K-12 environment while not necessarily providing definitive answers to key questions. However, much of the data collected and analyzed in this study supports existing research indicating that online learning has been growing in K-12 schools and that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future. A comparison was made to higher education where data are more prevalent and trends have been followed for a number of years. If K-12 follows the pattern of enrollment growth in higher education, it is quite possible that online learning will emerge as a substantial component in K-12 schools, especially at the secondary level. In examining this potential, small rural schools may be providing important experiences for school districts in other localities, especially those that are facing severe teacher shortages. It is also possible that the blended model may prove to be attractive to K-12 schools, especially those that are struggling with issues of online learning quality, student readiness, and teacher professional development. Finally, online learning is not one thing but comes in various shapes and sizes. This study attempted throughout to differentiate fully online and blended learning in order to provide a more refined model for future research."}, {"section_title": "VIII.
