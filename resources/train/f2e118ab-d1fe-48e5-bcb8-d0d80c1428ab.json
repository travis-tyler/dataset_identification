[{"section_title": "", "text": "This Issue Brief assesses how many international Ph.D. graduates intend to stay in the United States after completing their degrees, and how these intentions differ across fields and nationalities. All analysis is based on data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates, an annual census of all Ph.D. graduates from U.S. universities (see Box 1). Past studies show that intention-to-stay rates, the focus of this paper, correlate strongly with actual stay rates. The results speak to recent debates about the continued ability of the United States to attract and retain global talent. Many fear that an increase in international competition is eroding the country's talent and innovation assets. 1 Chinese students feature especially prominently in these debates due to concerns about technology transfer, and a widespread perception exists of a \"reverse brain drain\" of Chinese citizens leaving the United States. 2 We find little evidence of decreasing U.S. attractiveness either among international Ph.D. students in general or among Chinese students specifically. Instead, we find that: \u2022 International students account for a large portion of U.S. STEM Ph.D. graduates, with large variation across fields. International graduates are most numerous in computer science and engineering (around 60 percent) and least numerous in the health and biological sciences (below 30 percent). In nearly all STEM fields, the proportion of graduates who are international remained constant or decreased slightly between 2010 and 2017. \u2022 Intention-to-stay rates among international Ph.D. graduates are 70 percent or higher in all STEM fields. They are highest-between 85 and 90 percent-in computer science, biology, and engineering. Across all STEM fields, intention-to-stay rates either held steady or increased slightly between 2000 and 2017. \u2022 Intention-to-stay rates are highest-above 85 percent-among students from Iran, India, and China. Students from richer countries, such as European Union member states and Canada, intend to stay at lower rates (around 75 percent). Intention-to-stay rates increased for students from most countries of origin between 2000 and 2017. \u2022 The two most common countries of origin among international Ph.D. graduates are China and India. Looking closely at these graduates, we find that: \u25cb Among graduates from China, engineering (40 percent) and the physical sciences (20 percent) are the most popular fields of study. In these and most other STEM fields, intention-to-stay rates were around 85 to 90 percent in 2017. Rates declined somewhat in the 2000-2010 period, but mostly remained constant between 2010 and 2017. \u25cb Among graduates from India, engineering (40 percent) and the biological and health sciences (cumulatively 30 percent) are the most popular fields of study. In these and most other STEM fields intention-to-stay rates were between 85 and 95 percent in 2017, with little change between 2000 and 2017. Further relevant information about the SED and the data reported here is discussed in the \"Data Notes\" at the end of this Brief. The NSF also has extensive documentation for the SED available on its website, including a copy of the full survey and an annual report with detailed data tables. 4 International Ph.D. Graduates in U.S. STEM Fields This Brief focuses on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Following SED classifications, we distinguish between seven broad STEM fields: Agricultural Sciences/National Resources (\"Agriculture\"), the Biological/Biomedical Sciences, Computer and Information Sciences (\"Computer Science\"), Engineering, Health Sciences, Mathematics, and the Physical Sciences. Each of these fields encompasses between four and 40 \"fine fields,\" for example nuclear physics within the physical sciences. We exclude fields within the humanities and social sciences, and professional degrees such as business and education. 5  Source: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates.

Intention-to-stay rates are measured by respondents' answers to the SED question \"where do you intend to live in the year after graduation?\" Response rates for this question average around 92 percent (see the \"Data Notes\" section at the end of the paper). 6 The survey is typically taken by Ph.D. students either in the final semester before graduation or soon after graduation, meaning most respondents will be relatively certain about their post-graduation positions. Nonetheless, respondents may change plans between completing the survey and graduating because the question is prospective. Statistics on intention-to-stay rates correlate strongly with statistics on actual stay rates available from other data sources. For example, one study tracking Ph.D. graduates five and ten years after graduation found that Chinese and Indian graduates have among the highest long-term stay rates (both around 85 percent). 7 Chinese and Indian graduates also have higher intention-tostay rates than those from most other countries, and their levels correspond closely to actual stay rates. 8 Intention-to-Stay Rates by STEM Field Figure 2 shows intention-to-stay rates across the seven broad STEM fields between 2010 and 2017. In 2017, rates were highest in Computer Science (87 percent), the Biological/Biomedical Sciences (86 percent), and Engineering (85 percent), followed by the Physical Sciences (81 percent), Mathematics (79 percent), the Health Sciences (73 percent), and Agriculture (69 percent). Notably, between 2000 and 2017, intention-to-stay rates either held steady or increased slightly across all seven STEM fields. Intention-to-Stay Rates by Nationality Table 2 shows the number of STEM graduates and their intention-to-stay rates by country of origin (in descending order of the most common countries of origin). Graduates from China, India, and Iran have the highest intention-tostay rates (around or above 90 percent), while graduates from the European Union, Canada, Turkey, and elsewhere are lower (historically at around 65 to 75 percent). 9 Over time, intention-to-stay rates have increased or held steady for most countries, with China as an exception. There are also notable cross-country differences in how many STEM Ph.D.s enroll and graduate. Whereas the number of domestic graduates and those from China and Iran steadily increased over time, the number of students from other countries or regions listed in Table 2 have mostly remained flat or even decreased somewhat. "}, {"section_title": "Intention-to-Stay Rates by Nationality and STEM Field", "text": "Given their countries' relatively large percentage of total graduates, this section assesses trends among Chinese and Indian Ph.D. graduates, looking at numbers and intention-to-stay rates across STEM fields. The number of Chinese graduates is especially high, and has increased steadily since the turn of the century (Figure 3). Source: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates. When disaggregating by field and nationality at the same time, certain data points rely on a low number of respondents. This raises the chance of random fluctuations in the results, especially in low-enrollment STEM fields such as Agriculture or the Health Sciences. To address this risk, the tables and figures in this section usually aggregate two or more years together. However, this is only a partial solution, so any changes in intention-to-stay rates should be interpreted with caution. Country Profile: China Figure 4 shows the annual number and proportion of Chinese Ph.D. graduates by STEM field, averaged for academic years 2016 and 2017. Engineering degrees lead, with around 2,000 Ph.D. graduates per year, accounting for 40 percent of total Chinese graduates, followed by the Physical Sciences (around 1,000 graduates, or 20 percent of the total) and the Biological/Biomedical Sciences (around 800 graduates, or 16 percent).  Between 2010 and 2017, on the other hand, rates held steady in most fields, except Computer Science (a mild increase) and Agriculture (a mild decrease). In 2016-2017, Computer Science saw the highest intention-tostay rates (nearly 95 percent, compared to 88 percent for all international students as seen in Figure 2). Rates ranged from 85 to 90 percent for most other fields, with only Agriculture (close to 75 percent) scoring lower. 10 Figure 5. Intention-to-stay rates of Chinese STEM Ph.D. graduates by field, 2000-2017. Source: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates. At the time of writing, SED data is available for approximately half of eventual 2018 respondents. Because the data is not yet complete, we exclude it from the figure above. However, the preliminary 2018 data suggests steady intention-to-stay rates in the Biological/Biomedical Sciences (a one percentage point increase from 2017 to 90 percent), the Physical Sciences (84 percent, no change), Health Sciences (one-point increase to 87 percent), and Engineering (87 percent, no change). There were larger drops in Computer Science (four points to 90 percent), Mathematics (four points to 82 percent), and Agriculture (four points to 71 percent). These numbers may change when the full data become available. 11 Country Profile: India Figure 6 shows the annual number and proportion of Indian Ph.D. graduates by STEM field, averaged for academic years 2016-2017. As with Chinese graduates, Engineering degrees are clearly the most popular, with around 750 Ph.D. graduates per year-or 40 percent of total Indian STEM graduates-followed by the Biological/Biomedical Sciences (a little under 500, or 26 percent) and the Physical Sciences (a little under 300, or 14 percent).   Source: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates. For Indian graduates, we repeated the preliminary analysis of 2018 data we did for Chinese graduates. Intention-to-stay rates remained the same for most fields, with small changes in the Biological/Biomedical Sciences (three-point increase to 96 percent) and Computer Science (two-point increase to 93 percent). The only exception was Mathematics, where rates dropped nine points from 83 to 74 percent. Again, with data available for only roughly half of eventual 2018 respondents, these numbers may change."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "International students account for a significant portion of U.S. STEM Ph.D. graduates, and the vast majority intend to stay in the country after graduating. Intention-to-stay rates are especially high-above 85 percent-in computer science, biology, and engineering among students from Iran, India, and China. Between 2000 and 2017, rates increased for most fields and countries. Intention-to-stay rates among Chinese Ph.D. graduates dropped slightly between 2000 and 2010, but-contrary to popular perceptionremained constant at high levels between 2010 and 2017. This report has focused solely on presenting descriptive results (the \"what\") and refrained from trying to explain the findings (the \"why\"). Box 2 contains further readings on \"why\" questions. While valuable, the data analyzed for this Brief has shortcomings. First, stay rates are measured by intent expressed on a survey, which could pose reliability issues. As noted above, data on intention-to-stay rates correlates strongly with data on actual stay rates, but future research could explore using the NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), which tracks U.
