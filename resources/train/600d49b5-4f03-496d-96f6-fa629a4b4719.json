[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Th e development in 1984 of consensus criteria [1] for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) capped a period of evolving knowledge that AD could be diff erentiated not only from normal aging but also from other causes of neurodegenerative dementias. On average, clinical diagnosis using these consensus criteria is approximately 81% sensitive and 70% specifi c compared to the gold standard, pathology at autopsy [2], a performance that equals or exceeds the performance of proposed diagnostic criteria for many other neurodegenerative diseases [2, 3] .\nNevertheless, there remains both room and a need for improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Up to 20% of subjects clinically diagnosed with AD do not have AD pathology at autopsy [4] [5] [6] , a percentage that is essentially unchanged from the estimate in the 1984 consensus publication [1] . In addition, under-diagnosis in the commu nity setting is signifi cant. Approximately 10% of community-dwelling elderly have undiagnosed dementia [7, 8] and community physicians may fail to diagnose up to 33% of individuals with mild dementia [8] .\nPerhaps the biggest limitation in current practice is a reliance on the presentation and progression of symptoms to identify an AD phenotype. Th is inherently leads to delays in diagnosis as physicians must wait for symptoms to appear and must track progressive decline over time. However, the past 25 years have seen dramatic improvements in technology and understanding of biomarkers that off er potential to improve this diagnostic algorithm. As a result, new draft criteria [9,10] have proposed that diagnosis can be enhanced by use of biomarkers to increase certainty, and, in early stages, to identify prodromal AD. Th is approach has the potential to allow earlier and more specifi c diagnosis and will possibly identify patients with AD before the point where irreversible damage precludes eff ective treatment [11] .\nA number of diff erent biomarkers, including atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regional metabolism as assessed by 18 F-fl uorodeoxyglucose positron emis sion tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) concentrations of tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) are poten tially useful [11, 12] , but molecular imaging with amyloid targeted PET ligands is a particularly attractive approach. Rate of atrophy on volumetric MRI and pattern of metabolic defi cits on 18 F-fl uorodeoxyglucose PET can provide useful information on stage of deterioration and functional status, but may lack specifi city, since multiple types of neurologic disorders can cause the same type of changes [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . CSF markers provide information (albeit indirect) more relevant to the underlying molecular pathology, including both A\u03b2 and tau, but require a relatively invasive procedure (lumbar puncture) and may Abstract Current theory suggests that \u03b2-amyloid accumulation may be an early step in the cascade that leads to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. \u03b2-Amyloid targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging potentially provides a direct, relatively noninvasive estimate of brain \u03b2-amyloid burden. This has recently been supported by demonstration that amyloid plaque binding on PET was strongly correlated with brain \u03b2-amyloid burden at autopsy. Additionally, there is growing consensus that PET imaging can identify subjects with elevated \u03b2-amyloid burden, even at early stages of disease. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that abnormal \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, as evidenced by PET imaging, has implications for both present and future cognitive performance. Although large longitudinal studies like the ongoing ADNI trial will be required for defi nitive evaluation, present data suggest that PET amyloid imaging has the potential to promote earlier and more specifi c diagnosis of dementia."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "not be entirely specifi c for AD [18] . In contrast, A\u03b2 imaging potentially provides a direct, relatively noninvasive estimate of brain A\u03b2 burden, which together with tau and a progressive pattern of neuronal loss is a defi ning pathology and an import link in the pathogenesis of AD [19, 20] .\nTh e fi rst, and to date most widely studied, ligand for PET imaging of A\u03b2 aggregates (subsequently referred to as amyloid PET or amyloid imaging) is the 11 C-labeled agent known as Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) [21] [22] [23] . Although 11 C-PIB has been a highly valuable tool in the research setting, the short (20-minute) half-life of the 11 C label limits the utility of 11 C-PIB in routine clinical application. Th us, there has been a push to develop a longer lived 18 F-labeled amyloid PET agent. Th ree compounds are currently in the late stages of development. One of these, fl orbetapir F 18 [24] [25] [26] has now completed phase III trials [27] , while fl orbetaben [28] and fl utemetamol [29, 30] are currently enrolling to phase III trials.\nTh e utility of PET amyloid imaging as an aid in early diagnosis rests on three major assumptions: fi rst, that PET imaging accurately refl ects A\u03b2 burden in the brain; second, that PET imaging can detect brain A\u03b2 at an early stage of disease, that is, prior to the onset of dementia; and fi nally, that the presence of \u03b2-amyloid, as detected by PET imaging, has consequences for current and future cognitive performance. We will examine the available evidence for each of these assumptions in turn."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between PET amyloid imaging and brain A\u03b2 burden by histopathology", "text": "In vitro studies have shown that PET imaging ligands such as 11 C-PIB [21, 31] , fl orbetaben [32] and fl orbetapir F 18 [24] bind to A\u03b2 and co-localize with plaques stained by thiofl avin and other amyloid labeling agents. However, a defi nitive demonstration of the relationship requires a comparison between in vivo imaging and brain pathology, for example, at autopsy.\nFive single subject/single center PET to pathology comparison studies with 11 C-PIB have produced mixed results. Two studies described patients with clinical diagnosis and autopsy confi rmation of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) who had amyloid-positive 11 C-PIB PET scans in life, and borderline A\u03b2 pathology at autopsy. Bacskai and colleagues [33] reported a visually positive 11 C-PIB PET scan from a 76 year old with DLB and severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Regional quantifi cation of the PET image, expressed as distribution volume ratio (DVR), revealed low to moderately elevated tracer levels (DVR = 1.3 to 1.5), which was consistent with the autopsy fi ndings of low to moderate levels of diff use plaques and infrequent cored plaques (intermediate probability of AD by National Institute of Aging -Reagan Institute (NIA-Reagan) [34] criteria). However, there was no relationship across brain regions between regional DVR and regional levels of A\u03b242 in autopsy tissue as assessed by ELISA. Kantarci and colleagues [35] reported a positive 11 C-PIB PET scan from a 77 year old with DLB. At autopsy neuritic plaques were moderately common in some brain regions, including mid-frontal gyrus, amygdale and superior parietal lobe, but sparse in the areas used for pathological diagnosis, resulting in an NIA-Reagan classifi cation of low likelihood AD. In contrast to the previous study, there was a strong correlation between regional quantifi cation of the PET image and regional A\u03b2 density by immunohistochemistry at autopsy. Two other reports studied subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD. Ikonomovic and colleagues [31] reported an amyloid positive 11 C-PIB PET scan in a 64 year old with severe AD. Strong correlations (0.7 to 0.8) were seen between regional 11 C-PIB PET tracer uptake (DVR) and various postmortem measures of A\u03b2 burden, including immunohistochemistry, histopathology and A\u03b2 levels by ELISA. Cairns and colleagues [36] reported on a 91 year old with clinical diagnosis of early AD with a negative 11 C-PIB PET scan but reduced CSF A\u03b2. Th e autopsy revealed numerous diff use plaques, but sparse cored plaques and isolated neurofi brillary tangles (NFT). Th e neuropathologic diagnosis in this subject was borderline: low probability of AD by NIA-Reagan criteria, and possible AD by CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) criteria [37] . Addition ally, the 11 C-PIB PET scan was taken more than 2 years prior to autopsy. Th us, it is diffi cult to determine whether this case should be considered a failure of the 11 C-PIB PET scan to detect an early stage of AD, or a successful rejection of a case that lacked convincing AD pathology. Finally, Leinonen and colleagues [38] reported that fi ve of ten subjects who had a tissue removed for a shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalis had signifi cant numbers of A\u03b2 aggregates by immunohistochemistry at biopsy. Four of these subjects had abnormal 11 C-PIB PET scans (elevated cortex to cerebellum standard uptake volume ratio (SUVR)). Th e overall correlation between SUVR and number of amyloid aggregates across the ten subjects was 0.85.\nClark and colleagues [27] recently reported the fi rst prospective multicenter phase III study to evaluate the correlation between the level of cortical amyloid burden on PET scan and true A\u03b2 burden assessed by postmortem histopathology. In this study, 152 subjects with cognitive status ranging from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD or other dementing disorders agreed to both fl orbetapir-PET scan and subsequent autopsy. As specifi ed by the protocol, the fi rst six subjects to come to autopsy were considered front runners and were used to confi rm the experimental methods, and the next 29 subjects to come to autopsy were considered the primary effi cacy population. Cortical amyloid burden on fl orbetapir-PET scans was visually assessed on a 0-to-4 scale (no-to-high cortical tracer uptake) by three indepen dent raters, blinded to clinical information, with the median rater score as the primary outcome variable, and by a semi-automated quantifi cation of the SUVR in six cortical target areas (frontal, temporal and parietal cortex, precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulate) relative to the cerebellum reference region. Amyloid burden at autopsy was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry (primary outcome variable) and by a modifi ed CERAD scoring (silver stain) in the six cortical target regions. Th e results showed a strong, statistically signifi cant correlation between the level of cortical tracer uptake in the PET image, whether assessed by median visual read or SUVR, and true A\u03b2 burden, whether assessed postmortem by quantitative immunohistochemistry or silver stain (\u03c1 = 0.71 to 0.78, P < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in the primary effi cacy set (n = 29) and in the entire autopsy data set (n = 35, including the front runners). Th ere was qualitative agreement between fl orbetapir-PET and postmortem results in 97% of the autopsied subjects. Of 19 subjects that met pathologic criteria (CERAD and NIA-Reagan) for AD, 18 were rated visually positive for amyloid by median read, and all 19 had SUVR above a predefi ned cutpoint. Conversely, all 16 subjects that did not meet pathologic criteria (amyloid free) at autopsy were amyloid free by both visual and quantitative analysis of the PET scan.\nAlthough the data with 11 C-PIB are somewhat limited, the results with fl orbetapir F 18 provide a strong preliminary indication that PET amyloid imaging can provide an accurate refl ection of underlying A\u03b2 burden. However, further studies are required to understand how early in the disease course the amyloid pathology can be detected. In both the 11 C-PIB [36, 38] and fl orbetapir F 18 [27] studies there were some subjects with measurable but low levels of amyloid pathology at autopsy that were not associated with amyloid-positive PET scans. In most cases, the level of pathology in these patients at autopsy was below the threshold for neuropathological diagnosis of AD (that is, rated low likelihood or no AD). Th us, the threshold for detection of amyloid on the PET scan appears close to the levels of neuropathology typical for a diagnosis of AD. It is presently unclear whether levels of A\u03b2 burden at autopsy that are insuffi cient to be thought of as AD actually represent an early stage of disease [35, 36] , or whether they represent variants of amyloid deposition, including normal aging [39] . Longitudinal studies, with periodic repeat scans and cognitive testing, would be useful to determine how much or for how long a negative scan in a cognitively normal individual reduces risk of future amyloid accumulation and cognitive impairment. Such studies are now starting as part of the second phase Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; for example, ADNI-2) protocol [40] .\nOn the other hand, across both the 11 C-PIB and the fl orbetapir F 18 image/autopsy studies there were no cases in which a positive amyloid PET scan was obtained in a subject found to be cognitively normal and amyloid free at autopsy. Th ese results suggest that there is a high probability of underlying brain A\u03b2 pathology in subjects with positive amyloid PET scans. Th is kind of high specifi city and positive predictive value, compared to the autopsy gold standard, is a prerequisite for a biomarker to be used as an aid to early diagnosis of dementia."}, {"section_title": "Early detection of amyloid by PET imaging in MCI and cognitively normal subjects", "text": "Current theories of AD pathophysiology hold that A\u03b2 deposition may be a precipitating event that begins years in advance of the onset of dementia [41] [42] [43] . Evidence in support of the hypothesis includes the fi nding that 15% or more of cognitively normal subjects coming to autopsy may have plaque burden suffi cient to support a diagnosis of AD [44] [45] [46] and 33 to 62% of subjects with MCI have signifi cant accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques [47, 48] . Correspond ing changes in biomarkers have also been reported in non-demented individuals. Notably, studies of CSF biomarkers have consistently shown decreases in CSF A\u03b2 in 30 to 40% of cognitively normal subjects [49, 50] . Changes in CSF tau, MRI volume and cerebral metabolism may occur slightly later than changes in CSF A\u03b2 [41, 49, 51] .\nAmyloid PET imaging studies have yielded results similar to those from autopsy and CSF studies. Studies using 11 C-PIB have reported amyloid-positive scans in 14 to 47% of cognitively normal elderly volunteers [40, 43, [52] [53] [54] [55] , and 55 to 72% of subjects with MCI [51, [54] [55] [56] [57] . Where data from both 11 C-PIB PET scans and CSF A\u03b2 have been available, strong correlations between these measures have generally been reported [49, 57] . Results with 18 F-labeled imaging agents are similar to those for 11 C-PIB. Th e proportion of A\u03b2-positive scans in cognitively normal subjects has ranged from 7% and 12% with fl utametamol [29, 30] , to 13% with fl orbetapir [26] , and 20% with fl orbetaben [28] . In MCI subjects the proportion of positive scans was about 50% for fl utametamol [30] and fl orbetaben [58] and about 38% in the studies with fl orbetapir [59] .\nTh e diff erences across PET studies, which are similar to the diff erences in the pathological studies of cognitively normal controls and MCI, could easily be related to diff erences in subject age and inclusion criteria rather than diff erences in sensitivity of the diff erent tracers. Consistent with fi ndings in the autopsy literature [45, 60] , the proportion of cognitively healthy control subjects that are A\u03b2-positive by PET scan increases with age [26, 30, 44, 49, 53] . Th e mean age of cognitively healthy subjects varied by more than 10 years across the studies above [29, 55] . Additionally, the fl orbetapir trial [58] was designed to evaluate early stage MCI patients, diagnosed within the past year. Th ese subjects may be more diffi cult to diagnose and thus more heterogeneous, leading to inclusion of a greater number of subjects with nonamyloid/AD-related impairments.\nJagust and colleagues [40] , reporting on 11 C-PIB subjects from the ADNI study, further evaluated quantitative values (cortical to cerebellar SUVR) for the A\u03b2-positive and A\u03b2-negative subjects by diagnostic presentation group (cognitively healthy, MCI and AD). Interestingly, there was no apparent diff erence in SUVR between A\u03b2positive MCI and A\u03b2-positive AD, but SUVR in A\u03b2positive MCI and AD both appeared greater than SUVR in A\u03b2-positive healthy controls. Th ese results are consistent with histopathology fi ndings [47] , indicating that the relative proportion of patients with high versus moderate levels of A\u03b2 pathology at autopsy (defi nite versus probable AD by CERAD criteria) does not increase from MCI to AD patients, and suggests that A\u03b2 accumulation reaches asymptote at early stages of disease.\nTogether with the image-autopsy results described above [27] , these results suggest that PET imaging can detect the presence of A\u03b2 aggregates suffi cient to support a pathological diagnosis of AD in upwards of 15% of cognitively healthy elderly subjects (prevalence increasing with age) as well as in 40 to 70% of subjects with MCI. Th us, the results are consistent with the hypothesis [41] that PET amyloid imaging can detect A\u03b2 accumulation well in advance of the onset of dementia. Th e next section will consider the available literature regarding consequences of a positive amyloid scan for present and future cognitive performance in cognitively healthy and MCI subjects."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between amyloid PET imaging and cognitive performance/progression", "text": "Th e most obvious prediction from the model of Jack and colleagues [41] is that compared to subjects who have a negative amyloid PET scan, cognitively healthy control and MCI subjects who have positive amyloid PET scans will, as a group, show greater deterioration in cognitive performance, and will be more likely to progress to an advanced stage of disease (for example, from MCI to AD). A signifi cant number of studies have looked at the relationship between PET amyloid binding and concurrent cognitive performance. Multiple studies have reported no correlation between amyloid binding and degree of cognitive defi cits in AD patients [55, 61, 62] . Th is is consistent with the hypothesis that amyloid is an early initiating event in a pathological cascade, that A\u03b2 accumulation approaches asymptote by the time that symptoms appear, and that other pathological processes (tau phosphorylation, infl ammation, synaptic degeneration) are more closely linked to expression of cognitive impairment in AD patients [41] .\nResults are more mixed for MCI subjects. Pike and colleagues [55] found a good correlation (r = 0.61) between 11 C-PIB SUVR and a working memory compo site score. Others have found no consistent diff erences in cognition as a function of PET amyloid imaging [43, 54] . However, it is likely that correlational studies in MCI subjects are particularly sensitive to the diagnostic algorithms used to select and defi ne MCI subjects. Overlap between the diagnostic algorithm and cognitive outcome variables can reduce the chances of fi nding a relationship between an independent variable and cognitive performance; for example, if all subjects must have objectively demonstrated memory defi cits for inclusion in the study cohort, it becomes diffi cult to demonstrate a relationship between amyloid burden and memory performance within the cohort. Additionally, as noted above, amyloid levels may approach asymptote by the MCI stage, and diff erences in brain amyloid burden beyond that point may have as much to do with modulating factors infl uencing the individual subject's asymptotic level as they do with disease stage.\nIn cognitively healthy elderly subjects, Mintun and colleagues [52] , Storandt and colleagues [62] and Jack and colleagues [54] reported no relationship between concurrent cognitive performance and 11 C-PIB amyloid binding. Other studies have found mixed results. Mormimo and colleagues [63] reported a relationship between 11 C-PIB amyloid binding and episodic memory for one population of normal elderly, but not for a second population. Rowe and colleagues [43] reported that subjects with high PIB amyloid binding had signifi cantly reduced memory scores relative to subjects with low amyloid binding, but the correlation between binding and memory was not signifi cant. In contrast, several studies [55, 64, 65] have now reported correlations between 11 C-PIB amyloid binding and memory scores. Similarly, Rosenberg and colleagues [61] examined cognitive performance in the cohort of subjects described by Wong and colleagues [26] and found a signifi cant correlation between fl orbetapir F 18 binding and ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale) performance by normal elderly controls. Park and colleagues [66] have also recently reported a relation ship between fl orbetapir PET amyloid binding and work ing memory performance in cognitively normal aging subjects.\nIt is not surprising that the strength of correlation between PET result and cognitive performance, and/or the magnitude of the diff erence in cognitive performance between cognitively normal subjects with A\u03b2-positive and A\u03b2-negative PET scans, was modest and sometimes variable. At least three factors work to limit the magnitude of eff ect that can be obtained in cognitively normal subjects. First, the range of cognitive performance in cognitively normal subjects is constrained by the criteria used to separate cognitively impaired subjects from cognitively normal. Th e earlier and more aggressively the diagnosis of impairment is made, the less potential for variance within the normal group as a function of amyloid level, as subjects with greater amyloid burden, and more advanced impairment, may be classifi ed as cognitively impaired. Second, the outcome may depend on the diffi culty of the cognitive tests used. More diffi cult tests are more likely to uncover defi cits that may otherwise go unnoticed [64] . Finally, the relationship between amyloid binding and cognitive performance can be modifi ed by the subject's education/ cognitive reserve [64, 65] . Subjects with high education/ high cognitive reserve appear to maintain cognitive function in the normal range for a longer period or in the face of greater PET amyloid binding than subjects with lower cognitive reserve.\nTh e Pike and colleagues [55] and the Rentz and colleagues [64] reports above both include scatterplots of cognitive performance as a function of amyloid binding (SUVR). Rather than a preferential distribution of abnormally low memory scores in association with high amyloid binding, the scatterplots are notable for the relative absence of high memory scores in the high amyloid group. It is tempting to speculate that this kind of distribution is the result of the limiting factors discussed above. In the amyloid-positive cohort, subjects with low cognitive reserve cannot sustain performance and become classifi ed as MCI, whereas subjects with high cognitive reserve, who otherwise would have been above average memory performers, have deteriorated but are still perform ing near the middle of the normal range. However, this kind of hypothesis can only be addressed by longitudinal studies.\nTh e relationship between amyloid burden as assessed by PET imaging and longitudinal change in cognitive function in cognitively normal and MCI populations is currently under examination in multiple trials, including the US ADNI study [40] ( 11 C-PIB, phase 1, and fl orbetapir F 18, phase 2), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Initiative (AIBL) initiative [43] ( 11 C-PIB) and several ongoing longitudinal trials of aging [62, 67] , as well as in several trials with 18 F-labeled agents that are either still ongoing (fl utemetamol, NCT01028053; fl orbeta ben, NCT01138111; ClinicalTrials.gov) or recently completed (fl orbetapir) [59] . First results, now coming into the literature, strongly suggest a relationship between amyloid burden and AD progression.\nFour published studies have examined the potential of 11 C-PIB PET amyloid imaging to predict progression from MCI to AD. Forsberg and colleagues [57] imaged 27 MCI subjects and reported that 7 who subsequently converted to AD had higher PIB retention than nonconverting subjects. Okello and colleagues [56] studied 31 MCI subjects, 17 (55%) of whom were considered amyloid-positive on an 11 C-PIB PET scan. Of these 17 subjects, 14 (82%) converted from MCI to AD in the follow-up period (up to 3 years). Only 1 of 14 (7%) amyloid-negative subjects converted in the same time period. A comparison of fast (<1 year) versus slower converters suggested that fast converters (within one year of scan; 8 of 17 amyloid-positive subjects) had higher 11 C-PIB PET cortical to cerebellar uptake ratios than the slower converters, despite a similar mean age. Notably, all fast converters for whom genotype was available carried an apolipoprotein E \u03b54 alleole, whereas only two of six slow converters with genotype information carried an apolipoprotein E \u03b54 alleole. Th us, the \u03b54 alleole may have contributed to both the elevated amyloid burden (increased SUVR) and the more rapid conversion. Wolk and colleagues [68] similarly reported a higher rate of conversion in subjects classifi ed as amyloid-positive (5 of 13, 38%) versus amyloid-negative (zero of 10) by 11 C-PIB PET. Finally, Jack and colleagues [69] recently published the fi rst report of follow-up results from the ADNI study. Of 218 MCI subjects included in the analysis, 11 C-PIB data were available for 53 subjects, and CSF A\u03b2 levels, but not 11 C-PIB, were available for 165. In order to increase power and to better draw conclusions regarding relationships between amyloid burden and disease progression, CSF data from subjects who did not undergo 11 C-PIB imaging were transformed to facilitate a combined quantitative analysis. Over the observation period, 81 of 165 amyloid-positive versus 8 of 53 amyloid-negative MCI subjects progressed to AD. A Kaplin Meyer analysis estimated a signifi cantly increased hazard ratio (3.2) with a 2-year estimated conversion rate of 50% in the amyloidpositive versus 19% in the amyloid-negative subjects.\nOnly one study has reported progression of cognitively normal subjects to more advanced disease. Morris and colleagues [70] performed 11 C-PIB scans in 159 cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0) subjects that were part of a longitudinal aging study and reported that the relative risk of conversion from CDR 0 to AD (nine subjects) was increased almost fi ve-fold in the presence of a positive 11 C-PIB amyloid scan. A lesser, non-signifi cant increase in risk was reported for conversion from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5 (n = 23).\nTh e primary weakness of studies using conversion/ stage change as an endpoint is that the rate of conversion, particularly from healthy to MCI or AD, may be low and variable across subjects and studies, depending on recruiting centers and entry criteria. Hence, three studies in cognitively normal aging elderly have looked instead at the relationship between PET amyloid binding and continuous measures, that is, change in objectively measured cognitive performance. Storandt and colleagues [62] , working with essentially the same subject population as Morris and colleagues [70] , found that concurrent cognitive performance was unrelated to 11 C-PIB binding, but the estimated annual rate of cognitive deterioration, as evidenced by change in visuospatial and working memory performance composite scores, was signifi cantly greater in subjects with an amyloid-positive 11 C-PIB PET scan than in subjects with an amyloid-negative 11 C-PIB scan. High amyloid binding on 11 C-PIB scans was also associated with reduced regional brain volume on MRI, further suggesting that even in cognitively normal subjects (CDR 0) amyloid accumulation is not benign. Villemagne and colleagues [71] imaged 34 elderly subjects that had been previously followed longitudinally for 6 to 10 years. On average, subjects with memory decline over the observation period had higher 11 C-PIB retention; 7 of 11 subjects with elevated 11 C-PIB retention showed memory decline, versus 4 of 23 subjects with normal 11 C-PIB retention. Finally, Resnick and colleagues [67] obtained 11 C-PIB PET images on 57 subjects who had been followed for an average of 10.8 years as part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and found a signifi cant correlation between 11 C-PIB binding (DVR) and Mini Mental State Exam and verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test).\nOne weakness of the Storandt and colleagues [62] , Villemagne and colleagues [71] and Resnick and colleagues [67] studies is that they rely primarily on retrospective analysis of cognitive decline. Although several groups have now reported that change in 11 C-PIB binding is relatively slow, particularly in amyloid-positive subjects [40, 51] , it is diffi cult to judge from a retrospective analysis how early the 11 C-PIB PET could have predicted subjects likely to show cognitive decline. Of course, these groups and others (for example, ADNI) are now following subjects prospectively from the point of imaging. One recent preliminary report [59] was consistent with the results above showing a relationship between fl orbetapir PET amyloid binding and prospectively measured cognitive decline.\nIn summary, the data to date are limited, but taken together provide evidence that abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2 as evidenced by PET amyloid imaging is associated with increased risk of both concurrent cognitive defi cits and subsequent progression of cognitive impairment, and thus may be pathological even in apparently cognitively normal subjects."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Emerging consensus regarding diagnostic algorithms and criteria suggests that diagnosis of AD can be enhanced by use of biomarkers to increase certainty, and, in early stages, to identify the group of patients at risk for progression to AD. Th e data reviewed above suggest that PET amyloid imaging may be well suited to both tasks. Amyloid binding on PET has been shown to be strongly correlated with brain A\u03b2 burden at autopsy, and PET imaging identifi ed amyloid-positive subjects with a high sensitivity and specifi city in relationship to postmortem histopathological criteria for AD. Additionally, there is consistent evidence that PET imaging can identify subjects with elevated A\u03b2 burden, even at early stages of disease, and preliminary evidence suggests that excess A\u03b2 accumulation, as evidenced by PET imaging, has implications for both present and future cognitive performance.\nCurrent theory suggests that A\u03b2 accumulation may be a critical early step in a cascade of events, including phosphoryl tau and infl ammation-mediated synaptic damage and neuronal loss, that leads to cognitive impairment in AD. Early identifi cation of subjects with A\u03b2 accumulation may be critical to the development of potential disease-modifying therapies because amyloid targeted therapies may not be eff ective once later stages of the cascade have begun.\nTh ere is an opportunity to identify patients earlier than occurs in current clinical practice. Typical patients in clinical trials, who are generally well educated and well integrated into the medical system, report delays of approximately 2 years between symptom onset and diagnosis. Delays may be even greater in a community setting where physicians are known to overlook diagnoses in a substantial proportion of patients. However, improved diagnostic aids, such as amyloid-targeted PET scans, alone may not be suffi cient to overcome this problem. Diagnostic delays may be partly a matter of patient education (recognition and acceptance of AD symptoms, readiness to seek treatment) and physician practice. In particular, some physicians may be unwilling to commit to diagnosis in the absence of viable treatments. On the other hand, tools that provide evidence of the underlying pathology might improve physician's confi dence, and lead to an earlier diagnosis, by reducing the need for longitudinal follow-up and progression to a more advanced stage of symptoms. Equally important, the evidence indicates that PET amyloid scans can identify patients with early cognitive impairments who do not have pathological levels of brain A\u03b2 at autopsy. Since A\u03b2 pathology is required for a diagnosis of AD, the early demonstration of the absence of A\u03b2 may lead instead to further evaluation of potentially treatable causes of impairment (for example, depression) in these patients.\nWhen, and in what population of patients, should amyloid PET imaging be used? It is easy enough to identify and rule out the extremes. On the one extreme, a well characterized patient whose disease has progressed beyond the point where a scan would infl uence medical management would likely derive little benefi t from a PET scan. On the other extreme the evidence to date is not suffi cient to support routine use in screening cognitively normal subjects, even in the presence of risk factors. Although the results discussed above (for example, [55, 61] ) suggest that subjects who are amyloid-positive on PET scan may perform worse on cognitive tests, the results have not been entirely consistent across trials, and the eff ects are subtle and of uncertain clinical relevance. Most important, too few amyloid-positive subjects have been identifi ed and followed longitudinally to give guidance to the patient regarding likelihood and time course of future cognitive deterioration. Current estimates of 10 years or more between the fi rst signs of excess A\u03b2 accumulation and onset of dementia suggest that many amyloid-positive elderly patients might pass on before experiencing signifi cant cognitive decline.\nIn between these extremes lie a large number of patients that could potentially benefi t from PET amyloid scans. With three 18 F-labeled amyloid targeted ligands having entered or already completed phase III trials, it is likely that amyloid PET scans will be broadly available within the next few years. Additional studies and consensus evaluations are needed to determine the best use for these agents. Despite the positive results des cribed above, it is clear that an amyloid PET scan is not suffi cient to confer a diagnosis of AD. A\u03b2 can be present in association with other disease conditions, including DLB, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. It remains unclear whether this refl ects the coincidence of two or more disease entities (for example, AD independently in addition to DLB) or whether A\u03b2 (and tau) pathology can be found independently in multiple disease entities.\nIn either case, the advent of PET amyloid imaging techniques does not obviate the need for clinical/cognitive evaluation. Moreover, the information obtained from amyloid PET imaging may be enhanced by additional biomarker studies, including, for example, functional imaging [72] , or molecular imaging aimed at dopamine systems [73] [74] [75] . Additional studies are required to identify which patients most benefi t from PET amyloid imaging and which additional diagnostic assessments are most useful in developing a practice parameter to optimize the potential for early evaluation of cognitive impairment."}]
