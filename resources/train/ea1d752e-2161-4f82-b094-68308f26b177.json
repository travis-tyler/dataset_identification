Images and clinical correlate data were obtained with approval of the UAMS Institutional Review Board (IRB number 228350) which includes open access publication of this data in de-identified form. All data were collected from hospitalized patients with a positive COVID-19 lab test (PCR) verified diagnosis who had imaging studies within eight days prior to diagnosis and at least one imaging study post diagnosis. Emphasis was placed on patients with multiple post diagnosis imaging studies. All imaging studies of the head were excluded due to issues of potential patient identification from volumetric CT reconstructions 8,9 . Imaging. Imaging techniques were standard of care, primarily portable (97%), digital chest radiographs collected either by computed radiography, CR, (19 patients, 26 image series) or direct digital capture, DX, (100 patients, 236 series). CT (computed tomography) studies were performed on 21% (23) of patients depending on the severity of symptoms and clinical status (resulting in 199 CT image series). Radiographs were performed using a single view AP (anteroposterior) technique or PA (posteroanterior) and lateral views depending on patient mobility and intubation status. CT was performed on multi-slice, spiral scanners. Contiguous 1 mm axial images were obtained through the chest (Online-only Table 1 provides acquisition parameters for each of the 199 CT series). Axial (3 mm spatial resolution) and 2 mm sagittal and coronal reconstructions were performed and subsequently reviewed on a dedicated Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) workstation. A total of 256 chest imaging studies were identified, including 233 radiographs and 23 CT studies performed on a total of 105 patients. Figure 2 is an illustrative example of a chest radiograph and CT for the same patient taken on the same day. Final radiology reports for these examinations signed by board-certified radiologists were analyzed for key imaging findings. www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/ Summary of key imaging findings. The most frequent pattern of imaging findings is 'Organizing pneumonia' which is essentially a pattern of lung changes as a response to inflammation. The reported key imaging findings on radiographs and CT include confluent and patchy multifocal airspace opacification, either ground-glass opacities or consolidation. These airspace opacities were predominantly bilateral, multifocal, and peripheral. Although more commonly, these changes were diffuse and bilateral, lower lobe predominance was seen in cases that were more focal. A total of 59/232 (25%) radiographs and 8/23 (35%) CT were negative for airspace opacification. In our patient population, when present, ground glass changes were more common than consolidation, likely suggesting an earlier presentation in the disease course. Pleural effusions were rare and, when present, were only trace to mild. Other atypical findings like mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cavitation, and pneumothorax were not identified in our patient population. One of the 23 CT studies showed bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli.\nThe majority of ICU patients (28/29) showed radiographic AP changes, with 59% showing bilateral diffuse changes with left lower lobe involvement. One Radiographic study for one ICU patient had no significant findings. Seventy percent (7/10) of ICU mortality occurred in patients showing left lower lobe opacities. In contrast, one of these patients had no significant findings on CR or DX radiographic studies, 1 had general atelectasis, and 1 had diffuse disease without left lower lobe opacity. Clinical correlates. The average age in the cohort was 54.3 years old (range 19-91) with an even sex distribution (52 Male, 53 Female). The worldwide incidence is reported to be close to 1:1, with a 50% increase in hospitalizations, ICU stays, and mortality among males 10 . The racial characteristics of the cohort are presented in Fig. 1 in comparison to the total population of Arkansas and the current characteristics of the state-wide infected population. The average BMI in the cohort is 33.1 (18.7-64.9), well within obese range (30.0 or higher). Key Comorbidities include burns (2%), malnutrition (3%), pregnancy (4%), chronic kidney disease (11%), diabetes (21%), organ transplant (3%), and cancer (24%).\nThe overall ICU admission rate was 28% (29/105). The Average age among those admitted to the ICU was 58 (range 25-89), slightly higher than the average for the cohort as a whole. The racial breakdown of ICU admissions included 28% of the white patients, 25% of the black, 50% of other, and 100% of Pacific islanders. The ICU population was 66% male and 33% female and included 1 pregnant patient. Forty three percent of patients admitted to the ICU had BMI greater than 30. Of the black patients, 21% had diabetes and 29% chronic renal disease, while among white patients the highest percentage comorbidities were cancer (10%) and diabetes (10%). The ICU mortality rate was 34.4% (10/29) which is 1.5 times the national average of 23.6% 11 . The overall mortality rate was 10% (10/105) and all 10 patients in the mortality group were first admitted to ICU. Arkansan males were 1.95 times more likely to go to ICU (19/52 vs. 10/53). Our data shows an almost even overall mortality rate among males (5/53) and females (5/52). The data also suggest that once in the ICU, female mortality occurs at a rate 1.9 times that of males (5/19 vs. 5/10). Figure 3 summarizes rates of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality stratified by sex and race. SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set version 3 (218 primers) was kindly provided by Dr. Joshua Quick, University of Birmingham. The PCR amplification and extension condition of SARS-CoV-2 genome was performed using the COVID-19 ARTIC v3 Illumina library construction and sequencing protocol V.4 (https://doi.org/10.17504/ protocols.io.bgxjjxkn). The library was prepared and loaded on a R9.4.1/FLO-MIN106 flow cell, and sequenced with the MinION Mk1B (Oxford Nanopore Technology, ONT). Base-calling of the resulting FAST5 files was performed using Guppy (version 3.4.5) 12 , and the RAMPART software (v1.0.5) from the ARTIC Network 13 was used to monitor sequencing in real-time. The ARTIC Network bioinformatics protocol was used for all genome assembly and variant calling steps 14 . Figure 4 illustrates the resultant SARS-CoV-2 genome organization and identified mutations. Two isolates of UAMS SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified and grouped into a clade 15 .

All image data were processed using standard TCIA curation workflows. TCIA uses a standards-based approach for de-identification of images stored in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. DICOM Standard PS3.15 2016a -Security and System Management Profiles 25 defines how to correctly de-identify DICOM objects. The image data described in this data descriptor were de-identified using the \"Basic Application Confidentiality Profile, \" amended by inclusion of profile options: Clean Pixel Data Option (removal of information burned into the pixel data), Clean Descriptors Option (removal of PHI from data elements of type text or string), Retain Longitudinal With Modified Dates Option (all dates are shifted in a consistent manner by a random number so that relative temporal information is retained but absolute dates are masked), Retain Patient Characteristics Option (descriptive patient information is retained), Retain Device Identity Option (acquisition system information of potential scientific value is retained), and Retain Safe Private Option (retain scientifically valuable information stored in vendor private data elements) as is standard TCIA practice. Additional details on the de-identification process including the process for modifying dates by shifting using a random number are provided on the TCIA web site (wiki.cancerimagingarchive. net/display/Public/Submission+and+De-identification+Overview).\nThe TCIA curation team verifies completeness of the received collection, full removal of all PHI, proper labeling of all information to facilitate retrieval, and proper linkages among components of the collection [26] [27] [28] . TCIA curation procedures assure image quality and data integrity. TCIA uses the Posda open-source framework to implement its curation process 29, 30 . Posda-based TCIA curation workflows ensure the scientific utility of data and eliminate protected health information. After Posda processing is complete, a data curator visually inspects every DICOM image.\nPatient demographics, outcomes, and other clinical information were also validated during the TCIA curation process. Prior to this review, two of the authors (AB, FP) manually reviewed all clinical data for consistency, accuracy, and completeness, while SD and FP reviewed all image data and radiology reports.
