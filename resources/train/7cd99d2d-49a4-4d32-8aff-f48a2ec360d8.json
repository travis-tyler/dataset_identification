[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For many years, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) has maintained a Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs, which has included those academic institutions located in the United States and Canada. The print Directory was a well-regarded resource for tracking basic information like: language and sub-field specializations, student enrollment, number and type of degrees conferred, number and rank of faculty positions, and related demographic data for students and faculty. As the Directory evolved into an online resource, it became more difficult to produce an Annual Report with comprehensive information for all of the North American institutions because fewer departments and programs provided data to the LSA. A primary objective of the 2012 LSA website redesign was to develop a much more robust Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs. This redesigned Directory would serve a number of potential audiences: prospective graduate students, prospective faculty, and administrators seeking benchmarking data. With this overhaul complete, the LSA then embarked on extensive outreach efforts to enlist the participation of \"departmental contacts\" in order to update the listings for individual institutions. The LSA has also monitored and/or participated in a number of national (U.S.) surveys that track the status of linguistics in higher education. The National Science Foundation (NSF) conducts and reports data from two relevant surveys: The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctoral Recipients. The federal Department of Education conducts and reports data from an annual survey of ~4,200 post-secondary institutions. The most recent available data from all three of these surveys are included in this report. In addition to these federal data initiatives, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences conducted a Humanities Departmental Survey (HDS), with financial and in-kind support from the LSA, in 2007-8 and 2012-13. The 2012-13 HDS was published in 2014 and select pieces of data covering the field of linguistics in higher education appear in this report. In addition to the data collection and monitoring activities outlined above, the LSA also maintains a member database with individual profiles that include demographic information, professional affiliations, and linguistic sub-specialties. Although most LSA members do not choose to provide demographic information, most do choose to provide professional and/or scholarly affiliations. Charts summarizing statistically relevant data from the LSA membership profiles are included in this report. The long-term goal of the LSA is to produce an \"Annual Report on the State of Linguistics in Higher Education\" which will include data from all of the relevant sources mentioned above. These data will be compiled into longitudinal charts showing change over time in the academic linguistics community. The LSA welcomes the opportunity to report on trends affecting linguists beyond academia, to include those working in industry and government. Obtaining data for these populations is much more difficult, given the lack of systems in place for tracking these individuals and the lack of financial resources for creating such complex systems."}, {"section_title": "The State of Linguistics in Higher Education", "text": "Annual Report 2015 Page 5 The Linguistic Society of America"}, {"section_title": "Overview of Trends in Linguistics", "text": "The most common career outcome for linguistics PhDs is a position in higher education. There are, however, a significant number of linguists pursuing careers in industry and K-14 education after obtaining their doctorates. Within higher education, departments report that most members of their faculty are full professors, but the non-professorial category is growing, particularly for women in other full-time and part-time positions. Additionally, women are almost on parity with men for tenure-track 1 jobs, but still fall below men in the number of full professor positions. The field of linguistics is growing most rapidly for undergraduates, with an increase of approximately 120 more students awarded BA degrees annually for the past 13 years. Most linguistics undergraduate degrees are awarded to women. Although women represent just over half of graduate students in linguistics, a number which has been increasing over the last 50 years, women comprise over 65 percent of the undergraduate population. 2 The top five specializations for graduate students in linguistics are: Syntax, Applied Linguistics, Phonology, Semantics, and Language Acquisition."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources LSA Directory", "text": "Data found in this report come from a variety of sources. Information about departments and programs is self-reported in the LSA's online Directory, found at www.linguisticsociety.org/programs. Since the upgraded directory was redesigned in 2013, 239 out of 244 departments/programs have registered as official contacts, with 208 of those updating their information in 2015. 3 Calculations of numbers of job titles, students, degrees awarded, and average salaries are only from departments that have registered and submitted data about their students or faculty to the online directory in 2015 (110 departments, or just under half of all registered departments). The majority of those responding offer the PhD as their highest degree (95 of the 208 registered departments that reported that information). Since not all departments submitted data in every area, each graph in the following report is a representation of the departments that have reported data in that realm (89 departments for job types, 91 for current students, 52 for degrees awarded, and 10 for salaries). The graph on graduate specializations was compiled from only those programs that reported their specializations on their directory page (212 programs). 4 Data on ethnicity of faculty and student populations is collected via the Directory, but only eleven institutions provided such data. 5 Given the paucity of data, this report does not include any charts on ethnicity of faculty or students using data derived from the Directory."}, {"section_title": "LSA Membership Database", "text": "The data reported in tables about individual linguists comes from the LSA membership database. The data was exported in December of 2015 and did not include those members and departments that updated their information in 2016. Most of the charts included in this report are for Regular Members who have completed their linguistics education. Data for Student Members (n=1277) are handled separately (within the tables on ethnicity, citizenship, and year in school). The charts do not include data for lapsed regular and/or student members (n=10,537). This distinction is drawn primarily because there is little discernible difference demographically, and the lapsed members are less likely to have provided any profile data."}, {"section_title": "Government-Sponsored Surveys", "text": "The data reported in tables detailing trends in linguistics over time come from three sources that survey samples of respondents. Data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) is collected annually from questionnaires submitted from individuals receiving doctorates in the past year. Respondents represent approximately 420 institutions. Information from the longitudinal Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) is collected biennially from a sample of doctoral recipients over a career-long time span. Reported data are weighted using the SED sample. The Linguistics data from the SDR is aggregated into the minor category of Other Social Sciences. Data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS) is collected from tallies provided by an annual survey of approximately 4200 institutions. The IPEDS survey is conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. The IPEDS-derived charts in this report were first created in 2011 by the LSA's Linguistics in Higher Education Committee, and then updated in 2013-15 to reflect more current data.

In cases where the data diverged significantly, the discrepancies are included in this report.

Note that these estimates are from survey data that approximate these totals based upon a small subsample of all respondents with PhDs in science, engineering and health fields.
