[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Structural imaging studies have established the presence of subtle structural brain alterations in psychotic disorders. For schizophrenia, some of the most consistent findings include reductions in gray matter volume (GMV) of frontal, temporal, and limbic regions 1 , while bipolar disorder has also been associated with GMV reductions in prefrontal, temporal, and limbic regions 2, 3 .\nStudies have found correlations between structural alterations and symptom dimensions of psychosis; however, findings have been heterogeneous. In schizophrenia, inverse correlations between positive symptom severity and GMV of temporal lobe regions, most commonly the superior temporal gyrus (STG), have been frequently reported [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , but a minority of studies have observed no correlation or a direct correlation between positive symptom severity and GMV of these regions [9] [10] [11] . Results have been similarly mixed for the negative symptom dimension, with several studies finding inverse correlations with GMV of frontal regions [12] [13] [14] , and other studies reporting no correlation or a positive correlation with frontal regions [15] [16] [17] .\nMultiple reasons may account for the heterogeneity in findings. Positive symptoms of psychosis can wax and wane with time; thus results may be influenced by illness acuity of subjects at the time of scan. Other reasons for heterogeneity of results may include variations in technical aspects of imaging methodology, variable adjustment for confounding factors, and differences in subject characteristics, such as duration of illness.\nIn addition to the heterogeneity of findings on clinical correlations with GMV, the literature is limited regarding correlations with non-volumetric structural measures. Two constituents of volume, cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA), have demonstrated significant alterations in both schizophrenia [18] [19] [20] and bipolar disorder [21] [22] [23] . They may correlate differently with psychopathology due to their distinct neurobiological and genetic origins. According to a prevailing theory of cortical development, CSA is determined by the total number of cortical columns that form the cerebral cortex, while CT is determined by number of neurons within each column [24] [25] [26] . A recent longitudinal neuroimaging study of children found evidence for independent developmental trajectories of CT and CSA 27 . Additionally, neuroimaging studies of twins have found that CSA and CT are both highly heritable but probably genetically distinct 28 .\nThus far, the literature has not established whether CT and CSA have distinct correlations with positive and negative symptoms. Correlations have been reported between CT and propensity for hallucinations 19 and positive symptoms 29 among individuals with schizophrenia.\nHowever, one cross-diagnostic study of psychosis did not find an association between CT and symptom dimensions of psychosis 22 . Analysis of symptom correlations with CT and CSA may reveal their differential contributions to psychopathology, which in turn could help identify more specific neuropathological processes that drive the emergence of psychotic symptoms. In addition, inclusion of multiple diagnostic categories may reveal whether symptom-structure correlations are trans-diagnostic.\nIn this study, we examined correlations between symptom dimensions of psychosis and regional GMV, CSA and CT in schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar I disorder with psychosis. Correlations were examined using partial correlations between individual regions and subscales, and factor analysis was used to summarize overall structure-symptom relationships. Based on the existing literature 30 , we hypothesized that temporal alterations would correlate with the positive subscale, while frontal alterations would correlate with the negative subscale. We also hypothesized that CT and CSA would show distinct correlations with symptom dimensions. This is one of the largest sample sizes to date in which associations with dimensions of psychosis have been examined."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Subjects included individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. Subjects were recruited as part of the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP), using recruitment methods that have been detailed elsewhere 31, 32 . Inclusion criteria included the following: (1) age 15 -65; (2) English proficiency, as determined by ability to follow task instructions; (3) no known history of neurologic disorders including head injury; (4) no history of substance abuse within the last month or substance dependence within the last 6 months; and (5) negative urine toxicology screen on day of testing. Patients were generally clinically stable and receiving consistent psychopharmacological treatment for 4 weeks prior to testing. Study protocols were approved by institutional review boards at each study site, and subjects signed informed consent forms.\nAll subjects received the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) 33 . A consensus process was used to establish diagnosis using results from the SCID-IV, chart review, and review of psychiatric and medical histories. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) 34 was used to assess positive, negative, and general symptoms in patients. Inter-site standardization of symptom ratings was carried out by periodic meetings for rater training, using established 'gold standard' interviews. At the beginning of the study, there was a face-to-face training session for all raters, with a requirement for reliability of >0.85. Rater training was repeated annually to re-establish reliability 31 .\nA total of 455 patients had complete datasets available for structural MRI and symptom scales for analysis of structure-symptom correlations 31, 32 . Of these 455 subjects, 181 individuals were categorized as having schizophrenia, 117 individuals as having schizoaffective disorder, and 157 individuals as having bipolar I disorder with psychotic features. 352 healthy controls were also evaluated in the larger study; they received structural MRIs but did not receive PANSS assessments."}, {"section_title": "MRI-structural imaging", "text": "High-resolution isotropic T1-weighted MPRAGE sequences were obtained. Sites used comparable but slightly different MPRAGE acquisition parameters; full details for each site have been described previously 31 . The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol was used at all sites to standardize imaging analysis (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). All images were subjected to a rigorous data quality control process. First, images were opened, converted to nifti format, and checked for scanner artifacts. If the images passed through this check, they were run through auto-recon 1 in FreeSurfer v5.1 35 . Images were then checked for remaining non-brain tissues (dura or sinus). Trained raters, all reliable above 95%, edited images to remove any remaining non-brain tissue. An independent rater then determined if images were adequately cleaned for segmentation, and images were then processed through auto-recon 2 and 3. Freesurfer v5.1 software was used to extract regional GMV, CT and CSA measurements. correlations with a symptom subscale, sub-regions of that lobe were then correlated with that symptom subscale in a step-down fashion (see Supplemental Table 1 for lists of the sub-regions that constituted each lobe).

A mean CT for each lobe was determined by calculating a weighted average of the cortical thicknesses of component sub-regions (i.e., CT of each sub-region multiplied by CSA of that sub-region, divided by total CSA for that lobe).\nLobes and sub-regions that showed significant correlations in the whole-group analysis were then tested for correlations with symptom subscales within each diagnostic group, and were corrected for total number of correlations tested within that diagnostic group. Symptom subscales and PANSS total scores were also correlated with total GMV. Finally, a supplemental analysis was done using current antipsychotic dose in chlorpromazine equivalents, which was only available for 295 out of 455 patients. Analyses were repeated in this subset of patients with and without chlorpromazine dose as a co-variate to evaluate the impact of this co-variate."}, {"section_title": "Exploratory factor analysis", "text": "To construct an enriched sample of brain regions, all regional structural measures (80 GMV measures, 66 CSA measures, and 66 CT measures) were first screened for correlations with the positive and negative symptom subscales. Regional measures that correlated with the positive subscale at a significance level of p < 0.05, uncorrected, were entered into factor analysis. These regional measures were regressed against age, ICV, sex, and race. The residuals of these regressions were then used to create the correlation matrix for factor analysis, as has been done with structural brain measures previously 37, 38 ; that is, the correlation matrix for factor analysis consisted of partial correlations among these regional measures, controlling for covariates of age, ICV, sex, and race.\nPrincipal factor extraction (also called 'principal axes factoring') was used to extract factors because of deviations from multivariate normality 39 . A scree test was performed to obtain an initial estimate of number of factors 40, 41 . Additionally, several factor analyses were performed using different numbers of factors and were evaluated for overall factor structure. A final number of factors was chosen if it produced factors with no or few item cross-loadings and at least three variable loadings above 0.45 42 . Direct oblique rotation was performed to assess if factors were correlated with each other. Factor scores for subjects were derived using regression to maximize determinacy of scores 43 .\nEach factor score was entered as a predictor into a regression model with a full set of covariates (see previous section) to verify associations with the positive symptom subscale. Next, all factor scores were entered into a single model with co-variates to assess their relative correlations with symptom subscale scores. To assess specificity of correlations between factor scores and symptom subscales, factor scores were also tested for correlations with the negative subscale. Finally, to assess diagnosis by structure interactions, models were re-run with the inclusion of diagnosis and diagnosis by structure interaction terms. Assumptions of multiple regression were tested through visualization of QQ plots and residual-versus-fitted plots.\nAn identical and separate factor analysis process was performed using those regions that correlated with the negative symptom subscale.

Initial screening revealed that 58 out of 212 regions were correlated with the positive subscale (p < 0.05, uncorrected). Scree test suggested between 4 and 6 factors, and further evaluation supported four reliable factors: a temporal CT factor, a frontal GMV factor, a fronto-parietal CT factor, and a precuneus GMV-SA factor (Table 3, Supplemental   Table 3 ). There were no cross-loadings of variables.

Partial correlations were used to evaluate symptom correlations with individual regions, and factor analysis was used to summarize and compare structuresymptom relationships. The PANSS positive subscale correlated with reductions in both temporal and frontal structural measures. Among regions correlating with the positive subscale, factor analysis identified a temporal CT factor, a frontal GMV factor, a fronto-parietal CT factor, and a precuneus GMV-SA factor, of which the temporal CT and frontal GMV factors independently predicted positive symptom severity when all four factors were jointly entered in a regression model. 47 or GMV in regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus 48, 49 . Abnormalities in frontal regions could impact cognitive processes of working memory, attention, and language processing 50 , contributing to positive symptoms such as disorganization and delusions.\nComparing diagnostic groups, structure-symptom correlations were larger in the schizophrenia group than in the two other diagnostic categories. However, our factor analysis did not find significant interactions between diagnosis and structural factors on symptom subscales, indicating no major impact of diagnosis on structure-symptom correlations. Overall, findings in the schizophrenia group may reflect their higher level of subtle brain pathology, which may in turn be associated with their more chronic and persistent psychotic symptoms compared with schizoaffective and bipolar I disorders. Differences in exposure to antipsychotic medication are unlikely to completely account for the larger effect sizes of correlations in schizophrenia. While individuals with schizophrenia typically have greater exposure to antipsychotics than individuals with bipolar disorder, our secondary analyses found that antipsychotic medication dose did not have a major impact on effect sizes of correlations.\nThe PANSS negative subscale correlated inversely with CSA of right frontal regions, and factor analysis identified a frontal GMV-SA factor among those regions that correlated with the negative subscale. These results corroborate prior studies reporting correlations between frontal reductions and negative symptoms 13, [51] [52] [53] , and inverse correlations between regional cerebral blood flow and negative symptoms on positron emission tomography (PET) scans 54 . Overall, the negative subscale demonstrated fewer correlations with structural measures than the positive subscale. This observation may indicate the relatively greater contribution of social and nonstructural biological influences in the manifestation of negative symptoms.\nAs predicted, CT and CSA diverged in their associations with symptom subscales. CT reductions exhibited more correlations with symptom subscales, particularly the positive subscale, than CSA. Interestingly, one recent trans-diagnostic study of schizophrenia and bipolar I found more widespread regional reductions in CT than in CSA 20 . This study (and an earlier study with the same subject sample) did not find associations of either type of structural measure with symptom subscales 20, 22 . Our findings suggest that CT may be more closely associated with symptoms of psychosis than CSA. These findings may reflect the distinct neurobiological processes underlying these two aspects of structure. As mentioned earlier, recent research\nindicates that CT and CSA may have distinct genetic influences 28 , may follow independent developmental trajectories in childhood 27 , and may not be highly correlated with each other 20 .\nCT has been shown to fluctuate in response to environmental factors such as cannabis use 55, 56 and childhood trauma 56 , and may represent a \"state\" marker that tracks more closely with fluctuating positive symptoms than CSA. Given the more widespread correlations of CT with the symptom dimensions, particularly the positive subscale, future investigations may wish to focus on pathophysiological processes of CT as driving the development of psychosis.\nNotably, while correlations were significant, their magnitudes were small, indicating that other factors likely make independent contributions to symptom severity. Symptom severity is partly driven by social factors, such as education and socioeconomic status, whose neurobiological effects may not be captured by structural measures. Additionally, small effect sizes of structure-symptom correlations may complement the findings of neuropathology studies of schizophrenia, which observe subtle reductions in cortical neuropil and volumes of neuronal cell bodies, rather than loss of neurons 57, 58 . The effect sizes of our correlations may also reflect the influence of processes that enlarge structural measures. For example, inflammation, which may be important in early stages of schizophrenia 59 , could lead to structural enlargement through free water retention, thus reducing the strength of inverse correlations between structure and symptoms. Overall, the small effect sizes of structure-symptom correlations corroborate the concept of psychosis as a disorder of network connectivity 60 , involving subtle neurochemical and neurophysiological alterations in the interactions between brain regions. Our observations of frontal and temporal contributions to psychosis is consistent with the possibility that frontotemporal connectivity may be of particular importance in the pathogenesis of positive symptoms 61 .\nThis study had several strengths. This is one of the largest sample sizes thus far in which this question has been examined. Inclusion of all three diagnostic categories permitted the examination of associations in psychosis in a trans-diagnostic fashion, and inclusion of CT and CSA permitted exploration of their relative associations with symptom subscales. Many potential confounding factors were included in the analysis. Additionally, the subject sample consisted of clinically stable, chronically ill individuals. Structural and physiological abnormalities may change across the course of illness in psychosis 62 , and structural alterations may be more relevant in understanding persistent symptoms in a chronic population. Thus, our results may reflect more stable correlations between brain structure and residual, treatment-resistant psychopathology. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 There were several limitations. Because data were cross-sectional, it was not possible to draw conclusions about causal relationships. The region-of-interest analysis necessitated a heavy correction for multiple comparisons, which may have obscured some findings. Additionally, data on subjects' lifetime history of antipsychotic use were not collected, although current antipsychotic use was included. Longitudinal antipsychotic use may be associated with gray matter changes 63 and may have contributed to structure-symptom correlations in this study. Last, neuropsychological test results were not analyzed here, though they have been reported elsewhere in this sample 64 .\nIn conclusion, among a combined group of individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar I disorders, the PANSS positive subscale was inversely correlated with GMV and cortical thickness in frontal and temporal regions, while the PANSS negative subscale was inversely correlated with frontal cortical surface area and GMV. Overall, cortical thickness appeared more strongly associated with psychopathology, particularly the positive subscale, than cortical surface area. However, the magnitudes of all correlations were low. These results lend support to associations between structural brain alterations and severity of psychopathology.
