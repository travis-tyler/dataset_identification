[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite complex theories about the process of human development and the influences of childhood environments (see, e.g., Bronfenbrenner and Morris 1998;Sharkey 2008;Shonkoff and Phillips 2000), scholars in the social sciences have tended to rely on relatively crude measurement techniques to characterize children's social surroundings-including their primary and secondary schools. The basic setup is fairly standard: contextual characteristics like pupil-teacher ratio or per pupil expenditures are measured at a particular moment in time, or within a short observation period, and then these measurements are related to outcomes that are observed either contemporaneously or at some point in the future (Bankston and Caldas 1996;Condron and Roscigno 2003;Crosnoe 2009;Legewie and DiPrete 2012;Mayer and Jencks 1989). Historical data describing young people's previous environments are rarely incorporated, and variation in the length and/or timing of their exposures is frequently ignored. I argue that this conceptualization of \"context\" is problematic for at least two reasons. First, if the characteristics of young people's environments vary in meaningful ways over the course of their early life (either because they move between contexts or because their contexts change around them), then one-time assessments of those environments will misrepresent their lived experiences, compromising the ability of researchers to properly evaluate the importance of different contextual characteristics (Wolfe et al. 1996). Second, if the effects associated with childhood settings are conditional on the age of the individual or the duration of their exposure (Baumert, Nagy, and Lehmann 2012;Doyle et al. 2009;Haveman and Wolfe 1994;Heckman 2006;Reynolds et al. 2011;Shonkoff 2010), the findings that emerge from traditional cross-sectional analyses may be incomplete (or worse yet, inaccurate), failing to reflect differential effects stemming from individuals' time-indexed circumstances (Bronfenbrenner 1995). In this article, I explore these possibilities through an examination of school effects evidence of a relationship between school characteristics and student achievement (Betts 1995;Grogger 1996b;Hanushek 2003;Hoxby 2000b;Jencks 1975;Jencks et al. 1972;Milesi and Gamoran 2006), especially once differences in student background are taken into account. Others have argued that the effects associated with schools may actually be quite substantial (see, e.g., Arum and LaFree 2008;Condron and Roscigno 2003;Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2009;Imberman, Kugler, and Sacerdote 2012;Legewie and DiPrete 2012;Park, Behrman, and Choi 2013), identifying factors like class size, teacher quality, and the sociodemographic characteristics of students' peers as potentially important determinants of learning and achievement (see, e.g., Bankston and Caldas 1996;Chaudhary 2009;Crosnoe 2009;Downey and Shana 2004;Goldhaber 2002;Jennings and DiPrete 2010; Konstantopoulos and Chung 2009;Milesi and Gamoran 2006). Although these studies have often produced divergent results, researchers working in this area have been remarkably consistent in one important respect: they typically observe school characteristics at a single moment in time (usually early in the elementary school years or when students first enter high school), and then use those cross-sectional measurements as regressors in multivariate models predicting students' achievement and/or post-secondary outcomes (including college enrollment and income). Well-known examples include Bankston and Caldas' (1996) study of school composition (when students' were in the tenth grade) and academic achievement; Condron and Roscigno's (2003) investigation into school spending (observed during the third grade) and standardized test scores; and Grogger's (1996a) work linking educational inputs like pupilteacher ratio and class size to students' wages and future labor market outcomes. This approach raises important conceptual questions. If students' school exposures remain stable over time and across institutional boundaries, then a single-point-in-time measurement of school characteristics should suffice. In other words, if students who 4 attend advantaged (disadvantaged) secondary schools are the same students who attend advantaged (disadvantaged) primary schools, then the difference between a cross-sectional indicator and a variable that captures over-time variation in contextual characteristics would be mostly inconsequential. If, however, education is better understood as an additive process (Baumert, Nagy, and Lehmann 2012;Entwisle, Alexander, and Olson 2005;Heckman 2008)-in which resources, enrollments, and institutional environments vary in from one school year to the next (either because schools themselves change or because students move between schools)-then ignoring the chronological patterning of students' exposures would seem to pose a potentially serious problem. Unfortunately, there are good theoretical reasons to think that the latter scenario is the more likely one. Over the course of their childhood and adolescent years, many children move from one neighborhood setting to another (DeLuca and Dayton 2009;Ihrke and Faber 2012;Raudenbush, Jean, and Art 2011). Estimates indicate that roughly five out of six youth change their place of residence at least once prior to turning age 15 (Duncan and Raudenbush 1999), and nearly three out of five experience a corresponding transfer between schools (Rumberger 2003). If these moves are not all lateral moves with respect to school characteristics (e.g., transferring out of a low pupil teacher ratio school and into a school with similar pupil teacher ratios), heterogeneity over time should result. Some students will attend qualitatively similar schools for the entirety of their academic career, whereas others will experience significant changes as they make their way through the educational system (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Kain 2005). This suggests that students' experiences may vary not only in terms of where they went to school, but also in terms of when they were exposed to a particular school environment and how long their exposure lasted. These temporal distinctions could be important. Recent research in psychology, neurobiology, and elsewhere suggests that contextual exposures at younger ages are more consequential for children's social (Gormley et al. 2011), emotional (Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev 2013), and intellectual development (Doyle et al. 2009). According to these studies, the foundations for long-term success are established during children's early years through a process that is \"exquisitely sensitive\" to contextual factors (Yoshikawa et al. 2013). Early experiences in the home, in child care settings, in neighborhoods, and in schools interact with children's genes to shape brain architecture, thus influencing the acquisition of important cognitive and noncognitive skills. Prolonged exposure to enriched environments cements early gains, setting the stage for future success in school, at work, and in other social domains. Empirical evidence supporting this framework has accumulated quickly in recent years-especially within the literature on neighborhood effects. Researchers working in this area have now shown that longer exposures to disadvantaged neighborhoods amplify the negative consequences that these environments have for young people's developmenta duration effect (Ludwig et al. 2011)-and that the effect sizes associated with these exposures vary systematically depending on the child's age-a timing effect (Sharkey and Faber 2014). The outcomes examined in this work include verbal ability (Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush 2008), cognitive performance (Sharkey and Elwert 2011), educational attainment (Crowder and South 2011; Wodtke, Harding, and Elwert 2011), subjective well-being (Ludwig et al. 2012), externalizing and internalizing problems (Wheaton and Clarke 2003), and teenage pregnancy (Wodtke 2013). Similar processes could also operate with respect to school exposures and student learning. If a hypothetical student enrolls at a resource-rich elementary school at a young age (e.g., a kindergarten with low pupil-teacher ratios), it may enable her to more rapidly acquire valuable cognitive and non-cognitive skills due to the sensitive nature of early childhood development (Shonkoff and Phillips 2001). If the child remains enrolled at a 6 similarly advantaged school in subsequent years, her more rapid acquisition of skills could facilitate further gains in learning as previous gains are consolidated and as her skills and abilities continue to accumulate (Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach 2010). Over time, these processes could become self-reinforcing, leading to large gains in achievement that would not have been realized had the longitudinal patterning of the student's exposures been different than what it actually was. Heckman and Masterov (2007) refer to this as the \"productivity argument\" for investing in children at younger ages. In this article, my primary objective is to understand whether a longitudinal approach to measuring school-level variables-that captures students' history of school context exposures-allows for a more complete understanding of how school effects operate. To accomplish this objective, I analyze multi-year trajectories of school context exposure (that unfold as students move from one grade to the next) and then relate these trajectories to students' achievement as observed at the end of their middle school years. This approach-which has been profitably applied within a number of problem domains outside of the school effects literature (see, e.g., Pais, Crowder, and Downey 2014)provides the leverage I need to ascertain and model over-time variation in students' exposures to different school-level variables. In the two sections that follow, I describe the data and methods I use to implement my approach, and then go on to present results from the main part of my analysis. I then conclude with a discussion of the results."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "To consider the merits of the ideas presented above, I draw on data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the ECLS-K was a large, nationally representative, longitudinal study of U.S. children who were enrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 1998. Data on students, their parents, their teachers, their school administrators, and their schools were collected at six points in time (the fall and spring of kindergarten, and the spring of first, third, fifth, and eighth grade) using a rich multisource, multi-method design (for more details on the survey instrument and design see Tourangeau et al. 2009). 1 The primary sampling units were counties or groups of counties, from which about 1,000 public and private schools (with kindergartens) were selected. Approximately 23 children in each school were chosen for the study, with an oversample of Asian Americans and students who attend private schools. Although nearly 19,700 students completed the base year survey, issues related to missing data limit my analysis to just over 7,700 observations (in accordance with the ECLS-K's restricted-use data agreement, all of the samples sizes that I report are rounded to the nearest 10). Most of this missingness (n = 8,530) is by design, as the ECLS-K only followed a random sub-sample of students who changed schools between survey waves, and then compensated for the resulting losses through adjustments to the sampling weights. The remainder stems from item-level missing data (n = 100) and subject attrition (n = 3,350). 2 To ease the impact of the former, I multiply imputed missing values using the chained equations, where the number of imputed data sets equals 10 (results were insensitive to decision concerning the number of imputations). Following von Hippel's (2007), I included cases with missing values on the dependent variables during imputation but deleted them prior to running my analyses."}, {"section_title": "Time-varying measures of school contexts", "text": "The top panel of Table 1 provides means, standard deviations, and other descriptive 1 Data were also collected from a random sub-sample of students in the fall of first grade (27% of students participated in this wave). I do not use these data in my analyses. 2 Previous studies of attrition from the ECLS-K have found that the characteristics of respondents and non-respondents are generally quite similar (Bose and West 2002). 8 statistics for my time-varying measures of school context. To obtain valid information on students' schooling environments in each year between kindergarten and 8th grade, I linked their ECLS-K records to school characteristics data provided by NCES via the Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Universe Survey (PSS). 3 Because the PSS is conducted biennially, I interpolated data for \"off years\" using a linear function in time. Matches were performed using school identifiers available in the restricted-use ECLS-K file. The specific contextual measures that I examine-pupil-teacher ratio, percent minority, and percent eligible for free/reduced-priced lunch-are all school-level variables that (with the exception of free or reduced-priced lunch) can be calculated for students in public and private institutions. 4 These three measures-which tap different 3 Although it would have been preferable to analyze a complete year-by-year time series of students' exposures to different school, classroom, and teacher characteristics, I know of no data set that would allow for such analyses. The ECLS-K provides information about all three levels, but only does so for a subset of years in a student's early educational career. Other administrative data sets (e.g., the UTD Texas School Project or the North Carolina data) provide annual information about classroom or school characteristics, but usually do so for a constrained range of grades (e.g., 3rd through 7th grade) and often lack baseline measures of achievement and/or other important covariates. By merging the ECLS-K with the CCD and PSS, I was able to construct an annual record of students' exposures to three commonly analyzed school-level variables, while retaining the unusually rich set of background measures that the ECLS-K offers. This choice represents a compromise, but one that seems justified given the nature of my analyses. dimensions of students' school context exposures-have been used extensively in past research (Condron 2009;Crosnoe 2009;Kahlenberg 2001;Leithwood and Jantzi 2009). Theoretical explanations for why these variables might influence students' academic outcomes tend to focus on the importance of normative processes and the existence of organizational constraints (Coleman 1988;Hallinan 1988). The general argument is intuitive: schools that serve advantaged students frequently have more resources at their disposal and stronger academic climates, allowing for better instruction as well as the emergence of important peer effects (Hanushek and Rivkin 2012;Palardy and Rumberger 2008;Sacerdote 2014). Students who attend these schools are likely to benefit from the positive influence of significant others, closer interactions with their teachers, smaller classes, and more advanced curricular options (Alexander, Entwisle, and Horsey 1997;Condron 2009;Kozol 2005;Morgan and Sorensen 1999;Roscigno 1998), all of which are thought to promote achievement. Although the school-level measures that I use in my analyses do not capture these processes directly, they do provide informative proxies. 5 Generating a time-series of school characteristics data for students who remained in a single school throughout the entire period was generally straightforward: respondents were linked to school records (using unique school identifiers) and then the relevant school characteristic data (for each school year between 1998-1999 and 2006-2007) were appended to each case. This process was slightly more complicated for students who public and private schools-with students getting missing values for the years they spent in private schools-produced similar results. 5 Schools with large fractions of minority students, for example, tend to have more novice teachers , greater teacher turnover (Fryer and Levitt 2004), fewer teachers with advanced academic preparation (Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2002), and less supportive academic climates (Hoxby 2000a). moved between schools due to a scheduled promotion (e.g., the move from elementary school to middle school) or transfer. In these cases, I used information about students' residential mobility (taken from parent interviews), their previous and current school's lowest and highest grades offered (taken from the CCD and PSS), and their dates of enrollment (taken from student record abstracts) to infer when the switch was made. 6 Most students (n = 6,573) made at least one move between schools, with the most common transitions occurring after kindergarten and before the sixth grade."}, {"section_title": "Outcomes", "text": "My dependent variables-which are summarized in the bottom panel of Table 1, and which have been widely used in prior studies-are based on cognitive assessments in reading and math that were group-administered to children in paper-and-pencil format at the beginning of their 8th grade year (Tourangeau et al. 2009). According to the ECLS-K's documentation, assessment items were created in consultation with state officials, elementary content specialists, and multicultural experts. All items were field-tested and their construct validity confirmed by verifying that student performance consistently correlated with other, more established measures of academic achievement (Najarian et al. 2009). My analysis uses the item response theory-derived theta scores, which provide interval-scaled, normally distributed measures of children's underlying academic ability, ranging from approximately 0 to 2.5. For more details on these measures and their construction see the ECLS-K psychometric reports (Najarian et al. 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "To account for sociodemographic factors that may co-vary with school characteristics and students' academic achievement, I created indicators of (1) the child's gender, race, and family type (1 = two parents, 0 = otherwise; measured at baseline and during the final follow-up wave); and (2) the mother and father's age, socioeconomic status (a continuous scale based on questions about education, income, and occupation), and expectations concerning their child's future educational attainment (1 = the child will attend college, 0 = otherwise; measured during the baseline wave). 7 To control for the confounding effects of student mobility, I constructed a count of the number of residential moves that the child experienced and the number of schools that they attended (summed across all survey waves); I also constructed a summary measure indicating whether their parents ever based their residential choices on the perceived quality of area schools (1 = yes, 0 = no). Finally, to adjust for pre-existing differences in students' cognitive ability, I include baseline measures of their reading and math achievement scores in all of my models. Because students' school exposures are not allocated randomly, issues related to selection are always present in analyses of school effects (Duncan and Raudenbush 1999). This project is no different in that regard. For the purposes of my analysis, what matters most is that I am able to control for events or experiences that could influence both the shape of students' school context trajectories and their achievement at the end of the time series. Residential moves and school transfers represent the biggest threat in this regard (Rumberger 2003), and therefore enter my models in the two forms listed above. Although the inclusion of these variables (along with the other covariates summarized above) is not enough to justify strong causal assertions about the effects of school context trajectories 7 NCES provides a composite SES scale that was computed using information from both the mother and father of the focal child. If only one parent was present, the scale was computed by averaging the available components (see Tourangeau et al. 2009 for more details). I use the base-year measure in my analyses. on students' achievement, it does help to minimize concerns regarding unobserved heterogeneity. This is an issue that I shall return to in the discussion section."}, {"section_title": "Identifying school context trajectories", "text": "Longitudinal surveys, like the ECLS-K, are frequently used in the social sciences to understand and analyze how individuals' behaviors and experiences change over time; to ascertain whether change is greater for one subpopulation versus another; to determine whether the change process can be predicted by auxiliary variables; and to examine the consequences that these changes have for people's subsequent experiences, behaviors, and outcomes. Several statistical estimators have been developed to analyze longitudinal data of this sort, including hierarchical linear models (Bryk and Raudenbush 1987), latent growth curve models (LGCMs) (Bollen and Curran 2005;Duncan, Duncan, and Strycker 2006), group-based trajectory models (Nagin 2005), and growth mixture models (GMMs) (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n 2000). In the first part of my analysis, I use the latter type of model (GMMs) to characterize students' full history of school characteristic exposures."}, {"section_title": "Conceptually, GMMs are similar to", "text": "LGCMs in that they model change in a variable that has been measured repeatedly over time (Bollen and Curran 2005). Where the two approaches differ is in their treatment of heterogeneity. Rather than assuming that everyone's experiences vary continuously around a single mean growth curve (as is the case with LCGMs), the mixture modeling approach identifies distinct classes (or clusters) of individuals whose experiences vary around different underlying trajectories (Muth\u00e9n 2004). Latent growth curves are then estimated separately for each of the classes, producing a variety of different trajectory shapes. This setup is ideal for my purposes as it allows me to model situations in which the level of exposure to a given school-level variable (e.g., pupil-teacher ratio) is stable for some students, but increasing, decreasing, or changing in other complicated ways over time for others. 8 A graphical depiction of the GMM that I estimate is given in Figure 1. In the diagram, the latent categorical variable c i indicates which trajectory class the ith student belongs to, where c i = 1, \u2026 , J. Each class is allowed to take a distinct form, defined by an intercept ( 0 j \uf070 ), slope ( 1 j \uf070 ), and quadratic term ( 2 j \uf070 ). Students are assigned probabilistically to the latent trajectory class that most closely approximates their observed sequence of school exposures, denoted by Y i = y i1 , y i2 , \u2026, y i9 . Class-specific covariance matrices allow for individual heterogeneity within classes, but variance estimates are constrained to be equal across trajectories in order to facilitate model convergence. 9 To avoid local solutions, I generated 800 randomly perturbed sets of starting values and then optimized the 200 best sets. My final estimates were obtained from model runs in which the best log-likelihood was replicated at least once, suggesting that the global maximum likelihood solution was successfully reached. A major benefit of the mixture modeling approach is the ability to predict distal outcomes using respondents' inferred trajectory groups. 9 To assess the robustness of my results, I also fit models where the class-specific covariance was fixed to zero for all classes and where no functional form was assumed when modeling students' trajectories of school context exposure (Warren et al. 2015). These models-which are referred to as latent class growth models and longitudinal latent class models, respectively-produced substantively similar results. 14 between individuals' trajectory group assignments and their 8th grade reading and math scores; these models include the full set of controls described above. My primary objective is to determine whether and how long-term trajectories of school exposure are related to students' achievement. Throughout, I allow students to have fractional class membership (nonzero values for more than one class) to reflect uncertainty in the classification of individuals across trajectory groups. All of the estimates that I present have been weighted to correct for over-samples, non-response, and random sub-sampling, and I have adjusted standard errors to account for the ECLS-K's complex sample design. 10"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "How stable are students' school exposures over time? As a first pass at this question, Table 2a presents correlations for the three variables under consideration: pupil-teacher 10 Some researchers have questioned whether this estimation strategy is overly-prone to identifying specific types of trajectories (Sher, Jackson, and Steinley 2011). As a crude test of this possibility-which has been labeled the \"cat's cradle\" problem due to the disproportionate number of analyses that produce trajectories whose criss-crossing paths that resemble a cat's cradle-I estimated a series of ancillary GMMs using varying definitions of the time horizon (i.e., K-1 st grade, K-3 rd grade, K-5 th grade) and then compared the results across models. These analyses revealed substantial variation with respect to the shape and prevalence of the estimated trajectories, with simpler patterns emerging in model runs where the time horizon was constrained to include fewer years and more complex patterns emerging when I used a fuller portion of the time series. I take this as evidence that the preferred latent class solutions in my analyses are not \"predetermined\", but instead depend on actual patterns in the data. See Appendix Figure A1 for more information. ratio, percent minority, and percent free/reduced lunch. Column 1 gives correlations between school characteristics in kindergarten and all subsequent years; columns 2-9 give correlations for other grade-to-grade combinations. As might be expected, the strength of the associations decrease as the time interval expands. In terms of pupil-teacher ratios, there is only a weak relationship between where students start their career and where they end up (r k,8 = 0.32), with the largest year-to-year change coming between fifth and sixth grade (r 5,6 = 0.54). For the other two measures, the relationship is somewhat stronger: correlations in the off-diagonal are generally high, and there is greater similarity between exposures in kindergarten and exposures in eighth grade (r k,8 \u2265 0.70). How much of this variance is due to children changing schools and how much is due to schools changing around children? In Table 2b, I restrict the analysis to the select subsample of students who attended the same school throughout the entire nine-year period (n = 1,230); the results provide evidence about the extent of over-time changes in schools themselves. In Table 2c, I repeat this exercise using students (n = 1,895) who changed schools more than once; the results provide evidence about the degree to which movements between schools induce variation in children's exposures. Comparing the two sets of matrices, it would appear as though most of the change is attributable to students who made multiple school transitions (due to non-structural moves and/or scheduled school promotions). The correlations are substantially attenuated for this group, suggesting the presence of more year-to-year variation."}, {"section_title": "Modeling students' trajectories of exposure using GMMs", "text": "To determine how many trajectories are needed to capture and model this variation, I estimated a series of GMMs that differed only in terms of the number of latent trajectory classes c (c = 1, \u2026, J) that they included. I then relied on the Lo-Mendell-Rubin (2001) likelihood-ratio test (LMR-LRT) to identify the best-fitting solution. The test, which has performed well in simulation-based studies (Nylund, Asparaouhov, and Muth\u00e9n 2007;Tofighi and Enders 2007), produces a p-value that indicates whether a model with j classes can be rejected in favor of a model with j + 1. As illustrated in Table 3, I added groups in iterative fashion until further improvement in model fit (i.e., p < .05) could not be achieved (results for other commonly-used goodness-of-fit indices-including BIC, sample-size adjusted BIC, AIC, VLMR, and the entropy index-were generally consistent). My preferred model specifications are highlighted in bold. What do the school context trajectories produced by these models look like? In Figure 2, I graph the preferred solution for the pupil-teacher ratio variable. Estimated means at each time point are indicated by the solid black line, and the shaded gray areas give 95% confidence intervals around these means. Unlike what one would expect to find in an environment characterized by perfect or near perfect stability, there appears to be at least some heterogeneity over time in students' contextual exposures. Although the most frequently observed patterns (\"medium-stable\" and \"high-stable\") show little to no change in pupil-teacher ratios across grades, they describe the experiences of less than two-thirds of the sample. The other three trajectories-characterizing a combined 39.4% of the population-reveal an assortment of increasing (\"medium-increasing\"), decreasing (\"highdecreasing\"), and U-shaped trends (\"medium-low-medium\"). Complex patterns were also detected for the two compositional variables, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. For both measures, the preferred solution identified two large and stable trajectory classes that ran parallel to one another throughout the entire time period (I have labeled these trajectories \"low-stable\" and \"high-stable\"), and two smaller and less stable classes whose trajectories crisscross around grade 4 or 5 (\"low-increasing\" and \"highdecreasing\"). Although the latter groups are clearly in the minority, they are not such a small minority so as to eliminate the concerns raised earlier. Even for a relatively \"sticky\" characteristic like percent minority, there are still non-trivial numbers of students whose point-in-time environments poorly approximate their longer-term exposures. The end result is a collection of trajectories that converge, bifurcate, and intersect in complicated ways as students make their way from kindergarten to eighth grade."}, {"section_title": "Sociodemographic composition of different trajectory groups", "text": "Do persons in different trajectories differ with respect to their sociodemographic characteristics? The best way to answer this question, at least at the bivariate level, is to cross-classify trajectory group membership with various measures of social background. Table 4 provides  The descriptive analyses presented in Table 4 suggest that respondents are not distributed randomly to the trajectory groups identified earlier. Instead, students appear to be sorted into trajectories on the basis of their background characteristics. More advantaged students tend to experience more stable trajectories that are consistently characterized by lower pupil-teacher ratios, less poverty, and relatively smaller minority populations. In contrast, less advantaged students and minorities are disproportionately grouped into the less stable (or stable but high pupil-teacher ratio, high minority, high poverty) groups, creating a potentially adverse mix of early and long-term school-context exposures. Although the exact consequences of these groupings remain to be seen, it seems reasonable to think that they could produce a kind of \"double bind,\" whereby less advantaged students not only experience unfavorable environments at specific points in time, but also experience them during sensitive periods and for longer durations."}, {"section_title": "The importance of trajectories of exposure", "text": "In the foregoing analysis, I summarized the characteristics of students' school context trajectories and the students who populate them. Variation was evident for all three school-level variables, and differences in the patterning of students' exposures were sometimes pronounced. In this section, I carry out tests that are designed to show whether these dynamics are related to students' eighth grade achievement scores and whether they matter net of students' circumstances at particular points in time. These tests, which are shown in Table 5, compare the model fit obtained from specifications that include initial and contemporaneous measures of school context (Models 1-2), trajectory-based measures (Model 3), and a combination thereof (Models 4-6). Because I use an identical controls throughout, the relative performance of these models can be evaluated using F-tests. 11 Under the null hypothesis, adding the trajectory-based indicators to the point-in-time specifications should have no effect on the overall fit of the model. 12 The results from these analyses are consistent across outcomes and unambiguous. According to the p-values presented in the last three rows of Table 5, the null hypothesis 11 These analyses and those that follow are restricted to students with valid trajectory assignments for all three school-level variables, and thus include only students who attended public schools. Similar results were obtained when fitting models that only included one trajectory type (e.g., percent minority) at a time, allowing for the inclusion of both public and private school students. is easily rejected for the comparisons between Model 1 and 4 and Models 2 and 5 (where trajectory-based measures are added to the point-in-time specifications), but not for the comparisons between Model 3 and 6 (where both point-in-time indicators are added to a specification that already includes the trajectory-based measures). 13 These findings provide support for the basic theoretical framework outlined earlier. Knowing something about students' long-term trajectories of school context exposures (via the inclusion of the trajectory-based indicators) improves one's ability to explain their academic success, even when temporally proximate and lagged measures of their schooling environments are included in the model. Capturing students' full history of school context exposures would appear to be a useful exercise in this regard."}, {"section_title": "Modeling the effects of specific trajectory types", "text": "The results that I have presented thus far demonstrate the value of taking a \"longer view\" of contextual exposures, but they do not give a sense of the strength or direction of the associations between student achievement and specific trajectory types. In the final part of my analysis, I evaluate the relationship between certain types of contextual trajectories and students' reading and math scores. As noted earlier, theories of child development, learning, and skill acquisition all suggest that the temporal properties of students' exposures should matter with respect to academic achievement. In particular, these theories suggest that early exposures should be more consequential than later exposure and that longer exposures should have a greater effect than those that are temporary or 13 Although the positive increments to R 2 from adding the trajectory measures may appear small, they are roughly commensurate to the change that occurs when family structure and college expectations are added to the otherwise fully-specified model. 20 intermittent in nature. In this section, I provide an assessment of these ideas by regressing students' achievement onto indicators of their school context trajectories. Parameter estimates for each trajectory are presented in Table 6, with all models including the full set of controls. To facilitate interpretation, I selected the modal trajectory to serve as the reference category for all three variables. Reading down the columns, it appears as though children who attended schools with high pupil-teacher ratios (\"high stable\" or \"high-decreasing\"), higher concentrations of minorities (\"highstable\" or \"high-decreasing\"), and more disadvantaged students (\"high stable\") did worse with respect to achievement than their peers in each of the respective reference groups. Members of these groups have one thing in common: they experienced less favorable environments at younger ages, when children may be relatively more sensitive to the influence of key contextual variables (Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach 2010). I take this as evidence of a timing effect, where differences at the outset of the educational career lead to differences in student outcomes at later points in time. The coefficients given in Table 6 are modestly sized. The estimated difference in achievement between students in the \"medium-stable\" and \"high-stable\" pupil-teacher ratio trajectories, for example, was around a tenth of a point ( reading = -0.10, math = -0.09) in both reading and math. This corresponds to around one-quarter of a standard deviation (\u03c3 reading = 0.38, \u03c3 math = 0.44), or roughly two-thirds of the effect associated with parental education (students who had at least one parent with a college degree scored 0.15 higher in reading and math, on average, than students who did not). Similar effects were observed for students in the \"high decreasing\" pupil-teacher ratio group ( = -0.07 for both tests); for students whose schools had consistently large minority populations throughout the full time period ( reading = -0.07, math = -0.06); and for students who attended schools where a large fraction of students were eligible to receive free or reduced-21 price lunch ( = -0.06 for both tests)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper, I argued that school effects researchers too often pay inadequate attention to temporal variation in the contextual characteristics that students experience as they move from grade to grade and school to school. In an attempt to overcome this inadequacy, I described a new (and more theoretically grounded) way to conceptualize and measure the different schooling environments that young people pass through as they progress through their educational career. Using a finite mixture modeling strategy and a nationally-representative longitudinal data set, I empirically tested for and identified a series of qualitatively distinct school context trajectories that began in kindergarten and ended when students were in the eighth grade. The results suggest that these trajectories vary considerably with respect to shape, with some students experiencing appreciable changes in their schooling environments over time. In the second part of my analysis, I linked students' long-term trajectories of school context exposure to their academic achievement (as measured in the eighth grade), and showed that these trajectories mattered even after controlling for more conventional point-in-time indicators (which were also measured when students were in the eighth grade). These results suggest that students' academic performance is influenced not only by their present surroundings, but also by their prior history of school context exposures. This conclusion has important implications for how researchers think about the relationship between school-level variables and student outcomes. Being able to locate a child within a school at a given point in time may be informative, but for some students a complete longitudinal record is needed to fully appreciate the complex relationship between school exposures and key measures of academic achievement. What are the mechanisms driving this result? Although I cannot definitively say why trajectory-based measures provide additional analytic leverage, it seems likely that the answer is related to the time-sensitive ways in which children learn (Knudsen et al. 2006;Siegler 1989). In prior research, scholars have argued that early exposures to resource-rich environments facilitate the development of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Cunha and Heckman 2007). Children's subsequent exposures can either sustain or undermine these early gains (Yoshikawa et al. 2013), a cumulative process that could eventually lead to large gaps in achievement between students with different histories of exposure (Duncan and Magnuson 2011;Shonkoff 2010). One of the primary benefits of using a trajectory-based approach is that it allows researchers to capture these dynamics by parsimoniously incorporating multiple years of school-level data. Social scientists should continue to explore these ideas. With the proliferation of rich longitudinal data sets and detailed contextual identifiers, the opportunities to apply a dynamic conceptualization of context are rapidly expanding. In this study, I focused my attention on student achievement. My analyses used data from a well-known longitudinal survey to model the relationship between a subset of school-level variables and two commonly-used measures of academic success. Follow-up studies would do well to consider additional outcomes (e.g., educational attainment), other contextual variables (e.g., academic climate), a longer time horizon (e.g., pre-kindergarten through high school), and different levels of analysis (e.g., classroom-level contextual effects). Results from these analyses could be used to inform decisions about the efficacy of different school-or classroom-based interventions, the ages when they should be implemented, and the amount of exposure time that would be necessary to establish the desired effects. While I can only speculate, my expectation is that classroom-level analyses would reveal even more variation than the school-level results that I have reported here. Research by Pianta et al. (2007) and others suggests that students' opportunities to learn can be quite turbulent over time, with some students experiencing substantial swings in the instructional and emotional climate of their classrooms from one year to the next. My analyses of variation at the school-level may smooth over some of this variability, producing a somewhat conservative view of the amount and importance of change over time in students' contextual exposures. If these speculations are correct, it would imply that children's actual histories of exposure depart from their point-in-time environments to a greater degree than my trajectory-based analyses indicate. Future researchers should follow-up on this possibility, perhaps using classroom-level data derived from one of the existing state-based student tracking systems. Follow-up studies should also take steps to determine whether the effects associated with students' school context trajectories are causal in nature. My goal in this paper was to establish the importance of longer-term school characteristics trajectories for analyses of academic achievement. Although I performed covariate adjustments for a large number of observed attributes (including attributes that are likely to influence both the shape of students' trajectories and their success in school), there is no guarantee that my specification was exhaustive. Using the conceptual framework and methodological tools that I described in this article, future researchers stand to benefit from a making a more concerted effort to adjust for possible confounds. Approaches that merge trajectory-based modeling strategies with flexible weighting estimators could offer a useful new direction in this regard (Lee 2014;Lee and Jackson 2015;Robins, Hernan, and Brumback 2000). The most important message coming out of this project is perhaps an intuitive one: just as children change and evolve over time, so can their proximal school environments. Movements between schools and slight changes within them combine to create complex trajectories of contextual exposure-especially for mobile students who undergo more frequent school transitions. Although researchers are increasingly aware of the dynamic relationship between individuals and their surroundings (see, e.g., Pais, Crowder, and Downey 2014), few have explored the implications that these ideas have for analyses of school effects. If the goal is to produce a clearer understanding of the relationship between school context variables and student outcomes, then further consideration of students' longer-run school exposures would seem warranted. Findings from this paper suggest that a trajectory-based conceptualization could provide a useful foundation upon which to base such research.

The sub-sample of movers used in these analyses includes those students who changed schools (due to a transfer or scheduled promotion) more than once (n = 1,895). See text for more details.   Notes: Six different models were fit for each outcome-one including contemporaneous measures of school context (Model 1), one including baseline measures of school context (Model 2), one including trajectory-based measures of school context (Model 3), and three including different combinations thereof (Models 4-6). Model comparisons were then carried out using F-tests; p-values from these tests are provided in parentheses at the bottom of the table. P-values below 0.05 indicate that the reduced model (Models 1-3) can be rejected in favor of the fuller specification (Models 4-6). All models include controls for achievement in kindergarten, race/ethnicity, gender, SES at baseline, parental expectations concerning college, family structure (measured at baseline and the final followup), number of residential moves, number of school changes, and whether the quality of area schools influenced parents' residential choices. Missing data were recovered through multiple imputation; the relevant test statistics were retrieved using the procedures outlined by Harel (2009). See text for further details.
