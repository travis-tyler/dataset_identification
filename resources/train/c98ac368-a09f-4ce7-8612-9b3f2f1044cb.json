[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Cerebral atherosclerosis is a leading cause of stroke and an important contributor to dementia. However, little is known about its molecular effects on the human brain and how these alterations may contribute to dementia. Here, we investigated these questions using large-scale quantification of over 8300 proteins from 438 post-mortem brains from a discovery and replication cohort. A proteome-wide association study and protein network analysis of cerebral atherosclerosis found 114 proteins and 5 protein co-expression modules associated with cerebral atherosclerosis. Enrichment analysis of these proteins and modules revealed that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with reductions in synaptic signaling and RNA splicing and increases in oligodendrocyte development and myelination.\nA subset of these proteins (n=23) and protein modules (n=2) were also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, implicating a shared mechanism with AD through decreased synaptic signaling and regulation and increased myelination. Notably, neurofilament light (NEFL) and medium (NEFM) chain proteins were among these 23 proteins, and our data suggest they contribute to AD dementia through cerebral atherosclerosis. Together, our findings offer insights into effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the human brain proteome, and how cerebral atherosclerosis contributes to dementia risk."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and its hallmark pathologies include b-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles 1 . Both b-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies have been studied extensively and found to contribute to synaptic loss, mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration [1] [2] [3] . Yet, it is increasingly recognized that multiple pathologies contribute to the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia in addition to its hallmark pathologies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Notably, cerebral atherosclerosis is an important contributor to the development of AD dementia [8] [9] [10] [11] and associated with approximately three times higher risk for AD dementia and nine times higher risk for vascular dementia [12] [13] [14] [15] . Despite the high prevalence of cerebral atherosclerosis and its contribution to stroke 16 , AD [8] [9] [10] [11] , and vascular dementia [12] [13] [14] [15] , we have limited insights into its molecular effects on the human brain, and how these contribute to dementia.\nCerebral atherosclerosis is the accumulation of cholesterol-laden plaques in the walls of large arteries leading to effects ranging from minor wall thickening to significant luminal stenosis and reduced blood flow to the brain 17, 18 . Cerebral atherosclerosis is a common condition with a prevalence that increases with age and with the presence of vascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, or smoking [17] [18] [19] . For example, it is present in 7% of asymptomatic middle-aged individuals and 82% of individuals over 80 years old 14, 20, 21 . Furthermore, cerebral atherosclerosis and its consequences, including lower brain perfusion and metabolism, are among the earliest changes associated with development of AD dementia [8] [9] [10] [11] .\nTo investigate molecular effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the human brain and how these contribute to dementia, we generated large-scale multiplex brain proteomic quantification of 8356 proteins in 391 subjects from the Religious Order Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP; discovery dataset) and 6533 proteins in 47 subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; replication dataset). These individuals underwent detailed neuropathological assessment of nine age-associated brain pathologiesb-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral atherosclerosis, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), TDP-43, Lewy body, and hippocampal sclerosis -allowing for the identification of the proteomic signature of cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the eight other measured pathologies.\nWe found that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with alterations in 114 proteins and 5 protein co-expression modules independently of the eight other measured brain pathologies. Gene set enrichment analysis of these altered proteins and modules revealed that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with decreased synaptic signaling and plasticity, less RNA splicing and processing, and more oligodendrocyte differentiation, development, and re-myelination.\nTo investigate how cerebral atherosclerosis contributes to AD dementia, we examined the overlap between proteins and protein modules that contribute to AD dementia and cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other eight measured brain pathologies. We found that cerebral atherosclerosis likely contributes to AD through reductions in synaptic signaling, plasticity, and regulation but increases in abundances of proteins involved in myelination, possibly in response to axonal injury.\nNotably, we found that abundances of neurofilament light (NEFL) and medium (NEFM) chain proteins were associated with cerebral atherosclerosis but not with any of the other eight measured pathologies. Specifically, increased levels of brain NEFL and NEFM proteins were associated with greater severity of cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other eight measured brain pathologies in both the discovery and replication datasets. Furthermore, increased levels of NEFL and NEFM proteins were associated with AD dementia in both the discovery and replication datasets, suggesting that NEFL and NEFM contribute to AD dementia through cerebral atherosclerosis.\nTogether, our novel findings provide insights into the direct molecular effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the human brain and how these can increase the risk of dementia. Furthermore, our findings provide promising protein targets for future studies to identify novel surrogate brain biomarkers for early detection of cerebral atherosclerosis and AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants for the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts)", "text": "A total of 391 participants were from two longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease -Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) cohorts ( Supplementary Table 1a ) 22 .

Gene set enrichment analysis of the 32 proteins with higher abundance in more severe cerebral atherosclerosis revealed enrichment for oligodendrocyte cell-type specific markers and for oligodendrocyte differentiation, development, and re-myelination ( Figure 3) .\nThe 82 lower-abundance proteins in greater cerebral atherosclerosis were enriched for RNA splicing and mRNA processing (Figure 3 ).\nThree sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the specificity of our findings for cerebral atherosclerosis. These analyses examined whether gross infarcts or microinfarcts (i.e., the consequence of cerebral atherosclerosis) or vascular risk factors (i.e., predisposing factors for atherosclerosis) were driving the changes in our initial analysis, or whether cerebral atherosclerosis itself was exerting these effects on the brain proteome. In the first analysis, we performed a PWAS of gross infarcts adjusting for the 8 other measured pathologies, which did not yield any significant proteins. Next, we performed a PWAS of cerebral atherosclerosis that did not adjust for gross infarcts but adjusted for all of the other 7 measured pathologies and found more proteins associated with cerebral atherosclerosis (n=237 proteins; Supplementary table 6 ). However, these proteins were enriched for the same biological and molecular processes as those found in the fully adjusted model for the PWAS of cerebral atherosclerosis (Supplementary Figure 5 ). In the second sensitivity analysis, we performed a PWAS of microinfarcts adjusting for the 8 other measured pathologies but did not find any significant proteins. Next, we performed a PWAS of cerebral atherosclerosis that did not adjust for microinfarcts but adjusted for all of the other 7 measured pathologies and found more proteins associated with cerebral atherosclerosis (n=142 proteins; Supplementary table 7) . Likewise, these 142 proteins were enriched for the same biological and molecular processes as those found in the fully adjusted model (Supplementary Figures 6) . In the third sensitivity analysis, we performed a PWAS of vascular risk factors that did not yield any significant proteins. The burden of vascular risk factor here was the sum of counts for lifetime diabetes, hypertension, and smoking, which can contribute to cerebral atherosclerosis 17, 45 . Next, we performed a PWAS of cerebral atherosclerosis adjusting for all 8 measured pathologies and the burden of vascular risk factors. We found essentially the same proteins (106/114) associated with cerebral atherosclerosis after adjusting for vascular risk factors ( Supplementary Table 8 ). Taken together, these sensitivity analyses indicate that the proteomic changes associated with cerebral atherosclerosis in our primary analysis were specific to cerebral atherosclerosis and independent of gross infarcts, microinfarcts, and vascular risk factors.\nAmong the protein co-expression modules in ROS/MAP cohorts, we found that five modules were associated with cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other 8 measured pathologies at adjusted p<0.05 ( Figure 2C , Table 1A ). All five protein co-expression modules had lower abundance in more severe cerebral atherosclerosis (modules 3, 7, 9, 15, and 17; Figure 2C ). Among these five protein modules, three modules were enriched for synaptic signaling, regulation, and plasticity (modules 3, 9, and 17), and two modules for mRNA splicing and mRNA processing (modules 7 and 15; Table 1A ). Modules 3 and 17 were also enriched for oligodendrocyte cell-type specific markers, modules 7 and 15 for neuron-specific markers, and module 15 also for astrocyte-specific markers ( Figure 2B , Table 1A ). Taken together, the PWAS and protein co-expression network analysis highlight that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with i) more oligodendrocyte differentiation, development, and remyelination, ii) less RNA splicing and mRNA processing in neurons and astrocytes, and iii) decreased synaptic signaling, regulation, and plasticity, independently of the 8 other measured pathologies.\nTo replicate the cerebral atherosclerosis findings in the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts), we examined these 114 cerebral atherosclerosis-associated proteins in a replication dataset (BLSA cohort). We chose to perform a targeted replication and not a full meta-analysis for all proteins due to the sample size difference between the datasets (391 in the discovery versus 47 in the replication datasets) and technical differences in proteomic profiles due to a selection of proteolytic enzymes (i.e. 8356 proteins in the discovery versus 6533 proteins in the replication), leading to 51% of proteins of the discovery dataset measured in both datasets (4254 of 8356 proteins). Of the 114 cerebral atherosclerosis-associated proteins in the discovery dataset, 79 proteins were measured in the replication dataset. Of these 79 proteins, 42% (33 / 79) were replicated at adjusted p<0.05 (eight proteins had higher abundance and 26 had lower abundance, Supplementary Table 9 ). All analyses were adjusted for b-amyloid, tangles, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, CAA, sex, age at death, and cell type composition in the same fashion as was done for the discovery dataset. Thus, we were able to replicate 42% of the cerebral atherosclerosis-associated proteins from the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts) in the replication dataset (BLSA cohort)."}, {"section_title": "Molecular processes linking cerebral atherosclerosis to elevated odds for dementia", "text": "We found that 23 proteins were at the intersection of proteins associated with both cognitive diagnosis and cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other 8 measured pathologies at proteome-wide adjusted p<0.05 (Table 1B; Supplementary table 10 ). All 23 proteins consistently had either higher abundance in both MCI/AD and more severe cerebral atherosclerosis, or lower abundance in both, supporting the notion that cerebral atherosclerosis has a detrimental effect on cognition ( Supplementary table 10 ). Of these 23 proteins, 48% (11 of 23) were hub proteins of protein co-expression modules: seven hub proteins for module 2 and one hub protein each for modules 3, 5, 9, and 18 (Table 1B, Supplementary table 10 ). All the seven hub proteins of module 2 had higher abundance in cerebral atherosclerosis (ANLN, CBR1, CPM, CYB5R2, ENDOD1, NEFL, NEFM; Table   1B , Supplementary Table 10 ). Module 2 was enriched for myelination and oligodendrocytes cell-type specific markers (Table 1A) . Hence, it can be inferred that an aspect of cerebral atherosclerosis' contribution to clinical AD dementia is through increased abundance of the hub proteins involved in myelination.\nLikewise, from the protein network analyses, we identified two modules (3 and 9) that were associated with both cognitive diagnosis and cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other 8 measured pathologies. Both modules had reduced abundance in more severe cerebral atherosclerosis and in MCI/AD ( Figure 2D ). Module 3 was enriched for synaptic regulation and oligodendrocyte specific markers, and module 9 for synaptic signaling and plasticity (Table 1A) .\nTogether, converging findings from the PWAS and protein network analyses suggest that cerebral atherosclerosis likely contributes to AD dementia though its effects linked to reductions in synaptic signaling, regulation, and plasticity, and increases in abundance of the hub proteins involved in myelination. One possible model explaining these findings is that atherosclerosis causes axonal dysfunction and increase in myelination is in response to axonal injury. Axonal injury is notably supported by the association between greater abundance of neurofilament light (NEFL) and neurofilament medium (NEFM) chain proteins and higher levels cerebral atherosclerosis because NEFL and NEFM are well-described markers of axonal injury 46, 47 ."}, {"section_title": "NEFL and NEFM proteins are associated with cerebral atherosclerosis and AD dementia", "text": "Among the 23 proteins associated with both cognitive diagnosis and cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other 8 measured pathologies, NEFL and NEFM were noteworthy since prior work has shown that their CSF levels associated with AD (Table 1B) [48] [49] [50] . In light of these findings, we examined whether NEFL and NEFM were associated with cerebral atherosclerosis specifically or with other measured pathologies as well. Therefore, we performed a PWAS of each of the remaining pathologies (i.e. gross infarcts, microinfarcts, CAA, TDP-43, Lewy Body, and hippocampal sclerosis) adjusting for the other 8 measured pathologies in the discovery dataset. For each PWAS, we adjusted for all of the remaining 8 measured pathologies to find the proteins specifically associated with the pathology of interest. Strikingly, NEFL and NEFM were not associated with b-amyloid, tangles, microinfarcts, gross infarcts, CAA, Lewy body, hippocampal sclerosis, or TDP-43 (Table 1C ). NEFL and NEFM were only associated with cerebral atherosclerosis (NEFL p=0.00024, proteome-wide adjusted p=0.034; NEFM p=0.00056, proteome-wide adjusted p=0.045; Figure 1D ,E,G; Table 1C ).\nAssociations between NEFL and NEFM proteins and cerebral atherosclerosis were replicated in the replication dataset (BLSA cohort; Supplementary Table 9 ). These findings underscore the specific associations between NEFL and NEFM protein abundances and cerebral atherosclerosis in both the discovery and replication datasets. Likewise, the associations between NEFL and NEFM protein abundances and cognitive diagnosis in the discovery dataset (NEFL p=0.0025, proteome-wide adjusted p=0.032, OR=1.47; NEFM p=0.0019, proteome-wide adjusted p=0.028, OR=1.51; Figure   1A ,F,H) was confirmed in the replication dataset (BLSA dataset: NEFL p=0.016, OR = 5.2; NEFM p=0.023, OR = 4.6). Notably, the associations between NEFL and NEFM proteins with cognitive diagnosis were no longer significant when we adjusted for cerebral atherosclerosis in the regression model, suggesting that cerebral atherosclerosis mediates the association between NEFL, NEFM and AD dementia (NEFL p=0.0076, proteome-wide adjusted p = 0.068; NEFM p=0.0057, proteome-wide adjusted p = 0.058). Taken together, these findings underscore that NEFL and NEFM likely contribute to AD dementia through cerebral atherosclerosis."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We investigated the direct molecular effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the human brain and how these alterations increase the risk for AD dementia using the deep proteomes (n=8356 proteins) in a large sample size (438 individual post-mortem brains). We found that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with altered abundance of more than 100 proteins and five protein coexpression modules after adjusting for microinfarcts, gross infarcts, b-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, CAA, TDP-43, Lewy body, and hippocampal sclerosis. Gene set enrichment analysis of these proteins and modules revealed that cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with decreased RNA splicing and mRNA processing, lower synaptic signaling and plasticity, and more oligodendrocyte differentiation, development, and remyelination, possibly due to myelin sheath damage. Additionally, we showed that these alterations in cerebral atherosclerosis were not likely the result of either i) risk factors for cerebral atherosclerosis (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) or ii) the consequences of cerebral atherosclerosis (i.e., gross or microinfarcts in the brain). Of the proteins associated with cerebral atherosclerosis in the ROS/MAP discovery cohort, nearly half were replicated in the BLSA replication cohort.\nAn important aspect of cerebral atherosclerosis that we aimed to understand is its contribution to AD dementia. We found 23 proteins and two protein co-expression modules that contribute to both cerebral atherosclerosis and AD dementia independently of b-amyloid, tangles, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, and other pathologies. Thus, the effect of cerebral atherosclerosis on AD dementia is likely through reduced synaptic signaling, reduced plasticity, and injury to the myelin sheath. Our findings are consistent with prior studies in rodent models showing that cerebral hypoperfusion, a direct consequence of cerebral atherosclerosis, was associated with white matter inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn lead to damage to the myelin sheath and demyelination 51 . We did not find a statistical interaction between cerebral atherosclerosis and b-amyloid, or between cerebral atherosclerosis and tangles with regard to AD dementia, suggesting that cerebral atherosclerosis mainly contributes to AD dementia independently of the two AD hallmark pathologies; in other words, its effects are primarily additive to those of b-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles.\nStrikingly, protein abundances of NEFL and NEFM in the brain were specifically associated with cerebral atherosclerosis and AD dementia in the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts) and confirmed in the replication dataset (BLSA cohort). These findings indicate that NEFL and NEFM likely contribute to AD dementia through cerebral atherosclerosis. In support of these findings, another longitudinal cohort (i.e. Banner Sun Health Systems) with brain proteomic data also showed that higher protein abundances of NEFL and NEFM in the brain were associated with faster cognitive decline in advanced age, consistent with their associations with MCI/AD in this study 52 . Also consistent with our findings that NEFL and NEFM act through cerebral atherosclerosis on AD dementia is the lack of association between CSF NEFL and CSF b-amyloid despite the association between CSF NEFL and AD dementia in prior studies in CSF 49, 53 . In addition, we found that NEFL and NEFM were both hub proteins of protein co-expression module 2, which was enriched for myelination, the process in which oligodendrocytes myelinate the axons by wrapping them with myelin sheath. This is consistent because NEFL and NEFM are primarily expressed in myelinated axons 46, 49 .\nOur findings provide insights into why NEFL is a promising biomarker for AD dementia and its progression as shown by studies of CSF and plasma NEFL in AD 49, 50, 54, 55 .\nFrom a translational viewpoint, intra-brain vascular dysregulation has been suggested to be the strongest and earliest brain pathology associated with AD dementia development, followed by Ab deposition, dysregulation of glucose metabolism, and grey matter atrophy in a recent multifactorial analysis of 7,700 brain images and plasma and CSF biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 10 . Likewise, several studies suggested that reduction or dysregulation of cerebral blood flow occurs before cognitive decline, brain atrophy, and b-amyloid accumulation 9 .\nThese studies underscore the important and early contribution of cerebral atherosclerosis to the pathogenesis of AD dementia. Hence, surrogate brain biomarkers for cerebral atherosclerosis might be promising and more sensitive for early detection of AD dementia. We provided here 23 brain proteins specifically associated with cerebral atherosclerosis independently of the other 8 measured pathologies and with cognitive diagnosis (Table 1B) for future studies to investigate whether CSF or plasma levels of these proteins can serve as early biomarkers for cerebral atherosclerosis or AD dementia.\nIn addition to examining the effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the brain proteome and its potential effects on AD dementia, this work also investigated the proteomic alterations found in AD dementia and 8 other measured pathologies in a large dataset of individuals with deep proteomic profiling (n=383, n=8356 proteins). We found that MCI/AD was associated with decreased synaptic activities and plasticity, decreased mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy generation, increased inflammation, increased myelination, and increased neuronal RNA splicing. These findings are consistent with prior proteomic studies in AD and cognitive decline 32, 52, 56 . In addition, we found that neurofibrillary tangles contribute to AD through decreased mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production, decreased synaptic transmission, increased inflammation, and increased neuronal RNA splicing independently of b-amyloid and the other 7 pathologies.\nInterpretation of our findings should take into consideration its limitations. First, this is a postmortem brain study, therefore, it is a cross-sectional study and no causal relationship can be established. Second, the proteomes of the replication dataset (BLSA cohort) had fewer proteins than those of the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts), reflecting the advances in proteomic technology but making the replication study not as ideal. Our study has several strengths. It is the first human brain PWAS of cerebral atherosclerosis to the best of our knowledge. Second, the human brain proteomes were deep (over 8300 proteins) and the sample size large (N=391). Using isobaric tandem mass tag mass spectrometry, we detected 8356 proteins after quality control, which is more than two times the number of proteins detected from label-free quantification 52 . Third, the discovery and replication datasets have detailed neuropathological assessments, which enabled us to rigorously control for the effects of other co-morbid pathologies and improve the specificity of the protein alterations in cerebral atherosclerosis. Fourth, the discovery and replication design reduces the risk of false positive. Lastly, the discovery dataset (ROS/MAP cohorts) is a community-based cohort and not a convenience sample recruited from cognitive clinics, making the findings more generalizable.\nIn conclusion, this is the first human brain PWAS to characterize molecular effects of cerebral atherosclerosis on the human brain, and the first study to elucidate molecular underpinnings for contribution of cerebral atherosclerosis to AD dementia. Importantly, we show that protein levels of . Each neuropathology examined (b-d) was adjusted for the other 8 measured pathologies.
