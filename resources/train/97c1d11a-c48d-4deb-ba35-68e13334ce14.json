Although the course offerings and degree programs of many community colleges can accommodate diverse student interests and goals, preparing students to transfer to a 4-year college remains a central characteristic of community colleges (Brint and Karabel 1989). This preparation is key to the community college's role in higher education because it affirms the community college's claim to a collegiate, academic identity and to a role in broadening access for those historically excluded from a college education. Moreover, transfer is a component of most community college students' educational aspirations (Grubb 1991, 195-96). Despite, or perhaps because of, the importance of transfer from 2-to 4-year institutions, calculating the percentage of community college students who transfer has proven to be somewhat problematic. At first glance, the transfer rate seems relatively unambiguous: it is the number of students who transfer to a 4-year college divided by the number of potential transfer students. However, the numerator and especially the denominator can both be defined in a number of different ways, each having a significant impact on the transfer estimate. The purpose of the present study is to use nationally representative community college data to examine several ways of defining the population of potential transfer students, the relationship of these definitions to student background characteristics, and the relationship of each definition to the resulting transfer rate. This report consists of three sections. The first section describes the dataset used in the analysis and the measurement issues implicated in the study of transfer. The second section presents the selected indicators of the key concepts in the study and the results of the analysis. The report concludes with a discussion of the results in the context of other studies of community college students and transfer."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measurement", "text": "Although a considerable amount of research has investigated community college transfer rates, many of these analyses have used data that are either limited to a cohort of recent high school graduates, such as the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), or are not nationally representative. This study uses the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:1990(BPS: /1994), a nationally representative sample of all students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time between July 1, 1989, andJune 30, 1990. Follow-up interviews were conducted 9 COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER RATES TO FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS in spring 1992 and 1994. BPS is particularly appropriate for the study of community college students because it is representative of all beginning postsecondary students, not just recent high school graduates. The approach of this report is similar to that used in analyses of individual community colleges or districts, particularly that of Spicer and Armstrong (1996). Holding the numerator constant, variously restrictive definitions of the denominator are employed based on the different approaches to specifying the transfer population found in the literature. This report defines transfer as follows: initial enrollment at a community college followed by subsequent enrollment at any 4-year institution within the 5-year study period. Potential transfer refers to being eligible for transfer or \"at risk\" of transfer. The broadest definition of potential transfer used in this analysis includes all first-time, beginning community college students, although students only taking courses for which they receive no credit are excluded from the BPS sample. The pool of potential transfer students is then restricted using eight additional definitions of the denominator. They are referred to as \"increasingly restrictive\" because the total proportion of the sample that is included generally decreases, although the more restrictive groups are not necessarily subsets of the less restrictive groups. These definitions were selected to approximate measures commonly used in previous research, from explicit student goals to behaviors often thought to indicate intent to transfer or commitment to postsecondary education. They are as follows: 1) Expected to complete bachelor's degree or higher; 2) Enrolled in an academic program; 3) Enrolled continuously in 1989-90; 4) Enrolled anytime in academic year 1990-91; 5) Enrolled for 12 or more credit hours; 6) Indicated that they were taking courses toward a bachelor's degree in 1989-90; 7) Pursuing academic major or taking courses toward a bachelor's degree or both; and 8) Pursuing academic major and taking courses toward a bachelor's degree. The analysis begins with estimating the percentage of the 1989-90 cohort of community college students who meet each of these definitions. The relationship of these criteria to various other student characteristics is then explored. The first issue to be examined is whether the composition of the pool of potential transfer students varies as the definition becomes more restrictive. Then, consideration is given to whether different subgroups of students are more or less likely to meet each definition. Finally, a transfer rate is calculated for each group of potential transfer students, and the relationships of these definitions to transfer are explored. vi 10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Overall, 71 percent of beginning community college students responded that they anticipated earning a bachelor's degree or higher when asked, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" (figure A). Also, the majority of students were enrolled in an academic program, enrolled continuously in 1989-90, and enrolled during the 1990-91 academic year. Less than half of the students met the other definitions, with 11 percent of the students both having an academic major and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree.  Does the composition of the group of potential transfer students change as the definition becomes more restrictive? Restricting the group of potential transfer students according to these definitions may alter the composition of the group, since these educational characteristics are themselves associated with other background variables (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996). Across increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer, the percentage of the pool that was in the highest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile increased from 30 percent of all beginning postsecondary students to 51 percent of beginning postsecondary students with an academic major taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree. Furthermore, none of the students in this particular sample who met the most restrictive definition of potential transfer were black, compared to 6 to 10 percent black students in each of the other potential transfer groups.' In general, restricting the pool of potential transfer students systematically altered the composition of the group to include more traditional students (younger, dependent students who do not work full time). What percentage of students with different characteristics meets each potential transfer definition? In addition to examining how the composition of the population of potential transfer students changed as the definitions became more restrictive, the report also compares the likelihood of meeting each definition of potential transfer across various subgroups of students. For example, students 22 years or older were generally less likely than younger students to meet the various definitions of potential transfer. In general, the higher the SES, the higher the percentage of students who met the criteria for each specification. Students who reported taking at least 1 credit hour of remedial mathematics instruction during 1989-90 were generally about as likely to fit each definition as students who did not take any remedial mathematics instruction. Students who were enrolled full time were generally more likely to meet the various specifications than those who were enrolled less than full time. Transfer rates for each definition of potential transfer Figure B shows estimated transfer rates for all community college entrants and for the eight increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer arranged in order. The results show that, in general, the transfer rate increased for more restrictive definitions. The lowest rate of ever enrolling in a 4-year institution, 25 percent, was found for all beginning community college students, compared to 52 percent for students meeting the most restrictive definition (both pursuing an academic major during 1989-90 and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree). That is, the transfer rate for the most restrictive definition was at least twice the rate for all students. Furthermore, figure C demonstrates that the percentage of actual transfer students meeting the criteria for inclusion in the denominator also declined significantly as the definition of potential transfer became more restrictive. In other words, attempts to include only those students most likely to transfer actually exclude a sizable proportion of students who transfer anyway, without meeting those criteria. For example, four out of five actual transfer students did not meet the most restrictive definition considered.

Overall, 71 percent of beginning community college students responded that they anticipated earning a bachelor's degree or higher when asked, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" Also, the majority of students were enrolled in an academic program, enrolled continuously in 1989-90, and enrolled during the 1990-91 academic year. Less than half of the students met the other definitions, with 11 percent of the students both having an academic major and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree. Throughout the remainder of the report, the definitions of potential transfer are ordered according to the percentage of the initial cohort meeting each definition. They are referred to as \"increasingly restrictive\" Figure 1.Among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions, the percentage of the initial cohort meeting each definition of potential transfer because the total proportion of the cohort that is included generally decreases, although the more restrictive groups are not necessarily subsets of the less restrictive groups. Generally, about 70 percent or more of students meeting the criteria for a given definition of potential transfer also met the less restrictive definitions. For example, 82 percent of students enrolled in an academic program also expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher (see table C7 in appendix C). Among those enrolled for 12 or more credit hours, however, about half (52 percent) indicated that they were pursuing an academic major or taking courses toward a bachelor's degree or both, while 45 percent of students indicating that they were taking courses toward a bachelor's degree were also enrolled for 12 or more credit hours. Does the composition of the group of potential transfer students change as the definition becomes more restrictive? Restricting the group of potential transfer students according to these definitions may alter the composition of the group, since these educational characteristics are themselves associated with other background variables (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996). Table 1 shows the percentage distributions of all beginning community college students and students meeting each definition of potential transfer according to several student characteristics. Definitions of potential transfer are ordered by the proportion of the initial student cohort included in that definition (see figure 1). Caution should be exercised in interpreting this table, as many of the percentages shown are based on small sample sizes, which produce rather inefficient estimates. Still, some relationships are observed in this table. In particular, the increasing restriction of the definition of potential transfer was associated with several of the characteristics considered. As the definition of potential transfer became more restrictive, the percentage of the pool that was in the highest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile increased from 30 percent of all beginning postsecondary students to 51 percent of beginning postsecondary students with an academic major taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree. The proportion of students meeting each definition who were in the lowest SES quartile decreased from 19 to 8 percent of potential transfer students. Furthermore, in this sample, none of the students meeting the most restrictive definition of potential transfer were black, compared to 6 to 10 percent black students in each of the other potential transfer groups.'3 Across increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer, the proportion of the pool that was age 18 or younger increased and the proportion that was age 22 or older decreased. Other relationships are consistent with this pattern: the proportion of students who were dependent (who are likely to be younger students; [Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996]) also increased, from 65 percent of all students to 88 percent of those in the most restrictive pool of potential transfer students. In general, the restricted groups of potential transfer students had higher proportions of dependent students than the sample overall. On the other hand, the proportion delaying postsecondary enrollment more than a year after high school (who are likely to be older students; [Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996]) decreased with increasing restriction of the sample. The restricted pools of potential transfers generally had lower proportions of students who delayed enrollment compared to the entire cohort.'4 The percentage of students working full time (35 or more 13This does not necessarily mean, however, that there are no black students in the population of community college students who would meet this definition. One possible explanation for this finding is that black students may be more likely than white or Hispanic students to indicate that they are pursuing an academic major and taking courses leading toward an associate's degree (rather than a bachelor's), in which case they would not be included in this most restrictive definition. Students pursing a vocational major and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree are also excluded from this definition. 14Although the difference in this percentage between the total cohort and the most restrictive definition appears large, the latter group is small and has a large standard error, so the difference is not statistically significant. hours a week) was also higher the more inclusive the definition of potential transfer. Also, the percentage of potential transfers in the West, particularly the Far West, was higher the more restrictive the definition. Students were asked to compare their ability in several areas to the average person of their age. The percentage of potential transfer students who rate themselves as having \"above average\" academic ability increased as the definitions became more restrictive, comprising 24 percent of all students but 32 percent of students working toward a bachelor's degree in an academic major. This pattern was also found for selfratings of mathematical ability compared to others. Students meeting increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer were also less likely to score low (2 or less out of 9) on an index of participation in student life (including participation in school-sponsored extracurricular activities, interaction with other students and faculty, and the like). In sum, this table suggests that restricting the pool of potential transfer students not only changes the composition of the student pool, but alters it systematically toward greater proportions of higher SES students and more traditional students (younger, dependent students who do not work full time). What percentage of students with different characteristics meet each potential transfer definition? The previous section examined how the composition of the population of potential transfer students changed as the definitions became more restrictive. This section takes another approach to exploring the relationship between potential transfer and other student characteristics, comparing the likelihood of meeting each definition of transfer across various subgroups of students (table 2). In general, students age 22 or older were less likely than younger students to meet the various definitions of potential transfer. For example, about 50 percent of students age 22 or older expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 75 percent of students ages 19 to 21 and 81 percent of students age 18 or younger. Likewise, 11 percent of students age 22 or older indicated that they were taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree in 1989-90, compared to 26 percent of students ages 19 through 21 and 33 percent of students age 18 or below. Generally, the higher the SES, the higher the percentage of students who met the definitions of potential transfer. For instance, 16 percent of students from the lowest SES quartile indicated that they were taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree, compared to 40 percent of students from the highest SES quartile. First-generation students, defined as those who reported that their parents had no more than a high school education, were less likely to meet each definition of potential transfer than those who were not firstgeneration students. For example, 62 percent of first-generation students expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 81 percent of those who were not first-generation students. While the bachelor's degree expectations of men and women were about the same, men were less likely to have been enrolled continuously during 1989-90, but more likely to indicate that they were working 16 40   toward a bachelor's degree. Men and women were equally likely to meet the most restrictive definition of potential transfer. Hispanic students were about as likely as other students to indicate that they expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher, but were more likely than black students to have enrolled anytime during academic year 1990-91 (figure 2). White students and Hispanic students were more likely than black students to meet the most restrictive definition of transfer: having an academic major and taking courses toward a bachelor's degree. Students attending community colleges in the West were more likely than students attending schools in other regions of the country to have academic majors and be taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree (the most restrictive definition of potential transfers), but were no more likely to indicate that they expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher (the least restrictive definition). While students who rated themselves above average in mathematical ability and those who rated themselves below average were both more likely to indicate that they expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher than students who rated themselves average, there were few differences across self-reported ability levels in the other definitions of potential transfer. Students who reported taking at least 1 credit hour of remedial mathematics instruction during 1989-90 were generally about as likely to meet each of the potential transfer definitions as students who did not take any remedial mathematics instruction. In general, students who were enrolled full time were more likely to meet the various potential transfer definitions than those who were enrolled less than full time. In general, students who reported working 35 or more hours per week were less likely than students working fewer hours to meet the definitions of potential transfer. For example, 49 percent of students working 35 or more hours per week were enrolled continuously in 1989-90, compared to 70 percent of those who worked fewer than 35 hours per week. Students who did not receive financial aid were about as likely as students who did receive financial aid to expect to earn a bachelor's degree or higher and to be enrolled anytime during academic year 1990-91. Students who did not receive financial aid, however, were less likely to be enrolled continuously in 1989-90 and less likely to be enrolled for 12 or more credit hours in the 1989-90 sampled term than were students who received financial aid."}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education", "text": "\nAdditional exploratory analyses examined the percentage of 1989-90 community college students who ever transferred to a 4-year institution by spring 1994 for each potential transfer definition, by selected student background characteristics. In several cases, relationships of student characteristics to transfer rates generally persisted even when restricted to students meeting the various potential transfer definitions. For example, in general, the older the age group, the lower the percentage of students who transferred, regardless of the definition of potential transfer that was used. Also, regardless of the potential transfer definition used, higher SES was generally associated with a higher transfer rate. x\nFigures 5 through 8 present the percentage of 1989-90 community college students who ever transferred to a 4-year institution by spring 1994 for each potential transfer definition, by selected student background characteristics.'6 For example, figure 5 shows that 39 percent of all students 18 years old or younger ever transferred to a 4-year institution, compared to 22 percent of students ages 19 to 21, and 8 percent of students age 22 or older. 'Supporting data for these figures are shown in appendix C, table C5. Analysis of differences in transfer rates by major field of study within each definition was also conducted; however, due to small cell sizes, few conclusions could be drawn. 25 53 Figure 5.Among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions, percentage who transferred to 4-year institutions by spring 1994, by age and for various definitions of potential transfer These figures are useful because they reveal whether any differences in transfer rates across student groups remain when more restrictive definitions of potential transfer are applied to the sample. However, this approach to holding the definition of potential transfers constant while examining variations across student groups is limited by sample size. The number of cases in any given cell (e.g., students 22 years old or older who are taking courses toward a bachelor's degree) is often too small to produce an efficient estimate. As a result, some of the apparent differences across groups are not statistically significant. Still, some patterns are suggested. For example, in general, the older the age group, the lower the percentage of students who transferred, regardless of the definition of potential transfer used (figure 5). Also, regardless of the potential transfer definition used, higher SES was generally associated with a higher transfer rate (figure 6). For some potential transfer definitions, the transfer rate for first-generation students was similar to the rate for those whose parents attended a postsecondary institution, while the transfer rate for first-generation students was lower for other definitions (figure 7). Overall, first-generation students were less likely to transfer than those who were not; the same is true among students enrolled continuously, those enrolled anytime during 1990-91, and those enrolled for 12 or more credit hours. However, for the other definitions of potential transfer, the transfer rate for first-generation students and those whose parents attended a postsecondary institution was about the same. Finally, both male and female transfer rates increased with increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer (figure 8). Figure 6.Among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions, percentage who transferred to 4-year institutions by spring 1994, by socioeconomic status and for various definitions of potential transfer   Table C5 in appendix C also shows transfer rates by racial/ethnic subgroups and by region for students meeting each potential transfer definition. However, for several of the potential transfer definitions, there were not enough students in most racial/ethnic subgroups to estimate transfer rates, so comparing racial/ ethnic patterns of transfer across definitions is not possible. In addition, it appears that generally across the set of potential transfer definitions, students in the Northeast had lower transfer rates than those in the other regions.  "}, {"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "These results can be placed in the context of the literature about two questions: what percentage of students in community colleges have educational expectations that include a bachelor's degree, and what is the transfer rate for community college students? This contextual information is not intended to constitute a statistical comparison across studies. In general, however, BPS estimates of the percentage of beginning community college students whose expectations included a bachelor's degree or higher, as well as the percentage of students who transferred to a 4-year institution, are higher than estimates based on other datasets. Dougherty (1987Dougherty ( , 1992, for example, reviewed several studies and concluded that 30 to 40 percent of all community college entrants aspire to a baccalaureate degree, while the present study found that 71 percent of community college students in BPS expect to complete a bachelor's degree or higher. Similarly, while the overall transfer rate found in this study is comparable to the average estimate of 22 percent found by the Transfer Assembly project (Cohen and Sanchez 1997), both the numerator and denominator of the Transfer Assembly project are more restrictive. Although BPS data do not facilitate use of this definition, an approximation of it using BPS data yielded a transfer rate of 33 percent, somewhat higher than that resulting from the Transfer Assembly project. However, any comparisons between the estimates presented in this report and those from other studies must be considered in light of differences in how the overall population of community college students is defined across studies. For example, BPS excluded students taking courses only for remedial or avocational purposes without receiving credit, while other estimates may include these students. As a result, the typical amount of remediation for students in BPS may underestimate, or otherwise differ from, the amount of remediation found among community college students in generala factor that might be associated with transfer to a 4-year institution. Furthermore, this report focuses only on students enrolled in public 2-year colleges; including other less-than-4-year colleges, particularly less-than-2-year institutions, may lower the estimates. In addition, BPS data are restricted to first-time beginning postsecondary students; colleges conducting their own studies of transfer may include entering students who are not first-time beginners as defined in the BPS study. Finally, it could also be that student aspirations change appreciably from one cohort to the next, and that estimates therefore could depend in part on when the survey was administered."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This examination of alternative ways of defining potential transfer was undertaken in part to inform research at the design stage. Which definition (or definitions) is (are) most appropriate for addressing a specific research question? The decision is not straightforward. This report illustrates the trade-off between restricting the pool of potential transfer students and excluding substantial portions of the initial cohort. For example, including students who have an academic major and are taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree results in a high transfer rate (52 percent), but no more than about 1 in 10 community college xi students meets this definition, and it excludes 4 out of 5 transfer students. Restricting the pool to the 70 percent of students who expect to earn a bachelor's degree or higher yields a transfer rate of 36 percent, but fully 95 percent of all transfers have this expectation. Just as any statistic depends on the specific variables used to indicate the underlying concepts, the transfer rate for community college students is sensitive to the specification of potential transfer. The most complete picture is provided by using multiple indicators, but this approach is not always practical. If data collection costs or other constraints only permit one definition, one strategy is to define the group of potential transfer students broadly enough that it still reflects community college students somewhat generally, while not being so broad as to include students who never harbor plans to transfer to a 4-year college. The results of this study present several alternatives with different advantages and disadvantages. Overall, the results provide national estimates of community college students' academic expectations and transfer activity. These estimates refine and update our understanding of students' intentions and paths to transfer. Selecting an approach to defining potential transfer is a necessary first step in any effort to analyze the impact of institution type on persistence and attainment. This report has taken a step back and analyzed the definition itself by examining several alternative approaches using a complete nationally representative sample. While the results do not demonstrate the superiority of any single definition, they sharpen one's appreciation for the consequences of measurement decisions and build a firmer foundation for future work on this population. xii Percentage distributions within potential transfer categories of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions according to various

(Barbett 1998). Some of these students enroll in community colleges expecting to earn a certificate or an associate's degree in a vocational area such as data processing, business support, or automotive technology that will have immediate returns in the labor market. Other students enroll with the intention of taking primarily academic courses and eventually transferring to a 4-year college to earn a bachelor's degree. Still others enter community colleges planning to take no more than one or two classes that are of personal or professional interest. Finally, some students may not have a clearly defined academic or occupational goal when they enter community college, but are simply \"experimenting\" with postsecondary education (Grubb 1988(Grubb , 1991. The relative proportions of these various goals, however, have not been definitively established. Although the course offerings and degree programs of many community colleges can accommodate diverse student interests and goals, preparing students to transfer to a 4-year college remains a central characteristic of community colleges (Brint and Karabel 1989). This preparation is key to community colleges' role in higher education because it affirms community colleges' claim to a collegiate, academic identity and to a role in broadening access for those historically excluded from a college education. Moreover, transfer is a component of most community college students' educational aspirations (Grubb 1991, 195-96). Despite, or perhaps because of, the importance of transfer from 2-to 4-year institutions, calculating the percentage of community college students who transfer has proven to be somewhat problematic. At first glance, the transfer rate seems relatively unambiguous: it is the number of students who transfer to a 4-year college divided by the number of potential transfer students. However, the numerator and especially the denominator can both be defined in a number of different ways, each having a significant impact on the transfer estimate. Some researchers and practitioners suggest, for example, that the denominator should consist of all students who enter a community college in a given year, regardless of their initial expectations, while others argue that the denominator should only include those students who start out planning, expecting, or hoping to transferi.e., the pool of \"potential transfer students\" (Dougherty 1994;Spicer and Armstrong 1996). If the denominator is restricted to only those community college students with transfer intentions, how should this group be defined? The purpose of the present study is to use nationally representative community college data to examine several ways of defining potential transfer, the relationship of these definitions to student background char-acteristics, and the relationship of each definition to the resulting transfer rate. This report consists of three sections. The first section describes the dataset used in the analysis and the measurement issues implicated in the study of transfer. The second section presents selected indicators of the key concepts in the study and results of the analysis. The report concludes with a discussion of the results in the context of other studies of community college students and transfer."}, {"section_title": "Data Source and Measurement Issues Data Source", "text": "Although a considerable amount of research has investigated community college transfer rates, many of these analyses have used data that are either limited to a cohort of recent high school graduates, such as the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), or are not nationally representative. This study uses the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 1990-94 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:1990(BPS: /1994), a nationally representative sample of all students who enrolled in postsecondary education' for the first time between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990. To be eligible, a student must have been enrolled during the 1989-90 academic year for one or more of the following purposes: taking course(s) for credit; in a degree or formal award program of at least 3 months' duration; or in an occupationally or vocationally specific program of at least 3 months' duration. Students only taking courses for remedial or avocational purposes without receiving credit were excluded from the sample (Pratt et al. 1996, 5). Follow-up interviews were conducted in spring 1992 and 1994.4 The BPS:1990/1994 response rate was 91 percent among those students known to be eligible for the study, yielding a total sample of 6,617 students who responded to all three interviews (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996;Pratt et al. 1996). BPS is particularly appropriate for the study of community college students because it is representative of all beginning postsecondary students, not just recent high school graduates. Older, non-traditional beginning postsecondary students and those who may never have completed a high school diploma are more prevalent in community colleges than 4-year institutions (Kojaku and Nunez 1998). For example, 26 percent INTRODUCTION of beginning community college students are age 24 or over, compared with 5 percent of those entering 4year institutions (Kojaku and Nuflez 1998, 9). In addition, the final follow-up of BPS students occurred 5 academic years after most students had first enrolled, allowing sufficient time for many transfers to occur. BPS also captured all transfers that occurred within this 5-year period, regardless of the control or location of the receiving institution. Thus, students who made lateral or \"downward\" transfers to other less-than -4year institutions and then transferred to a 4-year college or university are also included in BPS. (About 20 percent of community college beginners first transferred to a less-than-4-year institution; of those, 9 percent enrolled in a 4-year institution by spring 1994 [McCormick 1997, 32, 41]). In short, BPS is the first study that provides a nationally representative sample of all entering college students at public 2-year institutions, while reflecting all of their transfer activity over an extended period of time."}, {"section_title": "Measurement Issues", "text": "As noted above, the primary purpose of this study is to examine alternative ways of defining potential transfer, or the sub-population of community college students who may harbor some intention of transferring to a 4-year institution. While BPS is a particularly appropriate dataset with which to study educational expectations and transfer, selecting a set of potential transfer definitions from the wide range of alternatives that have been proposed in previous research is a challenging task. This section reviews issues that researchers have faced in operationalizing the transfer rate, with an emphasis on the denominator, or the pool of potential transfer students. Calculating a transfer rate requires delineating both the population of potential transfer students and what is considered transfer itself. Although specifying the potential transfer population is particularly problematic and is the primary focus of this report, at least three issues arise when defining what constitutes \"transfer.\" The level of the destination institution has already been specified because transfer to 4-year institutions is of particular interest in the community college literature (Grubb 1991). Second, assuming that transfer is defined as subsequent enrollment,' what is the maximum length of time within which a student can enroll in a 4-year college and still be counted as a transfer student for a given cohort of community college students? If this period is very short, the transfer estimate may systematically undercount the transfer of students who initially enroll less than full time or who \"stop out\" for an extended period (see, e.g., Gutierrez-Marquez 1994; Kojaku and Nuriez 1998). Even students with transfer intentions at the time of entry into postsecondary education may not plan to do so immediately following their departure from their first institution (McCormick 1997;Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). On the other hand, accounting for all subsequent enrollment would, in essence, require following students until they died, which would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome. INTRODUCTION college students at time of entry, after a period of enrollment, or both times whether they intend to transfer (Gutierrez-Marquez 1994;Spicer and Armstrong 1996;Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000), while others have broadly asked about educational expectations or aspirations (McCormick 1997). A previous NCES report, for example, restricted the definition of potential transfer students to those who said that the courses they were currently enrolled in (during their first term in postsecondary education) were leading to a bachelor's degree or higher, inferring intent to transfer on that basis (McCormick 1997). Cohen (1991) suggests that potential transfer definitions should include only those students who have completed a minimum number of credits, thus having \"been enrolled long enough for the college staff to have had a chance to work with them\" (p. 3). Thus, his ongoing Transfer Assembly project, designed to produce consistent transfer data for community colleges across the country, aims to exclude students who simply \"drop in\" to postsecondary educationsampling one or two courses without giving any indications that they are directed toward completion of a specific credential goal. The Transfer Assembly definition, adopted by many researchers because it is widely collected by institutions, includes all students with no previous postsecondary experience' who complete a minimum of 12 credits within 4 years (Cohen 1991;Cohen and Sanchez 1997;Gutierrez-Marquez 1994;Laanan and Sanchez 1996;Spicer and Armstrong 1996). Variations on this behavioral definition look at completion of fewer or more credits in more or less time, or consider semesters completed rather than credits earned. Such measures, which necessarily limit the amount of time that may elapse before data are collected, exclude students who take longer than the specified time period to meet the potential transfer criteria. Furthermore, these measures also exclude students who transfer before meeting the criteria. Some studies have limited potential transfer students to those pursuing a specific credential objective at the community college level. Cohen and Sanchez (1997) explain that some of the programs that students might enroll in are more focused toward or compatible with transfer than others. To the extent that students enroll in these programs because they plan to transfer, or develop transfer goals after enrolling in them, credential objectives may reflect transfer intentions. Along these lines, both students' reported current degree objectives (e.g., completion of a certificate or an associate's degree [Gutierrez-Marquez 1994]) and their actual enrollment in certificate or degree programs (Laanan and Sanchez 1996;Spicer and Armstrong 1996) have been employed. Similarly, enrollment in an academic rather than a vocational program of study may be more compatible with subsequent transfer to a 4-year institution (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Of course, students who are enrolled with no plans for degree completion may also tend to be enrolled in academic rather than vocational courses. 6Many studies have attempted to filter out any effect of previous postsecondary experience by including only those students who are first-time postsecondary or first-time college students (Cohen 1991;Cohen and Sanchez 1997;Gutierrez-Marquez 1994;Laanan and Sanchez 1996;Spicer and Armstrong 1996;McCormick 1997) or students who enrolled in a given term who were not also enrolled at 4-year institutions and did not already have bachelor's degrees (Laanan and Sanchez 1996). Studies that rely on samples of recent high school graduates (Lee and Frank 1990;Grubb 1991) also, in effect, make this restriction."}, {"section_title": "2J", "text": "COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER RATES TO FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS Finally, recent federal legislation regarding the Student Right-to-Know Act requires schools to report information about the rate of completion and transfer (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office 1999). Schools must make available information about the transfer rate of degree-seeking students who attempt full-time enrollment in their first term (Spicer and Armstrong 1996). Unlike most of the definitions of transfer used in the literature, however, only students who enroll in a 4-year institution and do not first complete a certificate or an associate's degree are counted as transfers. This section summarized some of the measurement concerns that arise when calculating a transfer rate and some of the approaches that researchers have used to define potential transfer. The following section outlines this report's approach to the measurement of the transfer rate, first defining \"transfer\" and then delineating the several alternative definitions of \"potential transfer\" used in the analysis. The results of applying these definitions to the BPS longitudinal dataset are then detailed. 6"}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS AND RESULTS", "text": "The purpose of this analysis is to use data that are nationally representative of the community college population to examine a number of alternative definitions of potential transfer. The approach of this report is similar to that used in analyses of individual community colleges or districts, particularly that of Spicer and Armstrong (1996). Holding the numerator constant, variously restrictive definitions of the denominator are employed based on the different approaches to specifying the potential transfer population found in the literature. The next set of results examines how the composition of the student population captured by each definition of potential transfer changes as the definitions become more restrictive, and the relationship of each definition to the resulting transfer rate."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Variables", "text": "The operationalization of transfer (the numerator) used in this report is as follows: initial enrollment at a community college followed by subsequent enrollment at any 4-year institution' within the 5-year study period. To be counted as a transfer student, the student must have ceased enrollment at the community college; concurrent enrollment at a community college and a 4-year institution is not considered transfer in this study. Activity after enrollment at a 4-year institution is not factored into this definition: if a community college student transferred to a 4-year institution and then re-enrolled at the first institution, the student is still counted as having transferred.' Also, following McCormick's (1997) earlier analysis of transfer using BPS:1990/1994, this definition of transfer is based on enrollment only, regardless of whether or not a student transfers credits. About 89 percent of students who attended only two institutions over the course of the study9 reported transferring credits between the community college where they initially enrolled and the 4year institution at which they later enrolled (McCormick 1997, 37). Both the percentage of beginning community college students who ever enrolled in a 4-year institution (including students who first transferred to another less-than-4-year institution before transferring to a 4-year institution) and the percentage who first transferred to a 4-year institution after community college enrollment (including only students whose first transfer was to a 4-year institution) are presented.

These institutions may or may not also offer master's, doctoral, or first-professional degrees (McCormick 1997, 61). 'That is, students who enroll at 4-year institutions with only a short-term purpose, such as to pick up a course not offered at their current institution, are treated here as transfer students. However, since simultaneous enrollment is not counted as transfer, this group may be small. This definition of transfer is consistent with that used in previous NCES reports (McCormick 1997). 9These students represent 73 percent of all community college students who transferred to a 4-year institution (McCormick 1997, 37). Credit estimates for students attending more than two institutions are not readily available from BPS:1990BPS: /1994 "}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER RATES TO FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS Potential transfer refers to being eligible for transfer or \"at risk\" of transfer, and is specified in several ways in this analysis. The broadest definition of potential transfer used in this analysis includes all firsttime, beginning community college students, although students only taking courses for which they receive no credit are excluded from the BPS sample. The pool of potential transfer students is then restricted using the eight additional definitions of the denominator described below. These definitions were selected to reflect the widest possible range of measures detailed above, from explicit student goals to behaviors often thought to indicate intent to transfer or commitment to postsecondary education. For more information about the variables used in these definitions, as well as other variables used in the analysis, see the glossary in appendix A. 1) Expected to complete bachelor's degree or higher. This is the primary measure of self-reported academic expectations used in this analysis and is based on a student's response to the question, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" The question was asked of students during the base year interview in 1989-90. 2) Enrolled in an academic program. This definition is based on student reports of whether their program of study during the 1989-90 year was primarily academic or vocational. 3) Enrolled continuously in 1989-90. Students were considered continuously enrolled if they did not have any period of more than 4 months of nonenrollment during 1989-90. This definition and the one that follows are each intended to roughly approximate the Transfer Assembly approach of looking at only those students who earn 12 credit units (or about 4 classes) over 4 years.\"' 4) Enrolled anytime in academic year 1990-91.

Although most studies of transfer do not include full-time enrollment as a definition of the pool of potential transfers, this definition approximates the denominator used in the Graduation Rate Survey (GRS) of the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The GRS is designed to help institutions meet the reporting requirements of the Student Right-To-Know legislation.\" 6) Taking courses toward bachelor's degree. This definition is more narrowly focused than the general educational expectations in definition (1) because it refers to the courses the students were specifically enrolled in during the 1989-90 term. Even though students are enrolled at 2-year institutions, those who plan to transfer in the short term might indicate that they are currently working on a 'The Transfer Assembly definition cannot readily be used with BPS data. Although this definition and the next are intended to approximate the Transfer Assembly approach, a student could conceivably take just two courses over a 1-or 2-year period and still meet either of these criteria. Therefore, these definitions are likely to be somewhat less restrictive than the Transfer Assembly model. \"However, unlike the current study, the definition of transfer used in GRS includes only those students who have not completed a certificate, degree, or transfer-preparatory program. bachelor's degree. However, in systems where students are encouraged to complete an associate's degree before transfer, students might indicate that they are working on the associate's degree even if they have transfer intentions (McCormick 1997). Such students may, for example, be enrolled in community colleges that have clear articulation agreements with 4-year institutions in the same system.12 7) Pursuing academic major or taking courses toward bachelor's degree or both. This definition of potential transfer excludes those students pursuing a vocational major and taking courses toward an associate's degree, as well as those working on a credential below the associate's degree. 8) Pursuing academic major and taking courses toward bachelor's degree. While definition (7) includes students meeting either of these criteria, this highly restrictive definition requires students to meet both. Although it also excludes those students with a vocational focus, this specification serves as an attempt to exclude those students who may only be experimenting with postsecondary education. The analysis begins with estimating the percentage of the 1989-90 cohort of community college students who meet each of these definitions of potential transfer. The relationship of these criteria to various other student characteristics is then explored. First, the degree to which the composition of the pool of potential transfer students varies as the definition becomes more restrictive is examined. Then, consideration is given to whether different subgroups of students are more or less likely to meet each definition. Finally, a transfer rate is calculated for each group of potential transfer students. The following section describes the results of this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Transfer rates for each definition of potential transfer", "text": "Estimated transfer rates for the nine definitions of potential transfer among 1989-90 beginning community college students are shown in table 3.

Rates of transfer to 4-year institutions are shown both for first transferthe first enrollment following termination of enrollment at a community college and for whether the students had ever enrolled at a 4-year institution by 1994. The results show that, in general, the transfer rate increased across increasingly restrictive definitions. The lowest rate of ever enroll-  ing in a 4-year institution, 25 percent, was found for all beginning community college students, compared to 52 percent among students meeting the most restrictive definition.

'Includes students who first transferred to another less-than-4-year institution before transferring to a 4-year institution. NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, variables are as of 1989-90 (base year interview, first term of postsecondary enrollment). Figure 3 displays two sets of estimates. For each potential transfer definition, the figure shows the percentage of the initial cohort meeting that definition and the rate of transfer to 4-year institutions among students meeting that definition. For example, 63 percent of the initial cohort enrolled continuously during their first year of postsecondary education in 1989-90, and of these students, 37 percent transferred. Figure  4 presents another statistic relevant to the evaluation of these definitions: the percentage of actual transfer students meeting each definition. For example, among 1989-90 community college students who had transferred to a 4-year institution by spring 1994,44 percent indicated that the courses they were taking were leading toward a bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "SOURCE", "text": "When considered together, two facts are evident in figures 3 and 4. First, as suggested earlier, the transfer rate generally increased with the increasing restriction of the group of potential transfer students ( figure 3). In fact, the transfer rate for the most restrictive definition was at least twice the rate for all students: while roughly one-quarter of all students transferred, about one-half of those pursuing an academic major and Figure 3. Among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions, percentage of initial cohort meeting each definition of potential transfer, and of those students meeting the definition, the percentage who transferred to 4-year institutions by spring 1994 working toward a bachelor's degree did so. Second, the percentage of actual transfer students meeting the criteria for inclusion in the denominator also declined significantly with the increasing restriction of the definition of potential transfer (figure 4). In other words, attempts to include only those students most likely to transfer actually exclude a sizable proportion of students who transfer anyway, without meeting those criteria. For example, four out of five actual transfer students did not meet the most restrictive definition considered. Accordingly, as shown in table 3, while the transfer rate of students not meeting the least restrictive definitionexpecting to complete a bachelor's degree or higherwas relatively small (5 percent), the transfer rate of students not meeting the more restrictive definitions was relatively high (e.g., 20 percent among those not taking courses leading toward the bachelor's degree).  bachelor's bachelor's or both NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, variables are as of 1989-90 (base year interview, first term of postsecondary enrollment).

These results can be compared to the literature regarding two questions about community college students' transfer intentions and activities. First, what percentage of students in community colleges have educational expectations that include a bachelor's degree? This question is the basis for much of the debate surrounding the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of defining the pool of potential transfer students. Second, what is the transfer rate for community college students? The evidence from this report in response to these two questions is placed in the context of the literature, although this contextual information is not intended to constitute a statistical comparison across studies. The consequences for these questions of restricting the definition of potential transfer are discussed, and the section concludes with a consideration of the practical matter of operationalization. However, any comparisons between the estimates presented in this report and those from other studies must be considered in light of differences in how the overall population of community college students is defined across studies. For example, BPS excluded students taking courses only for remedial or avocational purposes without receiving credit, while other estimates may include these students. As a result, the typical amount of remediation for students in BPS may underestimate, or otherwise differ from, the amount of remediation found among community college students in generala factor that might be associated with transfer to a 4-year institution. Furthermore, this report focuses only on students enrolled in public 2-year colleges; including other less-than-4-year colleges, particularly less-than-2-year institutions, may lower the estimates. Finally, BPS data are restricted to first-time beginning postsecondary students; colleges conducting their own studies of transfer may include entering students who are not first-time beginners as defined in the BPS study.\n"}, {"section_title": "Educational Expectations and Potential Transfer", "text": "About 7 out of 10 beginning community college students explicitly stated educational expectations that included a bachelor's degree or higher, a somewhat higher rate than previous estimates. As noted previously, determining the percentage of students whose academic goals or expectations include a bachelor's degree has been difficult. Dougherty (1987Dougherty ( , 1992 reviewed several studies and con-cluded that 30 to 40 percent of all community college entrants aspire to a baccalaureate degree. He also noted the lack of nationally representative estimates and that the often-cited estimate of 70 percent for fulltime students from the American Council of Education's annual first-year student survey is not representative of the full community college student population. In contrast, the BPS results reported here showed that about 71 percent of all first-time beginning community college students expect to earn a bachelor's degree. However, student aspirations could change appreciably from one cohort to the next, and estimates could therefore depend in part on when the survey was administered. Still, the overall estimate of 71 percent, which is based on a reasonably broad definition of \"community college students,\" suggests that the academic expectations of these students are generally quite high. Using observed behaviors as indicators of transfer intent, anywhere from 11 to 68 percent of beginning community college students took such steps. Regarding the validity of self-reported student aspirations, Dougherty (1992) asked \"whether one should take what students say as the only valid indication [of baccalaureate aspirations], even if those statements are not reflected in baccalaureate-oriented behavior, or whether one should only class as baccalaureate aspirants those who take concrete steps in this direction?\" (p. 189, fn. 1). This report has tried to address this question partially by comparing different groups of potential transfer students, some defined by self-reports of expectations and others by indicators of \"concrete steps,\" such as enrolling continuously during the first year of postsecondary study. The selection of a specific behavior or combination of behaviors that most accurately indicates baccalaureate orientation, however, is not obvious. Furthermore, the proportion of students taking each concrete step varies widely: for the various behavioral indicators of potential transfer, between 11 and 68 percent of students met each definition. With increasing restriction of the pool of potential transfer students, the group was more traditional and less representative of all beginning community college students. Restricting the population of potential transfer students based on various measures of intent could affect the representativeness of the pool compared to all community college students. Spicer and Armstrong (1996) examined the transfer rate in conjunction with the percentage of the initial cohort of students who met the definition used in the denominator. In the two districts they studied, less than 40 percent of the initial cohort met the Transfer Assembly definition of earning 12 credits within 4 years, while less than 4 percent met the most restrictive definition of the denominator. In this report, the percentage of first-time students meeting the various definitions of potential transfer ranged from 11 to 71 percent, with the least restrictive definition (apart from looking at all students) being educational expectations including a bachelor's degree or higher. As the share of the population of community college students became smaller, the characteristics of the group changed as well. For example, as the definition was restricted further, the group of potential transfer students was more traditional (younger, more likely to be dependents, and less likely to be working full time)."}, {"section_title": "Transfer Estimates", "text": "As with estimates of educational expectations, the transfer rate estimates from BPS in this report can be compared to those based on other datasets. Various approaches to defining the transfer rate have produced a wide range of transfer estimates. Cohen (1991) found that the estimated transfer rate ranged from 5 to 84 percent across different studies, depending on how the denominator was defined. Transfer estimates tended to be lowest when all community college students were used in the denominator and highest when the pool of potential transfers was restricted to students with transfer intentions who had also earned associate's degrees. As noted above, the Transfer Assembly project tries to address the lack of a consistent definition of the transfer rate by providing a common method of calculating it that is readily estimated using data typically collected by community colleges. As of 1997, over 400 community colleges, enrolling more than 50 percent of all first-time community college students, participated in the project (Cohen and Sanchez 1997). The project found that among the 1988 cohort of beginning community college students who earned a minimum of 12 credit units in 4 years, about 22 percent had taken one or more classes at an in-state, 4-year college or university within 4 years of their initial enrollmenta rate that remained fairly stable across several subsequent cohorts (Cohen and Sanchez 1997). Several researchers have used longitudinal surveys of high school cohorts to estimate transfer rates. Lee and Frank (1990), for instance, using the HS&B study, reported that 24 percent of students who entered community college within 2 years of graduating from high school in 1980 transferred to 4-year institutions within 4 years of graduating from high school.\" Using the same dataset, Grubb (1991) found a transfer rate of 20 percent for all students, 25 percent for all students excluding those who completed fewer than 12 credits, and 34 percent for students who aspired to a bachelor's or graduate degree during their last year in high school. While the samples used in these national studies are representative of the high school cohort in a given year and capture all transfers (rather than only those to in-state, public institutions), they are not representative of all beginning community college students. Using BPS, McCormick (1997) found that 22 percent of all students who began at a community college in 1989-90 had transferred directly to a 4-year institution by 1994. Among those students who indicated in 1989-90 that they were taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree, 39 percent had transferred to a 4-year institution by 1994. Rather than using one or two approaches to calculating the transfer rate, some studies of specific community colleges or systems have presented several different estimates for the same cohort of students by varying how the denominator is defined. These studies, however, tend to use local or regional samples. Gutierrez-Marquez (1994), for example, examined transfer and other outcomes of over 10,000 beginning students who \"High school graduates who entered a community college in the second year after graduating high school would have 3 or fewer years to transfer and be counted as such (rather than the 4 years included in several other studies of transfer)."}, {"section_title": "60", "text": "entered the City Colleges of Chicago in fall 1986. Among all students, 13 percent had transferred to an instate, 4-year institution by 1990.'8 The transfer rate ranged from 15.5 percent for students who were enrolled in baccalaureate/transfer programs to 19 percent using the Transfer Assembly definition, which restricts the denominator to students who completed at least 12 credit hours in 4 years. Spicer and Armstrong (1996) applied 11 ways of defining the denominator to a cohort of beginning students enrolled in two California community college districts in fall 1988. The definitions ranged from including all students new to the institution to the most restrictive definition, which included \"all first-time college students with a transfer goal who are transfer ready and who have completed at least fifty-six units\" (Spicer and Armstrong 1996, 50). Spicer and Armstrong also examined the transfer rates of students who met the Transfer Assembly criteria, those who enrolled with a transfer goal, and students who were \"transfer ready\" (i.e., they had completed freshman English composition and mathematics courses transferable to a 4year institution). In the first district, the estimated transfer rate ranged from 3.6 percent using the least restrictive denominator definition to 40.4 percent using the most restrictive definition, while the rate for the second district ranged from 5.3 to 61.3 percent. The Transfer Assembly definition yielded a transfer rate of around 13 percent for both districts. Approximating the pool of potential transfers as defined in previous studies, such as the Transfer Assembly model or high school cohorts, transfer rates in BPS appear to be a few percentage points higher than previous estimates. In general, the transfer rates found in this study appear to be somewhat higher than those from previous research. For example, while the overall transfer rate found in this study is comparable to the average estimate of 22 percent found by the Transfer Assembly project (Cohen and Sanchez 1997), both the numerator and denominator of the Transfer Assembly project are more restrictive: to be eligible, students must have earned a minimum of 12 credit units in 4 years, and transfers were to in-state, 4-year colleges or universities (Cohen and Sanchez 1997). Although BPS data do not facilitate use of this definition, this analysis approximated it by looking at those students who were enrolled for at least one term during the academic year following their initial enrollment (they had to have taken at least two classes in 2 years, compared to the Transfer Assembly criterion of about four classes in 4 years). This analysis found that 33 percent of students meeting this criterion transferred to a 4-year college or university within 5 academic years of their initial enrollment, which is somewhat higher than the rate resulting from the Transfer Assembly project. Using a slightly different approximation of the Transfer Assembly definition, the rate of first transfer to public 4year institutions among beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in two consecutive academic years was 29 percent, still a few percentage points higher than the Transfer Assembly estimates."}, {"section_title": "1 DISCUSSION", "text": "Comparisons with other studies for other definitions also suggest higher estimates. While the transfer rate obtained from a representative sample of community college students might be different from estimates based on a high school cohort, the overall estimate of 25 percent in this report is similar to the transfer rate of 20 to 24 percent for the high school class of 1980 (Grubb 1991;Lee and Frank 1990). However, the resulting transfer rate of 39 percent among students who were 18 years old or younger when they first enrolled in a community college is appreciably higher than the estimates based on 1980 high school graduates. This report replicated the estimates of first transfer rates for all beginning postsecondary students (22 percent) and for those taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree (39 percent) provided by McCormick (1997) using the BPS dataset. Finally, after reviewing numerous transfer studies, Dougherty (1994, 92) concluded that \"the best estimate of the transfer rate of community college entrants is around 15 to 20%.\" Although the overall transfer rate estimate of 25 percent found in this report is somewhat higher than Dougherty's estimate, some of the discrepancy may be attributed to differences in definitions of community college students or transfer. As the pool of potential transfer students was restricted according to the various selection criteria, the transfer rate generally increased. This report also suggests some more general consequences of various choices of operationalization. For example, the results show that transfer rates were generally higher among potential transfer students as the definition became more restrictive. One explanation for this result, as suggested above, is that many students who report high educational expectations (the most inclusive of the restricted definitions of potential transfer) are not \"committed enough\" to the idea of earning a bachelor's degree to begin taking the necessary steps to obtain one. Alternatively, students' ability to transfer easily may vary from state to state, depending on articulation agreements that establish transfer credits or admissions policies facilitating transfer across levels of postsecondary education. Another explanation is that the difference in transfer rates may be due in part to a lack of resources among some students with bachelor's degree expectations, which may limit their ability to take the necessary steps to achieve a degree. Indeed, this report found that the proportion of students meeting each definition who had high SES increased as the definitions became more restrictive. Furthermore, some of the behavioral measures of academic intentions yield transfer rates similar to that of the self-reported measure, although they are somewhat more restrictive in terms of the percentage of the initial cohort meeting the criteria. Finally, there is some evidence that differences in transfer rates across various subgroups may not be accounted for by the definitions of potential transfer considered. As the definition of potential transfer became more restrictive, the percentage of actual transfer students meeting the selection criteria tended to decrease. To what extent do actual transfer students meet the criteria used to restrict the population to potential transfer students? Spicer and Armstrong (1996) investigated the percentage of transfer students captured by the definitions of potential transfer they studied in two community college districts. In one district, with the exception of the \"all students\" definition, no more than 50 percent of transfer students were captured by any definition, while in the other district 88 percent or more of transfer students were captured by several of the definitions. In this report, the percentage of transfer students meeting the criteria for inclusion in the denominator declined significantly as the definition of potential transfer became more restrictive. While 95 percent of transfer students indicated educational expectations including the bachelor's degree, about one in five (20.5 percent) had academic majors and were taking courses leading toward the bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Operationalizing the Transfer Rate Denominator", "text": "This examination of alternative ways of defining the pool of potential transfer students was undertaken in part to inform research at the design stage. The purpose of the research, however, was not to recommend any particular definition as superior to all the others. Instead, the analysis contrasted these alternative definitions so that whatever choice is made for any specific research question can be understood in the context of other options of operationalization that could have been selected. Three examples illustrate this point. First, if the purpose of a particular analysis is to examine the effect of community college attendance on student outcomes, such as bachelor's degree attainment, then it may be most useful to examine the transfer rates of students who expect to earn a bachelor's degree or higher, as well as those who do not. Such an analysis does not ignore the fact that at least some students who did not expect to earn a bachelor's degree or higher nevertheless transferred to a 4-year institution. Although the proportion who did so is relatively small (5 percent), this result is consistent with the hypothesis that community college attendance may raise some students' expectations. A second example further illustrates the point that the differences across definitions are not immediately evident from estimated transfer rates. The results of the analysis suggest that three of the definitions based upon enrollmentenrolled in an academic program, enrolled continuously in 1989-90, and enrolled anytime in academic year 1990-91define groups of students whose transfer rates are similar to the rate for students who expected to earn a bachelor's degree or higher (about 32 or 33 percent for first transfer; table 3). The percentages of students meeting these definitions, as well as the transfer rates of students not meeting these definitions, are also similar. These results suggest that definitions of potential transfer based upon certain enrollment characteristics are roughly comparable to the definition based upon students' stated intent, which in some cases may be more difficult to obtain. However, while the aggregate numbers are comparable, the individual students comprising these groups vary. For example, for each enrollment-based definition, roughly one in five students did not express bachelor's degree expectations (see appendix table C7). The underlying composition of the groups may vary with respect to other characteristics as well. Finally, the more restrictive definitions may be useful in identifying a group of community college students comparable (in terms of major and degree program) to students who first enroll in 4-year institutions. For example, one definition of potential transfer used in this analysis included students who indicated that they were pursuing academic majors or taking courses toward the bachelor's degree (or both). This definition excludes students with vocational majors taking courses leading to the associate's degree, as well as those students pursuing certificates. Because relatively few 4-year institutions offer vocational associate's degrees or certificates, this definition may maximize comparability across 2-and 4-year student populations in analyses of persistence and attainment. However, in the BPS:1990/1994 dataset, questions based on a. student's major tended to have a higher than average number of missing values. Furthermore, while this definition resulted in a fairly high transfer rate (43 percent), about two-fifths (43 percent) of community college students met this definition, and it excluded about 30 percent of all transfer students. This definition illustrates the trade-off between restricting the pool of potential transfer students and excluding substantial portions of the initial cohort and actual transfer students. Which definition (or definitions) is most appropriate for addressing a specific research question? The decision is not straightforward. Just as any statistic depends on the specific variables used to indicate the underlying concepts, the transfer rate for community college students is rather sensitive to the specification of potential transfer. The most complete picture is provided by using multiple indicators, but this approach is not always practical. If data collection costs or other constraints permit only one definition, one strategy is to define the group of potential transfer students broadly enough so that it still generally reflects community college students, while not being so broad as to include students who never harbor plans to transfer to a 4-year college. This study presents several alternatives with different advantages and disadvantages. Overall, the results of this study provide national estimates of community college students' academic expectations and transfer activity. These estimates refine and update our understanding of students' intentions and paths to transfer. Selecting an approach to defining the pool of potential transfer students is a necessary first step in any effort to analyze the impact of institution type on persistence and attainment. This report has taken a step back and analyzed the definition itself by examining several alternative approaches using a complete nationally representative sample. While the results do not demonstrate the superiority of any single definition, they sharpen one's appreciation for the consequences of measurement decisions and build a firmer foundation for future work on this population. Such work will be facilitated by the completion of the newest panel of the 1995-96 BPS, with follow-ups in 1998 and 2001. This new data source includes data on students' explicit transfer intentions and expectations of degree completion at the first institution attended (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). This additional information, also available in a nationally representative sample, has the potential to substantially enrich our understanding of potential transfer populations.

The need for a nationally representative database on postsecondary student financial aid prompted the U.S. Department of Education to initiate the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a crosssectional survey conducted every 3 years starting in 1987. The NPSAS sample was designed to include students enrolled in all types of postsecondary education. However, service academies were not included in the institution sample because of their unique funding and tuition base, and certain other institutions were also excluded.' In addition to a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) of students and parents, the NPSAS surveys collect students' registration and financial aid information directly from the sampled institutions. To provide the full range of information on financing postsecondary education, NPSAS samples both aided and nonaided students. The Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:1990(BPS: /1994) followed students from the NPSAS:1990 sample who were identified as first-time beginning students in academic year 1989-90. A CATI was conducted with these students 2 and 4 years after the base year study that collected information concerning enrollment, program completion, education financing, employment, and family formation; graduate school access and enrollment; and civic participation. The data derived from this survey permit a variety of analyses concerning postsecondary persistence and completion, entry into the work force, and civic participation. Unlike other NCES longitudinal surveys based on grade-specific cohorts (such as High School and Beyond), the BPS design allows for the increasing numbers of nontraditional postsecondary students, such as those who have delayed their education due to financial needs or family responsibilities. Students who began their postsecondary studies before 1989-90, stopped out, and then returned to their studies in 1989-90 were not included, nor were students still enrolled in high school. The NPSAS and BPS survey samples, while representative and statistically accurate, are not simple random samples. Instead, the samples are selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions are selected within geographic strata. Once institutions are organized by zip code and state, they are further stratified by, control (i.e., public; private, not-for-profit; or private, for-profit) and degree offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, 4-year nondoctorate-granting, and 4-year doctorate-granting). 19Other excluded institutions were those offering only avocational, recreational, or remedial courses; only in-house business courses; only programs of less than 3 months' duration; or only correspondence courses."}, {"section_title": "7 COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER RATES TO FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS", "text": "For more information on BPS:1990) Final Technical Report (Pratt et al. 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The statistics in this report are estimates derived from a sample. Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys, but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (e.g., some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:1990/1994 Data Analysis System (DAS).

In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors2\u00b0 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low n\" instead of the estimate.

Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix.

The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons across different racial/ethnic groups, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" is tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p< .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p< .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p< .05.21 For example, in a cornpariSon of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education, only One comparison is posSible ( males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the signifiCance level. When students are divided into five racial /ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be.p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: 'The standard that p<.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p<.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Dunn (1961). where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race/ethnicity, there are five racial/ethnic groups (American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; and white, non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 4, When comparing estimates across a family of three or more categories that are ordered, however, such as SES quartiles, it is possible to test whether the estimates may also be ordered more efficiently than with a series of paired comparisons. When proportions were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, the Student's t-test was applied to a measure of a linear trend. The test involves estimating a simple linear regression with a variable representing the order of the categories as the independent variable (e.g., SES quartile), and the proportion of interest (e.g., the percentage who enrolled for 12 or more credits) as the dependent variable. Before estimating the regression, the data must be adjusted by the design effects to account for the complex sample design. The t statistic is calculated as the ratio of the regression coefficient to its standard error. If t is greater than 1.96 (the critical value of t at a significance level of .05), there is evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.22 22For more information about this modification of Student's t-test, see Snedecor and Cochran (1967, 246-247).
