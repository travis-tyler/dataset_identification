[{"section_title": "", "text": "Imagine the excitement and optimism nonprofit board or staff might feel when promised the solutions, power, connectedness, exposure, innovation, and efficiency offered by the latest hardware, software, applications, and other technologies advertised by the corporate taglines listed above. Such tools afford organizations and individuals the opportunity to \"enlarge their efforts, quickly, easily, and inexpensively\" (Kanter & Fine, 2010, p. 3), which is a valuable prospect to thousands of small nonprofit organizations operating across the U.S. and the world. With current technology, a food pantry on a shoestring budget can use Facebook to engage its entire community in the U.S. Postal Service's annual \"Stamp Out Hunger\" food drive to stock the shelves (Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona, 2012). A group of teen activists can dream up and share a video that goes viral on YouTube, exposing the manipulative marketing tactics tobacco companies use to get youth to buy deadly products (rchfm, 2011), and an advocacy group based in San Francisco can ignite worldwide political action through a single video, \"Kony 2012\", to bring down a Ugandan war criminal (Guo & Saxton, 2013, Wong, 2012. A crisis pregnancy center can use Survey Monkey to devise a way to quickly measure program impact and use the data to support new funding proposals (Compassion Pregnancy Center of Northeast Indiana, 2009). A drug prevention coalition can prevent prescription drug abuse by sending a Twitter invite to its entire community to drop off unused medications at secure locations in police stations (A.H.E.A.D. Coalition, 2012). Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) undertake such technology-rich strategies every day to achieve outcomes and further their social missions. Some NPOs succeed overwhelmingly in these efforts, using Internet-based and other technologies to establish what Cuesta refers to as a mission-delivery engine, a comprehensive presence that actively engages stakeholders and creates public value while promoting an \"intuitive understanding of what the organization is about\" (2011, para. 2). Other NPOs fall frustratingly short of this goal, working to keep their workstations from failing, flashing the 'blue screen of death'. Still others suffer from an affliction journalist William Powers describes as \"digital maximalism\" (2010, p. 4), in which staff, volunteers, and even clients invest substantial time and resources on technology with the result of having to splinter that time between using text messages, e-mails, blogs, Facebook, answering cell-phone calls and finding opportunities to simply sit down and talk about creating positive change. This tremendous range of effectiveness in NPOs' technology adoption and use (Hoehling, 2012a(Hoehling, , 2012bBernard & Pukstas, 2006;Bernard & Pukstas, 2009;Levine, 2008) can be found across large cities and small towns, and even within individual service disciplines. How can this be? According to technology professionals serving the nonprofit sector, the organizations that are most successful at incorporating technology into their work, in ways that increase their achievement of goals and outcomes, practice IT alignment, through which they deliberately plan and use information technology (IT) strategies and tools in ways that support and augment their organizational missions . Some NPOs instinctively achieve strategic IT alignment, and some attend conferences or workshops to learn how to incorporate technology in ways that improve the important work they do, while others find themselves endlessly fighting with donated doorstop computers to accomplish basic tasks. Still others are entranced by every new application, frequently shifting their organizational focus and resources to figure out how to make the latest 'app' useful at the expense of other, mission-focused efforts. These scenarios, aggregated from my 15 years of experience leading and consulting in the nonprofit sector, illustrate the disparity in the levels of sophistication at which NPOs adopt, use, and align IT in accordance with their missions. This disparity is mirrored in the findings of annual surveys of IT staffing and use done by the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN) (Hoehling, 2012a(Hoehling, , 2012bBernard & Pukstas, 2010;Bernard & Pukstas, 2009;Levine, 2008). As this range of successful and not-so-successful NPO technology experiences is considered, it is important to note that IT alignment is not the practice of downloading and incorporating every new-fangled tool into the work we do. On the contrary, it can be more accurately portrayed as deciding what not to use. In Hamlet's Blackberry, Powers (2010) chronicles and applauds 'new' technology that has 'stuck' through the ages, such as scrolls to replace speeches for Plato and the printing press in Gutenberg's time. Yet he warns that those innovations, like ours today, inserted new challenges including busyness, information overload, and feeling a loss of control, as technology brought individuals and ideas closer together, more often. He asserts that all people must be strategic and discriminating in choosing the most effective uses for new technology in order to maximize their value, and we must balance that value with the need for time away from the screen. A full decade prior, Kanter, already well-acquainted with the challenges of becoming entrenched in the Digital Age, asserts, \"Depending on the angle, [technology] is both friend and foe, tool and driver, death threat and fountain of youth\" (2001, p. 40), a sentiment that is clearly illuminated both personally and professionally, as we log on to our lives each day. Nonprofit IT alignment, under such objective consideration, is the process of considering what an organization hopes to achieve (its mission), and being strategic and deliberate in choosing just the technology that will help achieve it. Maney provides the opportunity for a chuckle when he envisioned this process operationalized to its extreme: Every Girl Scout troop once had its territory for selling Girl Scout cookies, but enterprising troops with Internet merit badges who offer cookies over the Web could 'blow a hole the size of Greenland in that setup'. (in Kanter, 2001, p. 37) If a nonprofit organization's mission entails blowing such a hole through an existing social issue or problem, it is likely technology can assist, provided the technology is aligned with the right target."}, {"section_title": "An Overview of Technology in Nonprofit Organizations", "text": "A variety of factors contribute to NPOs' adoption and use of technology: availability of current technology and technical assistance, communication between IT and other staff, donor discretion, technology expertise, flexible and sustainable funding, collaboration among agencies, leadership, mission and goals, organizational culture, organizational size, stakeholder pressure, and staff skills and workload (Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Kanter & Fine, 2010;Manzo & Pitkin, 2007;McNutt, 2007;McNutt & Boland, 1999;Wolpert & Seley, 2007). However, no formal investigations to date empirically describe how these factors contribute to IT alignment in NPOs, whether IT alignment does, in fact, contribute to NPOs' increased achievement of organizational outcomes and, if so, to what extent."}, {"section_title": "The Origins of IT Alignment in the Business Sector", "text": "The practice of IT alignment has its roots in the business sector. Previous level of alignment maturity, and suggest relationships between alignment and business outcomes (Chan & Huff, 1992;Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993;Luftman, 2000;Luftman, Lewis & Oldach, 1993;Orlikowski, 1996;Reich & Benbasat, 1996Sabherwal & Kirs, 1994). A majority of the models consider Henderson & Venkatramann's (1993) conceptual Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) or use it as the foundation for their investigations. Luftman, Papp and Brier (1999) used this model to identify specific enablers and inhibitors to alignment, then Luftman (2000) constructed a framework of six criteria for alignment and a corresponding instrument to measure levels of the criteria. The Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM) has since been validated (Sledgianowski, 2004, Sledgianowski, Luftman, & Reilly, 2006. SAMM has been adapted for commercial use by IT service management consulting firms Forrester Research, Inc. (McNeill, Mendel, Garbani, Pohlmann & LeQuoc, 2005) and Gartner, Inc. (Newman & Logan, 2008), and used by thousands of business and IT executives to assess and increase their level of business-IT alignment maturity (Luftman, 2011). At present, SAMM is touted as the most widely-used IT alignment maturity assessment model in the business sector (Chan 2007, Gutierrez, Orozco, & Serrano, 2009Evers, 2010), yet competing models raise serious questions about whether SAMM and its conceptual model, SAM, address all of the factors necessary to measure, predict, and prescribe steps to increase IT alignment, both in business and other sectors. Burn and Szeto (2000) question its applicability in all industries, depending upon their level of IT intensity. Campbell suggests that while it can identify and prioritize variables, it ignores context and complexity of organizations (2008, p. 167). The factor of organizational size and its relationship to the presence of dedicated IT personnel is also not considered in Luftman's model, according to Gutierrez et al. (2009). This issue is of considerable concern in the present study because 62% of nonprofits that exist in the sample under investigation, as well as in the U.S. population of nonprofits are considered small organizations, smaller even than the criteria of 250 or less employees described by Zhang, Gutierrez & Mathieson (2010). Many of them do not have an IT function or even an 'IT guy or gal', a characteristic which will be discussed in more detail in future sections. Parallel to the conceptualization of SAMM, several investigations identified additional factors that influence IT alignment. Sabherwal and Chan (2001), Tavakolian (1989), and Tan (1997 contend that  conceptual model of business strategy typologies is indicative of specific IT alignment strategies and patterns. Reich andBenbasat (1996, 2000) championed the influence of social dimensions of alignment, which they assert are crucial to establishing commitment and shared understandings between business strategies and IT strategies. Croteau and Bergeron (2001) claim that business strategy and IT alignment assert equal influences on organizational outcomes. These additional perspectives encourage consideration of a number of ways IT alignment can occur in organizations across different sectors, as well as within the same sector. Since 1995, business-IT alignment has emerged as a top priority of senior technology executives on the annual Society of Information Management survey (Stephani, 2010), and for good reason. Empirical evidence garnered from multiple iterations of Luftman's SAMM instrument applied in authentic business settings indicates that when businesses align IT with business strategies, whereby they plan and implement technology initiatives as part of their overall business strategy, they achieve greater outcomes in terms of profits and revenues (Byrd, Lewis, & Bryan, 2006;Cragg, King, & Hussin, 2002), productivity and enterprise value (Nash, 2009), return on investments, assets, equity, and human capital (Luftman & Kempaiah, 2007;Kempaiah, 2008). Considering this evidence of the positive influence of IT alignment on outcomes, it intuitively makes sense for any organization, in any sector, to work toward achieving alignment between its IT strategy and its overall organizational strategy."}, {"section_title": "IT Alignment in the Nonprofit Sector", "text": "Supporting this assumption of utility, a few investigations have attempted to implement the SAMM assessment and other IT alignment models in nonprofit settings, primarily in the fields of healthcare (Evers, 2010) and postsecondary education (Sabherwal & Kirs, 1994;Chan, Sabherwal, & Thatcher, 2006;Flores, Lopez, Vargas, & Rusu, 2008). All of these investigations provide little new knowledge about IT alignment in nonprofit settings beyond the assertion that further investigation is needed to clearly determine whether business-IT alignment models can be appropriately applied in other sectors. The nonprofit sector has also investigated alignment to a limited extent at the practitioner level, and three rudimentary models have been proposed that explain IT alignment in NPOs and factors that influence alignment maturity , NPower 2011. These conceptual models, one of which shares many similarities with SAMM , have yet to be translated to empirical models with distinct, measurable variables that can tested in the field."}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Translate Business-IT Alignment Models to NPOs", "text": "Translation of business-IT alignment models to the nonprofit sector faces two challenges. First, distinct disparities exist between the character and constituencies of business and nonprofit sectors, most notably the nature of organizational outcomes and the ways outcomes are measured, differences in internal and external stakeholders, organizational culture, the ways in which risk is addressed, and the means through which NPOs and businesses sustain themselves and their organizations (Fine, 2006;Zhang, Gutierrez, & Mathieson, 2010). Together the differences render direct transfer of business-IT alignment variables inappropriate. Second, nonprofit practitioners tend to focus knowledge generation efforts on addressing specific, local problems that need immediate solutions rather than investing time and talent in building and testing generalizable theory (Salipante & Aram, 2003). These limitations result in skipping an important step of establishing a sound, validated theoretical model that will appropriately inform sector-wide IT alignment practice. When appraised of this missing link, nonprofit technology experts acknowledged its absence wholeheartedly. Steve Heye, author of \"Mission First: Achieving IT Alignment\" (2009), Peter Campbell, author of \"How to Decide: IT Planning and Prioritizing\" (2009) and Holly Ross, Executive Director of the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN), welcomed and agreed to support the establishment of a model that will help nonprofit organizations address their unique characteristics as they support NPOs in their ongoing endeavors to align technology in ways that will help them meet their social missions (S. Heye personal communication, October 13, 2010;P. Campbell personal communication, November 29, 2010; H. Ross personal communication February 11, 2011). Their overwhelmingly supportive responses to the question, \"Can we make and test a theoretical model to measure IT alignment in nonprofits and help them mature in their alignment\" were the spark and continue to be the fuel for this investigation."}, {"section_title": "Statement of the Problem", "text": "The problem addressed in this study is the lack of a theoretical model of the relationships between strategy typology, IT alignment and organizational performance that accurately describes and informs the process of IT alignment as it occurs in nonprofit organizations. Further, without a theoretical model that fits the character of NPOs, it is impossible to measure their level of IT alignment in terms of the factors that enable and inhibit alignment. Without a valid measurement tool, no empirical baseline exists from which nonprofits can take specific steps to increase their IT alignment maturity in order to improve their efficiency and effectiveness as it is demonstrated by the achievement of mission-focused outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "The purpose of this study was to address the inquiry above, posed by nonprofit technology practitioners, but even more explicitly to answer the question, \"How do NPOs adopt and use technology in ways that make a measurable difference in their achievement of outcomes?\" The present investigation explains relationships found in nonprofit organizations between the strategic and organizational factors that enable and inhibit IT alignment, the planning and use of information technology strategies and tools in ways that support and augment organizational strategies, and describe the extent to which performance outcomes are influenced by those relationships. Relationships identified and validated through this investigation defined a new theoretical model to explain the process and outcomes of IT alignment in NPOs. This model, coined \"SIMO\" to represent its main components, strategy, IT, mission and outcomes, expands upon achievements of the business sector by adapting and integrating existing business-sector strategy typology and IT alignment models with a nonprofit performance outcome measurement model in light of organizational characteristics unique to the nonprofit sector. Beyond the scope of the present study, but significant in establishing the value of the work, the validated model has the potential to be used by providers of nonprofit technical assistance to help nonprofits align technology with their mission. The data that emerged from this model and a corresponding practitioner assessment that will be developed in the future can be used to create, test, and widely disseminate an online assessment tool that can describe an individual NPO's IT alignment maturity profile. The data that emerges from this capacity-building tool can be used to create a menu of prescriptive strategies and next steps an organization can take to increase their IT alignment maturity and consequent progress toward achieving mission-focused outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The discussion to this point, encompassing the background of the problem, statement of the problem, and the purpose of this study provokes five research questions: 1. What factors influence nonprofit organizations' level of IT alignment maturity? 2. Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their level of IT alignment maturity? 3. Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their achievement of performance outcomes? 4. Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' levels of IT alignment maturity and their achievement of performance outcomes? 5. Given a specific strategy typology, what is the relationship between IT alignment maturity and performance outcomes?\nA question similar to that presented by Croteau and Bergeron's (2001) ignited the SIMO study, namely how do NPOs adopt and use technology in ways that make a measurable difference in their achievement of outcomes? The literature on IT alignment informs this question and suggests that IT alignment maturity, along with strategy type, influences organizational performance, whereby it frames several specific research questions:"}, {"section_title": "Assumptions", "text": "The assumptions of this study included the following: 1. That the models, methods and findings used previously to identify relationships between the variables were valid and reliable. 2. That the factors investigated in this study are not the only ones that each influence the other, however, they may increase understanding of the relationships between them. 3. That nonprofit organization representatives can identify a specific strategy typology that guides the organization's work. 4. That nonprofit organization representatives participating in the study can accurately identify their organization's present level of IT alignment factors. 5. That nonprofit organizations involved in the study have and can articulate results of a process for measuring organizational performance."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Study", "text": "This research addressed the need to examine how existing IT alignment models transfer to non-business sectors, a need expressed by Chan et al. (2006) and Zhang, et al. (2010). Models that consider the interface of IT with NPO strategy, mission, and outcomes are of particular interest. Chan et al. (2006) and Farrell (2003) proposed that future investigation of IT alignment focus on the influence of organizations' strategic orientation (typology), particularly in specific industries represented outside of the business sector. Chan et al. refrained from hypothesizing about an empirical connection between alignment and strategy because of the \"paucity of prior literature concerning the nature of possible relationships between business strategies and alignment\" (2006, p. 31), whereby clearly uncovering a gap that needs to be filled. In addressing needs of the nonprofit sector, Ebrahim and Rangan (2010) encourage continued exploration of ways NPOs align their mission and strategy, while using performance measurement to support such alignment (2010). This charge is echoed by Zhang et al. (2010), who suggest framing investigations of the interface of mission and strategy within an IT context in order to understand how IT can help better serve constituents, in other words, how IT helps NPOs meet their mission. The need for further investigation of \"meaningful and reliable comparative metrics\" (Ebrahim and Rangin, 2010, p. 34) for rating and benchmarking NPO performance is a reiteration of the same by Sawhill and Williamson (2001). Fulfilling the need for appropriate performance metrics can provide a means by which the impact of IT alignment on performance can be validly measured . The influence of nonprofit organizational culture on IT alignment is also a predominant theme in the literature, in terms of the need for concise identification of cultural factors that impact the process and outcomes of NPO IT alignment (Farrell, 2003;Tallon & Kraemer, 2003;Van Der Zee & De Jong, 1999;& Zhang & Gutierrez, 2007). These investigations suggest that future research examine the impact of an altruistic, rather than profit-motivated, environment of NPOs on organizations' receptivity to and engagement in IT alignment. Considering these suggested directions for research, this investigation demonstrates ways in which understandings about the process of IT alignment in the business sector can be translated for use in the nonprofit sector. While positive relationships between IT alignment and outcomes are empirically demonstrated in the business sector, the influence of strategy type has yet to be fully established, and none of the relationships have been demonstrated empirically in the nonprofit sector. As suggested above, in order to demonstrate these relationships, it has become necessary to isolate and examine three elements as they manifest in NPOs: strategy typology, IT alignment maturity, and outcomes, which has taken place in this study. From economic and service provision standpoints, the results of this investigation will provide data to technology producers and technical assistance providers to assist them in creating, marketing, and disseminating goods and services that will assist nonprofit organizations in becoming more efficient, effective, and productive, a need which is illuminated by Zhang and Gutierrez (2007)."}, {"section_title": "Organization of Dissertation", "text": "The remainder of this dissertation is organized into six chapters. Chapter II is organized into nine sections and affords a detailed review of the existing literature, beginning with a description of the scholarly research domains examined, followed by a description of the evolution of technology use by NPOs and factors that influence NPOs' adoption and use of technology. IT alignment is then described from both business and nonprofit historical perspectives, followed by a summary of the concept of strategy typology and its role in driving alignment. Challenges in translating present business-IT alignment knowledge to the nonprofit sector are then described, and the chapter ends with a summary. Chapter III describes the gap in the current knowledge base -the lack of a means to measure the relationships strategy typology, IT alignment, and organizational performance in the nonprofit sector, focusing specifically on the need for performance measurement metrics that can transfer across all types of NPOs. Chapter IV introduces SIMO, an integrated model to identify and measure the relationships between strategy, IT, mission and outcomes, one which is based on existing business models of strategy typology, IT alignment, and performance outcomes and incorporates the logic model as a structure through which nonprofit performance is isolated and measured. Chapter V describes and justifies the research design and methodology used in this study. The research design and target population are presented, strategies for tailored design are described, sampling strategy is explained, instrumentation is described and justified, data collection procedures are explained, and statistical analysis procedures are discussed. Chapter VI presents the results of data analysis, and Chapter VII provides a discussion of the results, conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for further study."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW Introduction", "text": "The literature review begins with a description of the nature of the research domains of interest for this study. Then, the evolution and landscape of technology use in the nonprofit sector is described as compiled during the preliminary phase of my research (Trusty, 2011). Factors identified as having influence on IT adoption and use in the nonprofit sector are then presented, followed by the illumination of factors that have been the subject of preliminary examination in terms of their influence on IT alignment in the nonprofit sector. A description of themes that frame existing business-IT alignment models follows. Next, I identify challenges the nonprofit sector faces in translating and applying existing IT alignment models. This discussion sets the stage for an extensive examination of the concept of outcomes as it currently is understood in the knowledge base. Together these ideas preface the presentation in Chapter 4 of a new theoretical model and assessment tool for measuring the relationships between strategy typology, IT alignment maturity, and outcomes in nonprofit organizations, created as a response to current needs and challenges established in the literature."}, {"section_title": "Scholarly Research Domain", "text": "This investigation is built upon previous work in three distinct domains: IT alignment, nonprofit organizations' technology use, and performance measurement in nonprofit organizations. IT alignment queries focused on the keywords business-IT alignment, alignment maturity, IT alignment, and strategic IT alignment. This search garnered over 1,800 articles, nearly all of which could be traced back to Henderson and Venkatraman' Strategic Alignment Model (1993) (n=1,794), Reich and Benbasat's social dimensions of alignment (1996,2000) n>585, and Luftman's assessing business-IT alignment maturity (2000) (n=339). The search for IT alignment literature in the nonprofit knowledge base using the keywords nonprofit, technology, alignment, and IT was less fruitful. Only two articles related directly to the present topic were widely cited, thus establishing Hackler and Saxton (2007) and Ross, Verclas and Levine (2009) as pioneers in this area. A variety of investigative avenues exist in terms of nonprofit technology use, and my focus in identifying supportive literature in this area was on the keywords nonprofit, technology, and strategy, which uncovered 186 relevant articles. Finally, a wealth of knowledge exists about current practices in nonprofit performance measurement, and those keywords plus technology comprised the search parameters for that aspect of this investigation, which illuminated foundational insights by Chinman, Imm and Wandersman (2004), Kanter (1994), Kaplan and Norton (2001) Hatry (2006), United Way (1996) and Wholey, Hatry and Newcomber (2010). Together these contributions provide insight into the extent of the knowledge base in these areas. The Evolution of IT Use by Nonprofits McNutt and Appenzeller (2004) describe three ages of the evolution of nonprofit technology use that have occurred over the past three decades: the Nacent Age, the Flowering Age, and the Institutional Age. While all sectors have experienced these ages, McNutt and Appenzeller specifically address ways in which nonprofits have modified their use of IT during each. Nonprofit technology use in the Nascent Age is characterized as having been ancillary to the employment of traditional social change strategies and included the use of static hardware, primitive internal networking and productivity software (i.e. word processing, databases for contact management, spreadsheets and accounting software for financial management, and desktop publishing tools) to support local and regional efforts. The Internet ushered in the Flowering Age, during which e-mail and web pages became the vehicle for advocacy campaigns in the nonprofit sector parallel to marketing and political campaigns in the private and government sector. The present Institutional Age is thus far characterized by the emergence of three elements, according to McNutt and Appenzeller (2004): new technologies, significantly changed strategies, and global scope (Trusty, 2011). Technology has become an indispensable strategic tool for some nonprofits, while others are still lagging behind in embracing its potential. NTEN, a virtual training and technical assistance community comprised of 35,000 members that \"aspires to a world where all nonprofit organizations skillfully and confidently use technology to meet community needs and fulfill their mission\" (Nonprofit Technology Network, 2011), provides insight into NPO technology. use through its annual survey of IT staffing and use by nonprofits. The survey results describe two distinct groups in terms of nonprofit technology use: leaders and stragglers. Nonprofit technology leaders are comfortable adopting emerging technologies and using them to become more productive in achieving their missions. In contrast, straggler nonprofits use technology at an average to low rate and lag behind in terms of technology adoption. Of 994 NPOs surveyed by NTEN in 2009, 65% were classified as stragglers, and 35% were considered leaders (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010, p.16). This portrait changed significantly in 2011, as only 5.3% of 975 respondents (2% response rate) rated themselves as stragglers and 14.8% considered themselves leaders (Hoehling, 2012a, p. 36). The report suggests that this change may be indicative of the explosion of technology options available for all nonprofits, giving all an opportunity to adopt something, while posing a challenge for leaders to stay on top of all of the tech tools and strategies being used in the sector. The findings of the NTEN surveys must be taken at face value, and caution must be taken to not extrapolate them to all nonprofits, as the survey respondents are members of NTEN, which means they have a distinct interest in improving their use of technology. Waters (2007) analyzed the content of the websites of a stratified random sample of the top 400 philanthropic organizations listed by the Chronicle of Philanthropy to identify ways in which they used the Internet. He found that a majority of the organizations disseminated information, including their services, news, mission statements, and annual reports. A majority also encouraged 2-way communication by requesting patrons' e-mail addresses and feedback, as well as accepted donations through their websites. Approximately one-third hosted online stores. Others use technology to extend their reach through advertising and advocacy efforts (McNutt & Boland, 1999, McNutt, 2007, civic engagement, networking, and relationship-building. Trusty (2011) expanded the scope of Waters' work in order to see if similar practices were used by nonprofits of all sizes, not just the top 400. She found in her content analysis of 567 Indiana NPOs with budgets between $0 and $44 million that 77% of them had websites, and although there was a significant relationship between organizational size and the presence of a website (r=2.39, p<.000), more than 2/3 of all sizes incorporated the Internet into their work. Her investigation reinforced the findings of Waters (2007), McNutt (2007), and McNutt and Boland (1999), as she found that a majority of organizations examined used social media and other two-way communication tools, online fundraising, and disseminated information through the Internet. However, she also found that far more NPOs located in metropolitan areas (81%) had an Internet presence than those located in micropolitan (12%) and rural (7%) areas, which indicates a need not previously identified in the nonprofit sector overall. These descriptions of increasingly widespread, although disparate, adoption of Internet-based technology align with earlier findings by Brainard and Brinkerhoff (2004), who assert that while some NPOs are maximizing their resources through the use of the Internet, others they surveyed do not take advantage of this low-cost resource. These findings also support evidence of a digital divide among NPOs described by Servon (2001) and identified by Schneider (2003) in her investigation of minority-serving nonprofits, in which she found many nonprofit agencies do not have the technology or skills to submit electronic proposals or adhere to online reporting requirements of funding agencies. Additionally, changes in technology use have taken place since Hackler and Saxton's (2007) analysis of 2001 survey data collected by Gifts in Kind International, which indicates that many nonprofits see IT as simply a tool to accomplish administrative tasks, at least in some NPOs. This wide variety of findings illuminates two issues: first, NPOs are using technology, but for a wide variety of purposes and at a wide range of levels. Second, while the nonprofit sector is beginning to embrace technology, it could benefit from tools that help organizations incorporate the efficiency and effectiveness afforded by technology into their mission-focused work. Factors that Influence NPOs' IT Adoption and Use Many factors shape NPOs' technology decisions. NTEN engages in nonprofit sector survey research in order to provide organizations with real-time data they can use to make decisions about technology. The following section is a brief summary of current knowledge of how and why NPOs adopt and use technology, or face challenges in doing so. The summary uses a recent iteration of these survey findings (Bernard and Pukstas, 2010) as a structure through which to describe the knowledge base in this area, identifying specific factors that influence nonprofits' IT adoption and use."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Size", "text": "The size of an organization matters, relative to IT use, in terms of organizational budget. Larger NPOs, with budgets over $1 million, tend to be more sophisticated in their IT use because they have discretionary funds to support staffing, equipment, and training (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010;Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;McNutt, 2007;McNutt & Boland, 1999;Wolpert & Seeley, 2007). However, Hoehling (2012a) found that there was not a significant correlation between organization size and NPOs' reported level of adoption and use, which led the author to suggest that even if an NPO has no control over its budget, it can control its technology decision-making strategy. Again, however, this NTEN finding was derived from a group of NPOs whose organizational strategy includes a specific focus on improving their use of technology."}, {"section_title": "Staffing", "text": "In terms of staffing, while organizations with more staff tend to dedicate more effort toward implementing IT, most nonprofits cannot afford a full-time IT person and delegate IT responsibilities to whomever has the time or interest, regardless of their level of IT competency (Baruch & Ramalho, 2006;Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Manzo & Pitkin, 2007;. In organizations that hold technology adoption and use as a high priority, the average number of technology staff is remaining constant, but the ratio of dedicated technology staff to overall organizational staff is increasing, from an average of 34 in 2009 (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010) to an average of 60 (Hoehling, 2012a), a trend which is unexplained at present, but is being monitored. In order to meet their technology needs, some NPOs outsource IT to consultants (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010) which according to Van Lier and Dohmen (2007), changes the landscape of IT management, thus impacting IT decision-making and, consequently, alignment."}, {"section_title": "Training and Technical Assistance", "text": "The level and availability of technology training for staff also influences IT adoption and use.  found that while NPOs often struggle in obtaining the technology tools they need, a greater challenge is building staff capacity to use new tools while expecting them to maintain their level of effort toward existing duties. This challenge is further clarified by Manzo and Pitkin (2007), who assert that capacity-building is necessary at two levels for successful technology integrationmanagement must know how to plan for technology implementation and include training as part of the process, and \"accidental techie\" staff must be provided with the training and support necessary to use the technology and navigate technological infrastructure (p.65). In their ongoing monitoring of staff technical training through NTEN annual surveys, Bernard and Pukstas (2010) and Hoehling (2012a) consistently find training to be the biggest challenge, both in the time and resources dedicated to training, and staff satisfaction with the level of training. They summarize the findings as, \"employees who are well-trained and comfortable with technology are better prepared to meet an organization's technology needs\" (2010, p. 23). Management Involvement Pettigrew (1973) suggests it is critical to involve management in technology innovation decisions because they have political power to allocate resources and staff in ways that can lead to successful change or failure. Manzo and Pitkin (2007), Harrison and Murray (2007) and Zorn, Flanagin and Soham (2011) assert that senior management support is a strong factor in IT adoption and use, and in order to be effective advocates, managers must have a high level of knowledge in how to select and use appropriate technology. Findings of Hameed and Counsell's (2012) meta-analysis of factors influencing IT adoption underscore the critical nature of CEOs' involvement in technology decision-making in all sectors, describing their influence at multiple levels of the process: In the initiation stage, managers' help developing awareness among the organizational members, in the adoption-decision stage they are responsible for allocating necessary resources and in the implementation stage they can create an environment for smooth integration into the organizational settings\u2026 Every adoption process is associated with uncertainty; however, a CEO with more positive attitude challenges these risks and continues to maintain their enthusiasm by committing increasing amounts of resources (para. 35)."}, {"section_title": "Mission and Goals", "text": "If an organization's mission or goals do not address technology or innovation, an organization is less likely to adopt technology or, at minimum, less likely to successfully implement IT tools and strategies (Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Fitch, 2007;Nunn, 2007;."}, {"section_title": "Culture", "text": "The values, beliefs, and behaviors of an organization, its culture, is a powerful driver of change. Adopting and using technology is a significant change in organizations. A negative culture, in which fear of change, anxiety about new technology, and negative expectations about the changes exist, can be a significant barrier to nonprofit IT adoption and use (Harrison & Murray, 2007;Manzo & Pitkin, 2007). Similarly, resistance to change, unwillingness to take risks, and a propensity to hold on to tried and true practices, particularly in the case of older workers, can also be barriers (McNutt, 2007. Conversely, collaborative cultures and those that embrace risk and innovation encourage NPO IT adoption and use (Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Nunn, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Funding and Other Resources", "text": "The availability of resources to invest in technology was deliberately put near the end of this list simply because the claim, \"we don't have the money\" is often the first reason assumed for nonprofit organizations' resistance to anything. Only 27% of NTEN survey respondents were satisfied with budget allocations for technology, and less than half (48%) of NTEN respondents feel they have the IT tools, hardware and software to meet the needs of all staff (Bernard and Pukstas, 2010). However, even organizations that aren't cash-strapped struggle with IT resources because many do not prioritize technology in terms of its share of the budget (Trusty, 2011). Government funding is, conversely, a factor that facilitates increased technology use because when the government mandates reporting and accountability tasks that require the use of computers and the Internet, they often supply resources to fulfill the tasks through grant line items or contracts (Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Manzo & Pitkin, 2007;Wolpert & Seeley, 2007;Zhang, Gutierrez, & Mathieson, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Influence", "text": "A stakeholder is defined by Freeman as \"any group or individual who is affected by or can affect the achievement of an organization's objectives\" (1984, p. 5). External stakeholders, such as governmental funders described above, community leaders, and donors have the power to influence the use of funding for technology, as well as leverage their power to influence decisions to adopt and use certain technologies. Funder expectations drive IT adoption and use through the provision of restricted funds and, conversely, a lack of non-restricted donations (Clerkin & Gronbjerg, 2007;Hall, 2007;Manzo & Pitkin, 2007;Wolpert & Seeley, 2007). Likewise, internal stakeholders, including the board, staff, volunteers and clients, have the power to champion or challenge decisions to adopt and use technology (Hameed & Counsell, 2012;O'Hanlon & Chang, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Planning and Alignment", "text": "The process of choosing technology that facilitates an organization's mission may sound quite simple, but evidence from the nonprofit sector suggests that it is far from an easy task. However, in tech savvy NPOs, some progress is being made. According to NTEN Staffing surveys (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010;Hoehling, 2012a), only thirty-five percent were satisfied with the integration of IT with their strategic plans, in 2009 just over one-third had strategic IT plans, and two years later 55% had strategic IT plans. In the nonprofit sector overall, though, little is known about whether IT is aligned in a way that will help organizations achieve their missions (Pereira & Cullen, 2009, p. 1056. In summary, the literature tells us that many factors influence nonprofit IT adoption and use, and it is likely that these same factors influence the level of IT alignment in NPOs, a prediction that will be tested in this investigation."}, {"section_title": "Current Ideas about Nonprofit IT Alignment", "text": "Nonprofit technology practitioners believe that IT alignment can help nonprofits more effectively achieve their missions based on their own anecdotal evidence, as well as demonstrated impacts in the private sector. Investigations of effective use of IT by NPOs frame the discussion of IT alignment. Effective use is defined by Gurstein (2003) as \"the capacity and opportunity to successfully integrate [IT] into the accomplishment of self or collaboratively identified goals\" (p. 8), which alludes to the concept of IT alignment. Harrison and Murray (2007) proceeded with this definition to create an [IT] effectiveness model which suggests that an organization's experience with IT, participation in IT use, job stress, ease of use of IT and financial resources are variables that impact perceived benefits from technology, which can be translated to \"effective use.\" O' Hanlon and Chang (2007) describe factors that impact effective use through their Technology Adoption and Use Model, through which they explain that the external environment, pressure from donors and volunteers to use IT, and IT's role in helping or inhibiting compatibility between clients and organizations all impact IT adoption and use. These models arrange combinations of the above-mentioned factors in ways that explain NPOs' propensity to adopt and use IT, yet they do not directly address the process of integrating IT with organizations' missions and goals in ways that will foster better achievement of organizational outcomes. McInerney (2007), Silverman, Rafter and Martinez (2007), and Hackler & Saxton (2007), however, insist that while effective technology use is important, connecting technology use with an organization's mission, IT-mission alignment, in other words, is truly the ultimate objective. Te'eni and Young (2003) and Manzo and Pitkin (2007) assert that integrating IT into the overall strategic planning process of nonprofits would result in increased richness, reach, affiliation, and effectiveness of organizations through improved, innovative information flow, provided that such integration is deliberate. Through their work with thousands of NPO staff across the U.S., technology consultants , Merritt (personal communication, November 29, 2010), and Campbell (personal communication, November 29, 2010) have seen this type of deliberate integration here and there in their work, but they have deduced that, for the most part, the divide between tech leaders and stragglers still exists in the nonprofit sector because most NPOs view ICT tools as add-ons, point-of-purchase solutions, or office supplies that help get work done, but not necessarily as strategic tools that are critical to achieving organizational missions. They have come to accept the dichotomy in the present, but assert that certain strategies can help straggler NPOs on a broad scale cross the divide and align IT with their missions in ways that will increase their organizational. Interestingly, in the two years since these conversations, the growth of free or low-cost, accessible, user-friendly social media and cloud-based tools have created a significant bridge between the leaders and stragglers. NTEN's 4 th annual Nonprofit Social Network Benchmark Report (Nonprofit Technology Network, 2012) found that 98% of nonprofit respondents use Facebook, up 30% from 2011, Twitter use by nonprofits increased 81% between 2011 and 2012. These increases are attributed to nonprofits' efforts to incorporate social media into their organizational strategy, make it a priority, and dedicate staff time to managing social network presence. These finding provide evidence for the claims above that strategy and staffing do impact technology use and adoption. But, again, the findings stop at activities and fail to consider whether technology impacts outcomes. Attention to the concept of nonprofit IT alignment emerged in practice through YMCA of the USA (2007) and NTEN . In descriptions of their respective models, YMCA and Heye suggest that nonprofit IT use can be characterized at one of five levels of maturity: \uf0b7 Chaotic -The organization is struggling to keep up with failing infrastructure, spending all of their time fixing old equipment \uf0b7 Reactive -The organization has basic systems in place to keep workstations running and updated, immediate needs are budgeted, but no plan is in place for long-term growth. \uf0b7 Proactive -The organization has a stable infrastructure, solid operations software, and a good set of policies and practices. Technology builds efficiencies, but isn't used to strategically meet the mission of the organization. IT does not help with organizational planning. \uf0b7 Service -The organization anticipates and meets the IT needs of staff, IT staff is involved in strategic planning processes in which IT is envisioned as helping internal and external functions. \uf0b7 Value -IT is considered an investment in mission, a percentage of budget is dedicated to IT, existing technologies are evaluated for mission and revenue impact, and new technologies are explored for future use. IT systems provide critical metrics to the organization. (Heye, 2009, p. 11-12) Heye (2009) describes the Five Stages of Managing Technology as a model that can be used by organizations to informally assess where they are in the evolutionary process and identify specific practices they can change to become more mature in their alignment between IT and organizational mission and goals. This model is an adaptation of two existing business models, Luftman's SAMM (2000) and Gartner's Enterprise Architecture Maturity Model (Schulman, 2002) that incorporate many of the same factors as SAMM. The main difference in Heye's model is that the factors are described in language that is familiar in the nonprofit sector, as illustrated in Figure 1. Although this practitioner model has yet to be empirically tested, Heye believes that if appropriate metrics can be identified to measure whether higher levels of NPO IT alignment maturity result in greater mission and goal achievement, the model can be a viable tool for nonprofits wishing to improve their IT alignment (Heye, personal communication, November 29, 2010).  Nonprofit IT Pyramid is a similar, yet more rudimentary framework to help nonprofit organizations understand how IT is typically adopted and used and how it can evolve in ways that can help NPOs better achieve their missions. The Nonprofit IT Pyramid is not designed to quantitatively diagnose organizations' level of IT alignment maturity, nor does it prescribe specific strategies organizations can use to evolve in their use of technology. Rather, it is a guide that suggests the order in which nonprofits should focus their efforts to bring IT into the organizational mix, as illustrated in Figure 2 below. While the pyramid is a nice guide, it is just that, and it has the potential to frustrate organizations that might attempt to use it as a change model for two reasons. First, the statement is made in their literature, \"It is no coincidence that Access to Stable and Secure Technologies is the foundation of our pyramid; it plays a very important role as a platform for additional technology adoption\" (2010, p. 2). It is an unfortunate coincidence that 28% of the most tech-savvy nonprofits (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010, p.16), and likely a much higher percentage of all nonprofits, are not presently at the bottom level of the pyramid because they consider themselves lagging behind or in trouble in terms of their technology use. Further, asking these nonprofits to envision the small steps they can take to get to the next level is futile. If they knew the small steps they should take, they would already be there. The most recently-released nonprofit IT alignment model is an iteration of Microsoft's model presented by NPower, which is a consortium of nonprofit technical assistance providers funded in part by Microsoft that serves 13 metropolitan areas across the U.S. (NPower, 2011). The Nonprofit Technology Pyramid considers stragglers as it presents a broader foundation to its model depicting organizations that are \"technology constrained,\" thus considering the stragglers, as shown in Figure 3. Again, the model is conceptual in nature and lacks a structure through which IT alignment maturity can be diagnosed and specific strategies prescribed for more sophisticated alignment. In order for NPOs to fully benefit from the work that has been done in the sphere of IT alignment, these ideas must be transformed into quantitative models and validated tools to assess and direct improvement of organizations' IT alignment. This has been done in the business sector, and has helped organizations achieve higher levels of alignment and greater organizational outcomes."}, {"section_title": "The Evolution of Business-IT Alignment Models", "text": "Organizations practice strategic IT alignment as they examine their organizational strategy (mission, vision, goals, and activities) and structure, choose technology initiatives and infrastructure that are best suited to their strategy, assess the effectiveness of these choices, then start the entire cycle again as the organization continues to change. The alignment process is complex. It involves making and evaluating ongoing, strategic decisions across multiple organizational levels throughout an organization's environment . This complexity is evident in the myriad of models and frameworks that have been created over the past several decades to describe the alignment process, its antecedents, and outcomes. The Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993) describes factors that influence IT alignment relative to four domains of strategy choice: business strategy, business infrastructure, IT strategy and IT infrastructure, and illuminates the role strategic fit and functional integration play in the alignment process. Strategic alignment is defined as an organization's ability to create a strategic fit between its position in the product-market arena and the appropriate administrative structure to support its execution (p. 6). SAM posits that when organizations consider IT initiatives that will further their strategic direction, they must make decisions within four domains of strategic choice: the external domains of organizational strategy and IT strategy, and the internal domains of organizational infrastructure and IT infrastructure. The concepts of strategic fit and functional integration were adopted by Luftman, Papp and Brier (1999) and Luftman (2000) as the foundation for alignment maturity criteria established by the Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM). According to SAMM, alignment maturity is the extent to which business and IT strategies and infrastructure functions are planned and integrated, based on a collection of internal and external factors. Luftman, Papp and Brier (1999) initiated their consideration of SAM as an appropriate model of business-IT alignment by using it as the basis for a survey that identified enablers and inhibitors of IT alignment. They elaborated upon SAM to include twelve components that define business-IT alignment, three in each of the domains described earlier by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993). The findings of this survey, implemented with 500 companies in 15 different industry sectors, provided the insight necessary to build an instrument with which organizations can assess their business-IT alignment maturity. The instrument combines the 12 original components into 6 criteria necessary for mature alignment: \uf0b7 Communications -Effective exchange of ideas and clear understanding of what will ensure successful strategies (p. 14) \uf0b7 Competency/value measurement -A balanced 'dashboard' that demonstrates the value of IT in terms of contribution to the business and clearly defines rewards and penalties for surpassing or missing objectives (p. 15) \uf0b7 Governance -Ensuring that the appropriate business and IT participants formally discuss and review the priorities and allocation of IT resources, and that decision-making authority is clearly defined (p. 17) \uf0b7 Partnership -The relationship between business and IT organizations\u2026, the opportunity for [each] to have an equal role in defining business strategies\u2026,sharing of risks and rewards of new initiatives\u2026,and sharing of a clearly-defined vision (p. 17-18) \uf0b7 Scope and architecture -The extent to which IT goes beyond the back office and front office of an organization, supports a flexible, transparent infrastructure, evaluates and applies emerging technologies, enable business processes and strategies, and provide customizable solutions (p. 19) \uf0b7 Skills -All the human resource considerations for the organization, including training, salary, performance feedback, career opportunities, cultural and social environments (p. 20) The most current iteration of the SAMM assessment survey (Luftman, 2011) uses 29 specific business characteristics and behaviors as variables, or factors that measure an organization's level of alignment in each of the six criteria, as displayed in Table 1. Table 1 SAMM Alignment Criteria (Luftman, 2003) SAMM Criteria SAMM Factors The five levels of business/IT alignment delineated in SAMM may look familiar, as they influenced the levels of alignment described earlier in  Five Stages of Managing Technology: 1. Initial/Ad Hoc Process: This is the lowest level of maturity; management practices and strategic IT choices to facilitate alignment do not exist or are ad hoc in nature. 2. Committed Process: Management practices and strategic IT choices to facilitate alignment exist at a low level in the organization. 3. Established, Focused Process: Management practices and strategic IT choices to facilitate alignment exist at a moderate level in the organization. 4. Improved/Managed Process: Management practices and strategic IT choices to facilitate alignment exist at a strong level in the organization. 5. Optimized Process: Management practices and strategic IT choices to facilitate alignment are fully integrated and coadaptive between the business and IT function. (Sledgianowski, Luftman, & Reilly, 2006, p. 19) The above factors were first validated by Luftman (2000) through implementation of a SAMM assessment survey instrument with 25 Fortune 500 companies (p. 10). Sledgianowski, Luftman and Reilly (2006) established confirmatory factor reliability and validity of the maturity constructs through a pilot of the instrument with 23 business and IT executives, then full-scale application of the survey with 153 executives from eight organizations (p. 22). However, these investigations did not take place in a vacuum. While Luftman's model has garnered over 250 independent inquiries of IT alignment to the present day using the SAMM instrument (Chan & Reich, 2007;Zhang, Gutierrez & Mathieson, 2010;Kempaiah, 2008;Nash, 2009;Khaiata & Zualkerman, 2009;Evers, 2010), others explored the concept from a variety of perspectives. Together, these studies suggest nine themes that characterize understandings of IT alignment, which are described below. Specific factors, or antecedents, have been identified through surveys, case studies, and interviews as having measurable influence on IT alignment (Luftman, Papp & Brier, 1999;Luftman, 2000Luftman, , 2001Raymond, Pare, & Bergeron, 1995;Sabherwal & Kirs 1994). Relationships within organizations also influence IT alignment. Sharing information, communicating, planning together, and celebrating success all require the development and nurturance of relationships within an organization, relationships which can enable greater alignment maturity (Bassellier & Benbasat, 2004;Bassellier, Benbasat & Reich, 2003;Chan, Sabherwal & Thatcher, 2006;Kearns & Lederer, 2003;Luftman, Papp & Brier, 1999;Reich & Benbasat, 1996. Both formal and informal aspects of organizational culture can either enable or inhibit alignment (Campbell, Kay, &Avison;Chan, 2002;CIO Insight Staff , 2004;Sledgianowski & Luftman, 2005;Tallon & Kraemer, 2003). The adage 'plan your work and work your plan' is clearly communicated in the literature relative to IT alignment --strategic planning is a necessary precursor to IT alignment (Chan, Sabherwal & Thatcher, 2005;Kearns & Lederer, 2003;Luftman, Papp & Brier, 1999;Reich & Benbasat, 1996Sledgianowski & Luftman, 2005). Shared knowledge and skills between business staff and IT staff are critical to successful and sustained alignment (Bassellier, Benbasat & Reich;Luftman, 2000). Most often, a champion, either from the business side or the IT side of an organization, facilitates the alignment process (Cragg, King & Hussin, 2002;Kearns & Lederer, 2003, Luftman, 2003Reich, & Benbasat, 2000). An organization's strategy typology, described as either a Prospector, Analyzer, Defender, or Reactor , influences its approach to and success in achieving and sustaining alignment (Chan, 2002;Chan & Huff, 1992;Chan, Sabherwal & Thatcher, 2006;Cragg, King & Hussin, 2002). Although the positive aspects of IT alignment are touted in a majority of these investigations, alignment is not always an appropriate goal for organizations. In fact, it is possible to \"overdo\" alignment and cause an organization to get stuck in its strategic approach and become unresponsive to environmental changes necessary for sustainability (Chan & Huff, 1992;Chan, Sabherwal & Thatcher, 2006;Sabherwal & Chan, 2001;Street, 2006). Accordingly, it is important for this investigation and its practical applications to acknowledge this risk and proceed with the foundational advice that the IT alignment process must be dynamic and flexible (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993;Orlikowski, 1996;Tallon & Kraemer, 2003). Finally, while IT alignment in itself is a formidable organizational outcome (Reich & Benbasat, 2000;Byrd, Lewis & Bryan, 2006) successful IT alignment is a means to greater ends: improvement of effectiveness, efficiency, growth, and financial metrics. These themes integrate Luftman's SAMM criteria and factors with similar and novel factors that have dominated the literature. A vast collection of investigations identify specific performance outcomes that are improved as a result of aligning IT with business processes and strategies (Chan, Sabherwal & Thatcher, 2006;Cragg, King & Hussin, 2002;Cragg & Tordorova, 2005;Croteau & Bergeron, 2001;Kempaiah, 2008;Luftman & Kempaiah, 2007;Nash, 2009;Sabherwal & Chan, 2001). These outcomes are shared with a caveat provided by Soh and Marcus (1995) and reiterated in essence by Chan and Reich (2007), that \"outcomes may not occur even when conditions [like alignment] are present unless a particular 'recipe' involving external directional forces and probabilistic processes unfolds\"(p. 31). Accordingly, the outcomes described assume that the factors previously described are present and take place as the process of alignment, performance outcomes that Soh and Markus (1995) generalize as primarily financial indicators such as return on investment, assets, and expense/income ratio. Previous investigations have isolated and tested a broad collection of antecedents to business-IT alignment. As is the case with most theoretical models and constructs, no one model addresses all facets of the phenomenon of interest. Each investigation isolates specific factors of interest, and it is likely that no singular model has the ability to comprehensively assess IT alignment. However, all of them illuminate components of alignment that can and should be incorporated into a theoretical model and corresponding measurement instrument if there is hope of presenting data to organizations that can truly assist them in increasing their IT alignment in authentic settings. SAMM (Luftman, 2011), although the most comprehensively tested, is not a perfect model for the purposes of this investigation. Its use in isolation ignores the additional factors mentioned above, the influence of business strategy typology, which is claimed to preclude alignment efforts, the direct relationship between alignment and organizational outcomes, and for the purposes of this investigation, the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations. Further, it has four distinct limitations to its transferability. First, it provides indicators for future progress in alignment maturity, but its utility stops at the indicators. Data derived from the instrument suggests factors that organizations can change in order to increase their IT alignment maturity, but does not provide specific guidance in how to change those factors beyond increasing their individual levels of maturity. Second, in all chronicles of its implementation in the business sector, greater IT alignment maturity is claimed to result in increased or improved organizational outcomes, but a majority of those outcomes are business-specific metrics, limited primarily to standard economic and financial indicators, such as profit/loss and return on investment (ROI). Use of SAMM to date exposes a gap in its utility in sectors and organizations in which performance metrics depart from such indicators. The nonprofit sector is one such sector in which performance is measured by far more than dollars. This disparity in metrics between business and nonprofit sectors is likely a primary reason SAMM and IT alignment as a strategic practice have been widely investigated in the business sector, yet have only been explored by a handful of investigators in the nonprofit sector. Third, SAMM, as well as all of the other models discussed, has been applied nearly exclusively in the business sector, and consequently the terminology and construct assumptions of these models render them inappropriate for wholesale adoption in a nonprofit environment. For example, if SAMM was administered in a small nonprofit organization, which describes the majority of NPOs, (Bernard & Pukstas, 2009Levine, 2008), it is unlikely that terms like \"federated/hybrid IT function\", \"activitybased costing\", and \"service level agreements\" included in the questionnaire (Luftman, 2011) would hold meaning for NPO respondents. Also, the models assume that the IT function is the responsibility of a full time employee or even department which, in small nonprofits, is highly unlikely (Bernard & Pukstas, 2009Levine, 2008). In order for any of these models to be of value to NPOs, the language describing the factors would need to be modified, which would prohibit any established validity from being generalized to the nonprofit sector. Fourth, it has been suggested that for-profit and non-profit organizations exist in two different worlds in terms of their missions, goals and outcomes. For-profit organizations, a term used interchangeably with the terms \"business(es)\" and \"business organization(s)\" for the purposes of this investigation, maximize profit and wealth, while nonprofits maximize social value and social welfare by changing individual and community attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and conditions (Baruch & Ramalho, 2006;Costa, Ramus, & Andreaus, 2011;Hackler & Saxton, 2007;Moore, 2000;Sowa, Selden & Sandfort, 2004). Fine describes this distinction quite clearly, \"The commercial sector provides a service on demand for the purpose of making money. Our beloved sector serves hard-to-reach people with hard-to-solve problems, against great odds, for the public good\" (2006, p. 4). A perfect example of this difference is illustrated by Crutchfield and Grant, who describe the \"underwhelming\" number of homes for lowincome families built by Habitat for Humanity, when compared to the number of lowincome housing communities built by commercial real estate developers. They assert that Habitat's impact moves far beyond bricks and sticks, \"Habitat doesn't aspire merely to build houses for the poor, but rather to mobilize communities to solve the problems of poverty housing. They inspire hundreds of thousands of middle-class volunteers to help build Habitat houses -to change how they think, how they act, and how they vote.\" (2012, p. 101) It is this distinction between the missions of private and nonprofit organizations that necessitates a careful consideration of fit when proposing a model that measures and encourages improvement of IT alignment in the nonprofit sector. Chan, Saberwhal and Thatcher (2006) echo this sentiment with this assertion that IT alignment mechanisms vary by industry and business strategy. In brief, the above discussion provides an overarching view of thoughts on business-IT alignment to the present, and provides a means to determine how translation beyond the business sector might proceed. Even with its limitations, it makes sense to consider SAMM as the starting point for adaptation to the nonprofit sector because it is the one that most comprehensively addresses the wide variety of factors that have been suggested. However, it can only be considered a starting point because, as was described previously, alignment does not happen in a vacuum, and it is not an end within itself. It has been posited that an organization's propensity to align IT with its mission is driven by its strategic orientation (Sabherwal & Chan, 2001). Further, the ultimate purpose of IT/mission alignment is to increase an organization's success in achieving its intended outcomes. Therefore, we must consider strategic orientation and outcomes as part of a larger equation in order to fully understand the potential benefits of IT alignment. Thus, the next section will address strategic orientation, which is followed by a business-sector model that brings together strategic orientation; technology deployment, which shares many similarities with IT alignment; and organizational performance. This confluence of business sector models will be followed by a consideration of the differences between NPOs and for-profit organizations and how those differences could impact transfer of the models across the sectors. A key difference, measurement of outcomes, will then be addressed in-depth in Chapter III. In Chapter IV, these ideas will be brought together into a new theoretical model that can be applied in nonprofit settings. Strategy Typology as a Driver of Alignment Miles and Snow's Business Strategy model (1978) explains the process of organizational adaptation and change as it is driven by the strategic choices that are made by decision-makers in organizations on a daily basis. According to Miles and Snow, \"Organizations act to create their environment\" (1978, p. 5), and over time these actions represent an ongoing adaptive cycle. They propose that these actions are determined by problems that arise and corresponding strategic choices that are made within an environment constrained by organizational structure and managers' processes of managing people and tasks. The configuration of staff and volunteers, the organizational hierarchy (i.e. chain of command), the formality of policies and procedures, and the way decisions are made are all structures and processes that influence an organization's strategic actions. More simply, 'structure + process = strategy'. The strategic actions translate to stable patterns of behavior over time, thus becoming part of an organization's character. The choice to align technology with an organization's mission is an example of a strategic action, and how the organization goes about the alignment process often demonstrates its strategy typology. The combination of these problems and strategy choices shape four distinct types of strategic behavior exhibited in most organizations, based on Miles and Snow's observations over time (1978) and hundreds of related investigations over the past several decades. More recently, these behaviors were analyzed in the nonprofit context by , who found, through their survey of 132 NPOs and interviews with 9 executives from NPOs that exemplified each strategy typology, that the characteristics of each typology translated consistently from the business context in which the typologies were originally operationalized to the participant organizations. The four business strategy typologies have been applied extensively in empirical investigations with consistent findings over time in a variety of contexts James & Hatten, 1995;Sebaa, Wallace & Cornelius, 2010;Shortell & Zajac, 1990 Defenders have a narrow focus, a set service area, or they serve a specific client or need. They are the experts in their sector and generally do not seek out new problems to solve or partners with which to collaborate. They often have formal policies and procedures to guide their work. Their approach to decision-making is generally stable, fueled by staff ideas and approved and monitored by the board. Strategy choices focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the services they currently provide and, to a limited extent, pursuing innovations that will help improve service delivery. Defenders can be characterized as either the go-to organization for best practices if their services result in consistent, reliable, high-quality, mission-focused outcomes, or they might be the 'old dog' in a community that does what has always been done with little regard for environmental pressures or changes. Defenders view their mission as a strict boundary for service provision . Prospectors are always looking for new ways to meet emerging needs. Accordingly, they are always in search of the latest technology and processes to create novel solutions. Prospectors are risk takers and often give up efficiency and overall superiority in exchange for their position as first on the block. They continually scan the community for opportunities to serve and respond quickly to funding and program development opportunities. These organizations invest resources and establish extensive partnerships to create, test, and offer new approaches. Board members, staff and volunteers are dynamic in their roles, champions and innovators are celebrated, committees are active, and service areas, policies and procedures are redefined as needed to meet emerging needs. Prospectors consider their mission a 'jumping off point' from which they should innovate and expand to meet a variety of needs . Analyzers exist in two domains: one that is stable and requires routine processes, formalized structures, and efficient technology; and one that readily adapts to changes in the community. The stable base often consists of a well-developed, yet dynamic strategic plan, which provides fuel for controlled innovation. Analyzers engage in ongoing needs assessment to keep their finger on the pulse of their community of stakeholders. When they find opportunities to solve new problems, they do so with conservative, yet progressive technology, structure and process choices. Staff and volunteers are often specialized, and decisions are data-driven. Analyzers use their mission to drive a set of limited, stable services yet they remain open to promising practices that might enable them to better meet community needs . Reactors do not tend to maintain a specific niche or present innovative approaches. Rather, these organizations respond to environmental demands by looking at what other organizations are doing, filling gaps and eliminating duplicative services. Environmental pressures tend to force disorganized choices in terms of who to serve, what to provide, what tools to use, and how to structure and process the work. Conserving resources and avoiding risk are often the focus, and the mission is flexible enough to adapt to a variety of needs and opportunities . As described above, the strategy typologies are the means by which organizations can be classified in terms of their general approach to planning, structuring their work, making decisions, and implementing processes. Considered through the lens of technology, strategy typology can be a critical driver of the structures and processes organizations choose as they adopt technology, use it, and align it with their missions. Croteau and Bergeron (2001) posit that strategy typology and technological deployment, defined in a way that closely mirrors Luftman's (2000) and  description of IT alignment, together impact organizational performance. An examination of their model provides significant insight into this process. The \"Information Technology Trilogy\" (Croteau & Bergeron, 2001) describes the relationships between business strategy, measured using Miles and Snow's strategy typology; technological deployment, described as corresponding \"to the way companies plan and manage information technology from its potential and effectiveness\" (p. 79) and measured using seven components that are similar to Luftman's six factors; and organizational performance, measured using financial and growth metrics (p. 81). Their model is shown in Figure 4 below: Croteau and Bergeron posit that for a business with a given type of strategy, a specific profile of technological deployment can help the firm enhance its performance. Using a questionnaire to which 243 organizations responded (12.5% response rate), they found that prospector strategic activities were positively related to organizational performance, and reactor activities impede performance. They also found that prospectors have high levels of impact, technological architecture, and system performance evaluation, while analyzers have high levels of information system department impact, architecture scanning, and evaluation. Conversely, they found a negative relationship between defender activities and impact, architecture, scanning and evaluation, and no relationship between technological deployment and reactor activities. These findings allowed them to generalize two profiles of technological deployment, inward and outward, that reflected these relationship patterns. When they tested relationships between the profiles and organizational performance, they found that analyzer (outward) and prospector (inward) profiles contribute to increased organizational performance (2001, pp. 91-93). The methodology section will discuss approaches to identifying and measuring these four strategy archetypes and their relationships to IT alignment and describe ways in which Croteau and Bergeron's model suggests the most appropriate approach to examining the relationships in the nonprofit sector. Later discussion also proposes a novel theoretical approach to incorporating three considerations of alignment -business strategy typology, factors influencing IT alignment maturity beyond just those measured by SAMM, and the measurement of outcomes --into a new framework that will best serve the needs of nonprofit organizations. Before this model can be presented, however, it is important to carefully consider the differences that prevent direct transfer of existing models to the nonprofit sector."}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Translating Business Models to the Nonprofit Sector", "text": "It would be very convenient to consider NPOs as just 'organizations' in order to test the transferability of SAMM and other relevant IT alignment concepts that emerged in the business sector. In fact several nonprofit investigations suggest that NPOs should \"run like a business\" by using strategies for success developed in the private sector (Paton, Foot & Payne, 2000;Standley, 2001;Young, 2001). Best-selling author and worldwide business consultant Jim Collins, who initially prescribed a disciplined approach to strategic operations that would transform businesses from mediocrity to top performers in Good to Great (2001), refuted this very assertion in his companion monograph, Good to Great and the Social Sectors (2006). He posits that disciplined people, disciplined thought, disciplined action and sustained focus on pursuing greatness in terms of outcomes, not business processes, makes an organization great. In Great by Choice, Collins and Hansen reiterate discipline, along with creativity, as cornerstones of greatness, particularly in fast-moving times such as today's technologically-driven society (2011). The distinct differences between business outcomes (financial) and nonprofit outcomes (social) give justification for not cutting and pasting practices from one sector to the other. Further, Collins claims that \"a culture of discipline is not a principle of business; it is a principle of greatness\" (2006, p. 1). Considering IT alignment in light of this assertion justifies its applicability to NPOs, because IT alignment in any organization is a strategic, deliberate practice that requires a sustained culture of discipline. The label \"nonprofit\" alone indicates that NPO are clearly different from \"forprofit\" business organizations. While these and all organizations share some characteristics, there are distinct differences in organizational character between NPOs and businesses. Edwards (2010) cautions that nonprofit and business organizations should each maintain their distinct character, and they should refrain from becoming \"hybrids\", as he claims the result would have undesirable tradeoffs. The present discussion will compare the two along several dimensions: mission and goals, organizational structure, culture, resources, stakeholders, and, most significantly for the purpose of this study, outcomes and performance metrics."}, {"section_title": "Different Mission and Goals", "text": "While every organization with a mission statement aspires to achieve that mission and its corresponding goals, the sentiments at the heart of nonprofit missions are very different from those of businesses (Cortes & Rafter, 2007;Hackler & Saxton, 2007;Moore, 2000). Friedman is very direct in suggesting the sole social responsibility of business, \"To use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of game, which is to say, engaged in open and free competition, without deception or fraud\" (Friedman, 1970, p. SM17). Rarely do NPO missions reflect a focus on profit for profit's sake. While NPOs do sometimes generate revenue and profit from their work, the proceeds are generally distributed back into the organization, presumably as further investment in achieving their mission. The primary focus of the work of nonprofit organizations is to fulfill a social mission (Hackler & Saxton, 2007) or social value, defined in the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors (1966) as \"principles and standards of human interaction within a given group that are regarded by members of that group as being worthy, important, or significant\". As they interface with individuals, groups and communities, NPOs strive to create social value with resources entrusted to them (Moore, 2000), an endeavor that is sometimes difficult to define in terms of goals, and sometimes results in multiple goals. In contrast, businesses focus on specific, tangible goals (Campbell, McDonald & Sethibe, 2009), which include, in the most general sense, maximizing profits and creating wealth for stakeholders (Hackler & Saxton, 2007). Cortes and Rafter (2007) describe the heart of the problem, the difficulty nonprofits face in defining their work: In contrast to the for-profit world's focus on financial return on investment, nonprofits' tendency to have multiple, uncertain, conflicting, ambiguous, and hard-to-measure goals makes organizational effectiveness hard to define, thus complicating improvement of organizational effectiveness through technology. (p. XI)."}, {"section_title": "Different Organizational Structures", "text": "Billis and Glennerster (1998) contrast the structures of NPOs and businesses as the former having an ambiguous structure, while the latter has a bureaucratic structure. Such ambiguity is found primarily in smaller NPOs, which make up 80% of registered nonprofits (Guidestar, 2012), those that are governed by a volunteer board, employ volunteers as a significant part of the workforce, lack clearly defined job descriptions and roles for staff, and expect everyone in the organization to jump in wherever necessary. This characteristically different organizational structure brings with it a different approach to training and skill development (Beck, Lengnick-Hall & Lengnick-Hall, 2008). In private sector corporations, structured learning is often incorporated into employees' job responsibilities. In nonprofits that employ large numbers of volunteers, it is far more difficult to require necessary training during evenings and weekends, without compensation, after folks have invested themselves in their \"day jobs.\""}, {"section_title": "Different Organizational Cultures", "text": "Nonprofit organizations with social missions must, by nature, be a part of the fabric of their communities if they are to be successful in meeting the needs of their communities. In order to achieve this, a majority of NPOs serve the public good through collaborations and partnerships. Compared to for-profit entities, NPOs are described by Zhang, Gutierrez, and Mathieson (2010) as existing \u2026in their broader, and often complicated social environments. They must deal with other involved entities such as other nonprofit groups, service recipients, assistance organizations, and regulators. (p. 4). Personal motivation also impacts the culture of NPOs. Comparisons of NPO and forprofit workforces show that employees in NPOs are driven more by ideology than the prospect of higher pay or better performance (Devaro & Brookshire, 2007;Ruhm & Borkoski, 2003). This element of culture may impact NPO workers' propensity to adopt and use IT for non-mission-focused tasks, but it may contribute to greater support for ITmission alignment, according to Zhang, Gutierrez, and Mathieson (2010), because NPO employees and volunteers are more apt to focus on work that is directly related to mission. The capacity and inclination to take risks is also an important cultural consideration, one which affects organizational change related to IT differently in the two contexts. Businesses have full discretion to design a budget that supports IT and risk reinvesting profits to increase IT capacity according to their strategic plans. NPOs, on the other hand, may only do so with discretionary dollars. More often, NPOs receive grants, contracts, and donations that are restricted to specific projects and expenses. Choosing to allocate funds to IT may be considered a viable risk to some, a risk that may result in greater effectiveness, efficiency and productivity, but if an NPO does so with restricted dollars, funder relationships and future funding can be put in jeopardy. Further, investing in technology in the near term may be possible through specific funding streams, but funding for ongoing maintenance of IT may not be available, whereby negating the preliminary advantage of the investment. In short, businesses can take risks more easily than NPOs can, which is a cultural factor which also must be addressed in an IT alignment model."}, {"section_title": "Different Resources and Resource Acquisition Structures", "text": "Financial resources and the means by which they are acquired are vastly different in business and nonprofit organizations. Businesses sell products and services to cover expenses and make a profit. Sometimes they start up with infusions of capital by outsiders, sometimes they begin with someone's nest egg, and sometimes they take out loans. It is at the discretion of leadership that funds are allocated toward organizational priorities. NPOs, in contrast, garner operational funds through a variety of sources. In the case of grants, contracts, and some donations, the organization makes the request, hopefully a request that aligns with their strategic priorities, proposes a budget, and agrees to specific deliverables if the request is funded. If, and only if, the request includes technology can funds be directed toward technology. Income from fundraising and selling goods and services are typically the only discretionary funding streams to which NPOs have access. Accordingly, budget priorities are not made strictly in terms of what the organization plans to do, but more often in terms of what they have promised their funders they will do with the money entrusted to them. This dichotomy, of full discretion versus limited discretion, is not reflected in SAMM, but must be considered when assessing how IT is prioritized."}, {"section_title": "Different Stakeholders", "text": "In a business context, many internal and external individuals, departments, and organizations are involved in strategy and IT processes, and their views and cultures may exert influences on these processes (Campbell, McDonald, & Sethibe, 2009). Freeman and McVea (2001) suggest that effective businesses \"manage and integrate the relationships and interests of shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, communities and other groups in a way that ensures long-term success of the firm\" (p. 10). Zhang, Gutierrez, and Mathieson (2010), in their comparison of for-profit and nonprofit organizations, assert that all stakeholders in business settings work toward the same financial goals, whereas NPO stakeholders all have different goals. This assertion is not entirely accurate, considering Auerswald's (2009) discussion of externalities and residuals. Businesses, in some instances, must manage the competing interests of stakeholders who are focused on financial residuals, i.e. profits, with the interests of others who wish to reduce or prevent negative externalities, such as environmental or human degradation that might be generated alongside profit. In other instances, businesses manage a diverse group of stakeholders, some that focus on profit while others focus on creating ethical residuals such as hospitals, trusts, and institutes that will benefit communities (2009). Recent focus in the for-profit sector on corporate social responsibility (CSR) provides encouragement for businesses to consider and take responsibility for ways in which their actions affect the interests of all stakeholders (Leonard, 2013). Carroll (as cited in Leonard, 2013) suggests four priorities in this area: legal responsibility to comply with statutory obligations, economic responsibilities, most notably turning a profit, ethical responsibilities to do what is fair, and philanthropic responsibilities, giving back to the communities in which they operate. Businesses are obligated to balance these interests and many do so successfully, but in all cases the primary objective is to make a profit, and the most influential stakeholders are those that are involved in strategic management of the organization toward achieving shareholder wealth or financial residuals for the organization. Stakeholders in nonprofit contexts are equally as diverse, representing internal perspectives of board members, staff, volunteers and clients, as well as external influences of funders, partner organizations, regulatory bodies, and governmental entities, all of whom have an interest in maximizing a specific social value as defined by their mission (Costa, Ramos & Andreaus, 2011, p. 470). This is the primary difference between NPO and business stakeholders -their priorities. While businesses must consider stakeholder interests in social costs and benefits as an ancillary part of their overall strategy, NPOs' stakeholders interests are nearly exclusively focused on maximizing social value. Yet another distinction that sets NPOs apart from businesses is the categories of stakeholders that influence their mission-focused work. Costa, et al. (2011) identified six different categories of stakeholders in their analysis of role and process of stakeholder management in performance accountability, expanding on three categories previously described by Ebrahim (2003). Of the six categories, some were found to be influential to mission-focused work, some were found to be impacted by the mission of the NPOs being investigated, and some fit both criteria. Table 2 below presents the categories as described by both Costa et al. and Ebrahim, and the involvement of each category in the mission-focused work of NPOs. Ebrahim (2003) previously identified three distinct categories of stakeholders based on the bi-directional, principal-agent relationships that exist between each category and nonprofit and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The categories are defined primarily by the accountability mechanisms and activities involved in maintaining the relationships. Figure 5 illustrates these relationships. Table 2 Categories of NPO Stakeholders 2. Ebrahim, A. (2003). In both stakeholder models, some of the categories, such as control bodies/regulators, financiers/funders, clients and communities are common to both businesses and NPOs. However, the character of the relationships is very different in each of the sectors because the missions of each have very different character, as described above. Accordingly, the relationships must be strategically managed so that stakeholder interests can be accommodated by an NPO, and the NPO will continue to be supported by the stakeholders. Ebrahim provides several examples of this challenging management process as it might look in NPOs: \uf0b7 \"NPOs report on the easily measurable components of their work (such as numbers of homeless people served or hectares of land reforested) in order to satisfy funders, while failing to report on factors undermining their work, such as increases in homelessness due to rising costs of living or policies that encourage clearing of forests\" (2003, p. 197) [social values that are critical to mission partners]. \uf0b7 \"donors have the ability to 'punish' NGOs by threatening to cut funds, impose conditions, or tarnish their reputations in cases where NGOs fail to deliver quick results in their projects. While such punitive measures are no doubt justifiable in some cases, they can also reflect a failure on the part of funders to appreciate the complexities, uncertainties, and long time frames associated with social development work \" (p. 192) [social values that are critical to mission partners]. \uf0b7 Public policymakers and funders of nonprofit organizations tend to focus on external means of ensuring accountability, such as monitoring measures, controls, and laws. In doing so, they neglect issues of accountability that are internal to organizations and individuals, such as integrity and mission, and through which principals and agents work toward developing congruent interests and commitments (p. 197). \uf0b7 Public agencies [are] sometimes unwilling to inspect politically powerful nonprofit groups for fear of offending them and ending up in court (p. 198). \uf0b7 In cases where there is a mismatch between the goals of a funder and those of a nonprofit organization, the nonprofit has a significant incentive to modify its own goals (even if nominally) rather than to turn down funding. (p. 200) \uf0b7 NGOs face tensions between accountability to funders and accountability to clients or communities, particularly in cases where funders presume to know the interests of potential beneficiaries or where the time demanded by upward reporting occurs at the expense of time spent in communities. (p."}, {"section_title": "200)", "text": "The examples above clearly show that NPO decisions are never made in a vacuum, and each is influenced significantly by the interests of stakeholders. For this reason, it is critical to consider stakeholders when considering IT alignment in NPOs because they could significantly influence the prioritization of IT alignment within an organizations' strategic planning process."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "It has been said that SAMM, the predominant existing IT alignment maturity model, can be used \"without difficulties\" to effectively assess IT alignment maturity in nonprofits (Luftman, personal correspondence, February 27, 2011). However the differences between nonprofit and business organizations described above, along with the structure and verbiage of the SAMM instrument that clearly describe business organizations puts this assertion in question, thus SAMM will be used as a starting point, but not a 'plug and play' solution to measuring IT alignment maturity in NPOs in the present study. One likeness that has been found between nonprofit and business organizations is the presence of definable strategy typologies. However, the existence of characteristic differences between the two begs the question of whether the interplay between strategy typology and alignment factors is the same in nonprofit organizations as it is in businesses, a question that is addressed in this investigation. cultures, resources, and stakeholders' interests that differ from those found in the business sector, they will also pursue and achieve outcomes that are vastly different from those achieved in the business sector (Ebrahim & Rangan, 2010;Kaplan & Norton, 2001). Outcomes, according to United Way (1996), \"are benefits for participants during or after their involvement with a program. Outcomes may relate to knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, behavior, condition, or status\" (p. xv). This definition is simplified by Wholey, Hatry and Newcomer to \"changes in clients or communities associated with program activities and outputs\" (2010, p. 28). Across the nonprofit sector, other terms are synonymous with outcomes: impacts, results, and effects, to name a few (United Way, 1996, p. 7). Outcomes should correlate directly with the mission of an organization, as well as the goals, objectives, strategies, and activities the organization pursues in order to achieve that mission. In other words, NPOs should endeavor to know whether they are making the difference they intend to make in individuals, families and communities. Identifying these outcomes, and more specifically, metrics to quantify the outcomes, has been the challenge to date in creating a tool for the nonprofit sector to assess IT alignment maturity and its influence on mission. With the incredible breadth of missions and contexts among NPOs, establishing a standardized means through which to measure outcomes across the sector is no small task. Much work has been done to establish appropriate outcome measures and performance measurement strategies for nonprofit organizations, and an examination of this work brings several issues to light. At the outset of this investigation, it seemed logical to incorporate outcomes into the proposed model of relationships between NPO strategy, IT/mission alignment and outcomes as a simple, straightforward, quantitative set of measures, as suggested by Sawhill and Williamson (2001). Their conceptual model for measuring nonprofit success considers a family of three outcome measures -impact, activity, and capacity --as indicators of nonprofit success. In their work with 31 nonprofit organizations, they endeavored to identify \"a nonprofit analog to 'profit' for a private sector enterprise\" (p. 378) and were unable to do so, which they had hypothesized. Instead, they arrived at three measures that were \"simple, easily collected, and easily communicated\u2026focusing on the highest-leverage strategies\u2026.and applicable across the organization at all levels so that managers could compare performance across all units.\" (2001, p. 375). In the present investigation, similarly straightforward indicators were sought because they would enable a proposed model to be applicable across a wide spectrum of organizations within the nonprofit sector. However, through examination of the existing knowledge base related to outcomes, it quickly became clear that these three simple measures do not provide an accurate picture of the series of critical, measurable process components involved in achieving outcomes. Thus, the following discussion describes what is known about nonprofit outcome measurement, and compiles the findings into a conceptual map of what it means for an NPO to achieve outcomes. This map will provide the theoretical basis for the outcomes component of the strategy, IT alignment maturity and outcomes model.\nThe Nonprofit Strategy, IT, Mission and Outcome (SIMO) Alignment Model provides insight to the query of whether strategy drives IT alignment, and whether IT alignment improves organizational outcomes. It informs the creation of an assessment tool with which NPOs can identify their strategic IT alignment profile, which will indicate specific organizational strategies and alignment strategies they can adopt to improve upon their efforts to align IT in ways that will help them better achieve outcomes and meet their missions. SIMO may suggest that specific organizational strategy types and IT alignment maturity profiles positively influence organizational performance. It proposes that specific IT alignment maturity profiles are characteristic of particular strategy types, and, in order to optimize performance, overall organizational strategy type must be matched with specific IT alignment profiles. This conceptualization of alignment has the potential to inform organizational planning, training, and technical assistance akin to a diagnosticprescriptive approach to teaching and learning in which gaps are identified and skills are taught that can fill the gaps (Manzo, Manzo & Albee, 2003). If an organization is struggling in achieving outcomes, SIMO and a corresponding assessment tool can identify the organization's strategy typology, assess levels of IT alignment criteria, and examine the levels of performance being achieved (or not achieved). With this information and online or personal technical assistance, the organization can learn and apply specific tactics to adjust strategy and increase alignment in ways that will improve outcomes. The first step toward using SIMO to add value to the nonprofit sector is, of course, to test it in the trenches. The process through which the SIMO survey was created, piloted, presented, and how the logic of the model was analyzed in the nonprofit sector is the focus of the next chapter, Methodology."}, {"section_title": "Nonprofit Outcomes are Social Values", "text": "Kanter and Summers assert that \"the centrality of social values over financial values \u2026complicates measurement [of outcomes] for nonprofit organizations\" (1994, p. 220). Moore (2000) takes this comparison one step further in asserting that for-profit businesses' long-term survival, economic performance and value creation are integrally connected, while in NPOs, mission-focused outcomes and financial sustainability can be achieved independent of one another. Both types of organizations perform, and their performance can be measured, but the way in which it is measured is strikingly different. In business, performance is measured primarily through financial metrics. A successful business' outcomes are reflected in its bottom line and a variety of other economic data. This data is, for the most part, tangible and finite. Mulgan (2010) provides a snapshot of a collection of metrics a for-profit company might use to demonstrate outcomes, in his exploration of the challenges of measuring social value compared to financial value: An airplane manufacturer \u2026 would use one set of metrics, mandated by laws and regulations, to explain to external stakeholders how it spends its money. The company would then use a second set of metrics to allocate resources in the building of airplanes. (It is a brave manager who would let investors see these internal accounts.) The company would then use entirely different kinds of measures to explain how its activities affect larger economic indicators such as gross domestic product. (2010, para. 6) NPOs cannot use dollars and cents as the primary means through which to measure performance because economic measures cannot always capture performance related to the social values that drive their missions. Lists of dozens of distinct social values, i.e. communication, compassion, education, equality, freedom, honesty, peace, security, and self-reliance exist (Hein, 1996;Posner, 2011), a majority of which can be classified within the historic values taxonomies of Kahle (1983), Rokeach (1973), and Maslow, Frager and Fadiman (1987 Many social values can be measured in terms of the extent to which NPOs maximize the values that are established within their missions (Costa, Ramus & Andreaus, 2011;. Maximizing social values is another way of saying that an NPO has met its mission. This assertion is supported by two decades of work by The United Way (1996), Chinman, Imm, and Wandersman (2004), The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (2004) and Wholey et al. (2010) in the field of nonprofit performance measurement. Knight (2002) and  suggest that social values can be classified, operationalized and measured using the acronym BACKS when NPO stakeholders identify and define specific behaviors, attitudes, conditions, knowledge, or status of their target population that demonstrate the social values that will serve as indicators of the targeted social value(s). BACKS serves as the most current iteration of a set of concise, transferrable outcome indicators. It convenes characteristics of several popular outcome frameworks, \"Getting to Outcomes\" (Chinman et al., 2004), \"Results-Based Accountability\" (Friedman, 2005); \"A Common Outcome Framework to Measure Nonprofit Performance\" (Urban Institute, 2006), and \"You Get What You Measure\" (Yellow Woods Associates, 2006). When identifying outcome indicators,  suggests that organizations describe their intended outcomes in terms that are \"meaningful, sustainable, bound in time, bound in number, narrowly focused and doable, measurable, and verifiable\" (p. 36). In order to determine whether an NPO has achieved mission-focused outcomes through its implementation of programs, services or interventions, organizational staff measure changes in the outcome indicators to determine whether the changes in participants are meaningful, add value or positive improvement, are sustained over time, take place over a defined period, and bound within a specified number or target with which the NPO can plan, track, and measure progress and success. If these criteria are met, then it is likely that the social values the NPO hopes to maximize will, in fact, be maximized or increased in the target population  missions. However, many such outcomes take years to achieve at a measurable level (Chinman, Imm, & Wandersman, 2004;United Way, 1996;W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004). This poses a challenge to NPOs, some of which depend upon inconsistent, piecemeal financial support with which to do their work, and others that operate on funding that is contingent upon demonstrating measurable outcomes. Many grants and contracts, for example, are awarded for just a few years or for one component of a comprehensive strategy to achieve long-term outcomes (Chinman, Imm, & Wandersman, 2004). W.K. Kellogg Foundation (2004) asserts that it can take anywhere from 1 to 6 years for an organization to demonstrate measurable changes in its target population, and between 7 to 10 years for an organization's initiatives to result in community-or systemwide impact. If the activities contributing to intended outcomes cannot be sustained because of a lack of resources, sometimes those changes never happen. Also, in some cases, long-term outcomes or impacts do not manifest until years after a program or activity has been completed, such as a reduction in youth recidivism or increase in gainful employment across an entire community (Poister, 2010;Shaping Outcomes, 2006;Taylor-Powell & Henert, 2008;W.K. Kellogg, 2004). Additionally, when NPOs endeavor to measure outcomes, often the assumption is made that an activity, program, or intervention is the direct cause of an outcome, while in reality most changes in individuals and communities are a result of the confluence of the activity with extraneous factors at the individual, family, and community level (United Way, 1996), sometimes rendering the outcome \"unevaluatable\" in a concise, quantitative sense (Connell, Kubisch, Schorr & Weiss, 1995). Generally, as measured outcomes become chronologically more distant from activities, these uncontrollable, external factors exert a greater level of influence on the target population (United Way, 1996). Therefore measuring outcomes in isolation may cause organizations assessing their programs' impacts, and the organizations' stakeholders, to come up empty handed, or misled by outcome data. Further, planning and implementation of the events that lead to outcome achievement directly affect the extent to which outcomes are achieved. Relationships established with stakeholders, resources available to address the social need, activities and strategies chosen with which to engage the target population, the scope and depth of service delivery, and the environment in which efforts are put forth all impact whether an NPO achieves outcomes and maximizes the social values upon which its mission is based. This process, of getting to outcomes, is as important to understand and measure as the outcomes themselves, because each component of the process provides insight into the factors that influence outcome achievement (Chinman, et al., 2004;Connell et al., 1995). For these reasons, it is critical to consider outcomes not in a vacuum, but as the final destination in a continuum of the investments NPOs make to create positive change in the lives of individuals, families and communities. United Way (1996) warns about putting full stock in outcomes as the sole measure of mission-focused work: Although outcome findings may show that program participants are not experiencing the intended benefits, they do not show where the problem lies or what is needed to fix it. To pinpoint and correct problems, program managers need the kind of data on program inputs, processes, and outputs they probably have been collecting for some time. Thus, outcome measurement is an addition to existing data collection efforts, not an alternative. (United Way, 1996) This guidance is echoed by Chinman et al. (2004) Way (1996). At present, the knowledge base is relatively consistent in identifying the format and specific elements of a logic model (McLaughlin & Jordan, 1999Milstein & Chapel, 2012;Taylor-Powell & Henert, 2008;United Way, 1996;Wholey, 1979;Wholey et al., 2010;W.K. Kellogg, 2004). Figure 6 below represents these common elements (McLaughlin & Jordan, 2010, p. 57). When an organization creates a logic model, it is describing the process it will follow to address a problem by achieving outcomes related to that problem, outcomes which, in most cases, are related to its mission and goals. As suggested earlier, each of the elements in the logic model is, or should be, identified and defined by the organization's stakeholders. Describing a measurable indicator of each element, a way to quantify its level, quantity, or extent of change, is part of the definition process. Logic models can be created at any time during a program or organization's life cycle. Often, a logic model is conceptualized as part of the planning process, then modified during implementation so that when program managers engage in measuring the indicators of each element during implementation (serving as a vehicle for formative evaluation -done for process improvement) and after implementation (for summative evaluation -done for evaluation of program effectiveness and assessment of outcomes, as well as ongoing process improvement) the program and the logic model will mirror each other. In some cases, a logic model is created after a program is implemented, either by organizational staff or an external evaluator, at which time the logic model serves as the framework for evaluating the effectiveness of the program in achieving outcomes (Wholey et al., 2010). In all cases, it is critical that stakeholders clearly identify each of the elements, define indicators, and establish a strategy for collecting data using the indicators. That having been said, often nonprofit organizations stop their performance measurement at outputs -they measure products and services created and report them to funders, boards, and other stakeholders. Often these measurements incorporate performance assessment data related to cost effectiveness, efficiency, quantity, service quality, and customer satisfaction (LeRoux & Wright, 2010 p. 574;Wholey et al., 2010, p. 102-103). Penna warns that this approach to measuring nonprofit performance reflects a \"funder mentality\" in which money is put toward a demonstrated need or problem with the expectation that good will come of it, with little consideration of the return on investment in terms of how the investment impacted the problem (2011, p. 29-30). Most data NPOs collect tends to focus on outputs because the data is immediately available and easy to collect (Carman & Fredricks, 2008;LeRoux & Wright 2010;Morley, Vinson & Hatry, 2001;W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004). Costa, et al. (2011) suggest through their findings that when upward accountability is the focus of outcome data collection and reporting, rather than maximizing social value, it is typical for NPOs to choose shortterm, easily-measurable projects rather than long-term initiatives that resulted in longerterm social impact, thus limiting the outcomes, or sustained changes that could potentially result from interventions. For that reason Chinman et al (2004), Costa et al. (2011) and Penna (2011) recommend a paradigm shift through which NPOs monitor process measures of the program elements described above to assess \"progress, problems, and lessons learned\" (Chinman, et al., 2004, p. 101) Way, 1996;W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 2004, p 2). This level of outcome can be characterized as having a learning focus, in which program activities influence participants to gain knowledge and skills, increase awareness, or change their attitude about a particular social value (Knight, 2002;Shaping Outcomes, 2006;Taylor-Powell & Henert, 2008;Urban Institute, 2006 (Knight, 2002;Shaping Outcomes, 2006;Taylor-Powell & Henert, 2008;Urban Institute, 2006 Capacity considers resources and inputs, such as \"human, financial, organizational, and community resources a program has available to direct toward doing the work\" (W.K. Kellogg, 2004, p. 2;Wholey et al., 2010); \"staff, volunteers, facilities, equipment, curricula and money\" (United Way, 1996, p. 17). Considering how all of these unique areas might be measured, it is evident that the simplicity I seek in establishing metrics for the present model can quickly be quashed if I use individual organizations' levels of resources or inputs as an indicator, because each of these things must be measured independently, and organizations I wish to compare will be diverse in their necessary levels of sufficiency to do their work. For example, a small grassroots arts-focused NPO may only need two employees in order to accomplish its work, whereas a statewide advocacy NPO may need 100. If they both had two employees, one would have sufficient resources, while the other would be unable to do its work at all, so using resources as a metric would not be conducive to comparison. Therefore, the measure of \"capacity\" is used in the current logic model instead of \"resources\" or \"inputs\" because for each of these areas, an organization can determine whether it has sufficient capacity, rather than assessing the quantity of each resource, which would have no quantitative, comparative meaning in the current study. Three new elements have been described as necessary considerations for NPOs as they work to achieve mission-focused outcomes: context, capacity, and stakeholder engagement. For the purpose of this investigation, the existing logic model structure is modified to incorporate these elements, as illustrated in Figure 6 below. The interface between the logic model as the framework for measuring outcomes, and additional elements of the Strategy/IT alignment maturity/outcomes will be detailed in Chapter 4. "}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Logic Models", "text": "The process of creating and using logic models to design and implement programs sounds great in theory. NPOs that use this best practice, either because they are required to do so by funders or choose to do so voluntarily tend to be more successful in achieving consensus, building collaborative relationships, identifying underlying assumptions and identifying and addressing flaws in logic that could affect their effectiveness, and communicating with internal and external constituencies (Kaplan & Garrett, 2005), all of which can help them succeed in getting to outcomes. Hendricks, Plantz and Pritchard (2008) found in their survey of 215 United Ways that 83% of the 71 respondents and their grantees used logic modeling or similar outcome measurement strategies, and the process helped them maintain accountability to donors, improve marketing and fundraising, and increase community visibility and positive image. The focus of evaluation for United Ways has become one of program improvement, more so than required accountability reporting to external stakeholders, which benefits both the NPOs and the stakeholders. Agencies using logic modeling can clearly design and observe their processes of achieving (or not achieving) outcomes and make process improvements along the way. Finally, because the logic model approach suggests that changes in target populations take place over years, it takes pressure off agencies to produce immediate output data and encourages the development of strategies that will produce long-term change. However, not all NPOs use logic models. In fact, less than half of NPOs targeted by investigations of logic model use reported using them (Carman, 2009) or demonstrated a clear understanding of how to create and use a logic model for program planning and evaluation (Kaplan & Garrett, 2005). This disparity in understanding and use of such a widely-known best practice has multiple causes: lack of training and technical assistance to NPOs in how to create and use logic models, lack of staff time to add creating and monitoring logic models to already full plates, lack of incentive or accountability to create and use the tool as a condition of continued funding, and in some cases fear that creating a logic model will expose assumptions or gaps that would call a funded program or strategy into question (Hendricks et al., 2008;Kaplan & Garrett, 2005;Carman, 2009). In my opinion and fifteen years of experience working with NPOs, the most influential reasons organizations do not use logic models are because they do not see the benefits in doing so, or they do not have incentive to do so. Interestingly, all of the organizations I have worked with (n=37) gather data and use it to measure performance and report to funders, as do most NPOs (Carman, 2009 Can it still answer those questions? The survey items prepared for this investigation that focus on \"getting to outcomes\" answer these last two questions, as the items probe respondents to consider their current organizational practices using the conceptual structure of a logic model as the lens through which they respond to each question. It is assumed that with each of the elements clearly defined and examples provided, all organizations surveyed can identify their stakeholders and characterize stakeholder engagement processes, they can estimate their organizational capacity, and they can identify the activities they engage in, measure their outputs, and identify outcomes. Then, as part of the debrief/reporting process, this lens will be explained to them in the IT Alignment technical manual they receive, providing an opportunity for them to learn more about the logic modeling practice and how it might assist them in improving the extent to which they get to outcomes and the extent to which technology can help them do so. This is a preview of the process participants engaged in during this study, which is described in detail in  Hall (2008, p. 155) as a way to resolve the dissonance between the sectors while harnessing the power of the strategies. In the present study, four existing theoretical models inform the creation of a conceptual framework that has the potential to deepen understanding about strategic IT alignment in the nonprofit sector. The Nonprofit Strategy, IT, Mission and Outcome (SIMO) Alignment Model, introduced below in Figure 8, posits that while NPOs are different from businesses in terms of their goals and outcomes, the strategy types they use to achieve their social missions and some of the ways they align technology with their mission may be similar. Accordingly, SIMO is a model of three constructs -strategy typology, IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance --that may be able to describe what those constructs look like in the nonprofit sector, and whether there are relationships between them. Croteau and Bergeron's (2001) information technology trilogy,  business strategy typologies, and Luftman's (2000) strategic alignment maturity model address these constructs as they manifest in the business sector, so those models have been adapted to fit the character of nonprofit organizations and combined with an updated iteration of McLaughlin and Jordan's (2010) logic model, which describes how nonprofit organizations achieve outcomes, to comprise the SIMO model. This chapter will explain how the constructs fit together, how they are measured, and why they are important to the nonprofit sector.  "}, {"section_title": "Overview of the SIMO Model", "text": "The Information Technology Trilogy model established by Croteau and Bergeron (2001), shown again below in Figure 8, provides a structure that addresses three synergistic aspects of IT alignment that have been suggested as critical elements that explain, predict, and inform IT alignment: strategy typology, technology deployment, and performance outcomes. The Information Technology Trilogy Model answers the question, \"Given a type of business strategy, what profile of technological deployment best helps firms enhance their performance?\" (Croteau & Bergeron, 2001, p. 81). This question is important for any organization that uses technology to answer, regardless of its sector, because enhancing performance is a universal organizational goal. The model tested three hypotheses through the use of mailed, paired questionnaires completed by 243 companies (out of 1949 surveyed): H1) The more specific the type of business strategy adopted by an organization, the better the organizational performance (a negative link is expected for the reactor type) H2) There is a profile of technological deployment specific to each type of business strategy. H3) For each type of business strategy, the more specific the profile of technological deployment, the better the organizational performance (2001, p. 82-83 The explanatory potential of this model is valuable because it describes the performance results of \"how organizations really deploy their IT with respect to their business strategy\" (Croteau & Bergeron, 2001, p. 78). I propose two adaptations to this model in order to render it appropriate for a) use within the nonprofit context and b) consideration of IT alignment maturity, rather than just deployment of technology. Second, \"technological deployment,\" a construct operationally defined by Croteau and Bergeron (2001) by combining two previously-developed measures with a measure designed by the author, \"corresponds to the way companies plan and manage information technology to benefit from its potential and effectiveness\" (p. 83). This conceptual model bears similarity of purpose with SAMM (Luftman, 2011), but does not possess the same level of specificity, empirical support, validity testing, or potential to inform future strategies as SAMM. \"IT Alignment Maturity\" factors (adaptations described below) replace technological deployment scales as independent variables of interest in the model.  Business Strategy Typology component of the model remains the same independent variable with the exception of the label, which is changed to \"Strategy Typology\" because it is being used outside of the business context. In the SIMO model, it is first necessary to consider the specific factors that influence IT alignment maturity, 6 of which are suggested by Luftman (2000) and validated by Sledgianowski (2004) as criteria necessary in the business sector for alignment maturity, and the one new factor, culture, suggested by the literature as being unique to the nonprofit sector. The model tested whether all of the 6 previously-identified factors and new factor emerged. The factors, latent variables determined through factor analysis of survey items in which respondents indicate the levels of certain conditions in their organizations, together create an overall IT alignment maturity score (RQ1) that interacts with the other major components of the model. The links between the model components can be assessed through the notion of fit. Venkatraman (1989) suggests that fit can be a mediator, in the present model, for example, between independent variables, strategy typology and IT alignment, and a dependent variable, organizational performance. For example, IT alignment maturity is the independent variable that influences the mediating variable strategy typology RQ2which then influences the dependent variable organizational performance (RQ4). The converse is explained by the model, also: strategy typology is the independent variable that influences the mediating variable IT alignment maturity (RQ2), which influences the dependent variable organizational performance (RQ4). This design, of mediating variables, illuminates two possible ways in which IT influences strategy, either by impacting strategy or by being influenced by strategy, as suggested by Vitale, Ives and Beath (1986) and Bergeron, Buteau and Raymond (1991), the two-way arrow between IT alignment maturity and strategy typology illustrates the relationship. Strategy typology also acts as a variable mediating the relationship between IT alignment maturity and organizational performance (RQ5). It is important to break down each of these components of the model to understand the ways in which they influence these relationships."}, {"section_title": "Strategy Typology", "text": "The diversity in organizational strategy types described in the literature review and represented in the SIMO model above supports Chan's (2002) assertion that there is no \"one size fits all\" approach to increasing IT alignment maturity, a claim that followed Chan and Huff's (1992) initial supposition that IT alignment is related to organizations' business strategy. These conclusions bracket Miles and Snow's assertion that \"in a particular industry or environment, there is more than one way to prosper\" (2003, p. ix), In fact, they suggest that some organizations may instinctively align, while others may never achieve alignment if they continue to do things the way they've always done them. Thus, the suggestion that all organizations travel the same path through five levels of IT alignment as reflected by the SAMM assessment (Luftman, 2011) begs additional consideration. Tests of Miles and Snow's model contend that some business strategy types achieve alignment more readily than others, and alignment tends to look different depending on an organization's strategy type, a concept that is tested by the new model, the process of which is also described in the Methodology chapter.  \nAs described in the conceptual model section above, strategy typology is an independent variable that has been known to influence both IT alignment and organizational performance. This variable indicates whether an organization approaches its work primarily with Prospector, Defender, Analyzer, or Reactor strategies. Strategy typology has historically been measured using a self-typing paragraph approach. Shortell and Zajac (1990) created a self-typing paragraph approach to identify healthcare organizations' business strategy type to fulfill the need to establish reliability and validity of the typology. Using a test-retest approach, they found that 19 CEOs identified their organizations as the same typology in 71% of cases and established moderate reliability for the strategic orientation measures (p. 823). The authors assert that although reliability and validity were established at the time of publication, they caution that in a rapidlychanging sector such as healthcare, ongoing monitoring of these measures is necessary. Further, they suggest that while strategy typology was examined in depth, the technical domain of strategy needs to be investigated (p. 829). James and Hatten (1995) used a similar approach to measure business strategy typologies, described in one of 409 reports and reflections on the use of the self-typing paragraph approach (Google Scholar, 2011). With their use of a set of traditional selftyping paragraphs to identify perceived business strategy archetypes, which departs from Shortell and Zajac's (1990) use of both perceived and archival measures to identify business typologies, they achieved their goal of reinforcing the validity and applicability of using the self-typing paragraph approach across multiple sectors in their study of 399 organizations in the banking industry (James & Hatten, 1995, p. 163). The findings supported Shortell and Zajac's (1990) assertion that the self-typing paragraph has moderate convergent validity and it transfers \"quite well\" (James & Hatten, 1995, p. 167) to the banking sector. This support suggests that the self-typing paragraph measure has the potential to transfer quite well to the nonprofit sector, also. Accordingly, the \"strategy type\" variable within the present model was measured by asking respondents to choose the paragraph that best described the type of strategy with which their organization approaches day-to-day processes and long-term work. As an existing characteristic of organizations, this was considered an independent variable. The language of James and Hatten's unlabeled paragraphs (1995, p. 168) was modified for the purposes of this study to suit a wider audience than the business sector while maintaining the characteristic descriptions of each archetype and can be found below, as well as in the SIMO questionnaire in Appendix C. The language of James and Hatten's paragraphs (1995, p. 168) is modified using context, structure, and strategy elements that more closely match a nonprofit audience, using descriptions created by  that maintain the characteristic descriptions of each archetype. The exact paragraphs used by Brown and Iverson are not replicated in this investigation because when they interviewed nine executives whose organizations exemplified each typology, they found that the executives felt the descriptions did not quite fit the typologies and needed to be further modified. For example, executives of organizations classified as Prospectors took exception to a phrase in the self-typing paragraph, \"Given its innovation orientation, this organization does not try to maintain superiority in all the areas it serves\" (p. 398), and insisted that their innovation orientation did not preclude them from pursuing excellence (p. 389), therefore that phrase is not used in the paragraphs included in the SIMO questionnaire. Likewise, a majority of Defender organizations refuted the description, \"The organization is not at the forefront of service innovations\" (p. 398), and several described a different kind of innovation, one that focuses on finding new approaches to increasing efficiency and effectiveness of existing programs, rather than seeking out opportunities to create new ones. With these modifications, along with a shift to a personal voice (\"we\", \"our organization\"), rather than a third-person to match the format of other survey items, the self-typing paragraphs are shown below: Defender: We try to maintain a secure niche in our community. We offer a limited range of programs and services and we try to protect our clients/population from other organizations that try to get them to engage. We try to protect our domain by offering high quality and superior service. We may not be at the forefront of developments in the compared to other organizations like us; we concentrate instead on doing the best job possible with the programs and services we do offer. When we innovate, we do so to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our current services."}, {"section_title": "IT/Mission Alignment Maturity", "text": "Luftman's Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM) (2000,2003,2011) describes the factors that enable and inhibit IT alignment in terms of six criteria that are essential, according to the model, to mature IT alignment. These criteria; communications, competency/value measurements, governance, partnership, IT scope and architecture, and skills; are defined in the SAMM model through 39 independent variables that are descriptively scaled to five distinct levels that represent stages of IT alignment maturity, as shown in Table 1 in Chapter 2. The criteria have been incorporated into a validated assessment tool (Luftman, 2003;Sledgianowski, Luftman, & Reilly, 2006) that measures organizations' level of IT alignment maturity. The results of the assessment can be used by organizations to identify gaps in alignment and initiate discussions among organization managers and IT managers that will close those gaps. As explained above, while SAMM in its present form has the ability to quantify levels of factors organized into six criteria groups, it fails to consider several organizational factors that are unique to the nonprofit sector. The diversity of nonfinancial performance outcomes, organizational structure aspects, particularly IT staffing and employment of volunteers, resource acquisition, and external stakeholders are not mentioned in SAMM. Further, consideration of organizational culture is very general in nature and is combined with factors in the \"skills\" criteria, which does not accurately portray that organizational culture is a distinct, significant aspect of organizations that should be given more specific consideration. The use and integration of technology in an organization is related to innovation (Luftman, 2003), locus of power (Franklin, 2011), trust between individuals, departments and organizations (Gates, 2003), learning orientation (Calantone, Cavusgil & Zhao, 2002), and change readiness (Merkel, Farooq, Xiao, Ganoe, Rosson & Carroll, 2007), all of which are aspects of an organization's culture. Accordingly, the proposed model incorporates the above factors except culture into existing criteria by adapting and adding scaled variables, and culture is given specific attention through the creation of an additional criterion and identification of corresponding factors. The original SAMM criteria are shown in Figure 11 below, and adaptation of the criteria is shown in Figure 12 as well as described in the Methodology chapter.  outcomes. Specific metrics through which these dependent variables will be measured are described below.\nOverall IT alignment maturity is a dependent variable historically influenced by strategy type, and an independent variable that can influence outcomes. The individual factors identified in the literature as having influence on IT alignment maturity are listed as independent variables in Appendix A, Variables of Interest in the Present Study, as well as described in the individual bullet points below. The variables were measured in terms of an organization's perceived maturity level in each factor using a 1 to 5 scale, on which descriptions of activities or organizational behaviors representing each level correspond with each number, one being the lowest level, and five being the highest level of maturity. Overall IT alignment maturity was quantified in terms of the six criteria and corresponding factors that describe the criteria established by Luftman (2000), Sledgianowski (2004), and validated by  which were discussed at length in Chapter 2, and one additional criterion, culture, established through the present literature review. These seven criteria are illustrated in Figure 12 on page 98. The constructs measured by the seven criteria were operationalized for the purposes of this study as follows, terminology was adjusted to accommodate the structures and functions of NPOs, and some variables were aligned with the new culture criteria. Communication Effectiveness. Effective exchange of ideas and knowledge across all levels and functions of the organization (Luftman, 2003, p. 9). Modeled after SAMM, Technology Governance Effectiveness. The processes through which decisionmaking, authority for resources, risk, and responsibility for technology is shared among organizational managers, technology managers and stakeholders (Luftman, 2003, p. 12). and the level of involvement of internal and external stakeholders (separate variables) in technology decision-making. Of those variables, the last two, addressing involvement of internal and external stakeholders, were added to the original SAMM variables, as stakeholders beyond nonprofit board and staff often are instrumental in governance and decision-making (Enright & Bourns, 2010). Partnership and Collaboration. The extent and character of the relationships that exist among the organizational leaders, its technology managers and stakeholders relative to enabling and driving technology change (Luftman, 2003, p. 12). The variables examined included perceptions of technology investments, the role of technology in organizational strategic planning, the extent to which technology staff and organizational staff share risks and rewards of technology-based initiatives, the extent of formal processes that focus on enhancing partnership relationships between technology and other organizational staff, the status of sponsors and/or champions of technology initiatives, and the organization's level of collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. The last factor, collaboration with stakeholders, was added to variables that were included in SAMM, again due to the extensive involvement of stakeholders in nonprofit operations (Enright & Bourns, 2010;Freeman, 1984). Technology Infrastructure Scope and Architecture. The organization's inventory and management of internal and external technology networks, hardware, software, and applications (Luftman, 2003, p. 12). The variables examined included the scope of technology systems; creation, use and compliance with technology standards and policies, the scope of architectural integration, or shared relationships between technology system elements; the level of an organization's technology infrastructure flexibility relative to organizational and technology changes; the number of different types of internal and external technology tools and systems used by the organization. The last two variables, the number of tools used by an organization, were added in order to ascertain the extent to which organizations tend to rely on internal versus external tools relative to their level of involvement of stakeholders, which is a performance variable described below. Human Resources and Skills. Human capital considerations related to technology, including hiring, engaging, and building capacity of staff and volunteers (Luftman, 2003, p. 12). Variables examined included the extent to which organizational leadership and staff have tacit knowledge about technology, in other words, they understand how technology works; the extent to which leadership and staff have explicit knowledge about technology, experience in using technology to manage projects and solve problems; the extent to which employees have opportunities to build skills in their primary role; the extent to which employees have opportunities to build skills and support services outside their primary role, the extent to which career crossover opportunities exist, the level of organizations' ability to attract and retain the best qualified technical professionals, and the organization's ability to attract and retain technologically competent volunteers. In this criterion, several variables were added to those contained in SAMM. The existence of tacit and explicit knowledge is described by Kearns and Lederer (2003) and Bassellier et al. (2003) as critical to strategic IT alignment, following extensive assertions during the previous decade led by (Kogut & Zander, 1992) and Zack (1999) that in order for organizations to remain competitive, they must be able to translate technology knowledge from the personal and abstract in order for it to be practical and transferrable (Zack, 1999), in other words, the \"who knows what\" and the \"know-how\" (Kogut & Zander, 1992, p. 383)  Organizational Culture. The unique pattern of shared values, priorities, assumptions, processes and behaviors that contribute to the social, interpersonal, and strategic environment and achievement of common goals of the organization (Christensen, 2012, pp. 160-61;Luftman, 2003, p. 12;Tharp, 2009). This criterion did not exist in SAMM, but several of the variables in SAMM were directly related to the value-and priority-driven behaviors demonstrated in organizations, and several other variables related specifically to culture were identified in the literature that could be related to strategy, IT alignment and performance. Accordingly, variables measuring innovation and the entrepreneurial environment of organizations, the locus of power in technology decision-making, the character of interpersonal climate, the level of perceived trust and value between technology staff and the rest of the organization, level of readiness for change, level of disruption caused by organization and technology changes, and ability of staff to respond to technology changes were moved to this new section from Human Resources/Skills, Governance and Scope and Infrastructure criteria. Inclusion of a new variable related to external stakeholders followed Enright and Bourns (2010) and Freeman's (1984) descriptions of their influence across organizations, inclusion of a variable related to learning orientation was informed by Calantone et al.'s (2002) assertion that innovation and competitive advantage require a strong learning orientation. A new variable was also included that measured organizational staff ability to respond to technology change addresses organizations' capacity and readiness for change (Anderson and Anderson, 2010), which may be a determinant of whether they can and will, in fact, adopt and align technology with mission. Organizations' alignment maturity level in each of the seven criteria was determined by aggregating ratings of each factor in that criteria area, thus alignment maturity was a dependent variable. "}, {"section_title": "RQ1: What factors influence nonprofit organizations' level of IT alignment maturity?", "text": "Many studies have identified and reinforced six specific factors that influence business organizations' level of IT alignment maturity. This study investigates whether the same factors, with one additional factor supported by the literature, influence the maturity of nonprofit organizations' alignment of IT with their mission. RQ2: Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their level of IT alignment maturity? Again, the presence of relationship between business organizations' overall strategy typology, as characterized by , and their level of IT alignment maturity has been well-documented in the literature. With the adaptation of existing IT alignment scales to accommodate the different character of NPOs, this study investigates whether similar relationships exist in the nonprofit sector. "}, {"section_title": "Variables of Interest", "text": "Four categories of variables were measured through this study: demographics, strategy typology, IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance. Variables that were measured as characteristics or perceptions of organizations' demographics, strategy typologies and IT alignment factors as evidenced by organizational behaviors were considered independent variables, and those that measured performance and aggregated IT alignment (combination of all factor ratings) were considered dependent variables. A list of all variables is provided in Appendix A: Variables of Interest in the Present Study."}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "Several organizational and respondent demographics were assessed relative to their relationship with strategy typology, NPO IT alignment maturity, and organizational performance. Organization size, as determined by annual budget (Carman & Fredericks, 2008;Salamon, 1995); geographic location as indicated by USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (USDA, 2009) and target population as determined by mission statement and reported population served were independent variables. Mission and target population were included as variables unique to the nonprofit sector relative to their focus on social value (Auerswald, 2009)  education; environment and animals; health; human services; international, foreign affairs; public, societal benefit, religion; mutual/membership benefit; and unknown. The relationship between strategy, alignment, performance, and the level of the independent variable of technology staffing was also examined, as directed by recommendations from pilot participants (pilot process described below) and findings from the NTEN Staffing surveys. This variable expressed the extent to which an organization dedicated human resources toward planning and managing technology, as it has been suggested that many nonprofit organizations do not have dedicated technology staff, and technology leaders have a more extensively-staffed IT function than those organizations that lag behind (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010;Hoehling, 2012a). Respondent level of education, tenure, and expressed support of IT/mission alignment were also examined to see whether they had any relationship within the model, as they were in Luftman's (2003) original Strategic Alignment Maturity Model and SAMM assessment survey (Luftman, 2011). Budget size, as indicated by total annual organizational budget, a metric suggested by Carman (2009) and Salamon (1995) as a measure of nonprofit organization size, was maintained in the and is also a measure in SAMM. Discrepant findings relative to rurality discussed previously illuminated the need to investigate whether the nonprofits participating in this study experience geographic barriers to technology use and consequent alignment, thus level of rurality was also identified as an independent variable indicated by an organization's county, which is linked to a specific RUCC code by the USDA 2009 Remaining variables consisted of organizations' level of individual factors within three categories: strategy type, alignment maturity, or organizational performance as defined by the SIMO model."}, {"section_title": "Prospector:", "text": "We try to meet a broad range of needs in our community, and we offer new services when new needs emerge. We value innovation, want to be 'first in' with new programs and services even if not all of these efforts have proven to be highly effective in achieving our mission. We try to respond rapidly to early signals concerning areas of opportunity, like grants and other resources, and these responses have often led us to engage in new activities and strategies. Analyzer: We work to provide a stable, limited collection of programs and services, while at the same time we try to move out quickly to follow a carefully selected set of promising, evidence-based new strategies to reach and serve our population. We are seldom 'first in' with new programs or services, but by carefully monitoring the actions of other organizations with missions similar to ours, we try to be 'second in' with a more efficient or effective program or service. Reactor: We don't have a consistent focus or service niche. When other organizations provide similar services in the same area, we prefer to conserve resources and eliminate offerings, rather than attempt to defend our service area. Although we try to avoid risks associated with new programs or services, occasionally we develop new offerings to keep up with other providers. We are usually forced to respond to environmental pressures, like funding flow and irregular stakeholder support, rather than elaborating and implementing a single strategic thrust."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Performance", "text": "In order to analyze the relationships between strategy, information technology and mission alignment, and outcomes, it was necessary to determine two primary things about organizational performance: first, the extent to which organizations engage in the distinct actions that will lead to outcomes as depicted by the logic model in Chapter 3 and second, whether respondents believe their use of technology influences those actions. For ease of understanding the measurement strategy, the logic model is provided again in Figure 13 below: The questionnaire measured these variables through two scaled items related to each element in the logic model. A caveat is necessary at this point: because the consideration of nonprofit organizational performance in a conceptual model of these relationships has not previously been endeavored, the methodology for testing this component of the model is purely experimental and does not incorporate existing metrics. However, the metrics discussed below have been suggested as those that can be used to assess performance in the nonprofit sector (Austin & Claassen, 2008;Martin & Ketner, 2009;Poister, 2010;Sowa, Selden & Sandfort, 2004), particularly relative to technology use (Kanter & Payne, 2012). Thus the strategy below is a confluence of what is known about effective nonprofit performance metrics, NPO technology use and the process of getting to outcomes, resulting in a measurement strategy designed specifically to address this existing gap. was measured through a ordinal scaled response spanning from not engaging at all, e.g. \"We do not implement any activities that are related to our mission\" to a high level of that action, e.g. \"We implement many mission-related activities over the course of a year, we surpass our goals, and we are planning to expand the number and/or scope of our activities\". In addition, respondents could report that they do not measure or monitor each element. This scale was created with the consideration that a ratio scale, such as the number of activities or outputs, is not consistent in terms of range across all NPOs. One annual activity might comprise the annual scope of work of a small NPO, whereas a large NPO might implement dozens of programs.) Thus, using a ratio scale would prevent comparison across respondent organizations, a concern raised by Sawhill and Williamson (2001, p. 375). In the case of stakeholder engagement, a logic model element that spans both the program/organization structure and the outcomes structure, the program/organizational structure scale was used because it was a more appropriate fit than the interval scale. Stakeholder engagement is defined in Chapter 3 as an organization's direct actions to enlist and sustain the involvement of influential and/or likely influenced stakeholders in strategic planning, implementation, and measurement of the organization's mission, goals, capacity, activities, outputs and outcomes. An organization can more readily report the extent to which it engages stakeholders in terms ranging from \"not at all\" to engaging an extensive scope of both internal and external stakeholders on an ongoing basis, than it can report the percentage of stakeholders it actually engages relative to the number of potential stakeholders it could engage (often an unknown), which is how the interval scale would have to be used. This set of variables, which will be hereby referred to as 'extent' variables, provided information about organizations' process of getting to outcomes, which, in and of itself, can help determine whether achievement of outcomes (or lack thereof) is, in fact, influenced by technology or possibly a flawed logic model (Kaplan & Garrett, 2005) and/or corresponding implementation process. In other words, an organization can use all the technology in the world, but if it isn't strategically engaging stakeholders, building capacity, implementing activities or producing outputs, it is unlikely that it will achieve any measurable outcomes. The second set of organizational performance variables relate to 'technology influence', and these variables assessed whether technology tools are being incorporated into each of the elements of the logic model and, if so, the extent to which respondents believe technology has influenced the performance of each element. In measuring technology's influence on organizational structure elements, these variables were measured in terms of the perceived influence of technology on performance, specifically in terms of efficiency, cost effectiveness, quantity, quality, and satisfaction (Poister, 2010;Sowa et al., 2004). Organizational structure elements (capacity, activities and outputs) and the structure-spanning element stakeholder engagement were measured with a balanced scale that spans from \"Reduced a great deal\" to \"Helped a great deal\", an The answers to these questions are justified by the literature, thus providing another level of confidence for the conceptual model. By implementing this performance measurement component of the SIMO model, it became possible to assess the extent to which NPOs measure and monitor their process of getting to outcomes, as well as surmise the influence of technology on their organizational performance."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER V METHODOLOGY Introduction", "text": "Previous chapters presented a gap in the nonprofit knowledge base, the absence of a means to identify and measure relationships between NPO strategy typologies, IT alignment maturity, and organizational performance, and proposed a theoretical model, SIMO, to close this gap. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the methodology used to test the SIMO model in the nonprofit sector. It details the research design, population, sampling strategy, measurement instrument, data collection procedures, methods for statistical analysis and, finally, outcomes of data collection."}, {"section_title": "Research Design", "text": "A cross-sectional, correlational survey design was used in this investigation. Cross-sectional designs, according to Creswell (2005), \"examine current attitudes, beliefs, opinions or practices\" (p. 356). Correlational design, specifically explanatory correlational research is used to \"explain the association between or among variables\" (p. 326). Accordingly, this study used a survey questionnaire to gather data from nonprofit organizations that have received grants from Community Foundations serving Indiana counties. The items examined the associations or relationships among variables that measure nonprofit organizations' strategy typology, IT alignment, and organizational performance, variables described in the SIMO model. Data generated from the questionnaire was analyzed and used to validate the model with the intent to generalize findings to \"all Indiana Community Foundation grantees\". The survey approach has been implemented in a wide variety of investigations of IT alignment and strategy typology (Bassellier & Benbasat, 2004;Bassellier et al., 2003;Chan & Huff, 1992;Chan et al., 2006;Croteau & Bergeron, 2001;Evers, 2010;Flores, et al., 2008;Gutierrez et al., 2009;Kearns & Lederer, 2003;Kearns & Sabherwal, 2007;Luftman, 2000Luftman, , 2011Sabherwal & Chan, 2001;Tallon & Kraemer, 2003). Survey data provided the means by which to explore whether there is a relationship between organizations' strategy typology, their alignment of technology with their mission, and their performance. The next section describes the process through which the model was tested in authentic settings."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The methodology employed in this investigation began with the development of the survey instrument and consideration of HSIRB protocol, followed by a pilot test of the instrument to establish content validity and assess functionality of the instrument. The pilot test informed modifications to the survey, which was then prepared in final form for implementation. The survey sample was identified using stratified random sampling, gatekeepers were approached for assistance in recruitment, participants were recruited, the survey was deployed, and data was collected. Throughout the investigation, Dillman, Smyth and Christian's (2009) Tailored Design Method guided the design and implementation of the survey. This method instructs investigators to consider social exchange theory, primarily matching methodology to the motivations of potential respondents, as the basis for decisions regarding survey mode, layout, content, sampling, contacts, incentives and technology. Specific strategies were used to build rapport with respondents, make the survey completion process as easy as possible, minimize survey error and increase response rate. Care was taken to make the survey visually appealing, flow logically, and easy to understand through the use of textual and spatial cues. This brief overview of the process might lead one to surmise that implementation of the methodology was seamless, went according to plan and confirmed best practices. As will be described herein, that was not exactly the case. Many lessons were learned and great insight about the character of nonprofit relationships was gained, along with a data set that was adequate for analysis and hypothesis testing."}, {"section_title": "Survey Instrument", "text": "The Nonprofit IT Alignment Maturity 87-item questionnaire consists of five sections: an organizational demographics section (8 items), a strategy typology section (1 self-typing paragraph item), an IT/mission alignment maturity factor self-rating section modeled after the SAMM questionnaire (56 items) (Luftman, 2011), an organizational performance section (14 items), and an individual demographics section (6 items). The SAMM questionnaire was used as a template for the present survey and, in several instances; the same or similar questions were used to gather similar information from NPO respondents that had been gathered from business-sector respondents using SAMM. The questionnaire was created using Survey Monkey and made available either electronically to participants using a link unique to each individual participant, or in paper form sent via U.S. Mail. The questionnaire is located in Appendix C. The organizational description section, a collection of fill-in, open-ended and multiple choice items, asks respondents to provide information about the structure and staffing of the organization, budget size, mission statement, target population, and Internet access, information requested in order to determine whether this study reinforced findings about NPO characteristics described in the literature review. The strategy typology section consists of a set of four paragraphs, each describing the actions and decision-making behaviors of one of the four strategy typologies described above. Respondents chose one of the four paragraphs and did not have an \"other\" or \"do not know\" option. IT alignment maturity factor items in the SIMO instrument are structured as ordinal-scale items in exactly the same way they exist in the SAMM instrument (Luftman, 2011), with descriptions of how each factor would be demonstrated at each level, 1-5. Permission was obtained to modify SAMM for the purpose of this investigation, and is included in Appendix D. Suggested changes included incorporating a progress bar into the survey, reconsidering the use of the logic model graphic, and a number of wording suggestions for specific items that informed modification to improve the instrument's fit for the nonprofit sector. To assess preliminary factorial validity, a factor analysis and principal components analysis was done to determine whether the groups of scale items that measured model criteria (IT/mission alignment and performance measurement) made intuitive sense (Field, 2003). This analysis was done tentatively with the understanding that the small sample size (13) could result in an inconclusive analysis. A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on all of the scale items together with oblique rotation (direct oblimin) which resulted in the determination that \"This matrix is not positive definite\" due to small sample size, thus preventing comprehensive factor analysis. Instead, a PCA was conducted with the same rotation on each criteria group of scale items (7 IT/mission alignment criteria and performance measurement criteria). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure confirmed that 7 of 8 groups of items had an insufficient sample size for analysis, all but one of the KMO values were >.5. Nevertheless, eigenvalues expressing commonality between the items after extraction were obtained for each item. All items for all eight groups had eigenvalues greater than Joliffe's criteria for retention of .7 (Field, 2009, p. 641). Scree plots were ambiguous, which was logical, given the small sample size. Further, for every group, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for all items had at least one correlation greater than .3, the threshold for retention recommended by Field (2009, p. 657) and none had coefficients greater than 9. Accordingly, all items were retained. Reliability, the likelihood that the SIMO subscales consistently reflect the constructs they purport to measure, was assessed using Chronbach's \u03b1, which, in SPSS, splits the data into two halves and computes correlations in all possible combinations in order to find the average covariance between items in each criteria and across all factors. The  7 (in Field, 2009, p. 675). The three subscales that did not reflect a Cronbach's \u03b1 above .7 were retained as written, tentatively, because Kline asserts that these type of constructs can produce values even below .7 because of their diversity (in Field, 2009, p. 675). The reliability test was run again with the full sample, to challenge this preliminary assessment, the results of which are discussed in the results section. Because no modifications were made to the survey to change its nature of \"not collecting personal identifiable (private) information about human subjects\", it was not necessary to resubmit the revised survey to HSIRB, since the project had been initially judged as one in which approval was not needed. Even with this status, it was important to provide a level of confidence to participants that the information they shared would be handled confidentially, and that risks of participation would be minimized. Therefore, a consent document was included in both the invitation to take the online survey (Appendix F) and attached at the beginning of the online and print surveys as shown in Appendix C. Additionally, modifications did not change the material content of the questions relative to the criteria or factors, therefore it was not necessary to repeat validity testing. With preliminary validity and reliability established and the intention to reassess both upon increasing sample size, identification and recruitment of subjects began. The process of identifying subjects was unexpectedly iterative, due to several challenges in access. These challenges spanned both sampling and data collection phases. Therefore, the next section describes the extent of the challenges, followed by descriptions of sampling and data collection procedures."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Individuals working in nonprofit organizations who have primary responsibility for managing and making decisions about technology were invited to participate in this study, and the nonprofit organization was the unit of analysis, a population that mirrors that used by Zorn et al. (2011) in their investigation of ICT use in New Zealand. While Kearns and Lederer's (2000) approach to investigating IT alignment by surveying matched pairs of CEOs and technology managers would be most insightful, the unique NPO characteristic of often having 'whoever's available' serve as the technologist rendered this strategy impractical because often that person is the CEO. The survey population for this study consisted of all nonprofit organizations that have had grantee relationships within the past two years with Community Foundations located in Indiana (N\u22484,000). Access to grantee organizations' contact information was gained through information provided either by Community Foundations directly or gleaned from Community Foundation or grantee websites, a process that will be described in detail below. The rationale for choosing nonprofit leaders responsible for making technology decisions, and for using Community Foundations as a gatekeeper was based on the need for adequate coverage, establishment of trust, acquiring access to respondents, and demonstrating benefits of participation, all of which are described by Dillman et al. (2009)  Foundations serving randomly-sampled counties were contacted via e-mail with the request for support and involvement, which was followed by an additional e-mail and phone call to those Foundations that did not respond. Tailored design consideration #3: Access. Following the established methodology of asking Community Foundations to serve as gatekeepers and promoters of the project was expected to provide direct access to potential respondents, but that was not the case. Four 4Community Foundations sent their grantee contact lists and sent out a pre-notice e-mail to their grantees, one (1) sent a contact list but refused to send a pre-notice, and one sent a pre-notice but did not feel comfortable sending a contact list. Of those that sent both, the Foundation that serves the investigator's home county also encouraged the investigator to promote the survey during a capacity-building presentation to all local NPOs. The lists provided contact information for 592 grantee organizations. In addition two (2) Community Foundations sent annual reports listing the names of grantee organizations, and two (2) responded with reference to websites that had grantees listed in a community database. Twelve (12) Foundations responded that they would not participate, three of which criticized the length of the survey, and two suggested contacting the Indiana Grantmakers' Association and request that they ask grantees to participate. In total, of the 50 organizations contacted, 30 did not respond to an e-mail or phone message or an administrative gatekeeper did not pass on information or suggest a call-back, results of which are illustrated in Table 3 below. information with which to invite organizations to participate in the survey. The process of establishing trust with gatekeepers in order to gain access to a target population is difficult process, but when it is successful, the results are also successful, as illustrated in Table 4 below, which compares the response rates of grantees when Community Foundations acted as gatekeepers by providing information and encouraging participation, to response rates when the Foundations were not involved in the process. Overall, the response rate was nearly 6% higher when Community Foundations were involved. Assuming that the relevance and importance of the topic, social value and incentive of participation would be compelling enough to lead Community Foundation staff to believe that the rewards of participating would outweigh the costs of responding was overshadowed by the tenets of existing relationships, time constraints, and  was also offered --in order to provide value to their organizations, each survey respondent would receive a custom report of their level of IT Alignment Maturity and a Technology Strategy Guide compiled from current theoretical and practitioner literature that provides suggestions of how they can increase their IT/Mission alignment in each of the 7 factor areas measured. Participants were informed that the custom report would be available only to organizations who were invited to participate. A similar incentive structure was used by Finn, Maher and Forster (2006, p. 282) and resulted in a 9.6% response rate. Additionally, several strategies for reducing costs of participation were used: providing the convenience and choice of electronic response through the use of Survey Monkey or paper response through a mailed, postage paid survey (Dillman e. al, 2009, p. 25), invitees were not made to feel subordinate (p. 26), and the survey did not require sharing of personal or sensitive information, rather it focused on the organization and their role in it in the survey items (p. 26). One of the recommendations not heeded was \"making the questionnaire short and easy to complete\" (p. 26), which, because of the character of the model being tested, was impossible. As mentioned above, several invited participants shared that the length of the survey and time required to complete it was unrealistic and they would not participate. However, invitees were advised of the maximum amount of time it would take them to complete the survey, so that they would clearly understand the expected investment necessary to receive the reward."}, {"section_title": "Sampling", "text": "The source of the sampling frame for this study, a map of Indiana counties and the In order to distinguish levels of rurality in the sampling frame, first the county or counties that each Community Foundation serves was identified, then the Community Foundations were listed alphabetically by county and each county's rurality was identified using RUCC levels. The sampling frame was stratified into three groups: Community Foundations operating in metropolitan areas (RUCC levels 1-3), nonmetropolitan areas adjacent to metropolitan areas (RUCC levels 4-6) and nonmetropolitan, non-adjacent or rural areas (RUCC levels 7-9). The characteristic of rurality dictated the use of purposeful stratified random sampling to select organizations for inclusion, described by Miles & Huberman (1994) as a strategy to delineate subgroups that have been found to differ in technology use in past research, allow for comparisons between them, and add credibility to a large, purposeful sample. Table 5 reflects the distribution of Community Foundations across the three RUCC groups, which, for the purpose of this investigation are referred to as \"metropolitan\" \"nonmetropolitan\" and \"rural\". The table also displays the percentage of all counties represented by each of the three groups.   b In order to provide the opportunity for all NPOs served by an umbrella CF to participate, two additional organizations (n=50) were added to the list, those that were served by those CFs who were randomly selected for other counties. alphabetically by county name. Next, random numbers were assigned to each county in the category using the Excel \"=RAND\" function. Attempts to sort the random number column in ascending order so that the first half of the category could be selected did not work. Each mouse click caused the random numbers to re-randomize. Therefore, after assigning random numbers, the lists were captured and printed as Portable Document Files (PDFs) (Adobe, 2012) in order to freeze the random number assignments. Then the PDF files were opened in Adobe Acrobat Pro, the files were recognized as text, the text was copied and pasted into Excel and, frustratingly, the columns disappeared. those counties in which there had been or was presently an independent Community Foundation and an Alliance to which it belonged, information that was sought and gathered county-by-county to confirm the existence of four alliances. Then Community Foundation websites that had a dual listing were scanned to confirm that they were, in fact, part of an alliance. Through this process, the random nature of the alliances was reinforced. Some had active individual websites and a presence on an alliance website, and some were only represented on an alliance website. Accordingly, a few judgment calls were made, and purposeful selection was used in a few cases to ensure appropriate coverage and consider the influence of alliances on the study's findings. The rationale for these actions was two-fold. First, in Community Foundations that had merged completely into a larger alliance, there would be no way to isolate grantee organizations by county from the alliance's grantee list, especially if a grantee organization served more than one county. Second, it is possible that Community Foundation alliances may provide a benefit to NPOs from economies in scale in training, equipment, and staffing, which could impact findings, so it was important to have this characteristic kept intact for data analysis. Therefore, if a Community Foundation serving a randomly-selected county was completely merged into an alliance and did not maintain its distinct identity and contact information as a county-based Community Foundation, the other counties in the alliance were checked to see if they had also been randomly selected. If so, all of the counties were kept in the sampling frame. If not, the counties were removed from the list and replaced with the next county on that particular stratification list. Community Foundations that were randomly sampled and had contact information were kept on the list. Table 6 illustrates the alliances and actions taken with each. With the list of counties selected and Community Foundation executive director contact information secured, project information e-mails were sent to Community Foundations in order to gather lists of grantees. E-mails were followed up with a phone call and additional e-mail request if no response to the initial e-mail was received. As described above, this endeavor was not successful in generating a sufficient sample of grantees to invite to take the survey. The five lists received provided contact information for 592 grantees. With a need to invite over 1,000 additional grantees to take the survey, a strategy was devised to collect their information one-by-one. First, grantee lists from Table 6 Community Foundation Alliances Community Foundation annual reports and web lists received from four additional counties were used to search the Internet for contact information for the directors of each of the grantee organizations. This process was laborious and required, on average, 10 minutes and at least 6 clicks or searches per grantee to find a name, an e-mail address for a specific person beyond 'info@organization.org' and, in the event that this information could not be located, a phone number to call to request information or a mailing address with which to send a paper survey. In the case of Community Foundations that did not respond, annual reports, newsletters or grantee lists from the Community Foundation's website were captured and the same process was used to collect contact information for grantees. This process began in October, 2012 and was completed in April, 2013, resulting in an initial sample of 2,036 Community Foundation grantees to invite to complete the survey, with sample defined by Dillman et al. as \"all units of the population that are drawn for inclusion in the survey\" (2009, p. 43). This definition of sampling is not completely in line with the sampling process used herein, because the grantee organizations themselves were not actually sampled, rather, the Community Foundations were randomly sampled. However, the organizations themselves took the survey and it was their data that was the unit of analysis, so the grantee organizations, in reality, were considered \"the sample\". The sample needed to be large enough to ensure a sufficient level of rigor and power. In previous validation studies of the SAMM instrument, sample sizes ranged from 25 (Luftman, 2000) to 153 . The target completed sample size, the number of units who complete the questionnaire (Dillman et al., 2009, p. 43), for the present study that would avoid sampling bias and exhibit a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level suggested by Dillman et al. (2009, p. 57) was 323 actual participants, based on the sample of 2036 grantee organizations gathered from Community Foundations and the Internet, although all of them did not receive or complete the survey due to either bounced-back e-mail addresses, mailings returned to sender, or organizations that no longer existed. The number of respondents needed to elicit a correlation coefficient statistical result with statistical power above .7, which is considered adequate power, meaning rejecting any false null hypotheses could be fairly certain, in the presence of medium effect size (r<=6% explained variance) was 66 with \u03b1=.05. (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p. 145). It was also important to consider how many responses were necessary in order to use confirmatory factor analysis and achieve satisfactory results of the analysis of 92 variables. Darlington, Weinberg and Walberg (1973) recommend a logarithmic equation which estimates the necessary sample size at 82, which is below the sample size of 100 recommended by Gorsuch (1983), and 250 recommended by Cattell (1978). Comrey and Lee (1992) suggest that a sample size of 300 is considered \"good\". Further, Cattell (1978) suggests that the ratio between cases and variables should be between 1:3 and 1:6. Taking this collection of criteria into account, the target number for the completed sample was 323 responses, which would result in a ratio of 1:3.5 and a response rate of 15.4%, which is not out of line with other technology-focused surveys, which include rates of 3% (Bernard & Pukstas, 2010), 8% (Hackler & Saxton, 2007), 9% (Finn, et al., 2006), 14% (Garrido & Camarero, 2010), 18% (Cragg, et al., 2002), 41% (Zorn et al., 2011) and 49% (Bassellier, et al., 2003) with sample sizes between 40 and 1,010. The sampling, recruiting, and tailored design strategies that resulted in a completed sample of 244 respondents from the 1,703 grantee organizations with valid email or postal addresses achieved 76% of the target sample size. This completed sample reflected the population at a 95% confidence level with a margin of error of 5.81%, a cases-to-variable ratio of 1:2.65. Interestingly, approximately half of the business sector IT Alignment survey studies reviewed provided data on the number of responses, but not the number of surveys distributed or the overall response rate, which leads me to believe that the response rate in these studies could have been omitted because it was not very high."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Procedures and Outcomes", "text": "Data collection procedures involved inviting participants to take the SIMO survey both through the Internet and through U.S. Mail. A description of procedures to gain access to the participants has been chronicled throughout the chapter, and specific steps for gathering data to test the SIMO model is provided here. A project management work plan was established early in the investigation to ensure that the investigator could handle issues that arose and that data collection would run smoothly. It was necessary to modify the plan due to gatekeeper and sampling challenges.

Of the letters sent, 53 were returned to sender. Survey packets were sent to 132 organizations remaining on the list, the contents of which included a cover letter, a paper copy of the survey, and a postage-paid return envelope addressed to the investigator. The cover letter summarized the purpose of the survey, explained completion options, which included filling out and returning the paper survey or accessing and completing the survey online using a link provided in the letter, and requested completion of the survey within 10 days. Each letter, survey, and envelope was coded with a respondent number for tracking purposes. Individuals who chose to complete the electronic survey were asked to enter their respondent number into a survey field. Of the survey packets sent, 26 were returned to sender, which indicated that 106 surveys were received by organizations. Fifteen days after the survey packets were sent out, reminder postcards were sent to all non-respondents, reminding them about the survey, providing the link to the online survey, and requesting that it be completed that week. Twenty paper surveys were completed, and 12 surveys were completed online, resulting in a response rate of 30.2%. In total, 1703 organizations were invited to take the survey and 244 participated, garnering an overall response rate of 14.3%. The distribution and response character of organizations involved in the paper survey process is illustrated in Table 9 below. A comparison of electronic, paper, and overall survey response rates is shown in Table 10.  "}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Sampling Strategy", "text": "Five limitations of this sampling strategy have been identified. The first is the generalizability of findings to \"all nonprofits\", which is ultimately the population to which the Nonprofit IT Alignment Maturity Model would have the most utility in practice. However, the feasibility of subjecting the model to validation using the U.S. population of 1.5 million nonprofit organizations is beyond the scope of resources available for this study. Therefore, data from this iteration of the survey was used to validate the model and generalize findings to \"all Indiana Community Foundation grantees\". Future research may engage a national sample. A second limitation of this sampling strategy is the concern respondents may have about self-reporting less-than-stellar information about their organization's strategies, organizational practices, and outcomes in light of the knowledge that they have been referred for the study by one of their stakeholders, a community foundation. Reassurance to respondents in the invitation letter, informed consent document, and the questionnaire itself that survey data will be kept confidential and no organizational identities will be revealed in the reporting of results beyond those provided to the organization's respondent in a Custom IT/Mission Alignment report, as well as encouragement to participate from the Community Foundations themselves, in some cases, was given to counter these concerns in an attempt to reduce measurement error. A third limitation involves coverage. Finding contact information for grantees resulted in a sufficient sampling frame, however the process uncovered a number of challenges. First, of all possible respondents included in Community Foundation lists (n=2036), 3% (n=66) were duplicated within and/or among the lists, a challenge described is described as common by Dillman et al (2009, p. 51 Corporation bookkeepers and town clerks were, in some cases, able to provide contact person for the grant project. In other cases the response was, \"I don't know\" or \"I do not have time to look that up\". When a contact person could not be identified, the request for involvement was sent to either the highest level administrator, i.e. the Mayor, the Chief, or the Superintendent, or the Technology Director, if one existed. Also, some Community Foundations sampled funded community projects and community groups for which there are not sole primary contacts. Festivals, parks, and initiatives are examples of such grants. In the event that the grant project had an e-mail or mailing address available, the primary contact was asked to participate. Otherwise, that grantee was not invited to take the survey. These challenges led to the limitation that while these grantees are loosely organized, and many do use technology (some extensively, based on their Web presence) the perspective shared may not accurately represent the organization if the individual responsible for strategy, information technology/mission and outcome alignment was not the person who completed the survey. Together these limitations suggest that nonresponse, measurement and coverage error may impact the utility and generalizability of the findings. Finally, the most concerning limitation is the failure of the implementation of the prescribed social exchange methodology to leverage the trust of stakeholders in the process of gaining access and enlisting participation, thus it is possible that not all Community Foundation grantees were identified and invited to participate. 'Thick skin' was definitely required when receiving rejections from what were hoped to be supportive organizations, and rude electronic lectures from seasoned NPO executives about the presumption that they had the time to help. The misguided assumption that all would readily comply with requests for participation resulted in little outside support of the project and was followed by a collection of \"no's\", specific criticism of the project, the instrument, its length, and the methodology. Personal responses were sent to all critics with poise, gratitude, and comments regarding each individual concern which, I believe, garnered a bit of respect, although no additional compliance. Using an alternative approach to enlisting participants one-by-one in the counties from which I received a negative response from a Community Foundation was unnerving. In two situations, Community Foundation directors were approached by their grantees after receiving survey invitations and criticized for their involvement (of which there was none) because grantees were informed in the invitation that they were selected because they were grantees of a Community Foundation. The directors shared this concern and one requested that a follow-up e-mail be sent to all of the invited organizations, clarifying that the Community Foundation was in no way involved in the survey. Compliance with this request certainly would not help the response rate, but it was done politely and promptly. (The invitation was modified after the first time this happened to inform grantees that they were identified by their inclusion on a publicly-available grantee list.) In short, the sensitive nature of the relationship between funders and grantees has become clearer, as has the potential of outside influences to jeopardize the relationship between grantors and grantees. This investigation may have caused friction among organizations, and, at minimum, the friction and the lack of support from gatekeepers resulted in a less-than representative sample and a lower survey participation rate."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis Plan", "text": "This section describes the intended plan for data cleaning and tabulation, "}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics Analysis", "text": "Descriptive statistics, presented in Chapter 6 (frequency distributions, means and standard deviations) were calculated using both SPSS v.20 and XLStat to establish a profile of the data set and present a holistic view of the items included in the study. Initial screening of the data illuminated a considerable amount of missing values, the extent of which is described in the following section. Because the data set was not complete, computation of descriptive statistics needed to take missing values into account. In order to accurately reflect the data, the original data set was used to run descriptive statistics, and the number of responses received for each item is noted in the presentation of the descriptive statistics. A statistical procedure, multiple imputation, described below was used to approximate the data in order to make it usable for inferential statistical analysis. Accordingly, the inferential statistics approximate, but do not purely reflect the characteristics of the respondents."}, {"section_title": "Correlations", "text": "The actual data set, although incomplete, did contain several (n=44) cases in which values for all model-related variables were present. These cases had a few missing values, enough to flag them as \"incomplete\", yet they contained a plethora of information that was usable. Accordingly, cases that contained values for all model-specific variables among all variables using a two-tailed test of significance (because of the exploratory nature of the analysis) to identify relationships that were significant at a p value less than .05. One of the dangers of running correlations on a large number of variables derived from survey research is that it could be considered 'data dredging', searching for any combination of variables that might show a statistical relationship but are actually spurious, with relationships identified by chance that could increase the likelihood of Type 2 errors, identifying relationships that are not, in fact, true relationships (Selvin & Stuart, 1966). Further, in such a small data set that is not randomly sampled, relationship findings cannot be generalized to the intended population. In order to overcome these dangers, rather than simply identify relationships in the small data set, correlations were also run for all cases that had 10% missing values, with missing values omitted from analysis, and the same correlations were run for the pooled values of the imputed data set, a set of 244 values (the size of the original data set) derived from 1220 estimated cases, the procedure for which is described below. Then, the results of the correlations were compared across all three data sets, and only those correlations that were maintained across all three data sets at a p value of less than .05 were considered as legitimate findings. Results of the correlations are described in the Results chapter."}, {"section_title": "Missing Values Analysis", "text": "After experiencing the sampling challenges described above, it was not a complete surprise that the limitations of the sampling strategy manifested in a less-thancompete data set. Although 244 individuals responded to the request for participation and accessed the SIMO survey, either on line or in paper form, not all of them completed all of the questionnaire items. Missing data is a common occurrence in surveys, whether it is missing completely at random (MCAR), with no relation between the variables and the missing data, selectively missing based on the content of items or characteristics of respondents, or missing by design because of the structure of the survey, accessibility issues, or because respondents had the option to answer 'don't know' or 'not applicable' to some or all items (Allison, 2001;Newman, 2003). Consideration of missing data is important because statistical methods presume that every case informs the variables that are included in the analysis. Further, patterns of missing data also provide information relative to instrument design and methodology that impact both analysis of the data that is collected, as well as considerations that must be made in future iterations of a survey instrument. Accordingly, before pursuing analysis of the data collected, it was important to analyze the missing data in order to determine how (or if) to proceed with the analysis. . 20 was used to analyze items to determine the overall summary of missing values, an illustration of which is provided in Figure 14. The first graph, The present study has an extreme amount of missing data. Of the 244 cases, 98% had at least one variable item missing, which is far beyond the generally acceptable level of 20% missing data that would indicate the use of a missing data approach. Historically listwise deletion, the process of removing cases in which data is missing, has been used to deal with missing data. If listwise deletion were used, only 2% of the data would be available for data analysis. Therefore, to utilize available data in an exploratory fashion, further consideration was made of the missing data, particularly whether there is method that would enable the missing data to be estimated for the purpose of analysis. The Missing Value Analysis module of SPSS v. 20 provides an expectation maximization (EM) procedure that provides a statistic for use with multivariate data with missing data, Little's MCAR, that enables the investigator to determine whether the data is missing completely at random, which would indicate that an imputation strategy could be used to estimate the missing data (Howell, 2006). IBM Corp. describes the EM procedure this way: Each iteration consists of an E step and an M step. The E step finds the conditional expectation of the \"missing\" data, given the observed values and current estimates of the parameters. These expectations are then substituted for the \"missing\" data. In the M step, maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are computed as though the missing data had been filled in. \"Missing\" is enclosed in quotation marks because the missing values are not being directly filled, but, rather, functions of them are used in the log-likelihood. (2011a, p. 8) Howell provides additional explanation of the process, in which the filled-in data is used to re-estimate the parameters, then the re-estimated parameters are used to estimate the values for several iterations. \"When the process finally converges on stable estimates, we stop iterating\" (2006, p. 15) and missing data, rather that was done using the multiple imputation strategy described below in order to prepare the data for analysis. All of the independent variables measuring strategy and IT/mission alignment maturity, as well as the dependent variables were analyzed using expectation maximization estimation with cases with missing values sorted by missing value patterns. Missing value analysis (MVA) output data is contained in Appendix K."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Imputation", "text": "When dealing with missing data, historically five methods have been widely used to prepare a data set for analysis: listwise deletion, dropping variables, replacing the data with dummy variables, mean replacement, and single imputation (Allison, 2002;Grace-Martin, 2013;Howell, 2006;Newman, 2003). Listwise deletion entails removing all cases that have missing data on any variables, which, in the present study, would require removing 98% of cases. Dropping variables could be considered if the variables had little or no effect on the dependent variable, but without sufficient data to determine that, the relationship between the variable being considered and the dependent variable is unknown. It is often the case that a variable with much missing data indicates a poorly worded question or data collection was flawed (Allison, 2002, Newman, 2003. Replacing the data with dummy variables does not produce unbiased parameter estimates and is therefore not recommended (Jones, 1996). Mean replacement involves finding the mean of all present occurrences of a variable, then using that mean to replace all incidents of that variable. The problem with this approach is that it underestimates the standard error of the variables that were treated, which would increase the likelihood of p-values that are too small, thus reporting results that are not really results at all (Grace-Martin, 2013). Additional strategies for dealing with missing data in multivariate analysis are described by Howell, including missing data coding, regression substitution and hot-deck imputation, each of which also have limitations. Two strategies are most frequently recommended for dealing with missing data: expectation maximization (EM) (Dempster, Laird and Rubin (1977) and multiple imputation (MI). (Rubin, 1987). According to Howell, often EM is used as the first step in MI. MI addresses the above issues by first applying the expectation maximization algorithm to the original data set to obtain unbiased parameter estimates for the dataset. As explained by Howell (2006), once the parameters are set, a complete set of data is imputed from the estimated parameters. The process for imputing an observation is to perform regression on a variable with missing data on other variables on the data set. Then, the complete data set is imputed to obtain revised parameter estimates for the model, similar to the process explained above for EM. Then the derived parameter estimate values are imputed back onto the data set, and then the data set is imputed back on to the parameter estimates for several iterations until the values stabilize. Howell likens this to running several replications of an experiment, then combining all of the results and subjecting all of them to multiple analyses. With MI, \"the replications are repeated simulations of data sets based upon parameter estimates from the original study\" (p. 19). Results of subsequent statistical tests are computed by finding the mean of the results of each of the imputed data sets, as recommended by Rubin (1987Rubin ( , 1996 In the present study, IT/mission alignment criteria and organizational performance cannot be directly observed. Instead, IT/mission alignment maturity questionnaire item choices describe conditions in an organization that reflect specific levels of each criteria. Similarly, organizational performance item choices describe levels performance and levels of technology's influence on performance that together establish levels of organizational performance. PCA determined which of the observable variables load on which latent factors. The loadings established the principal components. Six IT/mission alignment maturity latent variables were previously identified and validated by Sledgianowski (2004) and    (Clark, 2009). Varimax rotation was selected because, according to Brown (2009), it is an orthogonal rotation used to obtain a new set of factor loadings in order to achieve a simple factor structure. Orthogonal rotations are used when the goal is to identify factors that are uncorrelated. The rotated component matrix resulting from the process identified which variables loaded on which components, depicting the principal components of the set of variables, the results of which are described in Chapter 6. The factor structure for the IT/mission alignment maturity variables was replicated in the next analysis step, Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM). In this investigation, recall that PCA was done with the pilot data set with rather inconclusive results due to the small size of the pilot data set, then the analysis was replicated for the data set derived from the executed SIMO survey to confirm the components identified previously by  to determine whether the factors established for the culture criterion were, in fact, unique and uncorrelated with the other six IT/mission alignment maturity factors. Two of the guidelines used by Sledgianowski (2004) were used in this study to assess the extent of adequacy of extraction and interpretation of the factors: 1) Retained factors should have an eigenvalue >1. 2) Only factors loading with more than two variables are interpreted. (2004, p. 86) Statistical power should always be a consideration when computing inferential statistics. In the case of studies that use factor analysis, of which PCA is one type, the sample size, or number of cases analyzed is the primary determinant of power. Zhao PCA facilitated the reduction of individual IT/mission alignment maturity factors into the seven corresponding criteria while still reserving access to the factor data in order to use it for further exploration of how to identify and provide prescriptive technical assistance based on individual factor levels. In some survey studies, PCA is used to reduce the total number of factors or variables informing a construct, in other words, reduce the number of items on an instrument by identifying those that do not load on the latent factors. Because the SIMO questionnaire had already been used to collect data for the study, PCA findings could not be used to refine the instrument. However, the findings will be useful for refining the instrument for future iterations of the survey. The principle components confirmed by PCA were then used for testing the SIMO model, through partial least squares path modeling analyses to identify relationships between the IT/mission alignment maturity criteria, strategy typology and performance variables."}, {"section_title": "Partial Least Squares Path Modeling", "text": "Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), a method which combines processes of principle components analysis and multiple linear regression, was used by Croteau and Bergeron (2001) to \"estimate and test relationships among constructs\" (p. or variables that characterize a particular construct (Griffin, 2005). While Griffin asserts that Cronbach's alpha should be .70 or above to establish internal consistency he suggests that if a survey has sections of 6 to 10 items, which the SIMO survey does, a Cronbach's alpha of .50 may be considered adequate for the purpose of establishing preliminary reliability. Recall that because the instrument was implemented prior to the PLS-PM analysis, the result of the reliability analysis was not used to exclude factors, rather it identified those variables that would need to be considered for exclusion in future iterations of the instrument. Convergent Validity. Convergent validity establishes the point at which a construct or latent variable is representative of the 'true' value of that construct (Croteau & Bergeron, 2001, p. 87). It is measured using the rho or R 2 value presented in the first stage of PLS-PM analysis, a weight value determined by item loading. Nunnally (1978) and Hulland (1999) established that any constructs with a rho value greater than or equal to 0.70 should be retained, a criteria that was considered in this analysis. Advantages of using PLS-PM are its applicability for use with ordinal and categorical data and its' not requiring a normal distribution of data (Croteau & Bergeron, 2001, p. 85), which was the case with the data collected in the present study. When combined, the results of the measurement and structural models provided a framework of weighted and loaded measures that indicates the strength and direction of the measures."}, {"section_title": "PLS-PM", "text": "Considering the research questions addressed through the analysis, the factors that "}, {"section_title": "Data Screening", "text": "The previous chapter introduced the most substantial challenge to the investigation -missing data. This section will describe the results of the missing variable analysis performed using SPSS v. 20.0 and Microsoft Excel, as well as the process of multiple imputation performed using SPSS v. 20.0."}, {"section_title": "Results of Missing Value Analysis", "text": "After receiving 244 responses to the SIMO survey, missing value analysis illuminated that only 4 variables (items) out of 110 (4%) received responses from all 244 respondents. Only five respondents out of 244 (2%) provide responses for all 110 variables (including matrix items). Altogether, 9,696 data points (36%) were gathered through implementation of the SIMO survey, which requested input on 26,840 data points. These results, along with Figure 15 below, which presents the top ten missing data patterns, suggests that some respondents skipped a few items, some completed the first few then exited the survey, while others completed some of the survey then either took a break and forgot to go back and complete it or decided partway through to not complete the survey. The missing value analysis indicated that the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), as Little's MCAR statistic was .980, which is not significant. Patterns in the data suggest that while missing data was random in terms of relationships between variables, the data was both selectively missing and missing by design. Selectively missing data was caused by the characteristic of respondents who, while well-intentioned when beginning the survey, found that they did not have time to finish because they are the sole employee, their organization is short-staffed or they are volunteers who have to choose how to best invest their time, an issue that was made apparent in e-mail and phone conversations with respondents who took the time to share their concern. This led to the finding that not enough effort was made to convince subjects of the value of the survey, and not enough reminders were provided to encourage full participation. Data was missing by design due to three nonresponse issues. First, the survey is long, 87 items, and the items are complex. A mentor shared his concern about the length of the survey and the depth of the questions when the survey was first created, and Dillman et al. (2009) assert that longer surveys increase the cost (time) to participants, so length should be minimized when possible and administration should include extra incentives and follow-up contacts. The mentor agreed that if it was modeled after an instrument used in another study with the intention of comparing the results of implementation in a different sector, there was little that could be done to alter the length or character of the items, but he maintained his concern and predicted that response rate could be affected. Sure enough, the length of the survey contributed to respondent fatigue, defined by Ben-Nun (2008) as a phenomenon in which \"survey participants become tired of the survey task and the quality of the data they provide begins to deteriorate\" (p.743), as illustrated in Figure 16 below. The chart illustrates the way in which the number of nonresponse items increased incrementally as respondents moved through the items. (Again, the number of items shown takes into account matrix responses, which count as multiple variables.) The horizontal axis is labeled with the sections of the survey, each of which begins on a new page, prefaced with a title and short introduction. The number of nonresponse items follows the structure of the survey very closely, as though respondents decided, at the end of each section, whether they would continue or quit. The second design element that contributed to item nonresponse was the inclusion of a \"don't know/NA\" or an \"I don't know\" last response choice in five items in the organization section, 56 in the IT/mission alignment section, and 30 in the performance which was coded for the purpose of analysis as a nonresponse. While Dillman et al. (2009) hesitate to recommend the use of \"don't know\" responses because they oftentimes lead to additional incidents of nonresponse, in some cases the respondent truly did not know the answer because the information necessary was outside his or her scope of work. Several individuals either e-mailed or responded in writing in response to mailed surveys that the some or all of survey items did not pertain to them. In some cases the survey participant was not the most appropriate respondent, as would have been the case if an administrative assistant or departmental executive, rather than the chief executive, completed the survey. The survey was designed to be completed by the person in charge of making technology decisions, and this directive was included in the survey invitation letter and introduction, but that qualification was not enforced. If someone other than that person responded, then it is likely they could not answer the questions, so they would have either answered \"do not know\" or not responded. Some responded by using the \"don't know\" option where appropriate, and others refrained from completing the questionnaire. This is exactly the situation Dillman et al. describe and recommend that such an option is provided so that the respondent is not either forced to choose a response that does not fit or chooses to quit the survey because he or she cannot answer some of the questions (2009, p. 210). This led to the finding that the process of inviting participants needed to be more specific in order to include only decision-makers in the process. The extent of missing data indicates that even some primary technology decision- makers could not answer some questions, which suggests a third factor that influenced nonresponse due to design -appropriateness of the measures. Of the respondents who indicated their position, 117 can be considered primary decision-makers (CEOs, County Coordinators, Executive Directors, Lead Pastors and Technology Directors). One consideration in adapting a business-sector model and instruments to the nonprofit sector was ensuring that the concepts and terms of the measures were appropriate for the sector. Considering Table 11 below, which displays variables from the SIMO survey that received at least 25 nonsubstantive responses from primary decision-makers, it is likely that lack of understanding of several of the SIMO items, particularly those that were validated in the business sector (COMM, CULT, PART, SKIL) led to high levels of nonresponse. In the case of PART040, the percent of nonsubstantive response was greater for decision-makers (65%) than for the entire sample (53%). This led to the finding that some variables may be inappropriate and need to be studied further."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "Computation of descriptive statistics needed to take missing values into account, therefore the presentation of descriptive statistics incorporates designation of the number of individuals that responded to each item."}, {"section_title": "Demographics of Respondents.", "text": "Respondents were asked to indicate their position within the organization. Of all 244 respondents, 78 did not list a position, and it was not possible to determine from position titles in all cases whether the respondent was the primary technology decision-maker in the organization. Table 12 below depicts the range of positions represented by the respondents.    As shown in Figure 18, a majority of organizations (62%) have annual budgets of less than $500,000, 23% have budgets between $500,000 and $2.5 million, and 9% have budgets of more than $2.5 million. Most of the organizations in the sample use less than 3% of their overall budget for technology. The organizations in the sample serve across the state of Indiana, primarily in metropolitan areas (63%), with 25% serving non-rural areas and 12% serving rural areas. In terms of their purpose, which was designated by their mission and a description of the population they serve and classified by NTEE major categories, a majority address human service needs (43%), followed by education (21%), public and social benefit (12%) and arts, culture and humanities (11%). The overall distribution of organizations across NTEE categories, as well as across levels of rurality, is shown in Figure 19.  Respondents were asked to identify their perceived strategy typology. Most of the 214 respondents who designated a typology, 32% classified their organization as using the Analyzer or Prospector typology, 20% classified their organization as a Defender, and 4% designated their organization as a reactor. Correspondence analysis was used in SPSS to determine the average IT/mission alignment maturity level for each of the four strategy typologies. Of all original cases that did not have any missing IT/mission alignment maturity item values (n=94) Analyzers had the highest reported overall level of IT/mission alignment (x \u0305 =2.17, n=29), Defenders were close behind (x \u0305 =2.16, n=19), followed by Prospectors (x \u0305 =2.14, n=43), and Reactors had the lowest mean level (x \u0305 =1.67, n=19). Respondents were also asked to identify their organization's actions relative to 56 different factors related to IT/mission alignment maturity, the extent to which they achieve organizational outcomes and the level at which they perceive technology influences their achievement of outcomes. The summary statistics below reflect responses to one strategy typology item, the averages of all responses in each of seven IT/strategy alignment criteria categories, and the averages of all responses in each of two organizational performance categories.

The last three influence questions focused on the extent to which respondents perceived that technology influenced their achievement of outcomes, which rated their perception on a 5-point multiple-choice scale in which 1 was the lowest influence and 5 was the highest influence."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results of Correlations", "text": "Beyond just testing the SIMO model, it was important to determine whether variables external to the model could add to the understanding of the character of the subjects, the character of their organizations, and how those elements add to the understanding of the implementation of the model. Pearson's r was computed among all substantive variables to gather additional insights, which will be described first by looking at relationships that were identified involving the people who serve in NPOs (staff, board members, technology managers), then at the organizations themselves (public versus nonprofit, organization size, Internet access), then at relationships that interface with the SIMO model itself. As described in the Methodology chapter, the only correlations reported here are those that were maintained across the analyses of a complete cases from the original data set (n=44), a data set containing cases with 10% missing values (n=93), and the pooled values of 5 imputations, which in total comprised a data set of 1220 cases, but when pooled comprised a data set of 244 cases. When individuals responded \"don't know\", their responses registered as no value in the data set, which is reflected in the reported statistics below. Staffing. Significant moderate correlations were identified between the number of paid staff and the employment status of a technology manager or team within an organization, levels of which ranged from a full-time paid staff member (1 on scale) to no one in charge (7 on scale) or outsourced (8 on scale) (r=-0.428, n=244, p=.000); and the number of paid staff and organizations' status as either an NPO (value 1) or public agency (value 2) in that public agencies tended to have higher numbers of staff (r=-0.398, n=244, p=.000). Strong correlation was found between the number of paid staff and the size of organizations as indicated by organizational income (r=0.537, n=244, p=.000), and moderate correlations were found between the number of paid staff and the level of These correlations provide a logical preface for the principal component analysis and partial least squares path modeling analyses described in the next sections."}, {"section_title": "Results of Principal Components Analysis", "text": "The 56 IT/mission alignment maturity factors in the imputed data set of 1220 cases was analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA) in order to verify the 6 original factors identified by Sledgianowski (2004) and determine whether the seventh factor, culture, could be extracted from the variables. Two rounds of PCA were performed on both the original data and the imputed data for visual comparison purposes, although just the results of the imputed data were considered in the analysis, as the original data did not have a sufficient sample size of complete cases to subject it to factor analysis. The first round of PCA was performed to reduce the dimensions of the data set, and the second to examine factor loadings on the 7 a priori factors. In the first round of PCA, the strategy typology, IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance variables were selected for analysis. Univariate descriptives, initial solution, coefficients, significance levels, Kaiser-Meyer-Olking Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO), and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity statistics were run to test assumptions. Extraction was requested based on factors with Eigenvalues greater than 1, with 25 iterations to be done to achieve convergence. The KMO was .703, which is greater than the value of .50 recommended by Field (2009) and the value of .60 recommended by Starkweather (2013) to \"assess the adequacy of sampling size and evaluate correlations to determine if data are likely to coalesce on factors\" (p. 4). The Bartlett's Test statistic, a chi-square statistic which evaluates if the correlation matrix is an identity matrix, something that is not desired in PCA because that would mean the variables are unrelated and unsuitable for structure detection, had a significance level of .000, which indicated that the matrix was not an identity matrix. In the imputed data set, 54 of the 56 factors had communalities above .600, a statistic that is considered high when over .400, which is desirable because it explains the proportion of each variable's variance that can be explained by the principal components (IDRE, 2013). Twenty of all factor loadings converged on the first factor, which is typical (Starkweather, 2013), and the first 20 factors had eigenvalues between 1.018 and 7.588. The total variance explained by the 20 loaded factors was 64.653%, a percentage we would expect to diminish in the second round if the variables converged on a lower number of factors with a higher proportional percentage of variance explained by the loaded factors. Factor scores were saved from the analysis in order to run a bivariate correlation to see if any of the factor scores are related. The correlation showed that none of the factor scores were related, which suggested that the factors themselves were not related, which indicated that an orthogonal rotation (as opposed to an oblique rotation) should be used in subsequent rounds of PCA. Results of the first extraction are summarized in Table 15 below. In the second round of PCA, the same variables were selected for analysis, which this time included applying varimax rotation and indicating that a fixed number of factors, the a priori 7, should be retained in the extraction done with a limit of 25 iterations to achieve convergence. The KMO remained at .703 and the Bartlett's test remained at .000, as the sample size did not change. In the imputed, rotated data set, 47 of the 56 all factor loadings had communalities above .60. The variables loaded on 7 factors because they were selected in advance, and the converged factors had eigenvalues between 1.631 and 7.160, which remained above the cutoff value of 1.0. The total variance explained by the 7 loaded factors was 34.731%, a percentage that was desirable Table 15 Principal Components Analysis and Factor Extraction Based on Eigenvalues >1 because it showed that the variables loaded on fewer factors with a higher proportional percentage of variance explained by the loaded factors. This statistic, in and of itself, provided the evidence we need that the variables do, in fact, load on the 7 a priori factors, however, a review of the full results of the factor loadings after varimax rotation, located found that while the IT/mission alignment maturity variables tend to cluster according to criteria around separate factors and at 2 least variables loaded on each of the 7, some of them co-loaded on other factors, and not all factors within a cluster were within the lowest range of acceptable factor loading of .32, regarded as poor, by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007). This indicates that further refinement and testing of the adapted questionnaire items is necessary, as well as a more effective data collection strategy. Results of the second extraction are summarized in Table 16 below. While the factor structure of the IT/mission alignment maturity factors was found to be weak, evidence was provided through the PCA that a structure existed. Accordingly, analysis moved to the next phase, partial least squares path modeling, to determine whether relationships exist between those factors, strategy maturity and organizational performance. 'technology/mission alignment maturity were created, and arrows indicating the proposed relationships between the variables were used to connect them. An arrow indicating a two-way relationship between strategy typology and IT/mission alignment maturity, a one-way arrow from strategy typology to organizational performance, and a one-way arrow from IT/mission alignment to organizational performance indicated the proposed relationships. Then observable, or manifest, variables were defined for each of the latent variables, based on the results of the PCA and the a priori variables identified from previous research. For strategy typology, the only observable variable was the strategy typology item itself, so it also served as the manifest variable. For IT/mission alignment maturity, the seven criteria, the a priori factors were designated as the manifest variables:  Addinsoft (2013a), then the block is unidimensional, which was the case for IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance. A block is also considered unidimensional if Cronbach's alpha is greater than .700, which was the case for IT/mission alignment maturity (.757), but not organizational performance (.366). A large Dillon-Goldstein's rho, greater than .5, also indicates unidimensionality, which was indicated for both IT/mission alignment (.828) and organizational performance (.646). Strategy typology could not be assessed for unidimensionality because with one variable, reflectivity is irrelevant. This test completed the first phase of PLS-PM and the measurement model was defined.  IT/mission alignment and organizational performance; slight negative loadings were indicated between strategy typology and IT/mission alignment maturity (-.006 to -.074); and slight negative loadings were indicated between strategy and organizational performance (-.003 to -.023). Table 18 below illustrates cross loadings. Path coefficients between the three variables permitted evaluation of the structural model. An illustration of the initial PLS-PM coefficient, shown in Figure 20 below, indicates that there are relationships between two of the latent variables. The path from IT/mission alignment to organizational performance has a path coefficient of .509, with an R 2 value of .258, indicating that IT/mission alignment contributes 23.5% of variance to the model and a substantial relationship between those two variables. The path from strategy typology to organizational performance has a much smaller path coefficient, of .012 and an R 2 value of .0003, indicating that strategy typology contributes .03% of variance to the model. The path from IT/mission alignment maturity to strategy typology in the figure above shows a path coefficient of -.068, with an R 2 value of .005, indicating there is a very slight, inverse relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and strategy typology and that relationship contributes to .5% of variance to the model. When the direction of the path was reversed between IT/mission alignment maturity and strategy typology in a subsequent implementation of PLS-PM, indicating a two-way relationship between them as suggested in the SIMO model, all of the path coefficients and weights remained the same, suggesting that strategy typology has no influence on the model. This follows earlier findings, in which strategy typology had no loadings and negligible cross loadings with the other two variables. It was surmised that its character in the model as a single variable, rather than a composite of several manifest variables could contribute to its lack of influence in the model. Accordingly, an additional series of PLS-PM was run to investigate whether the four different values of the strategy typology indicated different relationships between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance. In these iterations of the model,     (.389) have weights that are considerably higher than the remainder of the IT/mission alignment criteria for this strategy typology, and the range between the lowest and highest weights is considerably greater than the range for the other three strategy typologies, a finding that is displayed in Table 19 below will be discussed in the next chapter. Considering the influence of organizational performance manifest variables, also for Reactors, the weight of extent of day-to-day performance (EXT D2D x \u0305 =.814) and influence of technology on day-to-day performance variables (INF D2D x \u0305 =.342) are greater than, actually far greater than the weight of extent of achievement of outcomes (EXT OUT x \u0305 =.142), and influence of technology on achievement of outcomes (INF OUT x \u0305 =.0002) variables. The relationships found for the Reactor strategy typology are similar in structure, as shown in Figure 24. A summary of these findings is shown below. they function overall using a certain strategy typology, whether that influences the relationship between their IT alignment maturity and their achievement of outcomes. The hypotheses presented at the outset of the investigation posited that there are relationships, an assertion that can now be revisited in light of the data analysis described above. This chapter provides a discussion of the results of the analysis and addresses the five research questions and hypotheses in this study. Conclusions are presented, limitations of the study are discussed, and suggestions are given for future research and practitioner considerations."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the SIMO Model", "text": "Returning to the study's overarching research question, \"How do NPOs adopt and use technology in ways that make a measurable difference in their achievement of outcomes\", this investigation brought to the field the understanding that the extent to which an NPO aligns technology tools and strategies with its mission-focused work has a positive relationship with its level of day-to-day performance, and that specific strategy This findings of this study do not prescribe particular technology tools or organizational behaviors that automatically lead to changes in outcomes, in other words, \"how to do it\". What the findings do describe are the types of strategies and the range of technology/mission alignment practices that influence day-to-day organizational performance which, as suggested by Wholey et al. (2010), if mission-focused, should lead to achievement of outcomes. The study found moderate to strong relationships between organizations' reported engagement in alignment practices (as described and measured by the SIMO model) and their levels of day-to-day organizational performance in terms of engaging stakeholders, maintaining sufficient capacity, implementing activities and delivering outputs at levels commensurate with their established organizational goals. This finding suggests that if an organization uses more mature alignment practices, it should achieve higher levels of day-to-day organizational performance, and the converse should also be true. This illustrates 'how' an organization could change specific technology/mission alignment practices, the factors, to make a measurable difference in their level of organizational performance. The study also identified specific strategy typologies that positively influence the relationship between technology/mission alignment and organizational performance. Strategy, defined simply by Miles and snow as the structures and processes an organization uses to do its work (1978), is another \"how\" in the SIMO model, one which influences the ways organizations choose to adopt and use technology and the results of those choices. Accordingly, the \"big question\" of the investigation serves as an appropriate umbrella for the research questions, which break down the SIMO model to identify the \"how\" relationships: adapted for use in the nonprofit sector, as well as new items comprising a new factor, organizational culture. derived from the nonprofit literature. The latent factors measured by SAMM, according to previous studies (Sledgianowski, 2004;, fulfill the first of this study's primary assumptions, of being valid and reliable, one of five assumptions presented on page 12. The variables measured with the survey loaded on the 7 factors, and the converged factors all had eigenvalues above the recommended cutoff of 1.0. However, while the IT/mission alignment maturity variables clustered according to criteria around separate factors and at least 2 variables loaded on each of the 7, some of them co-loaded on other factors, and not all factors within a cluster were within the lowest range of acceptable factor loading of .32, regarded as poor, by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007). Further, the criteria (factors) were found to be highly correlated with one another which was a divergence from the results of the PCA findings. This indicates that the items within each factor need to be further refined and analyzed to establish clearly uncorrelated criteria with which to measure IT/mission alignment maturity. These findings could be related to the incomplete data set, which was caused by a number of methodological issues that will be revisited in the limitations section. The incomplete data set challenges the fourth assumption upon which this study was based. This assumption, that nonprofit organization representatives participating in the study can accurately identify their organization's present level of IT alignment factors was not fulfilled, as only 89 respondents completed all 56 of the IT/mission alignment items. These findings indicate that further refinement and testing of the adapted questionnaire items is necessary, as well as a more effective data collection strategy. In addition to the IT/mission alignment maturity factors contained in the SIMO model, other variables were found to be related to each of the individual factors. Respondents' willingness to support their organization's efforts to align technology with its mission was found to be related to five of the seven IT/mission alignment maturity factors. The highest level of willingness a respondent could indicate was \"very supportive and willing to champion the effort\". A positive correlation between these items indicates that in organizations in which someone is willing to be, or already is a champion, IT/mission alignment maturity will be higher. This finding reinforces those of Cragg, King & Hussin (2002), Kearns & Lederer (2003), Luftman (2003) and Reich & Benbasat (2000), who noted that most often technology alignment efforts are initiated by a champion. Considering one IT/alignment factor in particular, architecture scope and infrastructure (SCOP), it was found to be related to several variables that are external to the model: the level of expertise of the respondent, the status of a technology manager, the size of an organization, the number of staff and the level of Internet access. This cluster of relationships around the SCOP variable reinforces the idea of a digital divide among NPOs, which is attested to by nonprofit practitioners, who describe a void in training, leadership in technology adoption and use, and funding for technology in the nonprofit sector (Hancock, 2013, Hill, 2013Liimatta, 2011), even a decade after Servon (2001) and Schneider (2003) brought the issue to light. In consideration of Hypothesis 1, \"Specific factors influence IT alignment maturity\" the hypothesis is supported by the model test statistics with the qualification that the exploratory model and instrument require additional refinement, and it is also supported by the correlation of factors external to the SIMO model, specifically the existence of a champion, or potential champion, and the persistence of the nonprofit digital divide."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Research Question 2", "text": "The second research question, \"Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their level of IT/mission alignment maturity?\" was addressed by asking respondents to identify the general strategy typology their organization uses from  four typologies. Nearly all respondents (n=214, 88%) were able to identify a specific strategy typology that guides their organization's work, which fulfills the third assumption upon which the study was based. The relationship between strategy typology and IT/mission alignment maturity was examined by seeking a Pearson's r for strategy typology and all other variables, and by running the PLS-PM assessment to test the SIMO model with all three model constructs serving as latent variables. When the strategy typology variable was correlated with all other variables in the model, no relationships were found. When the variable was correlated directly with the latent variable IT/mission alignment maturity, the path coefficient was -0.068, the correlation was -0.068, and it cross-loaded in a negative direction at levels ranging from -.090 to -.011 with all of the IT/mission alignment maturity manifest variables, which indicates there is no significant relationship between the two constructs. The way in which strategy typology was represented in the initial structural model did not facilitate loading, which is an issue that was foreshadowed by the \"exploded\" diagram of the SIMO model in Chapter 4. Because strategy typology as it is measured by the SIMO survey is not a construct composed of multiple manifest variables, rather it is a single variable that characterizes segments of the data set, the PLS-PM process cannot recognize its direct influence on the other latent variables. Other investigations have used a variety of combinations of scale items and typed paragraphs to characterize strategy typology, and in those cases PLS-PM was successful in estimating its relationship with other latent variables. However, the typed paragraph has been the predominant measure used, which is why it was selected for use in this investigation. While it did not appear in the initial SIMO model to influence other variables, when considered in light of the relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance, strategy typology did influence the relationship, as was proposed in the SIMO model. This will be discussed in more detail relative to Research Question #5. Considering Hypothesis 2, though, \"There is a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their level of IT alignment maturity,\" the data does not support a direct relationship between the two."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Research Question 3", "text": "The third research question, \"Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their achievement of performance outcomes?\" was also addressed by correlating all of the model variables and through PLS-PM assessment and testing of the SIMO model with all three constructs serving as latent variables. Again, when the strategy typology variable was correlated with all other variables, no relationships were found. When it was directly correlated with the latent variable organizational performance, the path coefficient was .012 the correlation between them was .0003, and when cross-loaded with the four organizational performance manifest variables, the values ranged from -.023 to -.003 which indicates there is not a significant relationship between the two constructs. Again, when the strategy typology variable was considered in light of the relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance, it did show evidence of influencing the relationship, findings of which will be reviewed in discussion of Research Question #5. Considering Hypothesis 3, \"There a relationship between nonprofit organizations' strategy typology and their achievement of performance outcomes,\" as was the case for Hypothesis 2, the data does not support a direct relationship between the two."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Research Question 4", "text": "The fourth research question, \"Is there a relationship between nonprofit organizations' levels of IT alignment maturity and their achievement of performance outcomes?\" was also addressed by the PLS-PM assessment and testing of the SIMO model with all three constructs serving as latent variables. When the IT/mission alignment maturity latent variable was correlated directly with the organizational performance latent variable, the path coefficient was .509, the correlation was .258, when cross-loaded with the four organizational performance manifest variables, the values for IT/mission alignment maturity ranged from .293 to .837, which indicates there is a relationship between the two constructs. When the four organizational performance manifest variables are examined more closely, it becomes evident that the two organizational structure variables (EXT D2Dx \u0305 and INF D2Dx \u0305 ), those which measure day-to-day performance toward organizational goals, have nearly twice as strong a relationship with IT/mission alignment maturity than the outcomes structure variables (EXT OUTx \u0305 and INF OUTx \u0305 ). This strongly suggests that organizations with higher levels of IT/mission alignment maturity are more efficient, cost effective, of higher quantity and/or quality, and achieve higher satisfaction relative to their stakeholder engagement, capacity, programs and outputs than those with lower levels of IT/mission alignment. This component of organizational performance is critical to maximize and measure, because it is the organizational structure of a nonprofit that creates the conditions and provides services that will influence the behaviors, attitudes, conditions, knowledge and status that the organization ultimately strives to change. In other words, organizational structure performance is a necessary precursor to outcome performance. The PLS-PM analysis also suggests that outcome structure is influenced by IT/mission alignment but its weight is half as much as organizational structure in the model. This finding, along with the consideration that day-to-day performance prefaces outcome achievement raises concern that IT/mission alignment may not be directly related to outcomes, rather, it could be a position removed from outcomes in the PLS path model, thus suggesting that the model may need to be reconfigured. However, the model may be sound, but the incomplete data set may have influenced the weighting of the performance variables. This is quite possible, because, as was discussed in Chapter 3, many nonprofits stop measuring performance at the organizational structure level. This assertion was supported by this investigation, as 94% of respondents reported that they measure day-to-day performance, but only 55% reported measuring outcomes. This finding challenges the fifth assumption upon which the investigation was based -that nonprofit organizations involved in the study have and can articulate results of a process for measuring organizational performance. Most do, but the process is incomplete. This is not unusual, and it is a problem that persists sector-wide, according to MacIndoe and Barman (2013), who suggest that measurement of outcomes is influenced by external actors that require use of outcome measurement, internal actors that control allocation of resources for outcome measurement and organizational networks that establish norms of governance, one of which is the practice of performance measurement. These influencing factors share similarities with some of the factors that influence IT/mission alignment, a similarity that will be addressed in recommendations for the field. These factors were beyond the scope of the present investigation, but they are important to the understanding of the SIMO model. Accordingly, the insight from MacIndoe and Barman suggests that the second assumption of the study, that the factors investigated in the study are not the only ones that influence each other, but they may increase understanding of the relationships between them, is true. There is more to the understanding of strategy, IT/mission alignment and organizational performance than what is represented by SIMO. Taking these findings into account when considering Hypothesis 4, \"There is a relationship between nonprofit organizations' levels of IT alignment maturity and their achievement of performance outcomes,\" the hypothesis is supported, but the relationship remains unclear and requires further investigation with a complete data set collected from a sample that fulfills the assumption of having articulated and implemented a process for measuring day-to-day organizational performance and achievement of outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of Research Question 5", "text": "The fifth and last research question, \"Given a specific strategy typology, what is the relationship between IT alignment maturity and performance outcomes?\" was addressed by a series of PLS-PM assessments run with IT/mission alignment maturity and performance outcomes serving as latent variables and each of the four strategy typologies serving in turn as a constant in the model. An examination of the path coefficients, R 2 statistics and the weights of manifest variables demonstrated in the relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance for each one of the strategy types illuminates noteworthy findings. This comparison can be found in Table 19  outcomes\" the hypothesis is supported by the data."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The conclusions that emerged through this investigation focus on three things that matter: balance, intention and relationships. First, balance matters. This investigation began by identifying and describing a challenge that many nonprofits face -balancing the important work they do with efforts to incorporate technology in ways that truly add value to that work. The SIMO model reinforces the idea that balance, particularly the ways in which nonprofits balance their efforts to improve communication, measure competence and value, govern, create and maintain partnerships, establish an appropriate scope of technology, build and maintain technology skills, and create a culture that welcomes the value of technology, is something that can be achieved. The influence of the seven individual it/mission alignment criteria factors on the SIMO model, particularly how they impact the path coefficients between it/mission alignment and organizational performance, demonstrate that when organizations focus on increasing their maturity in each one of the criteria, their overall alignment will increase and, tentatively, their organizational performance will increase. It was found that Defenders tend to achieve this balance best, followed by Prospectors, Analyzers, then Reactors. Accordingly, the SIMO model suggests to NPOs that considering, and possibly modifying, their strategy typology is important; and using specific alignment practices to integrate technology into that strategy is important to maximizing organizational performance. particularly small ones, do not have the luxury of ample staff or discretionary time to dedicate to planning. This lack of time was apparent in just the difficulty organizations had in completing the SIMO survey according to phone calls and e-mails received in response to the invitation to participate (which also reinforces the assertion made by Salipante and Aram (2003) that NPOs tend to not invest time and talent in building and testing theory, rather they focus on solving problems for those they serve). This investigation clearly illuminates the need to help nonprofits find ways to balance their time, their most valuable resource. The issue of balance also emerged as consideration was made of the relationships between the SIMO model and external organizational variables of size, number of staff, level of expertise, and Internet access that illustrated the persistence of the nonprofit digital divide. Logically, larger organizations with bigger budgets have more and more sophisticated technology, larger numbers of employees, and the ability to invest in highly skilled staff. Even with 'free' social media, cloud-based apps, donated hardware and software and a goldmine of online learning resources, a sample of which was shared with survey respondents in their Custom Technology Report, the nonprofit digital divide will continue to exist for nonprofits who cannot afford to employ dedicated technology staff or engage enough workers so that a bit of decision-makers' time can be freed up for strategic technology planning and the schedules of managers and direct-service staff include ample time for technology training, collaboration and innovation. Balance in this respect must be considered by the external stakeholders who support the work of nonprofits -how can funders, networks, and communities balance their support for these needs while still contributing directly to maximizing social values? Technology/mission alignment answers this question by providing guidance to nonprofits in how to integrate these needs as priorities into their mission-focused strategic plans, capacity-building efforts and related funding requests, which will educate funders on the critical nature of these needs. Second, intentions matter. Nonprofit organizations do the work that they do because of their mission -their intention to maximize social values. In order to use technology to maximize action toward an organization's mission, the organization has to approach technology with the intention to use it to maximize social values and assess whether it has, in fact, achieved what it set out to do. Based on the different levels of influence IT/mission alignment maturity had on organizational performance variables, it appears as though NPOs intend to adopt and use technology in ways that align with their day-to-day performance goals, and to a much lesser extent, to mission-focused outcomes. This may not, in fact, be the case. Instead, as was suggested by Carman (2009), LeRoux and Wright (2010), Morley et al. (2001) and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (2004), it is easier and faster to measure organizational structure performance than it is to measure outcomes, so unless nonprofits are forced to measure outcomes as a requirement of external funding, they probably don't measure them, but they may still strive to achieve them. If, however, NPOs wish to go beyond determining whether their day-to-day work is efficient, cost-effective, of sufficient quality and quantity and satisfactory to stakeholders to answer the question, \"Are we making a difference in the lives and communities we serve\" and determine whether technology is helping make that difference, they must operate with the intention of measuring that difference. This intention is should essentially mirror that of the business sector, which measures the outcomes it intends to achieve --ROI, shareholder value, and profit. While the metrics used to measure outcomes in the nonprofit sector are different from those in the for-profit sector, the intention, to maximize the intended value for constituents, must be the same if nonprofits wish to truly make an impact. IT/mission alignment is not something that one person, the \"tech guy/gal\", can do, although having a champion to spearhead the effort facilitates the process is a finding that was reinforced by this investigation. A champion who is supportive and willing to begin the IT/mission alignment conversation must be met by an organization that is willing to host the conversation and put words into action. IT/mission alignment practices that lead to higher levels of maturity provide guidance in how to become such an organization."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Delimitations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The most substantial limitation to this investigation lies in the data, or more accurately, lack of complete data. The missing values analysis illuminated several issues, one related to the character of the target population -very busy people, many who are volunteers, who do not have 45 minutes to spare to take a survey -as well as several related to the design of the study, all of which impacted the number of respondents who completed the survey. While the response rate for what ended up being essentially a coldcall invitation was comparable to other surveys was acceptable (14.3%), the completion rate was dismal, as only 2% of surveys returned were fully completed. Design issues kept this investigation from achieving its full potential, although the best of intentions framed the methodology. The first was creating a comprehensive survey that would have practical value. The survey proved to be too long and resulted in response fatigue and a high level of missing data. The second was the desire to maintain the wording and structure of as many SAMM survey items as possible with the hope that established validity and reliability would be maintained. Even with adaptations, several items were foreign to respondents, which led to increased nonresponse bias. The third was having confidence that gatekeepers would assist with promotion of the investigation because it would add value to the work of their local nonprofits. It was discovered that promotion of outside projects is beyond the scope of Community Foundations' relationship with grantees, and some felt it was a higher priority to protect their grantees from outside projects that would take them away from focusing on their mission. The fourth was having confidence that the instructions on the survey would facilitate the process of getting it routed to the most appropriate person. In many cases, the first person who saw it took it, or they threw it away. Less than half of respondents were the person most responsible for making decisions about technology, and many who took the survey did not have the knowledge necessary to complete all the items. These design items led to a low response rate and a very low completion rate. Once the survey data was received, and the missing data issue was discovered, a primary concern was whether the data would be usable. Strategies were identified that would allow it to be used, but the missing data concern persisted throughout the investigation. A primary concern was whether the missing data solution would return appropriate results. This was compounded by a lack of formal tests of significance for PLS-PM (Vinzi, Trinchera & Amato, 2010, p. 56). Bootstrapping, or running generated data through the model 100 or more times, then comparing the bootstrap estimate to the Goodness of Fit statistic, as well as running the PLSPM again with bootstrapping once the model is established and assessing the degree of multicollinearity among essential indicators were recommended in the literature as primary means to assess significance (Addinsoft, 2013, Howell, 2006, Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin & Lauro, 2005 , Microsoft Corporation, 2010, NPower, 2011 who were the first to adapt the business sector concept of IT alignment (Luftman, 2000;Sledgianowski, 2004; to the nonprofit sector. The SIMO model facilitates sector-specific theory building by proposing a model of the relationships among strategy typology, IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance that accounts for the unique character of nonprofit organizations. Second, the primary challenge in translating the IT alignment concept to the nonprofit sector has been the paucity of metrics that can consistently measure and compare performance across the wide array of activities, outputs and outcomes produced by nonprofit organizations (Ebrahim and Rangin, 2010;). The SIMO model presents a set of metrics based on the structure of a logic model (McLaughlin& Jordan, 2010;Wholey, 1979) that measures the extent of performance in each element of the logic model in terms of standardized percentages on an interval scale. This process results in performance data that can be compared across all types of nonprofit organizations. Third, the SIMO model reinforces the applicability of  strategy typology model outside of the business sector and presents a new iteration of the self-typing paragraph for use in the nonprofit sector. The self-typing paragraph had been used in isolation in the banking industry (James & Hatton, 1995) and it was modified for use in the nonprofit sector, where  reported that their iteration could use modification in order to find better fit within the nonprofit sector. The strategy typology model, operationalized as a combination of self-typing paragraph and strategy behavior scales, was combined by Croteau and Bergeron (2001)  Fourth, this investigation illuminates the need for the sector to continue encouraging a shift in the focus of nonprofit performance measurement from measuring outputs to determining the extent to which organizations are maximizing the social values targeted by their missions and the extent to which their work is contributing to sustained changes in the individuals and communities they serve. The SIMO model was able to identify a relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance, but for 45% of respondents, performance measurement stopped at outputs. The literature chronicles the persistence of this challenge over the past several decades, a challenge which MacIndoe and Barman (2013) attribute to the influence of stakeholders on the practice of outcome measurement. In their investigation, they were able to find a sample in which 71% of the organizations (n=279) report use of outcome measurement, which is the highest percentage this investigator has seen to date. The model in which they characterize implementation of outcome measurement should be considered in future investigation of this practice in NPOs. Fifth, the outcomes of the methodological approach to sampling and data collection used in this investigation warrant special discussion. When working in the nonprofit sector, careful consideration must be made of the existing relationships during the research design and implementation process. The relationship between grantor and grantee is a sensitive one. Unwritten, yet clearly understood boundaries exist around the requests grantors make of grantees. In this particular study, several Community Foundations, as well as the Lilly Endowment, were not willing to endorse the study or invite their grantees to participate because they did not want the grantees to a) feel obligated to do so just because a funder asked them to and b) take time away from the work they had committed to do through the grant agreement they had with the Foundation(s). The perspective of an investigator, of wanting to create new knowledge and help the field, may be valued by the agencies being asked to be participate, but it may not be as high of a priority as the perspectives, agreements and relationships they are committed to preserving in the long term. Stephen Covey's Fifth Habit of Highly Effective People, \"Seek first to understand, then to be understood\" (1989, p. 236) is a succinct guide for anyone pursuing field research in the nonprofit sector. For practitioners, the study also has practical implications. First, a new theoretical model now supports the practice of technology/mission alignment, and practitioners played a significant role in creating and testing the model. When invited to participate, organizational representatives who did feel they had the time were excited to learn more about how to align technology with their mission and looked forward to receiving the report of their results. Nonprofit practitioners invest time in activities that are immediately useful, a sentiment that was shared earlier. While the theory behind the model may not be of value in day-to-day work in communities, the establishment of the SIMO model is a first step in creating a useful model practitioners can use to assess their strategy typology and IT/mission alignment, then learn how to make changes in those two organizational elements in order to change their level of organizational performance. Future work in this area will focus on refining the instrument and data collection methodologies so that a strong data set can be used to validate the model before it is translated into a practitioner tool. Second, within the model and within nonprofit organizations, strategy typology is a big deal. Clear differences were found between the IT/mission alignment patterns of each of the typologies, and clear differences were found among the path coefficients between IT/mission alignment and organizational performance. If a nonprofit organization knows its strategy typology and finds that the strategy doesn't seem to be \"working\" in terms of performance, merely knowing that other strategy typologies exist is an insight that can be used to inform organizational learning and change. Third, if an organization wants to increase its IT/mission alignment maturity, its first step is to find a champion. If a champion exists, the organization's charge is to make sure the champion is heard and supported, and that the team she enlists to assist is provided with the time and resources necessary to plan, lead, and measure the results of the initiative. As the initiative rolls out, the organization is obligated to make sure everyone is 'in the loop' and provided with the opportunity to learn and use the skills necessary to help the process succeed. As IT/mission alignment proceeds, the organization must remember that alignment is an iterative process that has the potential to continually improve the performance of the organization. Fourth, nonprofit board members, who were identified in the SIMO model as having influence on competency and value measurement, may be the spark to light the outcome evaluation flame in organizations. MacIndoe and Barman (2013) suggest that internal actors control the allocation of resources for outcome measurement. If internal actors feel it is a priority, they will find a means to support it. Accordingly, while nonprofit executive directors may already understand the critical nature of outcome measurement, they often do not have the budget discretion to allocate resources toward its implementation, whereas their boards may not be as savvy, but if they understood the process of getting to outcomes, they could make it a priority. Therefore educating boards on the process of getting to outcomes may help organizations actually get there. Fifth, while optimism pervades the above discussion of the potential of the SIMO model to help organizations align technology in ways that will help them meet their mission, the study also shows us that the digital divide persists in the nonprofit sector, even with the tremendous strides that have been made in making technology tools and infrastructure widely available. Considering the factors contained in the IT/mission alignment maturity portion of the SIMO model, nonprofits do have the opportunity to reduce this divide, even if they aren't the biggest organization on the block. The sector has a plethora of avenues through which to pursue low-and no-cost technology tools, training and solutions, but, again, simply installing apps and using the cloud will not close the chasm --the missing resource is time. "}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "The SIMO investigation also suggests several avenues of future research, both to strengthen the model and investigate issues related to its constructs. In order to strengthen the reliability and validity of the SIMO survey, effort needs to be invested in further refining the IT/mission alignment maturity survey items so that the variables will load more distinctly on the 7 factors. While Goodness of Fit (GoF) is often cited as sole support for theoretical models, and a high level of GoF was established between the data and the SIMO model, in this case, nonresponse, particularly 'don't know' responses and attrition, provided evidence that the questionnaire needs further refinement and testing. The correlations identified between all of the IT/mission alignment factors are a concern, particularly because the same correlations were not evident in the principal component analysis, which indicated the use of orthographic rotation. Future use of the SIMO survey should only take place after each of the individual items is examined in light of the present data, revised if necessary, piloted, subjected to a variety of validity tests and both principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, then re-piloted with a wider variety of nonprofit organizations, all of which are recommendations made by Ritchie and Sherlock (2009) in their guidance on adapting surveys to the nonprofit sector. This refining process is critical to increasing the structure and definition of the model so that when it is ready for practical use, it truly is useful in separating the effects of the different factors so that practitioners can address them according to their priorities. Also related to methodology, cross-sectional survey research is a common approach to gathering information about IT/mission alignment and strategy typology. Certainly replicating well-documented methodologies is sound practice, but survey methodology, particularly the use of online surveys, appears to have become a go-to strategy for collecting information in the nonprofit sector, as well as in the rest of the The approach my informal poll participants choose to take in response to survey requests is to complete one or two quick surveys so they can feel good about contributing to the field, then they delete or ignore the rest. Or, with the best of intentions they start a survey or several and get pulled away, never to complete them. Even if the purpose of the survey is compelling and can help them add value to their work, they just don't have time to do them all. These may be very common responses to surveys, which would contribute substantially to the ongoing methodological challenge of achieving sufficient response and completion rates. Survey overload does not appear to have been addressed at any length in the nonprofit literature to date, as evidenced by only 7 mentions in the past 10 years in a leading academic journal and five hits in a university academic search engine, but it is an issue that scholars must contend with as they consider data collection strategies. Alternatives to 'sending out a survey' to a broad target population may include collaborating with agencies that may already possess similar data, hosting focus groups in conjunction with nonprofit events or, if a survey is necessary, distilling the target audience or pursuing alternate data collection venues such as during break times at practitioner conferences, away from already-full email boxes. Each data-collection scenario is unique. We must work, above all, to respect the time and obligations of our target populations, then determine the best way to gather the most complete, reliable and valid data we can. I challenge the field to help find the balance between survey overload and the methodological rigor necessary to bring new knowledge to the field. An example of an alternative approach is shared below. The missing values analysis highlighted several items that had high nonresponse rates, which is where refining should start. It was made clear by respondents that the survey itself was too long. Perhaps a better approach to achieving a complete data set would be to personally invite organizations randomly selected from the grantee lists to complete the survey, either by phone or face-to-face, and deliver the survey in phases, possibly once per month, to reduce the one-time cost of participation, which is a strategy Croteau and Bergeron (2001) used to garner complete responses. If the survey length is maintained, then it is critical to increase efforts to provide incentives for completion as suggested by Dillman et al. (2009). This would enable the investigator to monitor completion and follow up with individuals with whom working relationships would already be established. The relationships, plus the shorter sections would be more apt to fit into a nonprofit executive's busy schedule. The resource constraints of a personal approach would limit the number of participants, which would limit generalizability of the findings and render PCA and PLS-PM inappropriate due to small sampling size. Splitting the survey delivery into three components would also insert the possibility of attrition, which could lead to missing data. However, advantages to pursuing this alternate approach in future research would include increasing the likelihood of response and increasing the likelihood of relationships built and preserved between the investigator and participating nonprofits. The challenge of enlisting gatekeepers in the process is one that could be addressed, also, to generate authoritative support for the investigative effort. This particular recommendation leads to consideration of how the exploration of SIMO and its components can continue in the future. The primary relationship identified in this investigation relates to the influence of strategy typology on the relationship between IT/mission alignment maturity and organizational performance. This relationship raises a number of questions that can guide future investigations, such as how do nonprofit organizations choose their strategy? Is there a way that choosing and using an effective strategy typology could be facilitated by gatekeepers, namely Community Foundations who provide and support a variety of training and technical assistance to their grantees. Is this already being done, and is it helping NPOs achieve their mission? Strategy typology has not been widely investigated in the nonprofit sector; however it may have substantial value to the field in both its simplicity and its influence on performance. Accordingly further study is recommended. Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations,22(3), 470-493. doi:10.1007470-493. doi:10. /s11266-011-9183-7. Covey, S. (1989.

This consent document will explain the purpose of this research project and will go over all of the time commitments, the procedures used in the study, and the risks and benefits of participating in this research project. In this study, we are trying to find out if there are relationships in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) between the strategic and organizational factors that enable and inhibit IT alignment, which is the level at which an organization uses technology strategies and tools in ways that helps it meet its mission and goals. You may participate in this study if you are the person who has primary responsibility for making technology decisions in your organization. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a grantee of one of 45 Indiana Community Foundations randomly selected for inclusion in the study. If you are not the person in charge of technology for your organization, please forward this e-mail invitation to the individual in your coalition who meets this criterion. This study will involve completing an 87-item paper survey you received via U.S. Mail and sending it back to the Project Director via U.S. Mail. It should take you about 45 minutes to complete the survey, which is all that is required to participate in the study. If you choose to participate in this study after reading this document, you should access the survey by simply turning to the first page of survey questions and completing all of the questions in writing, using either pen or pencil. By completing the survey and sending it back to the Project Director via U.S. Mail, you will signify that you have read and understood this Informed Consent document. This study will measure four types of things: the type of strategies that are typically used by your organization, the level at which your organization demonstrates activities and strategies that lead to IT Alignment, the extent to which your organization achieves performance outcomes, and professional information about you and your organization. Because the survey questions will address your perceptions of your organization, you may feel uncomfortable that a Community Foundation or other nonprofit stakeholders will read the survey results and view your perceptions negatively. To alleviate this concern, all survey responses will be collected, stored and analyzed confidentially by the primary investigator. No one other than the investigator, Survey Monkey, and the individual who takes the survey will have access to identifiable information. People who participate in this study will help nonprofit organizations understand what it means to align technology with their mission, they will help nonprofit technical assistance groups provide better training and technical assistance, and they will help their organizations maximize its planning and use of technology to meet its mission. There are no costs associated with participating in this study. There is no monetary compensation for participating in this study. When you do complete the survey, you will be provided with a Custom Technology Alignment Maturity Report and Technology Strategy Guide that you can use to continue your efforts to align technology with your mission. The principle investigator and Survey Monkey administrators will have access to the list of individuals invited to participate in the study and collected individual survey response data. While reasonable and appropriate safeguards have been used in the creation of the web-based survey to maximize the confidentiality and security of your responses, when using information technology, it is never possible to guarantee complete privacy. Survey Monkey's privacy statement states \"we will not use the information collected from surveys in any way, shape or form.\" Survey Monkey will keep electronic data stored on servers kept in a locked cage requiring biometric recognition for entry, maintain surveillance equipment on the server site and staff the site 24/7. The Survey Monkey Security Policy can be reviewed at this link: http://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/security/. Paper copies and a USB drive of all data will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the School of Public Affairs & Administration Office at Western Michigan University for 3 years following the completion of this study. The public will have access to a combined data set of anonymous survey responses, which will be the only form of data that will be used to report findings beyond the provision of your Custom Technology Alignment Maturity report. If any of the information collected is submitted for use in a publication or presentation, you will be able to review the data set and comment before it is submitted. Your name, e-mail address and organization will not be connected to any publications or presentations made by the research team. You can choose to stop participating in the study at any time for any reason by simply discarding the paper copy of this survey. You will not suffer any prejudice or penalty by your decision to stop your participation. You will experience NO consequences either professionally or personally if you choose to withdraw from this study. The investigators can also decide to stop your participation in the study without your consent.  The first 9 survey items collect information about your organization. Please choose responses that most closely describe your organization and its use of technology. When asked for narrative responses, please be as detailed as possible. There is no one correct answer for any item. All responses will be kept confidential."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "3.

This consent document will explain the purpose of this research project and will go over all of the time commitments, the procedures used in the study, and the risks and benefits of participating in this research project. In this study, we are trying to find out if there are relationships in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) between the strategic and organizational factors that enable and inhibit IT alignment, which is the level at which an organization uses technology strategies and tools in ways that helps it meet its mission and goals. You may participate in this study if you are the person who has primary responsibility for making technology decisions in your organization. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a grantee of one of 45 Indiana Community Foundations randomly selected for inclusion in the study. If you are not the person in charge of technology for your organization, please forward this e-mail invitation to the individual in your coalition who meets this criterion. This study will take place entirely online, where you will complete a 86-item Survey Monkey survey.

You should use the buttons, keyboard and navigation tools on the page to complete the survey, then click NEXT at the end of the survey to submit your responses. You will be asked to close your browser after completing the survey. This study will measure four types of things: the type of strategies that are typically used by your organization, the level at which your organization demonstrates activities and strategies that lead to IT Alignment, the extent to which your organization achieves performance outcomes, and professional information about you and your organization. Because the survey questions will address your perceptions of your organization, you may feel uncomfortable that the Community Foundation or other nonprofit stakeholders will read the survey results and view your perceptions negatively. To alleviate this concern, all survey responses will be collected, stored and analyzed confidentially by the primary investigator.

So that you know a bit about me, I have lived and worked throughout Indiana as an executive director, grant writer, program director, volunteer, evaluator, and outside consultant for the past two decades. Being in the sector as a fellow practitioner, I know your time is valuable, and I truly appreciate your willingness to invest in this project. Thank you in advance for your help, which will help our entire sector learn and grow. I am writing to share an exciting opportunity with you, one in which you can learn more about how to align technology with your work in ways that will help you meet your organizational mission. This opportunity comes in the form of a study being done by a researcher from the School of Public Affairs and Administration at Western Michigan University. The investigator, Kelly Trusty, is part of our Indiana nonprofit community -she has lived and served in West Central and Northeast Indiana for nearly 20 years. As you help the nonprofit sector understand technology/mission alignment with your responses to a Survey Monkey survey, you will also receive a valuable benefit. Once you complete the survey, you will be sent a customized report of the level at which your organization's technology is aligned with its mission, as well as a resource guide of strategies that can help you use technology even more effectively than you already do. There are no strings attached. Your participation is completely voluntary. I think all of us in the nonprofit sector struggle with the balance between doing our important work in communities and finding ways to make technology work for us. This project is valuable to us because it can help organizations get better at doing both: using technology and meeting our mission. In a few days, you will be receiving an email invitation from Kelly Trusty to take the survey. I hope you will find time in your busy schedule to help the nonprofit sector grow in its ability to harness the power of technology.

While the model took shape as I worked toward my Ph.D. in Public Administra on, its essence has been building for the twenty years I have been working in and with nonpro t organiza ons. As the director of a grassroots coali on, I was asked by funders and community stakeholders, and I asked myself constantly, \"How do we know if we are making a di erence?\" All shapes and sizes of organiza ons I've consulted with since then hear that very same ques on as I help them create strategic plans and programs to meet community needs. By learning about outcome driven pro gramming, we've all found that we can answer con dently if we begin with the end in mind-the posi ve changes we hope will manifest in the individuals, families, and communi es we serve. In other words, we are likely to make a di erence if we start and end with our mission. Twenty years is a long me, long enough to experience the transi on from pen and paper tallies of a endance to scanning par cipants' bar codes; from folding hundreds of newsle ers to reach ing thousands instantly with e mails, blogs and tweets. During the past two decades, I have been involved in many conversa ons about how hard it is for nonpro t groups to keep up with technology. The cost, the learning curve and the distrac on are challenges, but the challenges are balanced by the poten al to reach greater numbers of folks, with more informa on, in real me, while saving tremendous e ort that sta and volunteers can focus elsewhere. Each of these ponderables points directly back to the ques on asked above, with a technology twist: Does technology really help us achieve our mission? How do we know? This is the ques on that fuels the SIMO inves ga on. Intui vely, we might all answer, \"Well, of course it does!\" However, un l now no one has looked at the SIMO rela onships really closely to nd key informa on that can help nonpro t organiza ons align technology with their overall strategy and their mission in order to achieve greater outcomes. That's what I am looking for, that key informa on, so I can share it with you and your colleagues so that you can do your good work, be er.

Un l now, no method existed to determine whether NPOs align technology with their missions and, if so, whether alignment e orts results in the achievement of greater outcomes and bene ts to the organiza ons themselves, their cons tuents, and the communi es they serve.

Of those invited, 244 (14.3%) responded to the invita on. The organiza ons serve primarily metropolitan areas (63%), with 25% serving non metro areas and 12% serving rural areas. The organiza ons pursue a variety of missions, most of which meet human service needs (43%), followed by educa on (21%), public and social bene t (12%) and arts, culture and humani es (11%). A majority of the organiza ons (77%) have 20 or fewer employees; most (82%) have 20 or few er board members, and 52% engage at least 21 volunteers. Over half are considered \"small nonpro ts\" with annual budgets of less than $500K (54%), and a majority spend 3% or less of their annual budget on technology (81%). Most (78%) have Internet access of DSL level or greater. Of all of the organiza onal representa ves that responded, 48% could be considered the \"leader\" of the organiza on, while the remainder are other administrators and program sta . Just over half of respondents have been involved with their organiza ons for 6 years or longer, and just under half have been involved for ve years or less. Most characterize their level of technology exper se and experience as \"experienced and skilled\" (52%), while 21% say they have experience, but not much skill, and 9% are very experienced and skilled or experts."}, {"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (cont.)", "text": "About the Survey Par cipants (cont.) When asked about the overall strategy type their organiza on generally uses to plan and make decisions, a majority reported using either Prospector or Analyzer strategies. Prospectors, 36% of respondents, look for ways to solve emerging needs and be the rst on the block to implement new programs or ac vi es. Analyzers, 37% of respondents, have a stable strategic environment. They are conserva ve in their approach to seeking out and solving new problems. They use environmental scanning to iden fy needs and struc tured planning to determine their approach to them. Defenders, reported as the predominant strategy type by 22% of respondents, focus on improving e ciency in their exis ng domain-they focus on strengthening their exis ng programs. Reactors, 5% of respondents, tend to respond in a disorganized way to outside pressures rather than proac vely adap ng to their environment. They seem to always be \"pu ng out res\" rather than planning ahead."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings", "text": "In more than half of the organiza ons (61%), there is not a paid sta member whose job it is to make decisions about or manage technology, and of those organiza ons that have a paid sta member in that role, only 24% of those sta members focus solely on managing technology. Further, of 25% of responding organiza ons, no one is in charge of technology. According to the Technology/Mission Alignment Maturity scales, altogether respondents rated their overall Technology/Mission Alignment Maturity at 2.66 on a 5 point scale. When asked to es mate their level of Technology/Mission Alignment Maturity, average respondent ra ng was 2.88, which suggests that organiza ons feel they are slightly more mature in their level of Technology/Mission alignment prac ces than they actually are. Overall, the respondent organiza ons' most mature Technology/Mission alignment criteri on is Organiza onal Culture and their least mature area of Technology/Mission alignment prac ce is Governance E ec veness. This chart shows average Technology/Mission alignment maturity scores for all respondents: When considering day to day organiza onal performance rela ve to stakeholder engagement, capacity, ac vi es and outputs, respondents as a group rated performance above average (2.98 on a 4 point scale). When considering their organiza onal performance rela ve to their achievement of outcomes, in other words, how they impact their clients and communi es, respondents as a group rated their performance at slightly above average (4.33 on a 1 6 scale). Respondents as a group tend to measure their day to day organiza onal performance (94%), but just over half of respondents (55%) measure their outcomes, or posi ve, sustained changes they have contributed to in their target popula on. Overall, respondents feel the use of technology has a great deal of in uence on their day to day organiza onal performance (rated 4.08 on a 5 point scale), but its in uence on the achievement of outcomes was rated considerably lower (2.46). This nding suggests that while technology is useful in ge ng work done, it isn't perceived as something that contributes to long term change. According to the SIMO model as it was tested with es mated data, strategy typology in uences the rela onship between technology/mission alignment and organiza onal outcomes in di er ent ways, depending on the speci c strategy typology an organiza on generally uses. Defenders, Prospectors and Analyzers tend to balance their e orts between technology/mission alignment prac ces, while Reactors tend to focus on just a few of the seven. Again, using es mated data to test the SIMO model, organiza onal culture maturity appears to be one area of technology/mission alignment maturity that is common to all strategy typologies in terms of the weight of its in uence on organiza onal performance.  4 , who describe four dis nct types of strategic behaviors that are exhibited in most organiza ons when they respond to needs and problems. These behaviors occur in a cycle of adapta ons that is dependent upon structures and processes that exist within the organiza on. The con gura on of sta , board and volunteers, the organiza onal hierarchy (i.e. chain of command), the formality of policies and procedures, and the way decisions are made are all structures and processes that in uence an organiza on's strategic ac ons. More simply,"}, {"section_title": "structure + process = strategy", "text": "The strategic ac ons translate to stable pa erns of behavior over me, thus becoming part of an organiza on's character. The choice to align technology with an organiza on's mission is an example of a strategic ac on, and how the organiza on goes about the alignment process o en demonstrates its strategy typology. For example, a community arts organiza on may have been the rst to align a few technology tools with their mission, such as using online fundraising for a mission focused program or crea ng and maintaining a facebook page so it can communicate more e ciently with volun teers and patrons. In order to use those processes, the organiza on would need to have a decision making structure, i.e. a commi ee comprised of a board member, the execu ve director, the program manager and the volunteer that manages all the technology, that supports this type of innova on and can create and implement a strategic plan to make those things happen. An organiza on like this would likely be classi ed as having a \"prospector\" strategy typology, provided these are the kinds of structures and processes it uses regularly . The four strategy types are described on the next page as they have been demonstrated in nonpro t organiza ons 5 . As you read the descrip ons and compare them to your reported strategy typology, ask yourself, \"Is our strategy typology helping us achieve mission focused outcomes?\" The answer to this ques on may become clear when you examine your SIMO Pro le on page 35."}, {"section_title": "Defender Prospector", "text": "Analyzer Reactor 7 YOUR STRATEGY TYPOLOGY (cont.) Defenders have a narrow focus, a set service area, or they serve a speci c client or need. They are the experts in their sector and generally do not seek out new problems to solve or partners with which to collaborate. They o en have formal policies and procedures to guide their work. Their approach to decision making is generally stable, fueled by sta ideas and approved and monitored by the board. Strategy choices focus on increasing e ciency and e ec veness of the services they provide and, to a limited extent, pursuing innova ons that will help improve service delivery. Defenders can be characterized as either the go to organiza on for best prac ces if their services result in consistent, reliable, high quality, mission focused outcomes, or they might be the 'old dog' in a community that does what has always been done with li le regard for envi ronmental pressures or changes. Defenders view their mission as a strict boundary for service provision. Prospectors are always looking for new ways to meet emerging needs. Accordingly, they are always in search of the latest technology and processes to create novel solu ons. Prospectors are risk takers and o en give up e ciency and overall superiority in exchange for their posi on as rst on the block. They con nually scan the community for opportuni es to serve and respond quickly to funding and program development opportuni es. These organiza ons invest resources and establish extensive partnerships to create, test, and o er new approaches. Board members, sta and volunteers are dynamic in their roles, champions and innovators are celebrated, com mi ees are ac ve, and service areas, policies and procedures are rede ned as needed to meet emerging needs. Prospectors consider their mission a 'jumping o point' from which they should innovate and expand to meet a variety of needs. Analyzers exist in two domains: one that is stable and requires rou ne processes, formalized structures, and e cient technology; and one that readily adapts to changes in the community. The stable base o en consists of a well developed, yet dynamic strategic plan, which provides fuel for controlled innova on. Analyzers engage in ongoing needs assessment to keep their n ger on the pulse of their community of stakeholders. When they nd opportuni es to solve new problems, they do so with conserva ve, yet progressive technology, structure and process choic es. Sta and volunteers are o en specialized, and decisions are data driven. Analyzers use their mission to drive a set of limited, stable services yet they remain open to promising prac ces that might enable them to be er meet community needs . Reactors do not tend to maintain a speci c niche or present innova ve approaches. Rather, these organiza ons respond to environmental demands by looking at what other organiza ons are doing, lling gaps and elimina ng duplica ve services. Environmental pressures tend to force disorganized choices in terms of who to serve, what to provide, what tools to use, and how to structure and process the work. Conserving resources and avoiding risk are o en the focus, and the mission is exible enough to adapt to a variety of needs and opportuni es. Technology/mission alignment is characterized by ve levels 1 . The levels are not places where an organiza on lands and stays. Rather, an organiza on's current technology/mission align ment level provides insight into areas in which technology already enables the organiza on to be er meet its mission, and areas in which it can improve internal processes, its management and use of technology, and, consequently, achievement of its mission."}, {"section_title": "Level 1-Chao c:", "text": "Organiza ons at Level 1 typically do not have a technology plan, use and management of technology is unpredictable, tech tools are used for simple, back room func ons, there is no tech support available, and funding is limited or nonexistent."}, {"section_title": "Level 2-Reac ve:", "text": "Organiza ons at Level 2 are essen ally in re gh ng mode.

SAMM has six criteria; the seventh criteria was added to SAMM and a number of terms were adapted in considera on of the character of the nonpro t sector in order to create SIMO. The premise of both models is that if an organiza on does not demonstrate one of the ac ons or demon strates it at a low level, then the maturity level of that criterion goes down. If the organiza on demonstrates or uses that ac on or process at a high level, the maturity level of that criterion goes up. These are the criteria: Communica on e ec veness-Ac ons that help leaders and sta e ec vely exchange ideas and share a clear understanding of what it takes to ensure that everyone is focused on mee ng the mission and using technology in ways that align with the mission. Measuring the competency and value of technology-Data collec on and evalua on pro cesses that create a balanced view of the value of technology in terms of its contribu on to the organiza on's mission, and strategies for using rewards and penal es for achieving or missing objec ves.

Technology can help engage stakeholders, build organiza onal capacity, create and deliver ac vi es, and increase outputs, as you may have read about in the many resources listed in the SIMO Toolboxes presented in this report. These measures are important because they tell organiza ons whether their day to day work is engaging the people in their communi es and helping them move in a posi ve direc on, one that aligns with organiza ons' missions. The measures don't, however, let an organiza on know wheth er the people and communi es being served have actually experienced sustained bene t or posi ve change. Outcomes, again de ned by Penna 7 , are the direct, intended bene ts or posi ve changes an organiza on's e orts have on the stakeholders its programs and other ac vi es serve, changes that make a signi cant, measurable di erence in a situa on or create something new that wasn't there before. In other words, a nonpro t's work should, over me, result in people being be er o than they were before, in a way that is consistent with and de ned by the organiza on's mission and goals. When outcomes are sustained over me and they become observable in a whole community or popula on, they are considered impacts. Nonpro t organiza ons should strive to achieve outcomes -posi ve changes, and they should always try to sustain their work long enough and well enough to achieve impacts. Outcomes should be observable, and they primarily fall into one of ve categories represented by the acronym BACKS, developed by Penna 7 : Behavior-Those things we see people do. In terms of outcomes, behaviors manifest as a change from a nega ve to a posi ve behavior, or a decrease of nega ve and/or an increase in posi ve behavior, such as smoking (nega ve) or a ending cultural events regularly (posi ve). Behaviors can be measured by observing, tes ng, surveying, or looking at data from agencies that typically see these behaviors. A tude-The way a person thinks about an issue that in uence the choices he/she makes. Suppor ng recycling and green prac ces, or believing in the value of a healthy lifestyle are examples of a tudes that can be changed through the work of nonpro ts. A tudes can be measured through ac vi es like surveys, interviews, focus groups and reviews of mass media and social media. Condi on-The state of someone's life rela ve to established criteria. Poverty, for example, is a condi on. Someone's poverty condi on can be measured by nding out their annual income and level of food insecurity. A common way social service agencies measure condi on is with ve established levels-in crisis, vulnerable, stable, safe, and thriving 8 . Neonatal service providers, another example, use the APGAR 9 score. Knowledge-The extent to which a person has and can use informa on about a social or behavioral topic or issue. An example is ar s c knowledge, which can be measured through interviews, surveys, or even crea ng new art of a certain genre, all outcomes that would be very desirable to an art museum or school. An environmental group might strive to build knowledge of the bene ts of reducing, reusing and recycling which they hope will translate to someone ac vely choosing and sustaining those behaviors. Status-The extent to which a person ts an exis ng social category or label because they have the characteris cs of that category. Employed is a status, as are endangered, CHINS, bullied and college graduate. The t of the label determines the status, and sta tus can, as an ini al step, be measured by coun ng labels as found in agency data. One of the major ndings of the SIMO study was that most of the survey respondents (94%) reported that their organiza ons measure day to day organiza onal performance through collec on of data on stakeholder engagement, capacity, ac vi es and/or outputs. In order to measure how well their organiza on is performing day to day, and in order to maintain accountability, they keep track of who does what, who delivers what, and how clients and par cipants respond. That is important, and it helps organiza ons determine whether things are running smoothly and what needs to be xed in organiza onal processes in order to keep things that way. However, that data does not tell organiza ons whether the social value they are striving to achieve, their mission, is being ful lled. The data just cannot communicate that informa on. When asked if they measure outcomes, 45% of organiza ons, nearly half, reported that they do not. In other words, they have no way to say whether their important work has resulted in any sus tained bene t or posi ve changes in their cons tuencies. While it is commendable that over half of organiza ons do measure outcomes, the percentage needs to be higher. Why? To determine whether an organiza on is truly contribu ng to posi ve change. To change course if e orts are not resul ng in sustained posi ve change. To report to funders their return on their investment, or what posi ve changes they contributed to. To celebrate when e orts are crea ng change and to share evidence of best prac ces. For the purposes of the SIMO study, to determine whether technology has any in uence on the extent to which organiza ons achieve their missions and how that in uence can be strengthened. Next, we'll look at how the rela onship between performance and technology was assessed."}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE (cont.)", "text": "When you were asked about organiza onal performance in the SIMO ques onnaire, you were asked two types of ques ons -\"extent\" and \"in uence of technology\" ques ons. Extent ques ons measured your perceived performance rela ve to your established organiza onal goals and objec ves: The extent to which your organiza on performs its day to day work of engaging stake holders, building its capacity, implemen ng ac vi es and delivering outputs on a 4 point scale, with 3 points re ec ng achievement of goals and 4 points indica ng that goals are surpassed; and The extent to which your organiza on achieves short , intermediate-and long term out comes on a 6 point scale, with 6 points indica ng 100% of clients or par cipants demon strated expected outcomes. In uence of technology ques ons measured the level at which you feel technology in uences your day to day performance and achievement of outcomes: Day to day performance is o en assessed in terms of e ciency, cost e ec veness, quan ty, quality, and sa sfac on 10 . Accordingly, you assessed the level at which you feel tech nology in uences day to day performance in each of those areas on a 5 point scale, with 1 indica ng that technology reduced performance, 3 indica ng that technology did not a ect performance, and 5 indica ng it helped a great deal. Achievement of outcomes is assessed in terms of posi ve change. Measuring outcomes, at a basic level, entails measuring the extent to which change has taken place. You were asked to report whether you feel technology contributes to these types of changes for individuals and communi es served by your organiza on using a di erent 5 point scale, where 1 equated to no in uence, and 5 indicated that technology was the exclusive in u ence on the achievement of outcomes. The logic model 11 below illustrates the ra onale for asking di erent ques ons for day to day perfor mance and outcome achievement. In order to achieve outcomes, it is important to plan and measure day to day work. If an organiza on doesn't achieve su cient stakeholder engagement, if it doesn't have the capacity to do its work (resources, sta , etc.), it doesn't implement ac vi es e ec vely, and it doesn't produce su cient outputs, it is not likely to achieve outcomes 12 . Considering performance in this two stage model allows organiza ons to troubleshoot along the way, and, for the purposes of SIMO, it allows organiza ons to consider how and where to integrate technology in order to get to outcomes. The next sec on will summarize how you reported organiza onal performance. The purpose of the SIMO study was to determine whether there are rela onships between strategy typology, technology/mission alignment maturity and organiza onal performance. Due to data constraints (not everyone who started the survey completed it), validity and reliability of the SIMO model were not able to be con rmed, so this report will not tell you unequivocably that \"This is your pro le-if your organiza on uses 'X' strategy typology and 'Y' technology/mission alignment strategies, you will get 'Z' level of performance.\" The data that was collected was used to es mate a full data set using sta s cal procedures that allowed for an exploratory level of data analysis, which did allow a rst look at some poten al rela onships. The SIMO model is shown below. The overall hypothesis for this study was that there are rela onships between the three elements of the model, which are shown by the arrows in the diagram. While there was not a rela onship iden ed between strategy typology and organiza onal performance, or strategy typology and technology/mission alignment maturity (shown in the model as IT Alignment maturity), there was unique in uence of each strategy typology (prospector, analyzer, defender and reactor) on the rela onship between technology/mission alignment maturity and organiza onal performance (shown by the do ed line). You may be asking, what in the world does THAT mean? It means that according to pa erns that emerged when data was run through the model, di erent strategy types use di erent alignment prac ces, that result in di erent levels of organiza onal performance. The pa erns are described on the next page. Following descrip ons of the pa erns, you will nd your SIMO pro le, which you can use to consider how your organiza on might priori ze making any changes to its strategy typology or technology/mission alignment prac ces in order to get to outcomes.
