It has been shown to be less variable than ADAS-cog, to have excellent 2-year responsiveness and to be appropriate in distinguishing between MCI and AD patients. 9 The objective of this work is to develop an original natural history population disease progression model based on CDR-SOB scores from ADNI by integrating the experiences from previous ADAS-cog modeling. The model presented herein, similarly to Yang's model, 6 is based on the concept that study entry time does not correspond to the start of the disease as illustrated in Figure 1 . Analyzing the data at the population level permits derivation of the most likely common disease trajectory using time scale adjustment and back-and forth extrapolation between AD and MCI patients. In addition, the different approaches developed by Samtani 4, 5 have been adapted to the CDR-SOB score."}, {"section_title": "ReSUlTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Available data", "text": "Model building was performed on data obtained from the ADNI database (www.adni.loni.ucla.edu). 10 The final analysis dataset consisted of 2,700 CDR-SOB values collected from 380 MCI and 180 AD patients for up to 4 years. It excluded control subjects for which, contrary to ADAS-cog scores, most CDR-SOB scores were equal or close to zero (Figure 2a,b) , as well as subjects with a single CDR-SOB record. Guided by prior disease modeling in this area, a total of 19 covariates were included (see Methods). As cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were only available in about half of the patients, their impact could not be fully assessed.\nSpecial attention has been given to the HIPV which is known to be an important covariate in AD. 11, 12 HIPV has been shown to be affected by head size, age, and sex 13 and to significantly drop in the elderly.\n14 Therefore, its standardization to individual characteristics should improve its disease predictive value. 15 So, in addition to the observed HIPV centered to the median value of healthy population, a HIPV normalized to that of a healthy subject with the same age and head size (RHPNM) has been derived for each MCI and AD patient. The normalization was based on the relationship between HIPVs, individual estimated intracranial volumes, 16 and ages in healthy subjects (see Methods) and was used to compare the HIPV atrophy between patients. It should be noted that sex was no longer necessary in this normalization because it was already included in estimated intracranial volumes. As expected and shown in Figure 2c ,d, this transformation decreased the variance of the HIPV measurement by about one-third."}, {"section_title": "Structural base model development", "text": "As previously described for ADAS-cog, 4 ,5 graphical analysis of CDR-SOB progressions indicated a continuous increase in disease progression rate over time in most patients, the higher the CDR-SOB score the faster the progression rate. Like ADAS-cog, CDR-SOB score is also constrained between lower and upper limits (here, 0-18) and in particular, left censored (Figure 2a,b) .\nAs a starting model, we selected a nonlinear model adapted from Samtani 4 based on differential equations with an evolving disease progression rate. As subjects entered the study at different stages of the disease, a disease-onset time (DOT) similar to the time shift introduced by Yang 6 was also applied: )) which due to the power arbitrary set to 30 approximated a step function from 0 to 1). The change in A(1) was described by a constant disease progression rate (RATE) plus an additive term (A(1) \u00d7 \u03b1) in which \u03b1 was a parameter for the individual change in progression rate. To deal with floor and ceiling CDR-SOB scores, the modeling was performed in the logit domain and additive residual error was used. Therefore, A(1) represents the time course of CDR-SOB in the logit domain. Inherent to the nature of the model, at least one covariate indicative of the patient's status was required. The most appropriate one was the cognitive CDR-SOB score at study entry since it carried most of the information on the patient disease status and DOT (i.e., the higher the score the earlier the disease started). It should also be noted that due to numerical difficulties, log normally distributed interindividual variability (IIV) could only be implemented on one of the two parameters, RATE or DOT, forcing either the same RATE or the same DOT for every subject. The model was stable when implementing IIV on parameter DOT.\nTherefore, for a CDR-SOB score at study entry and its progression as a function of time, the modeling exercise essentially consisted of identifying a DOT for each individual that minimized the objective function given the population disease trajectory. The combination of DOT synchronization and population analysis-information from one individual enriched by the information coming from the other individuals-allowed the estimation of the most likely disease trajectory of the CDR-SOB score.\nHowever, when applying this model, two major observations were noted. First, observed disease scores evolved more slowly in a significant number of subjects, mainly belonging to the group classified as MCI. Second, CDR-SOB scores following study entry showed an early drop or delay before progression of the disease. These two observations were in agreement with the previous findings 5, 17 when modeling ADAS-cog scores. To allow the model to capture the difference in the disease progression rate, a mixture model was implemented allowing to assign subjects to one out of the two subpopulations ($MIX). 18 For the first subpopulation, RATE was estimated without IIV and \u03b1 set to 0, whereas for the second subpopulation, RATE without IIV and \u03b1 with IIV were estimated together. Subjects were assigned to either subpopulation independently of their disease status (i.e., MCI and AD status was not used as a covariate). The second observation was accounted for by adding a 'placebo' effect at the time the patient entered the study as given by the following equation where CDR_SOB represents the predicted CDR-SOB score, PL the magnitude of the 'placebo' effect, and KPL the equilibration rate constant of the effect: \nFinally, in addition to the IIV on DOT and \u03b1, the score-time profile was best captured by log normally distributed IIV on PL; the estimation of IIV on KPL was not supported by the data."}, {"section_title": "Covariate analysis", "text": "Covariate analyses presented hereunder pursued two aims. The first one was to find among available biomarkers those that could best explain the variability in disease progression, described in this model by DOT and \u03b1 parameters, and the second aim was to identify biomarkers that could allow the discrimination between slow and fast MCI progressers.\nBase model. As mentioned previously, the primary covariate that needed to be accounted for was CDR-SOB at study entry, put on DOT. Next, covariates such as baseline ADAS-cog, hippocampal volume, mini mental score exam (MMSE), and functional assessment questionnaire (FAQ), preselected mainly by graphical analysis (i.e., correlation with DOT) and clinical significance were also tested on DOT as described in Table 1 (part I).\nADAS-cog was retained since it decreased the objective function the most (100 units). None of the other tested covariates were found statistically significant after selection of CDR-SOB and ADAS-cog. This model was considered as the base model ( Table 2 , left part) and was used to search for potential covariates for slow and fast MCI progressers. At that stage, tentative implementation of covariates on parameter \u03b1 was explored but always resulted in numerically instable models.\nSlow-and fast-progressing MCI populations. Effect of covariates to identify slow-and fast-progressing MCI populations was explored using generalized additive models (GAM) in univariate and multivariate steps. First, all covariates (i.e., in total 19) were tested separately. As shown in Figure 3a , sex and APOE \u03b54 carrier status were not identified by univariate analysis. Conversion from MCI to AD appeared indicative of fast progression since 84% (136 of 162) of fast progressers had converted although 33% (69 of 207) of not-yet-converters were also identified as fast progressers by the model. Interestingly but not surprisingly, use of co-medication was also indicative of fast disease progression.

Sex and APOE \u03b54 carrier status were also tested again. From this multivariate step-GAM analysis, the most significant covariates to differentiate between slow and fast MCI progressers were CDR-SOB (P = 8.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ), FAQ (P = 1.85 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), and RHPNM (P = 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). Sex was also identified but was less significant (P = 0.026). APOE \u03b54 carrier status was not identified.\nAs mentioned earlier, CSF tau, p-tau 181P , and A\u03b21-42 levels, biomarkers well known to be altered in AD, 19 were only available in a subset of MCI patients (Figure 3a) and therefore were not included in the multivariate GAM analysis.

A final search of covariates for their potential influence on parameter \u03b1 was undertaken as described in part III of Table 1 and led to the inclusion of the MMSE score.

Visual predictive checks are shown in Figure 4 for base and final models. As shown in this figure, both models were able to satisfactorily predict the course of the disease progression in the different diagnosed groups. The base model performed slightly better for AD patients and the final model for fast MCI progressers, particularly for the fastest ones.\nResults of GAM analyses for the slow and fast MCI populations were also evaluated for both models by applying the logistic models to all subjects from the ADNI database with the appropriate covariates as shown in Figure 3b ,c. As shown in this figure, predictions made on GAM-selected covariates allowed to reasonably differentiate subjects relative to their probability of disease progression and were in good agreement with ADNI classification. Indeed, the NL and AD subjects who were not part of the GAM analysis of slow and fast MCI subjects could be well categorized based on their covariates, for their probability of progression."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Considering AD as a continuously progressing disease, CDR-SOB scores from MCI and AD patients from the ADNI database have been used in a combined analysis using DOT synchronization in order to reconstruct a coherent trajectory for disease progression. DOT and the disease trajectory were implemented in a differential equation. At the time the disease started in an individual, the estimated DOT activated the increase in the CDR-SOB score following a RATE adjusted to each subject's progression velocity by an additive disease increasing rate term (CDR \u00d7 \u03b1). Initially to deal with the floor and ceiling effect of the score, modeling was performed in the logit domain. However, this approach also implies that the disease progression itself occurs in the logit domain. In fact, a score is only an expression of a disease status and is limited to a time window when it is sensitive to the disease progression. For instance, the disease can have started a while ago, but the score is not yet sensitive enough to detect its progression (e.g., CDR-SOB score below 0.5). On the opposite, the disease can still evolve but the score can no more describe its progression because it has already reached the maximum value (e.g., CDR-SOB score of 18). If we accept that the disease progresses in the logit domain, the different scores (e.g., ADAS-cog, CDR-SOB, MMSE, FAQ, etc) can be positioned at different phase of the disease progression and can translate the disease progression rate through different link functions. Unfortunately, today, the 'true' or reference disease status and trajectory have not yet been defined. Imaging techniques might help in this quest. This makes that A (1) in the disease trajectory equation is not the 'true' disease status and is mainly driven by the score used in the modeling, i.e., CDR-SOB. It can also be mentioned that even in the logit domain, the progression of the score could not be modeled by a straight line and required a nonlinear function. This is due to an asymmetry in the score or/and its progression as a function of time. Finally, the use of a differential equation to describe the trajectory was justified by the flexibility it offers in the future to describe different drug actions on disease progression. With this model, it was identified that the disease progression evolved significantly more slowly in a number of MCI subjects. To capture this difference in disease trajectories, a mixture model was implemented. The time shift approach has already been applied by Yang et al. on ADAScog scores. 6 However, in our case, the model was not able to align all patients according to one trajectory but rather identified statistically two populations, based on fast or slow progression in the CDR-SOB score. As expected, most of the patients from the AD group (97%) were identified by the model as fast-progressing subjects whereas the slowprogressing population was essentially formed by the patients from the MCI group (44%), indicating that these patients did not transit to AD status during the observation period. This is in agreement with the segregation of MCI patients into two subpopulations described by Samtani."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Figure 4", "text": "Model visual predictive check. Visual predictive checks for the base (left side) and final (right side) Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression models. Red lines are the 10th, 50th, and 90th progressions of clinical dementia rating scale-sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) from the AD neuroimaging initiative trial whereas dots are the individual observations. Green areas represent the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the predicted CDR-SOB progressions from the 100 simulated datasets. Identification of fast-progressing and slow-progressing MCI highlights an important caveat to the analysis of Yang et al. 6 in which ADAS-cog 13 is used to synchronize time trajectories across three different populations. The logic of that analysis would be sound if the MCI population was simply a more progressed version of the control population and the AD population were just a more progressed version of the MCI population. That, however, is not the case: the AD population is both a more progressed and a highly selected (by virtue of the study design) version of the MCI population. Because of this selection, it is not the case that, given enough time, the MCI population would eventually be similar to the AD population. This has also an impact on the estimation on the DOT. The present analysis can be considered as an additional step in the sequential development of AD progression models. In our model, all the trajectories of CDR-SOB scores were defined by individual DOTs and a rate, which could progress slowly in slow-progressing subjects, or faster with more or less acceleration as the disease evolved in fast-progressing subjects. In addition, the disease trajectories were completed by a 'placebo component' to take into account the transient slight improvement or delay in the score progression observed in numerous patients following study enrolment. Apart from a placebo effect, this drop in CDR-SOB scores may also be interpreted as learning effect but could result from other study-specific effects (inclusion criteria and concomitant drug effect). The decrease in CDR-SOB scores was a challenging aspect of the model development, since it could confound other aspects of disease progression. The way it was modeled allowed taking this effect into account without compromising other aspects of the disease progression model. However, the fact that the placebo effect was introduced after logit back transformation might produce negative scores in a simulation mode. Since the score was digitalized to 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc, no negative scores were produced in the simulations (e.g., visual predictive checks).\nCDR-SOB and ADAS-cog scores were identified as covariates for DOT and MMSE as covariate on the diseaseincreasing rate term. It should be noted that the covariate search only focused on biomarkers available in most of the patients; therefore, the impact of CSF p-tau 181p and A\u03b21-42 which were only available in half of the subjects in ADNI was not fully explored in this analysis. The potential influence of CSF p-tau 181p and A\u03b21-42 should be further tested with additional longitudinal CSF and clinical data.\nCovariates identified for assignment to the slow-or fastprogressing MCI groups at study entry were CDR-SOB, FAQ, and the hippocampal volume normalized for age and head size. Notably, without normalization, HIPV was only just significant (P = 0.02). Implementation of these biomarkers as covariates of the mixture model significantly improved the model (\u0394OF > 200) and patient stratification. On the basis of these prognostic factors, 81% of the subjects could correctly be assigned to the slow or fastprogressing subpopulations and, assuming that fast progressers will convert, 77% of the MCI to AD conversion could be predicted. Notably, the disease progression model described correctly 84% of the conversions (see Supplementary Data online). These biomarkers have also been identified by other authors as important for status definition, 8 progression rate, 10 and MCI to AD conversion. 20 Of note, they combine a cognitive score with a functionality score and brain anatomy. Therefore, the use of these biomarkers to calculate the probability of fast disease progression should improve the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of AD.\nThe estimation of the DOT allowed a better positioning of each individual in his disease trajectory at study entry. The DOT estimated by the CDR-SOB model could be applied to the time profiles of biomarkers. The application of this concept has already been introduced by Yang. 6 It is illustrated for our analysis in Figure 5 in which the hippocampal volume time profiles have been synchronized on the DOT. This approach virtually expands the clinical observation period from 3 to 8 years and provides insights into long-term changes in the biomarkers.\nIn conclusion, the use of the DOT and disease trajectory concepts was powerful for detecting different AD progression rates in the ADNI population and identifying corresponding prognostic factors. Estimation of the DOT by the CDR-SOB model allowed the synchronization of biomarkertime profiles on disease onset rather than on study entry and provided insights in long-term changes in biomarkers. From this analysis, the CDR-SOB score could be considered as complementary to the ADAS-cog score from a modeling and simulation perspective for evaluating disease-modifying drugs in prodromal subjects."}, {"section_title": "MeThODS", "text": "ADNI data extraction and assembly. Data used in this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla. edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the US Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is M.W.W., VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco, with efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. Subjects have been enrolled from over 50 sites across the USA and Canada. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nFollowing approval to access ADNI, original data sets were downloaded on 1 August 2011. At that time, ADNI database consisted of 819 adults, aged 55-91 years, with CDR-SOB records for an observation period up to 4 years: 229 subjects were classified as NL, 397 as MCI, and 193 as AD at enrollment. Biomarker assessments were recorded at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months with an additional evaluation at 18 months for the MCI group. During the observation period, 166 MCI converted to AD, 6 AD converted to MCI, and 19 NL evolved to MCI whom 3 of which subsequently evolved to AD. Intrinsically, the model considered that control subjects had CDR-SOB scores of zero which was in agreement with the observations. Therefore, control subjects were not included in the final NONMEM dataset for the CDR-SOB analysis since they did not carry information to the model. Patients with a single CDR-SOB record (16 MCI and 13 AD) were also removed. Covariates investigated were age, sex, serum cholesterol, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, hippocampal, ventricular and estimated intracranial volumes, FAQ, Trail B test, MMSE and ADAS-cog (total 11) scores, CSF Tau, p-tau 181P and A\u03b21-42, plasma A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-40, MCI to AD conversion, and medication for cognitive disorder (CCMED). The latter was registered as categorical covariates (0, 1) and positive when at least one anticholinesterase drug was recorded. Values at study enrollment were utilized. HIPV was the average of left and right HIPV as used by Samtani. 4 For covariate model building, median covariate value of the diagnostic group was imputed for missing covariate when covariate was nearly complete. For GAM analyses, subjects with missing relevant covariates were excluded. The HIPV of the subject at study entry (HIPVbsl i ) was normalized to the HIPV of a healthy subject with same head size and age (HPNMbsl i ) to obtain an estimation of the HIPV atrophy of the patient (RHPNMbsl i ) at study entry as follows:\nwhere HPNMbsl i = Age i \u00d7 (-26.6268 + EICVbsl i \u00d7 0.0016 + 3340.4395). The calculation was based on regression analysis between HIPV, age, and estimated intracranial volumes performed in healthy subjects; the estimated intracranial volume being the best substitute for head size found in the ADNI database.\nModel building and evaluation.
