[{"section_title": "", "text": "One further challenge in controlling COVID-19 is the accumulation of variation across genes. Sources indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating at about 2 variants/month 4 , but the potential implications of these on molecular diagnostics and the development of candidate vaccines and treatments remain poorly explored. Fortunately, the continuous exponential increase in the amount of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data and structural information available provides the opportunity to analyse both data sources concomitantly. This provides a unique opportunity to not only understand how variants might affect patient outcomes, but also anticipate and minimise their potential role in viral escape through early incorporation within the development pipeline.\nTo facilitate this, we have developed a comprehensive online resource, COVID-3D, to enable analysis and interpretation of variants detected in over 45,000 SARS-COV-2 genomic sequences 5 ( Figure S1 ). We have mapped these circulating variants to their respective protein sequences and structures of the SARS-COV-2 proteins derived from available experimental information, permitting a direct comparison of variant clustering between the two representations. Our interactive 3-D viewer enables fast and intuitive spatial visualisation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, highlighting their potential impacts on protein structure and interactions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] (Figure S2-S5 ). This is particularly useful for analysing sites being currently targeted by potential therapeutics. To further enhance therapeutic discovery efforts, we have included drug binding potential 13, 14 and predicted antigenicity maps 15, 16 of the structures, which permit rational selection of target sites and compound design specifically avoiding already circulating variants ( Figure S3 ). Finally, combining this structural information with evolutionary and population variation analysis can further help identify sites less likely to accommodate mutations in the future. To illustrate this, COVID-3D was used to provide insights into the two main therapeutic targets-the Spike protein and Main Proteinase.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediating cell entry. Subsequently, the ACE2 receptor binding domain has been the main target of most vaccine programs. Measures of selective pressure suggest that the spike protein is one of the viral proteins most tolerant to the introduction of mutations 17, 18 (Table S1 ). Upon closer inspection (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/covid3d/protein/QHD43416/CLOSED), it is evident that despite SARS-CoV-2 only being discovered 6 months ago, we can already see significant variation across the protein surface, including in predicted epitope regions in the receptor binding domain ( Figure 1B ). Of these variants, the D614G mutation is present in twothirds of the sequenced strains, although its actual significance remains unclear despite initial suggestions at increasing transmissibility 19 . The residue is located far from the ACE2 interface (73 \u00c5), and was predicted to have a mildly stabilising (DUET 8 0.5 kcal/mol; SDM 7 2.3 kcal/mol) effect on protein stability, and hence a minimal fitness cost 20 . It was, however, predicted to alter protein dynamics and the interactions between the subunits (4.4 \u00c5 from the interface. mCSM-PPI2 11 Interestingly, when we look at population specific variants across ACE2, we see a number of ethnic group specific variants across the interface recognised by Spike ( Figure 1A ). Evaluation of their consequences using mCSM-PPI2 11 , which has been experimentally validated on this protein system 21 , reveals potential significant effects on the binding affinity of Spike, opening up further work to explore how this influences the severity and progression of COVID-19.\nApart from Spike, the Main Proteinase (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/covid3d/protein/QHD43415_5/APO) has also attracted a lot of therapeutic development efforts, as a target for small molecule development. The Main Proteinase, however, is not particularly intolerant to missense variants (Table S1 ), which may promote the emergence of resistant variants. The structures show that there are already a number of circulating variants present in the drug binding site that could have implications on efficacy (Figure 2A ). Using COVID-3D, we have leveraged the wealth of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to calculate measures of mutational tolerance, which revealed a number of proteins under strong purifying selection (Table S1 ). This includes the Helicase, NSP7, NSP8, NSP9 and ExoN, which may make novel attractive drug targets with few circulating variants seen near the druggable pockets ( Figure 2B ).\nCOVID-3D provides an easy to use bridge between genomic information and structural insight to better guide our biological understanding and treatment efforts. As new structural and sequence data becomes available, COVID-3D will be periodically updated to enable their integration into ongoing efforts to understand and combat SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Mapping genetic variants", "text": "High quality SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were obtained from GSAID 5 and the COG-UK Consortium.
