Of late years it has been widely acknowledged that erythropoietin' s action is not limited to hemopoietic system, as erythropoietin involvement is being extensively evaluated in various pathological conditions concurrent with oxidative stress, vascular diseases, metabolic abnormalities or immune system dysfunction (19) . Recent data of biomedical literature has shown that erythropoietin's pleiotropic actions are involved in normal and pathological ageing (18, 20) .\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Leiden 85-plus study, have evidenced that EPO serum levels tend to increase with age, probably as physiological response required to maintain adequate red blood cell production (10) . In elderly subjects with diabetes mellitus or hypertension, this compensatory mechanism eventually becomes inadequate, leading to a greater risk of developing anemia (12) . Additional clinical studies pointed out low or inappropriately normal levels of plasma erythropoietin in diabetic patients with or without anemia (26, 31) . These abnormalities in erythropoietin biosynthesis in patients with anemia and diabetes mellitus, represent an \"inappropriate\" response to decreasing Erythropoietin in elderly with type 2 diabetes 401 401\nhemoglobin levels (32) . Diabetic patients with anemia and decreased EPO levels may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (24, 28) . Hyperglycemia, even during short time intervals can lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in endothelial, hepatic, beta-pancreatic cells and in erythrocytes (35) . Peroxidation of erythrocyte membrane lipids, exposed to increased ROS impairs their physiological function and reduces red blood cell life-span (17) .\nTaking into account that besides the ability of stimulating erythrocyte production, erythropoietin has been extensively implicated in normal and pathological cell metabolism regulation through its multiple actions, and that oxidative stress induces dysfunction and ageing of erythrocytes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum erythropoietin and oxidative stress induced erythrocyte vulnerability in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The study was carried out in 67 patients (34 men and 33 women) aged between 64 and 76 years old, selected by clinical and biochemical criteria from patients hospitalized at Ana Aslan -National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics.\nTwo groups of study patients were selected: 1.

In basic experimental research and clinical studies, erythropoietin has been strongly associated with modulation of cellular metabolism (19, 20) . Diabetes mellitus, a major public health problem, comes also as main evidence when cellular dysfunction related to cell metabolism is under scrutiny (21) . Furthermore, metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress appear to be strongly related in the etiopathogeny of type 2 diabetes. Several studies evidenced that oxidative status was improved by EPO treatment of anemia (2, 11, 25) . EPO therapy may exert its antioxidant effect, by modulating the action of erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (25) . Also, recent results showed that EPO treatment increased the GSH levels in both erythrocytes and platelets, in \u03b2-thalassemic patients (2) . However, the relationships between EPO and erythrocyte oxidative stress in elderly subjects with diabetes have been less explored.\nNormal erythrocyte function depends on integrity of the erythrocyte membrane, which is a target for numerous toxic prooxidant factors, including chronic hyperglycemia (22, 30) . Erythrocyte membrane is among the main targets for oxygen radicals or peroxides as it contains both polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are the most susceptible substrate for lipid peroxidation as well as prooxidant catalysts such as Fe 2+ and hemoproteins (23, 33) . Hence, the erythrocyte susceptibility to peroxidation represents an informative biomarker on red blood cell mechanisms and capability of antioxidant protection against free radicals.\nTherefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the correlation between circulating EPO levels and systemic oxidative stress biomarkers, in elderly with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In view of this purpose, we evaluated the erythrocytes susceptibility to lipid peroxidation (ESP) and serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC).\nResults showed that elderly T2DM subjects had a decreased antioxidant defense, in both serum samples and erythrocytes, compared to healthy subjects, which is in accordance with previous studies (14, 15) . Also, lower levels of EPO were found in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism, compared with age-matched controls. The main finding of our study showed that erythropoietin levels correlated inversely and significantly with oxidative stress exerted at erythrocyte level (ESP), even though hemoglobin, the circulating erythrocyte mass and serum iron levels were comparable. Also, lower levels of EPO in T2DM group were associated with a significant decrease in serum antioxidant capacity (TAC). Subsequently to establishing these associations, the following questions could be raised: to what extent diabetes determine a decrease in EPO biosynthesis and to what extent diabetes per se can initiate oxidative damage of erythrocyte membrane? And not in the least, which might be the mechanisms of the antioxidant EPO protection expressed at erythrocyte level?\nDiabetes-related chronic hyperglycemia can lead to a hypoxic environment in the renal interstitium, which results in impaired production of erythropoietin by the peritubular fibroblasts and in diabetes nephropathy, subsequent anemia (28) . The distinction between T2DM patients with anemia and those with diabetic nephropathy in whom anemia has not been evidenced, lies in a defect of \"anemia-sensing\" mechanisms particular to these later mentioned patients, and that may contribute to EPO deficiency and explain low EPO levels (9). In ageing, the decline in the capacity to produce EPO could be due to a mechanism distinct from impaired renal excretory function. Certain ageing-associated disorders such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, could accentuate the impairment in EPO secretion (12) .\nDue to their physiological roles, erythrocytes are continuously exposed to oxidative stress. Results obtained confirm observations of literature regarding the damaging effects of hyperglycemia mediated or stimulated by oxygen species. Mechanisms could be the following: 1) glucose oxidation pathways generate oxygen free radicals; 2) hyperglycemia deteriorates antioxidant capacity, and 3) mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species is generated in hyperglycemic states (6, 19, 21) .\nMoreover, in kidney cells hyperglycemia increases mitochondrial ROS production which alters the transcription factors involved in the control of hypoxia and oxidative stress response in relation with the renal hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, involved in erythropoiesis (19) . Research has extended to the effects of EPO in regulating oxidative Gradinaru D et al. 406 metabolism and mitochondrial function, the interactions between EPO and important energy regulation factors, and the protective role of EPO from stresses that are related to metabolism, which have been recently reviewed (34, 35) .\nEPO may exert its antioxidative effects directly by involvement in intracellular mechanisms such as up-regulation of hem oxygenase-1 expression, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation. Recent studies found the recombinant form of EPO (rHuEPO) to be a potent scavenger of HO\u02d9with the capacity to inhibit Fenton chemistry through catalytic iron chelation. Its ability to scavenge peroxyl (ROO\u02d9) radicals, evaluated in vitro, was also superior compared to other antioxidants (5) . The indirect antioxidant EPO action could be achieved through iron depletion and thus limitation of iron-dependent oxidative injury, and by increasing new red blood cells (RBC) loaded with a significant amount of antioxidants (1, 2, 11, 16) .\nPrevious studies pointed out also an inverse association between hemoglobin concentrations and erythrocyte membrane MDA (13) . In our study population hemoglobin and serum iron concentrations were comparable, and within normal ranges, therefore we could suggest that mainly erythropoietin and not hemoglobin, nor iron determined the changes in oxidative stress parameters.\nRecent in vitro and in vivo studies underline the antioxidative EPO effect in various cell systems: erythrocytes, neurons, microglia, astrocytes, cerebral endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, retinal cell (2, 11, 16, 20) . In in vitro studies on blood vessel cells exposed to increased glucose concentrations a strong cyto-protective EPO effect was noticed (8) . Similarly to insulin, also for EPO protective effects were demonstrated, subsequent to its administration to diabetic and non-diabetic patients, with resistant, severe congestive heart failure (27) . EPO administration can significantly improve survival of endothelial cells and moreover, EPO can block DNA degradation in the course of apoptosis of endothelial cells under hyperglycemia conditions, similarly to other experimental models of oxidative stress in cultured cardiac and endothelial cells (4) . A recent study which investigated the timedependent effects of EPO therapy on oxidative stress parameters of hemodialysis patients showed that long term administration of EPO attenuated the lipid peroxidation process and restored the levels of antioxidants (11) . New in vivo research showed potent protective effects of EPO against diabetes development by direct effects of EPO on \u03b2-cells by increasing \u03b2-cell mass through anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic mechanisms (7) .\nThe strong inverse association between EPO levels and ESP pointed out in our study, in T2DM, could reflect the diminished RBC membrane cytoprotection by reducing the strength of total antioxidant potential at systemic level. Further in vitro experimental models and in vivo studies are needed to demonstrate the precise mechanisms.\nThe limitations of this study could be the small population sample and the global assessment of oxidative stress damage exerted on erythrocytes (ESP) without specific evaluations of biomarkers of erythrocyte antioxidant defense, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and catalase. As oxidative stress in diabetes is suggested to be associated also with chronic low-grade inflammation, another limitation of the study is the lack in the assessment of sensitive inflammatory markers (such as hsCRP, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), therefore we could not point out relationships between decreased EPO serum levels, oxidative stress markers and inflammation.\nThe present study provides new data regarding the protective effect of EPO expressed at systemic level, and the relationships between circulating EPO levels, impaired glucose metabolism and erythrocyte susceptibility to oxidative damage. Since administration of antioxidants in the course of hyperglycemia can block free radical generation and reduce oxidative stress, EPO could offer an alternative therapy appealing in view of maintenance of normal cell metabolism and appropriate membrane potential. Hence, inhibition of oxidative damage of cell components could represent a new modality of EPO therapeutic intervention in diabetes. In this sense, in the future both glucose lowering therapy as well as judicious early supplementation with erythropoietin could lead to delay or block the development of anemia and vascular complications in elderly diabetic patients.
