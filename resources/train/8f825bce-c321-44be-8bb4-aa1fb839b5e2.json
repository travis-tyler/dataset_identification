Novel fluid and imaging biomarkers to detect amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau are known to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of dementia [11 -14] . We previously reported that among cases clinically diagnosed with AD, the number of A\u03b2-negative cases increases with age [15] . These A\u03b2-negative cases are not included in AD pathologically [16] nor by the recent clinical definition of AD used by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association research framework using biomarkers [8, 17, 18] .\nThe classical amyloid hypothesis of AD suggests that oligomer or accumulated A\u03b2 is the first and common pathway to induce neurodegeneration [19 -21] . Tau accumulation and neuronal dysfunction may follow such A\u03b2 accumulation [22, 23] . However, this sequence was mainly confirmed in hereditary AD [24, 25] and may not be applied to sporadic AD. Indeed, we previously reported that age-related accumulation of tau may precede robust A\u03b2 accumulation, leading to AD [26] . Furthermore, the failure of many clinical trials targeting A\u03b2 indicates that A\u03b2 may not be the primary cause [27 -30] .\nNeuropathologically, cerebrovascular diseases, primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART), and \u03b1-synucleinopathy are the leading causes of non-amyloid dementia [6, 31 -33] . Among these, age-related tau accumulation without A\u03b2 in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, and brainstem is postulated to represent PART [34 -37] . The concept of PART covers cases with normal cognitive function to those with profound cogni-tive impairment. The latter cases are reported to include Argyrophilic Grain Disease (AGD) [38 -41] and Neurofibrillary Tangle-Predominant Dementia (NFTPD) [42 -45] .\nTo explore the contribution of tau to Amyloid-Negative Dementia in the Elderly (ANDE), we studied tau accumulation with a radiopharmaceutically significant tracer, 2-\n, for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) [46 -49] ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics", "text": "Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or from close family when the participants were cognitively impaired.
