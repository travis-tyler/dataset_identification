[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimer's disease (AD) exists before dementia is present and that shifts in amyloid beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b2 1\u221242 (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer's disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual's CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE\u03b54 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 status. This is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE\u03b54 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy. \u2020 Data used in preparation of this article were generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Metabolomics Consortium (ADMC). As such, the investigators within the ADMC provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.\n\u2021 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.\nMethods\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a large, multicenter, longitudinal neuroimaging study, launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations.\nADNI is a longitudinal study of older adults, designed to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nWe examined 566 individuals in the ADNI cohort who had measures at baseline of age, APOE\u03b54 carrier status, 193 protein levels (including homocysteine, A\u03b2 1\u221240 , and A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) and a further 190 proteins measured on a Rules Based Medicine (RBM) platform) and 186 LC-MS/MS metabolites and lipids. After applying previously documented quality control procedures (Supplementary Methods) and removing analytes with more than 15% missingness, 149 proteins and 138 metabolites remained. No samples were removed from the analysis as missingness levels were less than 5%. Any remaining missing data points were imputed using an unsupervised RF approach 26 . After quality control, a total of 566 individuals, each with measures for 289 analytes, age and APOE\u03b54 carrier status, were present in the ADNI cohort (Table 1) .\nThe 566 individuals in this study ranged from 54.4-89.6 years of age and could be categorized by their AD clinical diagnosis as cognitively normal (CN; n = 58), amnestic MCI (n = 396) or, probable AD (n = 112).

However, it is increasingly recognized that AD is a decades-long neurodegenerative process, with shifts in amyloid \u03b2 1\u221242 (A\u03b2 1\u221242 ) providing the first indicators of disease development, long before \"Alzheimer's dementia\" (significant cognitive decline) is clinically apparent [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .\nThere is currently no cure or disease-modifying therapy for this terminal illness despite hundreds of clinical trials being conducted since 2002 6, 7 . It is hypothesized that the high failure rate of AD trials is in part due to the trials targeting AD patients with significant cognitive impairment, who are therefore in the late stages of the disease and likely have suffered a level of brain tissue loss that cannot be compensated for. Compounding this is the discovery that many patients enrolled in clinical trials, up to 20% in one study 8 , were retrospectively found to have normal levels of amyloid and hence did not have AD 9 . Given these findings, there is a great interest in amyloid screening for clinical trial enrichment in order to recruit individuals at the earliest stages of AD, where intervention is thought to have the greatest chance of success 10 . It would also ensure that included individuals are amyloid positive (i.e have abnormal levels of amyloid), a necessary precondition for the development of AD. This selective screening is a precursor for the longer-term goal of population screening for AD 11 .\nThere are currently two established methods to measure an individual's amyloid burden: either in vivo in the form of reduced levels of A\u03b2 1\u221242 in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or increased uptake of radioactive tracers that bind selectively to the A\u03b2 fibrillary aggregates by PET imaging. Unfortunately, existing methodologies for measuring an individual's amyloid levels suffer drawbacks that limit their utility for screening. Lumbar punctures are highly invasive, with this factor alone limiting the applicability of CSF biomarkers for screening. While PET scans are less invasive, they are far more expensive and access to PET scanning facilities is limited in some regions. Despite this, nearly all current trials related to amyloid now require positive amyloid imaging at baseline to ensure accurate diagnosis, a cost-intensive process 7 .\nDespite their invasiveness, recent studies have found evidence that changes in CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 may indicate AD risk long before these same changes are reflected in PET A\u03b2 imaging [12] [13] [14] . Palmqvist et al 13 have shown shown compelling evidence that changes in CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 occur up to a decade before the same signal is found by PET A\u03b2 imaging. These results indicate that CSF may be a more suitable measure for early detection, whereas A\u03b2 PET contributes independent information that is more related to disease progression and downstream pathology.\nTo bypass the invasiveness of CSF collection, there is a strong interest in finding blood-based markers that yield the same information about amyloid status as would be obtained from CSF. There have been a number of studies which have shown that a blood protein signature can be found that reflects AD brain pathology as measured by PET [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Of particular interest is the recent study by Nakamura et al. (2018) 25 , whereby levels of A\u03b2 1\u221240 , A\u03b2 1\u221242 and APP 669\u2212771 in plasma, measured using specialised immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) time-of -flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (henceforth referred to as IP-MALDI-TOF-MS), were shown in combination to have strong performance (> 0.94 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)) in predicting PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 status across two cohorts. This combination of biomarkers was also found to be predictive of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status, with an AUC of 0.876 on a smaller subset of patients (n=46). The novel method employed by Nakamura et al. (2018) 25 , IP-MALDI-TOF-MS, is still in its infancy and it is unclear how easily this will be translated into a clinical setting. Thus, there is still strong interest in finding blood markers for CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 using alternative approaches that rely on more established technologies.\nHere, we evaluated the ability of proteomic and metabolomic data to predict the levels of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 using a Random Forest (RF) approach and explore which types of measurements lead to the strongest predictive performance. We then determine the minimal set of features required to achieve comparable predictive performance. Finally, we evaluate the robustness and utility of these predictive models across a held-out validation cohort of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), demonstrating that subjects with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels showed a faster rate of cognitive decline (measured by transition to AD) than those with predicted normal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels. Table 1 . Demographic characteristics of the ADNI data set used separated into training and validation cohorts, corresponding to individuals with and without CSF measures respectively. Columns in each cohort provide a further breakdown into individuals that are cognitively normal (CN), have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The units of each cell are shown in parentheses in the row names and commonly include number of patients (n) or mean of a given quantity (mean). If a secondary measure (percent (%) or standard deviation (sd)) is also present, it is listed in brackets next to the primary measure. Table 1 . This cohort was split into a training and a validation cohort with 356 and 210 individuals with and without measures of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 , respectively, where CSF was measured using the Luminex xMAP platform and Innogenetics INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay. The training set was used to build predictive models and evaluate their performance directly using the measured A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels while the validation cohort was not used to build the predictive model, but was instead used to evaluate the generalizability and utility of the model's predictions. For each cohort, we also considered a subset of individuals for whom A\u03b2 1\u221242 status from PET was available at least one timepoint (not just at baseline), either using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) or Florbetapir (AV45) tracer, for further validation of our modelling. Further demographic information for these cohorts can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 to 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Dataset", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "individuals by baseline diagnosis and CSF availability is shown in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Binary and regression modelling tasks", "text": "The primary aim of this work was to produce a model that predicts if an individual's CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels are below the recognized clinical threshold of 192pg/ml for the platform used, indicating an abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 level, and hence AD risk. Given the continuous CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 measures in the ADNI cohort, two approaches were considered: a 'regression' task, learning the continuous CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels and thresholding these post-prediction and a 'binary' task, learning the dichotomized CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status based on clinical thresholds directly. While both tasks result in a binary classifier, they face different trade-offs. The regression task makes use of the full information in the CSF levels but needs to learn a suitable threshold to convert its continuous predictions into suitable binary labels whereas the binary task only learns from the dichotomized CSF levels. Given these trade-offs, we have investigated both modelling approaches throughout this work."}, {"section_title": "Statistical modeling", "text": "We made use of Random Forests (RF) as the modeling approach to predict CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels for both the binary and regression tasks. RFs are a widely-used ensemble method that have a number of advantages for the small sample size and disparate types of features observed in the ADNI dataset. RFs are invariant to the scale of the observed features and make few assumptions about the distributions of observed data allowing them to be applied to multiple data modalities easily.\nAll analysis in this work made use of the RF implementation in the R package ranger 27 . Each forest contained 2000 individual trees, each making use of a random selection of p 3/4 features, where p was the total number of variables used in a given model. These parameter choices were based on recommendations provided in Ishwaran et al. (2011) 28 . All other parameters in the ranger implementation were set to their default values.\nTo get an estimate of the performance of our models, we have made use of a nested cross-validation (CV) framework, whereby an inner CV was used to determine model parameters, and the outer CV was used to gain an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data 29 . In this study, we used 3 repetitions of 3 fold cross validation for the inner CV loop and 10 repetitions of 10 fold CV for the outer loop.\nAs the RF used pre-determined parameter values, only a single parameter had to be determined; the threshold on the continuous regression predictions necessary to generate binary labels. This threshold was selected based on performance in the 3/13 inner CV loop, using the R package OptimalCutoffs 30 to evaluate six potential cutoff metrics (Supplementary Methods) and selecting the method which maximized the accuracy over all of the test folds from the inner cross validation loops. The best performing cutoff criteria was then used in the current iteration of the outer cross-validation loop and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity derived from this threshold was recorded for that fold. While this approach means that a different method could be used to derive the regression threshold for each fold in the outer cross-validation, the resulting estimate of performance is unbiased and hence is likely to be more representative of performance on unseen data compared with selecting a threshold based on the entire set of training data."}, {"section_title": "Measures of model performance", "text": "Model performance was summarized by the mean and standard deviation of area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity from the testing performance across the different cross-validation runs.

The best performing model was selected for all subsequent analysis."}, {"section_title": "Discovery of smallest set of markers needed for strong predictive performance", "text": "After evaluating the impact of the different modalities, we determine the minimum set of individual analytes necessary to achieve high predictive performance. This was done by treating the number of included features as a parameter to be determined in our nested CV framework. Within each fold of the inner cross validation loop, we used a recursive feature elimination approach, ranking features according to their Variable Importance, the difference in the prediction error on the out-of-bag data when a given feature was permuted and unpermuted 31 , and removed the lowest ranking features in a stepwise fashion. The AUC of the resulting RF was recorded, and the procedure was repeated over increasingly smaller subsets of features until no features were left to be removed. After the inner CV loop finishes, we determine the number of features that achieved the optimal trade-off between model complexity and performance by selecting the smallest subset of features that achieved within 4% of the maximal observed AUC. A model using this subset of features was then trained on all training folds of the outer CV loop and evaluated on the test fold. Again, by determining the number of features to include within our nested cross-validation framework, we are able to determine an unbiased estimate of the model's expected performance over unseen data."}, {"section_title": "Survival Analysis", "text": "Survival analysis was conducted to determine if the rate of conversion from MCI to AD was different between those with predicted low and normal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels, enabling us to determine if our predictions lead to useful clinical outcomes in the validation cohort.\nFour separate analyses were performed: using the measured CSF status on the training set (n=198), and using the predicted CSF status from either the B, BP and BP f s , the feature selected model (model with the smallest set of features), in the validation set (n=198). For each analysis, we have examined the hazard ratios using Cox regression and used log-rank tests to compare the survival distribution of low/normal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 stratifications in the three analyses, as well to compare equivalence between the actual and predicted stratifications."}, {"section_title": "Validation performance over PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 status", "text": "In order to further validate our model, we have examined the ability of our model to differentiate PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 abnormal and normal status. While it is known that A\u03b2 1\u221242 status from PET can differ from that observed in CSF, measurements from the two modalities are correlated and should be very similar for individuals who are not close to the cutoff indicating pathology. This provides a further indication of our model's ability to determine A\u03b2 1\u221242 status in individuals in the validation cohort, where CSF measurements are not available.\nGiven that only a limited number of individuals had associated measures of PET imaging at baseline (n=18 and 27 for training and validation cohorts respectively), we have made use of the earliest PET image available, leaving us with 108 and 68 individuals in the training and validation cohort to evaluate.

If this assumptions do not hold, it is likely to worsen predictive performance, making this analysis somewhat conservative."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Models utilizing protein levels accurately predict CSF positivity", "text": "We evaluated the ability of blood-based biomarkers to predict CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 normal/abnormal status using RFs trained using different subsets of input variables, treating the modelling of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 as either a regression or binary task. Summaries of the performance metrics from the resulting models are shown in Table 2 with their corresponding ROC curves shown in Figure  1 .\nWe observed strong overall predictive performance for both the regression and binary tasks within our cross-validation framework. All sets of features outperformed the base model of age and APOE\u03b54 carrier status with BP based models leading to the highest AUC in both tasks of 0.84 and 0.83 for the regression and binary tasks respectively. Standard deviation for the AUC was relatively high (7-8%), likely due to the noise inherent in both the analytes being used for prediction as well as in the CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 measurements.\nThe BP models resulted in a mean R 2 of 0.29 for the regression task. The automatically derived threshold for this regression RF yielded a mean accuracy of 0.77, with a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.73. Across the 100 cross-validation runs, the chosen threshold ranged from 164pg/ml to 194pg/ml with a median of 185pg/ml. Similar AUC and accuracy could be observed for learning the dichotomized CSF labels directly (e.g AUC 0.83, accuracy 0.77 for the BP model). For the binary task, a slight drop in both AUC, as well as an altered trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, was observed across all different feature sets compared to the regression task. Given this, we chose to focus on the regression model for much of the follow-up analysis.\nWhile all sets of features outperformed the base model, models that made use of the protein level measurements consistently achieved the strongest predictive performance, whereas metabolites appeared to be of limited utility. In both the regression and binary tasks, models containing metabolites and proteomic data (BPM) achieved equivalent or worse AUCs than models containing only the proteomic data (BP). Furthermore, we observed that the use of the base features and metabolites alone (BM) lead to decreased performance compared to the baseline model, indicating that the set of measured metabolites may have contributed little predictive information or may have been too noisy to be useful for predicting CSF status. These findings are in contrast to the utility of metabolites in predicting PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 positivity 22 .\nWhile the results presented in this section include clinical diagnosed AD individuals, who are almost all CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 positive, it is worth considering only 'pre-clinical' individuals as this may be more relevant for selective screening in drug trials. Evaluating our model's performance on CN and MCI individuals only, we find that similarly strong predictive performance can be obtained (Supplementary Table 4 , Supplementary Figure 1 , AUC 0.80, Acc 0.77 for the BP model) supporting our primary findings that plasma protein levels can be utilized to predict amyloid pathology status.\nTo ensure that our imputation procedure did not bias our results, we also built similar models using only complete cases after applying more stringent QC (removal of plasma analytes where more than 1% of measurements were missing), obtaining similar AUCs of 0.81 for the regression and binary tasks ( Supplementary Figure 2 ).

In practice, measuring hundreds of analytes is costly, negating a key advantage of using blood biomarkers for screening. Given this, we have applied feature selection to the BP regression RF, the most parsimonious model while achieving high predictive performance, to identify the smallest number of features that still achieved high predictive performance. Within cross-validation, we find that the average performance of this feature selection approach, denoted BP f s , yields an AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.81, 0.81 and 0.63. The number of features selected in the model ranges from 2 to 15, with a median of 5 features included. When applying this feature selection procedure to the entire set of training data, we identified a subset of four plasma analytes as well as APOE4 genotype status critical for model performance: Chromogranin-A (CGA), A\u03b2 1\u221242 (AB42), Eotaxin 3, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE). This combination of protein levels, together with APOE\u03b54 is denoted as BP5. Figure 2 indicates how each variable influences the model predictions after we have accounted for the influence of all other variables. As expected, the strongest relationship with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 is with APOE\u03b54 carrier status, where being a carrier (APOE\u03b54 = 1) leads to a low predicted A\u03b2 1\u221242 level.

These survival distributions could then be compared to those of the real A\u03b2 1\u221242 status observed over the training cohort.

Comparing the predictions from the BP and BP5 models on the validation cohort to the actual CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status on the training cohort, we find that there is no significant difference between the survival distributions for either the normal (log-rank test p = 0.19, 0.2, 0.21) or abnormal (log-rank test p = 0.97, 0.31, 0.23) survival distributions, respectively, reflecting the overlapping confidence intervals of the hazard ratios.

While some AD clinical trials are enriching pre-symptomatic AD individuals with PET screening, recent findings that shifts in CSF amyloid can be observed up to a decade before those from PET may indicate that CSF positive individuals are more suitable for clinical trial enrichment 33 . Direct measurement of CSF biomarkers is too invasive to be used in such a screening test 34 . However, the development of a minimally-invasive, low-cost solution that provides the same type of information would overcome these limitations. This current study evaluates the utility of a blood-based signature of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status using a Random Forest approach. We demonstrated that CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 normal/abnormal status using age, APOE\u03b54 carrier status and protein levels can be predicted with a high AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.84, 0.78 and 0.73 respectively. Compared to the base model (age and APOE\u03b54 genotype) the inclusion of the plasma analytes improved the performance (AUC) by 6%. To make the model more suitable for clinical application, we identified four plasma analytes which, together with APOE\u03b54 carrier status, still achieved a high AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.81, 0.81 and 0.64 respectively. These predictive models were then validated on a separate cohort of individuals to demonstrate that MCI subjects with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 (low) levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis at a significantly higher rate than those predicted with normal CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels. Furthermore, these rates were similar to those observed in a demographically similar cohort of MCIs using actual CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels. This is a strong 8/13 validation of our modelling as the blood-based biomarkers for CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status is only useful if they can replicate the behavior of the actual A\u03b2 1\u221242 status for clinically relevant endpoints for individuals that were not used to build the predictive model. Strong predictive power of PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 status on the validation cohort provides further evidence for the generalizability and robustness of our modeling.\nA number of studies have previously investigated the use of blood analytes to predict the burden of amyloid in the neocortex, as measured by PET 15, 16, 18-20, 22, 23 . Some of these studies showed similar performance metrics to those reported in this work (> 0.80 AUCs 15, [23] [24] [25] or > 0.78 accuracy 17 ), indicating that prediction of PET and CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status are of similar difficulty. PET A\u03b2 is directly related to brain fibrillar amyloid, whereas CSF amyloid is a marker of soluble A\u03b2 1\u221242 and they may, therefore, give different insights into AD progression and mechanisms. For example, CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 has been shown to be associated with APOE\u03b54 whereas PET has been shown to have a greater association with tau 35 . Thus, the development of a blood-based screening test for CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels is a complementary approach to existing blood-based biomarkers of PET amyloid status.\nOf the above studies, the study by Nakamura et. al. 25 not only showed a very high AUC in a discover and independent validation dataset for PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 status (AUC 0.94 and 0.96 respectively), but also showed strong performance for predicting abnormalities in CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels (AUC 0.88%), in a small cohort (n=45) of their validation set. While these results are promising, the automation of the novel technique used (IP-MALDI-TOF-MS), and hence transfer to a clinician setting, is non-trivial, motivating the search for complementary approaches. The protein signature presented in this study, based on a multiplex immunoassay, is likely to require a far shorter timeframe for clinical translation given the high level of automation that already exists for multiplex immunoassays, and that biomarkers from such platform have already been used in commercially available diagnostic tests that have been approved by the FDA The use of metabolites appeared to be of limited utility for predicting CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 . In both the regression and binary tasks, models containing metabolites achieved equivalent or worse AUCs than models without.These findings can be contrast with the utility of metabolites in predicting PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 positivity 22 and their association with AD more broadly 36 . Alternative methods for integrating this source of data 37 , may be required in order to find robust associations with CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status.\nThe subset of features found to be critical for our BP5 Random Forest model included APOE\u03b54 genotype, Chromogranin-A (CGA), Eotaxin 3, A\u03b2 1\u221242 (AB42), C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma Apolipoprotein E levels (APOE). Several of these identified proteins have known associations with Alzheimer's disease.Unsurprisingly, the levels of plasma APOE are associated with CSF amyloid levels. APOE\u03b54 is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. APOE is involved in the clearance of A\u03b2 1\u221242 [38] [39] [40] and there is a strong relationship between APOE\u03b54 genotype and APOE plasma levels, where APOE\u03b54 carriers have lower plasma levels 41, 42 . Plasma A\u03b2 1\u221242 showed a positive relationship in our model for CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 , in line with a prior observation 43 . This is interesting, as the link between alterations of A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels in the blood and the progression of the disease is still controversial and studies assessing the A\u03b2 1\u221242 concentration in blood of AD patients have produced conflicting results [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Chromogranin A (CGA) is associated with synaptic function, and has traditionally been used as an indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 50 . More recent work has shown that CGA has a degree of co-localisation with amyloid plaques in the brain 51, 52 . However, levels of CGA in the CSF and blood serum do not appear to be correlated 53 , and serum CGA has not previously been linked to AD. Eotaxin 3, also known as C-C chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), plays an important role in the innate immune system and has been found to be dysregulated in AD patients 54 . CSF Eotaxin 3 has been shown to be significantly elevated in patients with prodromal AD, however, Eotaxin 3 levels in plasma or the CSF do not correlate with rates of disease progression 54, 55 This study has several limitations. The training and validation cohorts are both part of the ADNI study and thus all measures were conducted on the same platforms. Hence further cross-cohort and cross-platform replication is required. This remains an ongoing issue within the development of all AD biomarkers relating to early screening and requires significant future investment 56 . Furthermore, the current cohort is neuropathology biased, i.e. 84% of the cohort have MCI or AD, and thus likely to have neuronal damage, potentially confounding the analysis of CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 status. Finally, it needs to be noted that there are other medical conditions that are known to affect CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 levels and it is unclear whether these affect any of the patients in our cohort.\nThe early identification of AD disease is paramount and a major global focus as the success of disease-modifying or preventative therapies in AD may depend on detecting the earliest signs of abnormal amyloid-beta load. The differences between CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 and PET A\u03b2 1\u221242 in preclinical stages of AD could also have implications in clinical trial settings. Blood-based biomarkers of amyloid can serve as the first step in a multistage screening procedure, similar to those that have been clinically-implemented in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases 56 . In-conjunction with biomarkers for neocortical amyloid burden, the CSF A\u03b2 1\u221242 biomarkers presented in this work may help yield a cheap, non-invasive tool for both improving clinical trials targeting amyloid and population screening."}, {"section_title": "9/13", "text": ""}]
