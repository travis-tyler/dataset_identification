Less often discussed is the fact that gifted representation among students of color can vary markedly from school to school, even among schools with similar student demographic compositions. Some differences are attributable to state-to-state differences in gifted definitions and identification processes, but even within states (and even districts), variation in implementation of policy can lead to considerable disparity in rates of gifted identification (National Research Council, 2002) .\nRelatively few studies, however, have examined the school-level factors influencing the rates of placement in gifted programs across different student racial and ethnic groups (Ford, 1998; McBee, Shaunessy, & Matthews, 2012; McBee, 2006) . Motivated by the long literature on what is termed bureaucratic representation in political science, this study focuses on one particular set of potentially important factors: the demographic characteristics of the school's teachers and principal. Bureaucratic representation theory suggests that more descriptively representative public organizations-i.e., those whose employees share demographic characteristics with client populations-tend to more equitably distribute policy outputs among client groups (see AUTHOR, 2015; Kennedy, 2014; Meier, 1993) . The potential mechanisms are varied and include behavioral responses to descriptive representation by both bureaucrats-in this case, educators-and the clients (students and parents) themselves, including greater sensitivity of minority bureaucrats to minority client needs, advocacy by minority bureaucrats for organizational policies that ameliorate past disparities between minority and nonminority clients, and increased likelihood that minority clients seek out organizational services in the presence of bureaucrats \"like them\" (Lim, 2006) . Research suggests that often these mechanisms only surface when a \"critical mass\" of bureaucrats from a minority group are present in the organization (Henderson, 1979; Kanter, 1977; Thompson, 1976) .\nAssignment to gifted services may be a particularly likely place to observe the effects of representation because of the roles subjectivity and discretion play in the assignment process.\nExcept in the case of universal screening, which is employed in some systems (e.g., Card & Giuliano, 2014) , gifted assignment begins with referral for evaluation, typically by a classroom teacher, on the basis of the teacher's perception of the student's potential for giftedness (McBee, 2006) . We may expect teacher race or ethnicity to matter for which students are referred for testing because, for example, teachers of color may be more attuned to giftedness among racially and ethnically diverse students due to heightened sensitivity to cultural differences among students from different groups. This consideration may be especially important given evidence that teachers are less likely to perceive giftedness among students of color than among white students even when presented with evidence about the students that is otherwise similar (Elhoweris, Mutua, Alsheikh, & Holloway, 2005) . At the same time, parents from minority populations may feel more comfortable communicating with teachers from similar backgrounds and thus more likely to request that students be evaluated for gifted services. Once referred, students are formally tested using standardized assessments and other metrics, then often a placement committee, again consisting of teachers and other personnel, such as school psychologists, reviews the information gathered during evaluation and makes a final determination of whether the student should be officially designated as gifted (National Research Council, 2002) . Evaluation and placement decisions may present additional opportunities for teacher representation effects for students of color. For example, teachers of color may be more likely to express concern about evaluation procedures that disadvantage nonwhite students (e.g., IQ tests) and advocate for the use of multiple measures of giftedness or other changes to evaluation and placement procedures that improve the likelihood of the recognition of giftedness among students of color (Ford, Grantham, & Whiting, 2008; ; Joseph & Ford, 2006) .\nBureaucratic representation research has also found evidence that the race and ethnicity of managers in a public organization can affect the distribution of policy outputs (Grissom & Keiser, 2011; Meier & Stewart, 1992) , suggesting that principal race/ethnicity may have effects on the representation of students of color in a school's gifted programs as well. Although principals are less likely than teachers to be directly involved in gifted referral, evaluation, and placement decisions, recognition of inequities in assignment patterns among white and nonwhite students may make nonwhite principals more likely to shape school assignment practices to increase minority gifted representation. By implementing policies such as allowing gifted nominations from non-teachers, using multiple measures to evaluation giftedness, and providing multicultural training to teachers to help circumvent biases in the identification process, principals are positioned to influence minority representation within gifted programs (Harris et al., 2004; Joseph & Ford, 2006; Matthews & Shaunessy, 2010; McBee, Shaunessy, & Matthews, 2012) .\nInvestigation of connections between the diversity of a school's educators and the representation of students of color in gifted programs is particularly important in light of the growing mismatch between teacher and student demographics in American schools (AUTHOR, 2015; Boser, 2014) . Some earlier bureaucratic representation research has linked teacher workforce diversity to greater rates of gifted participation among black and Hispanic students, though this research has been published outside of education and remains unfamiliar to education scholars (e.g., Nicholson-Crotty, Grissom, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2011; Rocha & Hawes, 2009 ).\nThe purpose of this study is to build on and extend this prior work in several key ways. First, we investigate connections between teacher racial/ethnic diversity and gifted representation using the most recently available national data (from the 2011-12 school year) to test whether associations between teacher demographic characteristics and gifted composition observed with earlier data remain relevant and how they may have changed. More specifically, we ask: to what extent are the proportions of black and Hispanic teachers in a school associated with the racial composition of students assigned to gifted programs? Second, we investigate the critical mass phenomenon observed in representation studies in other organizational settings. That is, we ask:\nis there evidence that a critical number of teachers of color must be present in a school before teacher race/ethnicity becomes associated with the racial/ethnic composition of the school's gifted program? Third, we explore whether the race/ethnicity of the school's principal is associated with gifted representation, even after controlling for the characteristics of the teacher workforce, a possibility not considered in prior empirical work. Specifically, we ask whether schools with black or Hispanic principals have gifted programs that are more representative of students from those racial/ethnic backgrounds and, furthermore, whether principal race/ethnicity moderates the connection between teacher diversity and the composition of the school's gifted programs.\nWe begin by discussing bureaucratic representation theory as a framework for understanding the connection between the demographic diversity of a school's faculty and differential gifted placement rates for white students and students of color. We then discuss our data and methods before turning to a presentation of the study's results. The final section concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and practice in the area of gifted education and efforts to increase equity in the provision of school services more generally. We also discuss study limitations and ideas for future work."}, {"section_title": "Bureaucratic Representation Theory and Application to Gifted Placement", "text": "We draw on bureaucratic representation theory, a well-established theoretical framework in the fields of political science and public administration literature, to guide our investigation into how teacher and principal roles in the identification, referral, and evaluation processes for gifted programs may connect educator diversity to disparate rates of gifted placement across different racial groups. Representation scholarship begins from the observation that the composition of the public bureaucracy influences the implementation of public policy; that is, who the providers of government services are matters for how policy outputs are distributed. In particular, scholars examining a variety of contexts have repeatedly made empirical connections between descriptive representation in the bureaucratic workforce-that is, the degree to which public sector workers share demographic characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or gender with the populations they serve-and greater access to policy outputs for traditionally disadvantaged groups (AUTHOR, 2015) . As one example, in one study, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission field offices employing more black and Hispanic investigators were shown to bring a greater number of charges on behalf of black and Hispanic complainants (Hindera, 1993) .\nThese connections have also been made in prior research on representation in schools (see AUTHOR, 2015, for a review). Bureaucracy scholars have long looked towards teachers as quintessential street-level bureaucrats-government professionals who, like police officers or social workers, work directly with client populations (i.e., students and their families) in roles with substantial discretion and autonomy (Lipsky, 1980) -and thus viewed schools as verdant ground for testing many areas of bureaucratic theory. Work in this tradition has linked a larger presence of black and Hispanic teachers to improved treatment or outcomes for black and Hispanic students along a variety of dimensions, including lower rates of exclusionary discipline (Meier & Stewart, 1992; Grissom, Nicholson-Crotty, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2009 ), lower likelihood of placement in special education (Fraga, Meier, & England, 1986; Rocha & Hawes, 2009) , and higher pass rates on standardized tests (Meier, Wrinkle, & Polinard, 1999; Weiher, 2000) . Researchers also have linked teacher racial and ethnic diversity to placement rates for nonwhite students in gifted programs (Grissom, Nicholson-Crotty, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2009; Rocha & Hawes, 2009) , particularly in schools where nonwhite students are assigned very infrequently relative to their proportion in the overall school population (Nicholson-Crotty, Grissom, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2011) .\nResearchers have put forth a number of mechanisms through which descriptive representation provides substantive benefits for underserved client populations, including both direct actions by the minority bureaucrat and indirect effects minority bureaucrats may have on the behaviors of their colleagues or the client population itself (Lim, 2006) . We illustrate the main hypothesized mechanisms in the context of assignment to gifted services.\nThe mechanism most commonly set forth in the literature is that descriptive representation benefits minority clients because minority bureaucrats exercise discretion towards them in beneficial ways. Some scholars have expressed concern that this beneficial exercise of discretion simply reflects bias (Mosher, 1968) , as would be the case if an African American teacher, presented with a white and an African American student of similar capacities, was more inclined to refer the African American student for gifted evaluation. Others have suggested instead that shared demographic characteristics proxy for shared background, values, beliefs, or understanding, which may lead to discretionary actions by minority bureaucrats that benefit minority clients (Lim, 2006) . As an example, a Hispanic teacher may be more likely to refer a Hispanic student to gifted services because linguistic or cultural sensitivity better equips her to recognize giftedness in Hispanic students.\nOther mechanisms linking bureaucratic diversity to improved outcomes for minority client populations are indirect, operating through changes in the behaviors of others. A minority teacher may be more attuned to practices within the organization that disadvantage minority students and thus advocate for changes to those practices, either informally or formally. An example of the informal case is the nonwhite teacher who pushes her white colleagues to look closely at nonwhite students for signs of giftedness or provides them with some tips or ideas for assessing giftedness in culturally diverse students. In the more formal case, a nonwhite teacher may be more likely to recognize bias towards nonwhite students in tests used for gifted evaluation and advocate for the school to use a different test (Ford, Grantham, & Whiting, 2008) .\nIn both instances, the presence of nonwhite teachers in the school benefited nonwhite students by nudging the environment in a direction that increased their probability of success.\nDescriptive representation may also benefit minority clients indirectly by changing the behaviors of the clients themselves. A Hispanic parent may be more likely to approach her child's Hispanic teacher to request that the student be referred for gifted services, for example, if shared language or culture increases the parent's comfort in making the request. Students with teachers of similar demographic backgrounds may also perform better on assessments that make gifted identification more likely. This demographic similarity may improve testing outcomes via a role modeling effect, wherein students work harder to gain approval from teachers like them (Lim, 2006) , or by reducing stereotype threat, a psychological impediment to performance based on anxiety around stereotypes, which may be more salient in the presence of other-race teachers (Dee, 2005) .\nOther research on representation in organizations suggests that the impact of descriptive representation on outcomes for diverse clients is unlikely in the absence of a critical mass, or numerical threshold, of bureaucrats from the minority group (Henderson, 1979; Kanter, 1977; Thompson, 1976) . These scholars focus on the impact minority bureaucrats can have on organizational policies or practices, suggesting that only when minorities have enough of a presence can they build internal support to effect change (Henderson, 1979; Thompson, 1976) .\nRepresentation effects will thus be nonlinear, and in fact a pattern consistent with a critical mass condition was observed in Hindera's study of EEOC complaints (see Hindera & Young, 1998) .\nThe threshold for when descriptive representation is likely to matter is unclear. Kanter (1977) proposed that the minority group must comprise 15% of the organizational workforce before descriptive representation would produce substantive effects. Critical mass effects have largely gone ignored in studies of schools, with the exception of one study by Meier (1993) , which found some evidence that the presence of Hispanic principals (but not teachers) begins to have a positive association with student disciplinary and achievement outcomes only once they comprise between 16 and 26 percent of school leaders. No studies of which we are aware have examined the critical mass idea in the context of gifted assignment.\nStudies similarly have overlooked the potential for representation effects on gifted outcomes for school principals. Principals may influence gifted assignments in their schools by implementing referral and evaluation policies that may increase rates of placement for underrepresented groups. For example, students in Florida who attended schools with alternative policies in place to increase gifted representation by nonwhite students had nearly twice the probability of being identified as gifted as students attending schools without these plans (McBee, Shaunessy, & Matthews, 2012 ), illustrating a school-level policy change via which principals might affect the gifted participation of students of color. It is also possible that nonwhite principals could encourage referral of students of color by providing professional development to teachers on recognizing giftedness for underserved groups or implementing a systematic screening process to increase opportunities for identification. A nonwhite principal's presence could also make the parent of a student of color more comfortable in requesting a referral form for their child. Some limited empirical evidence suggests that minority principals are associated with improved schooling outcomes for minority students in such areas as referral to special education or graduation rates (Meier, 1993; Meier & Stewart, 1992; Pitts, 2005) . This work suggests that attention to possible principal representation effects in gifted assignments is warranted as well."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We pair two years of nationally representative data from two sources: the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and survey data collected by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the 2003-04 school year and again in 2011-12, referred to in the remainder of the study as 2004 and 2012, respectively. We supplement these data with additional district-and school-level information from the Common Core of Data (CCD). SASS uses a stratified sampling method to gather information on demographic characteristics, organizational processes, and attitudes of principals and a random selection of teachers for each school. We merge the SASS data with survey data administered by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which also uses a stratified random sampling method to collect information on academic grouping, discipline, and educational attainment disaggregated by gender and race from approximately schools. Given that students are substantially more likely to be identified for gifted services in elementary school, we restrict our sample to U.S. public elementary schools with gifted programs that can be matched between the two samples, then further restrict the analytic sample to non-charter, non-magnet schools. The final sample size is 2,170 schools.\nApproximately 6.2% of elementary students were designated as gifted in the matched sample in both waves of data.

The composition index of Hispanic students, for example, is simply the number of Hispanic gifted students in the school divided by the total number of gifted students. Using OCR data, we calculate composition indices for white, black, and Hispanic students. As Table 1 shows, the composition of the average elementary school gifted population within the pooled sample is approximately 72% white, 9% black, and 10% Hispanic, in contrast to the composition of the average elementary school population at large, which in these data is 62% white, 14% black, and 15% Hispanic.\n2 These pooled averages, however, mask important changes between the samples over the two waves.

These percentages are, on average, 4%, 6%, and 88%, Approximately 5% of principals in the sample are Hispanic, 10% are black, and 88% are white.\nPrincipal race stayed constant across both waves of data for Hispanic and black principals, but the percentage of white principals increased slightly from 87% to 89% (p < 0.10)."}, {"section_title": "Control Variables", "text": "Models include control variables to account for other factors that might explain variation in assignment to gifted programs. Aside from the fraction of all students in the school assigned to gifted programs-which comes from OCR data-and locale (e.g., urban) and expenditure information-which are from the CCD-control variables are primarily taken from SASS. We include the percentage of all students who are black and the percentage who are Hispanic because the proportion of these populations should be highly correlated with the proportion of students in gifted programs. We also include the percentage of students within a school that are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) because these students are less likely to be placed in gifted programs (McBee, 2006) . The percentage of students who are eligible for FRPL increased significantly from approximately 46% in 2004 to 50% in 2012 (p < 0.01). We control for school size, district size, and locale type because these factors may be associated with standardization of gifted identification, referral, and testing processes and different levels of discretionary academic grouping. We note that the percent of students who attended schools in various locales changed significantly between the two waves of data. The percentage of students attending schools in cities declined from 33% to 20% (p < 0.01) while the percentage of students in rural areas increased from 23% to 33% (p < 0.01). The percentage of students attending schools in suburban areas or small towns remained relatively constant across both waves of data.\nThe observable differences likely stem from changes in urban locale codes within the CCD across 2004 and 2012. 3 In addition, the average district size decreased significantly between the two waves, from more than 35,000 students to just less than 22,000 (p < 0.01). Per pupil expenditure in constant 2012 dollars is included as a control for school resources, which may influence the size of a school's gifted program; this value significantly increased from approximately $10,850 in 2004 to $11,530 in 2012 (p < 0.01)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We estimate a series of ordinary least squares regression models where the dependent variable is the percentage of gifted students in one of three different race or ethnicity groups (Hispanic, black, or white).

We cluster standard errors at the districtlevel to correct for correlated errors within districts.

Therefore, to observe the zero-sum trade-off, we also model the relationship between black and Hispanic teachers on the composition index of white students in gifted programs.\nAdditionally, we test for the moderating influence of the principal's race, investigating the hypothesis that teachers of a certain race will have a stronger influence over the racial composition of the school's gifted program when the principal is also from a minority group. To do so, interactions between the percentage of teachers who are of a certain race (black or Hispanic) and the dummy for whether the principal is of that same race or (black or Hispanic)\nare included in the model.\nFinally, we test for critical mass effects by entering teacher race/ethnicity percentages as a series of categorical variables defined over discrete ranges (e.g., 1-5%, 6-10%, and so forth).\nThese dummy variables allow us to examine whether the association between the percentage of teachers who are of a certain race and the placement of students of color into gifted programs is nonlinear.

Also, the total percentage of gifted students in a school is positively related to the composition index for Hispanic students (\u03b2 = 0.09, p < 0.01).

The race/ethnicity of the principal, however, shows no evidence of a relationship with the proportion of gifted students who are Hispanic.\nColumn 2 shows results for black students, and again the coefficients for Hispanic and black teachers are similar to those in the related model in Table 2 . Here, the presence of a black principal has a significantly positive association with the percent of gifted students who are black (\u03b2 = 3.76, p < 0.05), meaning that the presence of a black principal is associated with approximately a 3.8 percentage point increase in the share of gifted students who are black.

Consistent with prior research outside education (e.g., Rocha & Hawes, 2009 ), our analysis shows that descriptive representation among an elementary school's faculty and leadership is associated with greater access to gifted programs for black and Hispanic students. In a large, national data set spanning two time points, larger percentages of black teachers in the school correlate to increased gifted representation among black students. The relationship between Hispanic teacher representation and Hispanic student presence in the school's gifted program is of an almost identical magnitude. At the same time, gains for blacks and Hispanics in schools with more diverse teaching faculties appear to come at the expense of white students, though prior research suggests that this tradeoff only occurs in schools where nonwhite students are very underrepresented (Nicholson-Crotty, Grissom, & Nicholson-Crotty, 2011) . We also find evidence of non-linearities in these relationships; a critical mass of racial ethnic minority teachers-in the range of 20% to 30%-may be necessary before descriptive representation translates into differences in outcomes for students in assignment to gifted programs.\nOur results also demonstrate an association between principal race and the composition of gifted programs. Schools with black principals have significantly higher gifted representation among black students. The presence of a black principal is associated with a 3.8% increase in black representation in the school's gifted program, equivalent to the gain associated with increasing the school's cadre of black teachers by 13%. Associations between teacher representation and assignment of black students to gifted programs are stronger in these schools as well. However, we uncovered no parallel results for Hispanic principals and students, though we note that only about 5% of the schools in our sample were led by a Hispanic principal, potentially limiting the power to distinguish such relationships.\nThese results point towards a greater need to understand the implications of teacher declining. An implication of this study is that failure of the public school system to recruit Hispanic teachers and principals at increasing rates may have consequences for the educational services provided to Hispanic students, at least in the area of gifted programs.\nOf course, diversification of the educator workforce is not the only means for ensuring greater access to gifted services for students of color. Universal screening and the use of multiple measures of giftedness are examples of strategies that can help increase equity in access to gifted programs (Ford, 1995) . Such strategies are unlikely to eliminate the role of teacher discretion in the gifted assignment, evaluation, and placement processes, however, which means that training and professional development aimed at breaking the connection between teacher race/ethnicity and differential access for students by, for example, helping teachers recognize giftedness among students from diverse cultural backgrounds, may be necessary for combatting gifted underrepresentation among students of color.\nThis last point speculative, however, highlighting the need for additional research to understand why teacher and principal race are associated with differential assignment. Certainly different capacities for teachers to identify giftedness among students of the same race or ethnicity is a potential mechanism, but there are many others, including different assignment practices employed by schools with more diverse teachers, role modeling effects that elicit greater evidence of giftedness among students of color, and greater propensities for parents to engage with the school around gifted identification and evaluation when connected to teachers or principals of the same demographic background (AUTHOR, 2015; Lim, 2006) . Moreover, we cannot be sure whether teacher or principal race becomes a salient characteristic during the identification, referral, evaluation, or placement stage, or some combination. Future research employing student-level data or more detailed data on gifted placement processes within and across schools can further elucidate the empirical linkage to which this study draws attention.\nThe study faces limitations beyond the depth of the data it utilizes. Most importantly, the analysis relies on regression methods that do not warrant causal conclusions about the relationship between educator demographic characteristics and the representation of students of color in gifted programs. We cannot be sure that increasing the numbers of black teachers in a school, for example, will affect the school's gifted population or over what time frame, only that elementary schools with higher percentages of black teachers have higher rates of gifted participation among black students, conditional on other variables in our models. These results could be driven by other factors we cannot observe. For example, schools in more progressive districts may place a priority on ensuring diversity both in teaching and in student programs, or schools that emphasize equity among students may have an easier time attracting teachers and principals of color. Although a large body of research on representation suggests that educator diversity can lead to differential schooling outcomes for students of color, and quasiexperimental research examining other outcomes finds evidence consistent with this idea (e.g., Dee, 2005) , additional research is necessary to substantiate a causal relationship.\nEven in the absence of a causal linkage, the patterns we document in this article should raise concerns among advocates for equity, in gifted services and beyond. A correlation between the racial or ethnic composition of a school's faculty and the racial and ethnic composition of its gifted program suggests that a child's access to gifted services is a function of a school characteristic over which he or she has little control and which bears little apparent relationship to whether or not the child is indeed gifted. This study lays a foundation for education researchers to dig more into this important empirical connection and for policymakers to begin to consider steps that might be taken to ensure that gifted students receive gifted services regardless of such school contextual variables.\nAppendix Standard errors clustered at the district level shown in parentheses. *(p<0.10), **(p<0.05), ***(p<0.01).

Samples limited to schools containing between 1% and 99% of students in each DV group. Reported sample sizes rounded to the nearest 10 per NCES nondisclosure rules. 2 Note that these percentages are not weighted by the number of students in the school and thus are not the same as the percentages in the gifted or total student population.\n3 CCD uses locale codes as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). In 2005 and 2006, NCES supported work by the Census Bureau to redesign the original locale codes in light of changes to the U.S. population and the definition of key geographic concepts. As a result, locale codes from a 8-value system to a more detailed 12-value system, with some schools designated to different levels of urbanicity across both locale code schemes. We chose to collapse locale codes across both waves into larger categories representing city, suburban, small town, and rural locales. Where possible, we use the 2004 locale codes for all schools within our sample and 2012 locale codes for schools that do not appear in the 2004 CCD, however, regression results are not sensitive to alternate methods of construction for our urbanicity control."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "We interacted the year 2012 with both the teacher percentage (Hispanic and black) variables and the principal (Hispanic and black) variables to explore whether the relationship between percentage of teachers of a minority racial/ethnic group and percentage of gifted students who share the same racial/ethnic group remains relatively constant across the two years, controlling for district and school factors. The results for these separate regressions are shown in Table A .1 (teachers only with covariates) and Table  A .2 (teachers and principals with covariates). We used an F test to examine the joint statistical significance of these interaction terms. The null hypothesis that all were 0 could generally not be rejected for either set of regressions at conventional levels (with the exception of the white student model that included both teacher and principal interactions, which was marginally significant (p = .09). Overall, these results point to little evidence that the associations we examine differ between 2004 and 2012 (see also Figures 2 and 3) . Therefore, we chose to proceed with a pooled sample for our analyses and include year fixed effects in our main models."}]
