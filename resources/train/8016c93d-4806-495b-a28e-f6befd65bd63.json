Briefly, the cognitively healthy elderly were enrolled since 2009 from the population-based EPIC cohort. 1 Cognitive impairment was ruled out using a cognitive test battery and by the assessment of physicians experienced in dementia disorders. At the time of the analysis, the longitudinal data had not yet been assembled and evaluated for the healthy controls. The MCS patients were between 60-80 years, had been referred to one of three participating memory clinics in Sweden due to perceived cognitive impairment, did not fulfill any dementia criteria, had an MMSE score of 24-30, spoke Swedish fluently and did not have other condition that clearly could explain the cognitive impairment. For more details about the inclusion and exclusion criteria, see www.biofinder.se. Only subjects with a complete A\u03b2 PET scan and CSF analysis were eligible for the present study. From cohort 2, patients who had converted to AD dementia (hereafter refered to as MCI-AD) were selected for the present study. The follow-up diagnosis (AD at the dementia stage) was determined by a consensus group (KN, PJ, SP), which reviewed the follow-up diagnoses in September 2014 according to the criteria for 1 Supplementary text probable AD. 2 The consensus group was blinded to all biomarker data. The patients were classified as having MCI based on a neuropsychological battery assessing the cognitive domains of verbal ability, visuospatial construction, episodic memory, and executive functions, as well as the clinical assessment of a senior neuropsychologist (S.V.). Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was defined as those in the MCS cohort who did not fulfill the criteria for MCI. At baseline in the MCS cohort, 3 (9%) had SCD and 31 (91%) had MCI at baseline (48% amnestic single-domain, 39% amnestic multi-domain and 12% non-amnestic).\nThus, for this analysis, 3 patients with SCD at baseline were included in the MCI-AD group."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 PET scanning and analysis", "text": "The cerebral A\u03b2 burden of the patients was visualized using"}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "F-flutemetamol PET. 3, 4 PET/CT scanning of the whole brain was conducted at two sites using the same type of scanner, a Philips Gemini TF 16. PET sum images from 90-110 min post injection were generated describing the average uptake of 18 F-flutemetamol over this time span. MRI data were not involved since they do not improve the quantification of 18 F-flutemetamol data. 5 The images were analyzed using the software NeuroMarQ provided by GE Healthcare. A volume of interest (VOI) template was applied for the following 9 bilateral regions: prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal, medial temporal, sensorimotor, occipital, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus and a global neocortical composite region. 5 The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was defined as the regional tracer uptake in a VOI, normalized for the mean uptake in the cerebellar cortex."}, {"section_title": "CSF analysis", "text": "The procedure and analysis of the CSF followed the Alzheimer's Association Flow Chart for CSF biomarkers. 6 Lumbar CSF samples were collected at the three centers, stored in 1 ml "}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Differences between the controls and MCI-AD groups were calculated with the MannWhitney U test (Table 1 ). The area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the continuous CSF and PET variables ( Table 2 ). The 95% confidence interval (CI) and significance for differences between the AUCs were calculated using bootstrap techniques 8 , with 5000 bootstrap replicas. The AUCs of the combined CSF and PET variables were derived from logistic regression analysis.\nCutoffs were established for all CSF and PET variables using Gaussian mixture modeling applied on the study population, which produces cutoffs that are completely unbiased by the underlying diagnosis. 9 Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated based on the investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2.\nTo date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in 4 Supplementary text the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

Briefly, all subjects included in ADNI-2 were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, had completed at least 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, and were free of any significant neurologic disease other than Alzheimer's disease. Control subjects had Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \u226524, and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score 0. MCI subjects had MMSE score \u2265 24, objective memory loss as shown on scores on delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (>0.5 standard deviations below the normal mean), CDR 0.5, preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia.\n5"}]
