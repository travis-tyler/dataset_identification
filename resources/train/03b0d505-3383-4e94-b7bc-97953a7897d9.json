[{"section_title": "Technology Adoption Updates from ARMS", "text": "Recent data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey highlight the extent of precision technology adoption among producers. For example, cotton producers adopted satellite-driven guidance systems on about 6 percent of planted area in 2003, similar to adoption levels reported by corn and soybean producers in previous years. However, cotton producers had not adopted other precision agriculture technologies, such as yield monitors and yield maps, to the same extent as producers of corn, wheat, and soybeans.

Users can access per capita food availability data (also known as U.S. food supply data or disappearance data) for all commodities through 2003, either by downloading spreadsheets or using the newly expanded custom database to develop tables or charts for specific food groups, commodities, and years. For the first time, spreadsheets are now available on per capita servings and can be compared with servings recommendations for the U.S. population.

The increasing complexity of global agricultural markets is also analyzed, including the economic implications of food safety, intellectual property rights, and regional trading arrangements.

As the official statement of Federal nutrition policy, the Dietary Guidelines influence nutrition education, labeling, and regulations for Federal food assistance and nutrition programs. Updated every 5 years, the 2005 Dietary Guidelines continue to recommend including foods from all the major food groups, while balancing calories to avoid overweight. New emphases include recommendations to consume at least three servings of wholegrain foods daily, and to eat more fruit, dark-green and orange vegetables, legumes, and low-fat and nonfat dairy products. These increases should be balanced by decreasing intake of saturated fats, added sugars, and refined grains. USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion is updating its food guidance system, popularly known as the Food Guide Pyramid, to reflect the 2005 Dietary Guidelines. ERS is examining the potential impact of the guidelines on agriculture and food processing.
