Abnormal A\u03b2 levels and aggregation of oligomeric A\u03b2 peptides in the brain are thought to trigger a cascade of events that leads to synapse and neuron loss, progressive cognitive impairment and ultimately dementia.\nThe two major A\u03b2 species (A\u03b2 x- 40 and A\u03b2 x-42 ) are produced by sequential endoproteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase complex. Amyloid precursor protein can also undergo non-amyloidogenic proteolysis by \u03b1-secretase, which cleaves APP within the A\u03b2 sequence and thereby precludes A\u03b2 generation. 1 Although APP metabolism has been extensively studied, it is likely that some of the factors involved in this complex process have yet to be identified and characterized.\nBeyond the role of A\u03b2 peptides in the AD process, little is known about their physiological roles which seem to be highly pleiotropic. Several lines of evidence suggest that A\u03b2 peptides have a broad spectrum of biological functions: (i) they are produced by many different cell types; (ii) they are present in peripheral tissues as well as in the brain; (iii) they may act as ligands for various receptors and other molecules; 2, 3 (iv) they variously display neurotrophic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, vasoconstrictive and platelet aggregation-modulating properties at physiological concentrations.\nWith a view to identifying novel factors involved in APP metabolism and characterizing A\u03b2-related physiological and pathophysiological processes, we hypothesized that A\u03b2 peptides concentrations in biological fluids may constitute a suitable endophenotype for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We decided to focus on plasma A\u03b2 peptides concentrations for several reasons: (i) plasma samples are easy to collect and thus facilitate meta-analyses of individuals with both A\u03b2 peptides concentrations and GWAS data; (ii) plasma A\u03b2 peptides are associated with risk of incident dementia and hypertension; [9] [10] [11] [12] (iii) plasma A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 levels are heritable traits. 13 Within this context, we developed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of four studies totaling 3 528 healthy individuals of European descent and for whom plasma A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 peptides levels had been assayed."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Populations", "text": "The three-city (3C) study. The 3C study is a prospective cohort study of vascular risk factors for dementia. The methodology of the study has been described in detail elsewhere. 14 The 3C study's protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee at Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre University Hospital (Paris). In 1999-2000, a sample of 9 294 community dwellers aged 65 and over was selected from the electoral rolls of three French cities: Bordeaux (n = 2 104), Dijon (n = 4 931) and Montpellier (n = 2 259). Of these, 880 participants were excluded due to lack of a blood sample or lack of participation in any of the follow-up examinations. This left a sample of 8 414 participants. A case-cohort study (3C1) was performed after 4 years of follow-up, in order to investigate non-standard risk markers for dementia, stroke and coronary heart disease. 10 This sub-cohort was composed of 1 254 participants randomly selected in strata according to center, age (in 5-year age groups) and gender. Participants diagnosed with prevalent dementia at baseline or incident dementia during follow-up were excluded from the present analysis. Participants for whom at least one plasma A\u03b2 concentration or covariate was missing and participants with an aberrant plasma A\u03b2 concentration (more than four standard deviations above or below the mean) were also excluded. Finally, we excluded individuals of non-European descent or with missing genetic information. These selection steps allowed us to define a sample of 909 individuals. Another subset of 1 169 participants from the 3C Dijon Center (3C2) in whom plasma A\u03b2 levels had been recently assayed was also available. A sample of 911 individuals was analyzed after application of the selection steps mentioned above.\nThe Rotterdam study. The Rotterdam study is an ongoing, prospective, population-based cohort study investigating risk factors and incidence of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, locomotor and ophthalmological diseases in elderly people. 15, 16 From 1990-1993, all 10 275 residents of Ommoord (a district of Rotterdam) aged 55 years or older were invited to participate in an extensive home interview and two visits to the research center; 7 983 (78%) agreed. At the baseline clinical examination, blood samples were drawn from 7 050 individuals, of whom 7 047 underwent screening for dementia. Prevalent dementia was diagnosed in 334 of the latter. Hence, the cohort at risk of dementia comprised 6 713 participants. A random sub-cohort of 1 756 people was drawn from this source population for plasma A\u03b2 concentration assessment. 9 Individuals for whom at least one plasma A\u03b2 concentration or co-variable measurement was missing were excluded, leading to final analysis set of 1 490 individuals.\nThe Pittsburgh cardiovascular health study cognition study (CHS-CS). This study began in 1992-1994, at the time when the participants underwent an initial brain MRI scan. 17 In 2002-2003, the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosed in 1998-1999 in the CHS-CS population was determined. Of the 924 participants examined in 1992--1994, a total of 532 normal and MCI participants were available for study in 1998-1999. These participants had undergone annual cognitive tests from 1989-1990 to 1998-1999 The Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative study (ADNI). The ADNI study is a prospective, multicentre, longitudinal neuroimaging study that was launched in the USA in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations. 18 It includes 819 adult participants aged 55-90 who fulfilled the entry criteria (a clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI, probable AD or cognitively normal). The collected data encompasses clinical information, neuroimaging data and biological samples for molecular biomarker measurement (for more details, see http://www.adni-info.org). We further classified participants as 'stable' if they did not change their diagnostic status from cognitively normal to MCI/AD or from MCI to AD during a follow-up period of at least 36 months. Participants other than stable cognitively normals were excluded.

As expected, plasma A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations were strongly correlated in each study and significantly differed across studies (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) P-values o 10 \u2212 16 for plasma A\u03b2 1-42 and A\u03b2 1-40 concentrations, see Supplementary Material Table 3 ). This latter observation led us to transform plasma A\u03b2 levels into z-scores for each study. In each population, associations between A\u03b2 1-42 or A\u03b2 1-40 levels and SNPs were then evaluated in linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, center and principal components.

QQ plots of the P-values were then generated (see Supplementary Material Figure 1 ). For both A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 , no inflation of P-values was observed; the overall genomic inflation factors (lambda) were 1.02 for A\u03b2 1-42 and 0.99 for A\u03b2 .\nManhattan plots of plasma A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 1-42 P-values are presented in Figure 1 . Although none of the meta-analyzed SNPs attained genome-wide significance (P-valueso 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ), several suggestive signals (with P-values between 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 and 1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 ) were identified. The SNPs with the lowest P-value in these loci are presented in Table 2 (see also detailed results in Supplementary Material Table 4 and forest plots and regional association plots in Supplementary Material Figures 2 to 19 ). We were unable to set up a replication stage due to the low number of available cohorts with both GWAS and plasma A\u03b2 concentration data. We therefore decided to develop a number of complementary statistical, bioinformatics and biological approaches to assess the relevance of our results.\nWe first hypothesized that the genetic determinants of plasma A\u03b2 concentrations were clustered within one or more specific biological pathways, rather than being randomly distributed. This type of analysis can indicate relevant pools of genes likely to genetically modulate APP metabolism and thus can provide clues about the function of A\u03b2 peptides and APP. Hence, we generated a list of 1 762 genes containing at least one SNP associated with both plasma A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 1-42 (P o 0.05) concentrations with the same direction of effect. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we observed 27 significantly enriched canonical pathways (out of 287) after multiple testing correction. These results are presented in Table 2 . Interestingly, some of the pathways have been already described as being involved in APP metabolism (e.g., protein kinase A signaling and netrin signaling). [31] [32] [33] [34] Other pathways appear to be related to potential physiological functions of APP in the brain (e.g., axonal guidance signaling; see Supplementary Material Table 6) 35,36 or directly associated with A\u03b2 peptides' properties, for example, blood pressure modulation (reninangiotensin signaling). 11 As pathway analyses depend on the tool, algorithm and pathway database used, we attempted to confirm our findings using the Webgestalt software. As a result, we observed 120 gene ontology categories significantly enriched (P o 0.05 after correction) (See Table 2 for the most significant pathways). In line with the IPA findings, most of the significantly enriched pathways were related to potential physiological functions of APP in the brain and particularly, axonal guidance (see Supplementary Material Table 7 for the list of genes associated with A\u03b2 plasma level and involved in this pathway). Genome-wide association study of plasma A\u03b2 V Chouraki et al\nTo account for the eventuality of an artificial enrichment due to linkage disequilibrium between SNPs, we repeated IPA and Webgestalt analyses after filtering SNPs with r 2 value \u2a7e 0.5 when comparing different SNPs. This resulted in the exclusion of three and four SNPs, respectively, and we were still able to identify axon guidance pathways displaying the overrepresentation of genes associated with A\u03b2 plasma levels in our GWA data set (data not shown). We finally assessed the degree of consistency among data sets. We did not independently test CHS and ADNI because of their restricted sample size, and focused on results obtained from the Rotterdam study and in the combined 3C study. We observed consistent results among these data sets. For instance, using IPA, the Axonal guidance pathway was enriched in both Rotterdam and 3C studies (respectively, P = 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 and P = 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 after multiple testing correction). A similar observation was obtained using Webgestalt (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 in 3C and 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 in Rotterdam after multiple testing correction).\nWe next took the gene most strongly associated with the plasma A\u03b2 1-42 level (cortexin 3, CTXN3) in the meta-analysis and studied its influence on APP metabolism at the biological level. The results are presented in Figure 2 . We tested the effect of CTXN3 overexpression on A\u03b2 peptide secretion in a HEK cell line that stably expressed the APP 695wt isoform. Following CTXN3 overexpression, A\u03b2 1-42 secretion was significantly lower than in control experiments (37% lower; P = 0.02). A trend in the same direction was observed for A\u03b2 secretion (27% lower, P = 0.10). Furthermore, we observed colocalization of APP and CTXN3 in HEK293 cells overexpressing both proteins. In order to control partially for potential biases due to proteins overexpression, we repeated the immunofluorescence experiments from endogenous APP and overexpressed CTXN3 in HEK293 cells (HEK293 cells do not express CTXN3). We still observed colocalization of APP and CTXN3 in this model. In conclusion, these data suggest that CTXN3 may lead to a decrease in A\u03b2 peptide production by directly modulating APP metabolism.\nFinally, we tried to replicate previously reported associations between SNPs and plasma A\u03b2 1-42 levels and explored whether SNPs associated with cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of A\u03b2 or AD risk would also be associated with plasma A\u03b2 levels (see Table 3 and Supplementary Material Table 8 ). Only rs2075650, located in the APOE locus presented nominal level of association with plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations (P-value = 2.81 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2 ; see Table 3 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "To our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first genomewide association meta-analysis of plasma A\u03b2 concentrations in non-demented participants. Although we did not observe any genome-wide significant locus, we identified 18 suggestive loci. Pathway analyses showed enrichment of canonical pathways involved in neuronal functions, for example, axonal guidance signaling. We also assessed the biological impact of the gene most strongly associated with plasma A\u03b2 1-42 levels (cortexin 3, CTXN3) on APP metabolism in vitro and found that the gene protein was able to modulate A\u03b2 1-42 secretion.\nSet-up and performance of the study was subject to several methodological and technological limitations. First, environmental factors modulating A\u03b2 plasma concentrations are poorly known. Thus, it is difficult to assess whether differences in alimentary habits or in medications across samples could influence our results. Second, plasma A\u03b2 concentrations were assayed using Genome-wide association study of plasma A\u03b2 V Chouraki et al different approaches and thus were not fully comparable. Therefore, we transformed the data into z-scores prior to the statistical analyses to minimize between-center variability. Third, few previous studies had both plasma A\u03b2 concentrations and GWAS data available at the time of this study. This limited the power of our meta-analysis and we failed to generate results that were statistically significant on the genome-wide scale. Given the high number of association tests usually performed in GWASs, the Genome-wide association study of plasma A\u03b2 V Chouraki et al likelihood of false-positive results is high and is mitigated by applying highly conservative alpha-risk corrections (e.g., the Bonferroni correction in many cases). Furthermore, our results may be influenced by the simultaneous involvement of many biological processes modulating A\u03b2 peptide concentrations in plasma (e.g., peptide production, secretion, degradation and/or clearance); this would have weakened our ability to detect significant genome-wide signals. Finally, the main limitation of our study relates to the difficulty in obtaining relevant replication samples; this made it impossible for us to discriminate between false and true positives. One option would have been to split our data sets between discovery and replication stages. However, we considered that an excessively underpowered discovery stage would have led to a large number of false negatives. Given these caveats, we used complementary approaches. The first was based on pathway enrichment analyses using the IPA software. The most enriched canonical pathway was protein kinase A signaling, which had already been described as modulator of APP metabolism. 31, 32 Remarkably, we also observed that a large proportion of the enriched canonical pathways were involved in neuronal functions and development. This is in line with the reported involvement of APP and its metabolites in neurogenesis and synapse formation/function. [35] [36] [37] Furthermore, we observed that canonical pathway renin-angiotensin signaling was enriched in genes associated with plasma A\u03b2 concentrations. This is of particular interest, as blood pressure modulation is one of the suspected physiological functions of A\u03b2 peptides. 5, 11 With importance, we confirmed the enrichment of pathway involved in the development of neurons and in neuronal functions using the Webgestalt software.\nThe existence of equilibrium between plasma and brain A\u03b2 peptides is debated even if some evidences seems to indicate that plasma A\u03b2 peptides do not reflect a dynamic equilibrium between brain, CSF and plasma compartments. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] One can argue that actors of the APP metabolism driving A\u03b2 peptide production and/ or degradation are not the same between organs/compartments. However, we detected enrichment of pathways in axon guidance using two different tools (IPA and Webgestalt) and a list of 1 762 genes containing at least one SNP associated with both plasma A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 1-42 (P o 0.05) concentrations with the same direction of effect. We indeed postulate that correlation between plasma A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 are representative of physiological processes leading to A\u03b2 peptide productions (i.e., amyloid precursor protein metabolism). Of note, we observed, as expected, strong correlation between plasma A\u03b2 1-40 and A\u03b2 (Supplementary Table 3 ). Taken together, these observations indicate that we were able to detect processes involved in neuronal development although working on plasma phenotype. This suggests that mechanisms controlling A\u03b2 peptide production and/or degradation could be in part constant across organs/compartments. As a consequence, analyzing such a plasma phenotype appears to be relevant to search for cerebral actors of the APP metabolism.\nOur second approach was based on biological relevance and determination of whether genes corresponding to our best signals might be directly involved in APP metabolism. We noticed that the disabled homolog 1 (DAB1) gene was associated with plasma A\u03b2 concentrations in our GWAS. The corresponding protein is a partner of APP and has been described as a modulator of metabolism. 44, 45 In addition to characterizing genes known to be involved in A\u03b2 peptides production, we also focused on the best signal obtained for plasma A\u03b2 concentration. This locus contained the CTXN3 gene, the product of which had not previously been described as a modulator of APP metabolism. We showed that CTXN3 overexpression was associated with significantly lower A\u03b2 secretion and that CTXN3 may co-localize with APP. Nevertheless, little is known about the CTXN3 protein (described for the first time in 2007): it has a single membranespanning domain and appears to be expressed only in the kidney and in the brain. 46 Another interesting gene of this locus, MEGF10, encodes a phagocytic receptor that could have a role in A\u03b2 uptake in the brain 47 and a suggestive association with cognitive decline in AD patients has been recently reported within this gene. 48 Previous genetic studies of plasma A\u03b2 levels have reported a linkage peak on chromosome 10q 49 and subsequently, several associations with variants in candidate genes of this region, including CTNNA3, 50 ,51 PLAU 52,53 and IDE. [54] [55] [56] [57] Another group reported an haplotypic association spanning the MMP3 gene. 58 Using the same SNPs, we did not replicate theses findings in our study (Supplementary Table 8 ). Of note, our second best signal for plasma A\u03b2 1-42 levels was located within the 10q linkage peak, in an intron of the ANK3 gene. Further studies will be needed to assess whether this gene is responsible for our signal and the 10q linkage peak previously reported. 49 Variants in this gene are associated with risk of bipolar disorder, 59 schizophrenia 60 and austism spectrum disorders. 61 Links between these conditions and APP metabolism have been suggested, [62] [63] [64] which warrant further studies of ANK3.\nSeveral GWAS have also analyzed genetic associations with A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations in CSF. [65] [66] [67] Only one SNP associated with CSF concentrations of A\u03b2 and tau was also associated with plasma concentrations of A\u03b2 at nominal significance level in our study (Supplementary Table 8 ). This SNP, rs2075650, is located in the APOE locus, which is suspected to influence AD pathophysiology through impaired A\u03b2 peptides clearance from the brain. 68 In addition, apart from this APOE SNP, we did not also find any significant association between known genetic risk factors for AD 18, 69, 70 and plasma A\u03b2 concentrations ( Table 3 ). As our analyses were performed in non-demented samples, the genes within our suggestive loci may not be involved in the AD process. Of note, we did not observe any significant associations between CTXN3 and AD risk in the European Alzheimer's Disease Initiative GWAS of 2 032 AD cases and 5 328 controls. 19 In conclusion, our study results suggest that the use of plasma A\u03b2 peptides are valid endophenotypes in GWASs and can be used to characterize the metabolism and functions of APP and its metabolites. Our identification of CTXN3's involvement in APP metabolism in vitro indicates that our genome-wide association meta-analysis was able to pick up new factors in this metabolic pathway. Consequently, systematic screening of the other suggestive loci might be relevant."}]
