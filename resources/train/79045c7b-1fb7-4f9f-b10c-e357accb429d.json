Included in NPSAS:96 is a sample of first-time postsecondary students (of all ages) that make up the Beginning Postsecondary Student (BPS) longitudinal study cohort. BPS was designed to provide information about the composition of the beginning postsecondary student population and their patterns of persistence and attainment from initial entry into postsecondary education through leaving and entering the labor force.' The NPSAS:96 survey provides detailed financial aid information and comprehensive data on enrollment, attendance, and student demographic characteristics. There are several sources of data within the survey, including institution data, financial aid records, national student loan files, student interviews, and testing agency files. The glossary (appendix A) contains the definitions of the variables presented in the report. This report is based on institutional records and telephone interviews for approximately 12,000 beginning postsecondary students from 832 institutions.\nAs shown in the Compendium Tables section, of all students beginning for the first time in postsecondary education in 1995-96, just over half (52 percent) were enrolled full time for the full year. Fifty-four percent were women, and 46 percent were men. Of the 99 percent of beginning students who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents, 70 percent were white, non-Hispanic; 12 percent were black, non-Hispanic; 12 percent were Hispanic; 4 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander; and 1 percent were American Indian/Alaskan Native. About two-thirds (68 percent) of first-time students were age 19 or younger, and 20 percent were age 24 or older. One-fifth did not speak English as their primary language at home. Six percent of beginning students reported having some kind of disability. Among all beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96, 60 percent received some form of financial aid, averaging about $4,900. Of those enrolled full time for the full year, 71 percent received some form of financial aid. Seventy percent of first-time students worked while they were enrolled in postsecondary education.

Students with no risk factors were almost twice as likely to have earned a degree or certificate or to remain enrolled after 5 years as were students with three or more risk factors.

Generally, students entering public 4-year institutions were more likely to have somewhat lower socioeconomic backgrounds and to demonstrate somewhat lower prior academic achievement than those entering private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. The most consistent differences were observed between students entering public 2-year institutions and entrants into institutions in either 4-year sector. Generally, public 2-year institution entrants were more likely to be older, have lower socioeconomic backgrounds, have lower educational aspirations, and demonstrate lower prior academic achievement than their counterparts at 4-year institutions. Moreover, students entering public 2-year institutions were considerably more likely to be characterized by each of seven risk factors known to be associated with attrition and not attaining a degree: delaying entry into postsecondary education, attending part time, working full time, being financially independent, having dependents, being a single parent, and not having a high school diploma. Consistent with their increased risk, therefore, students entering public 2-year institutions were more likely to interrupt enrollment before the end of the first year. Even public 2-year institution entrants without risk factors (\"traditional\" undergraduates) were less likely than their counterparts at 4-year institutions to be enrolled continuously during the first year. These findings reflect a clientele for most public 2-year institutions that is unique among degree-granting postsecondary institutions. As Cohen and Brawer point out, \"community colleges reached out to attract those who were not being served by traditional higher education: those who could not afford the tuition; who could not take the time to attend a college on a fulltime basis...who had inadequate preparation in the lower schools; whose educational progress had been interrupted by some temporary condition\"; and so on.28 Moreover, the higher incidence "}, {"section_title": "3 4", "text": "Profiles of Students Entering 2-and 4-Year Institutions of interrupted enrollment among entering students before the end of the first year at public 2-year colleges is consistent with the unique mission of that sector.
