C-CAP inventories coastal submersed habitats, wetland habitats, and adjacent uplands and monitors changes in these habitats on a one-to five-year cycle. Coastal habitat information and frequency of detection are required to improve scientific understanding of the linkages of coastal and submersed wetland habitats with adjacent uplands, and, with the distribution, abundance, and health of marine resources. Satellite imagery, aerial photography, and field data are interpreted and integrated with other digital data in a geographic information system. The resulting land cover change databases are disseminated in digital form for use by anyone wishing to conduct geographic analysis in the completed region. Regional inventories are completed by regional experts following C-CAP guidelines. Washington falls within the Northwest region.

Eelgrass beds were mapped from photographs onto State of Washington Orthophoto Maps and digitized, providing a digital data base for analysis of eelgrass bed area, spatial distribution, and future change detection. Training sites were selected prior to mapping to distinguish spectral characteristics of eelgrass and other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAy). Post mapping verification and accuracy assessments were accomplished through the use of large scale Digital Videography."}, {"section_title": "Aerial Photography Acquisition", "text": "The 1995 eelgrass photography was obtained through the State of Washington Department of Transportation (WDOT) using a Jena LMK-2015 camera with a 153mm Jena Lamegon Lens and Aerocolor 2445 film. The camera was mounted in the cabin, on the floor of the fuselage behind the co-pilot. The plane was a Gulfstream Aero Commander 680F and photography was acquired at 3,000 feet taking altitude yielding a 1:12,000 photographic scale (Walker, 1996). Flightlines for the photography were predetermined by WDOT to provide 100% photographic coverage of Willapa Bay and limited coverage of its tributaries and were plotted on a 1:24,000 scale USGS 7.5' quadrangle (figure 1).  (Dobson et al., 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Acquisition Metrics", "text": "Quality assurance on the plane consisted of checking the photographic settings with an automatic exposure control, measuring sun angle with an indicator, plotting the flight lines, employing an intervalometer to provide 60/20 photographic overlap, coordinating scale/altitude/film/focal length to ensure a minimum mapping unit of 1 meter, and in flight pilot assessment of cloud cover over the target area (Walker, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Mapping Operations", "text": "The mapping procedures applied to this study were designed to parallel those suggested by the NOAA C-CAP program for monitoring submerged land using aerial photography (table 2). The mapping process includes initial field surveys, photo interpretation, transfer of data to base maps, entry of the data into a Geographic Table 1 General protocol for the acquisition of aerial photography used to delineate Submersed Rooted Vascular plants (SRV). Adapted from NOAA Technical Report NMFS 123 (Dobson et al., 1995). Film Type -Recommended film type is Aerocolor 2445 color-negative film. Second choices are Aerochrome 2448 color-reversal and Aerographic 2405 black-and-white negative film. Infrared film is not recommended for delineating SRV. Haze filters should always be used to minimize the degrading effects of haze on photography. True color film gives more information than black-and-white and color infrared film and is critical for initial mapping attempts of new or unfamiliar areas. Metric Photography and Photographic Scale -Metric-quality aerial photographs ( 3\u00b0 of tilt off-nadir and including camera calibration data) are essential to produce the highest quality data possible. The need for rectification is reduced through precise control of aircraft altitude and orientation relative to vertical during photography and by interpretation in stereo. Photographic scale is a compromise among resolution of signatures, coverage of habitat, inclusion of land features sufficient for horizontal control, and cost. Photographic scale should normally range from 1:12,000 to 1:24,000. Flightlines, Reconnaissance Flights, and Photographic Overlap -Flightlines are planned with reference to aeronautical and nautical charts to include all areas known to have, or suspected of having, SRV. Proper planning of flight missions can greatly increase efficiency and provide for the inclusion of cultural and shoreline features required to register the image to the base map (-lt3 of the exposure). Overlap of the photographs includes endlap of adjacent photographs along a flightline and sidelap of photographs on parallel flightlines. Sixty percent endlap allows stereoscopic viewing, facilitates interpretation from the most central region of the photographs, and compensates for loss of coverage due to sun glint in the photographs. Thirty percent sidelap ensures contiguous coverage of adjacent flightlines and produces a block of aerial photographs that can be used in a photogrammetric bundle. Environmental Considerations -Phenologv -the best time of year to acquire photography is during the season of maximum biomass or flowering of dominant species, considering the phenologic overlap for the entire community. This is June for the SRV of the Pacific Northwest. Clouds and Haze -It is best to have no clouds and minimal haze. Thin broken clouds or thin overcast above the plane may be acceptable when these are determined by visualization from the air neither to cast shadows nor adversely affect illumination of the study area. Haze reduces illumination and clarity of the image of benthic features being recorded in the photograph. Turbidity -Aerial photography should be conducted when turbidity is low. Care should be exercised in areas adjacent to sources of suspended sediment and nutrients. Data collection should be avoided during seasonal phytoplankton blooms or immediately following heavy rains or persistent strong winds. Ii -Generally, aerial photography should be collected within 2 hours of the lowest tide predicted by NOS tide tables, although factors affecting water depth and water clarity should be considered simultaneously. In general, extreme low tide, which may be -0.5 to -1.0 m or more around the U.S. coast, is preferred, if compatible with other constraints. The significant \"lag\" in the tidal stage of some estuaries should be considered for data acquisition. Wind and Surface Waves -No wind and no waves is best for aerial photography. Low wind (<10 mph) may be acceptable. The direction, persistence, fetch (the distance that wind can blow unobstructed over water), and recent wind events should be taken into account. Breaking waves and associated turbidity, white caps, lines of bubbles, and floating debris should not be visible from the air or in the photographs. Sun Angle -Sun angle affects the illumination of benthic features, sun glint, and shadows from tall shoreline features in the photographs. A sun angle of 15-30\u00b0 is recommended by C-CAP. This interval maximizes the time for photography considering both the illumination of submerged features and sun glint. Sun angles above 15\u00b0 illuminate the bottom sufficiently for photographic purposes. Sun glint also increases with sun angle but precludes visualization of benthic features where it occurs in the photograph. As sun angle increases, sun glint also increases and moves from the edge toward the center of the photograph. Loss of coverage due to sun glint at sun angles of up to about 30\u00b0 is compensated (to ensure monoscopic coverage, at a minimum) by the recommended endlap of 60%. Photography at sun angles above 30\u00b0 is not recommended. Shadows from tall objects on shore such as trees, however, can preclude visualization of benthic features and may be a factor when the land and sun are on the same side of the plane. Information System, and final field verification of the digital data. The entire mapping process was completed between August 1995 and June 1996 (Dobson et al., 1995).  Adapted from NOAA Technical Report NMFS 123 (Dobson et al., 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Photointerpretation", "text": "Designation of SRV -This is a function of the minimum detection unit, the minimum mapping unit, the proximity of the area to other SRV, and the quality of the data source. All detected SRV that appear to be in a continuum with adjacent SRV in an area exceeding 0.03 ha will be mapped as a single polygon. The minimum mapping unit is the smallest area to be mapped as habitat. At the C-CAP map scale of 1:24,000, the minimum mapping unit is 0.03 ha for SRV. The presence of SRV signature in the photograph defines habitat if: 1) the total area exceeds 0.03 ha; 2) no unvegetated discontinuities, such as dredged or natural channels, partition the distribution into spatial units less than 0.03 ha; and 3) unvegetated areas between plants are not large relative to the minimum mapping unit. Because of the constraint of the minimum mapping unit and the possibility of suboptimal photography, delineation of SRV will tend to be conservative. The degree of underestimation depends upon the atmospheric and hydrographic conditions at the time of photography, the experience of the photo interpreter, and the nature of the subject area. Monitoring Submerged Lands -Even under the best photographic conditions, delineation of all or part of some habitat polygons may require additional effort in regard to surface level verification or direct inclusion of surface level data. Coverage and bed form can be estimated from aerial photographs but is not a requirement of C-CAP. The degree of contrast between shoots and exposed sediment and the clarity of the photographic image determines the minimum detection unit of features within SRV. Comparison of habitats with different depths, water clarity, or substrate brightness, therefore, is problematic. Analysis of change over time at a given location may be useful but requires consistent photographic conditions and field verification. Some data including species, biomass, productivity, functional status, and health of SRV may not be interpretable from the aerial photographs. Species identification is not possible from aerial photography in temperate areas such as North Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay. Field Surveys -Once selected by stratified random sampling of potential habitat, stations are observed for SRV species and the presence or absence of aquatic beds during the same season and preferably within one year of the photography. The presence or absence of aquatic beds and species of SRV are determined within an area equal to the minimum mapping unit and centered around the nominal station location. These data are translated into an assessment of the presence or absence of an aquatic bed at the station considering the spatial distribution of SRV relative to the minimum detection and mapping units. Signature Verification and Supplemental Spatial Data -Locations selected from the photographs are observed during the same season and within one year of the photographic mission. The purpose of this survey is to resolve uncertainties in the photographs and, if necessary to collect surface level data for inclusion in the spatial database. Surface level data intended to augment photo interpreted data require differentially corrected GPS positioning to a CEP of\u00b15 m. Base Maps and Registration of Habitat Polygons -Accurate and up-to-date planimetric base maps of coastal land features are essential for georeferencing (establishing of geographic location) and scaling polygons of habitat interpreted from aerial photographs. C-CAP recommends I) use of the most accurate and up-to date base map available for the study area and 2) use of the most cost-effective technology to apply local horizontal control to interpreted data by registration of the photographs to base maps. The base map and the registration technology may vary regionally. Planimetric Base Maps -The accuracy of the base map used for local horizontal control places a limit on the accuracy of the C-CAP product. The two base maps broadly available are NOAA shoreline and USGS 7.5' topographic maps. When available and current, NOAA shoreline and coastal data should be used for C-CAP. Shoreline data are produced from tide-coordinated photographic data and ground level survey data by the Photogrammetry Branch of NOS and meet or exceed national map accuracy standards. Transfer of Polygons to the Map Coordinate Projection System -Polygons of habitat interpreted from aerial photographs are mapped into a standard map projection coordinate system. The UTM projection is recommended. C-CAP protocol allows the polygons interpreted from aerial photography to be transferred onto planimetrically accurate basemaps using three approaches: I) Stereoscopically interpret the photographs and optically scale the polygons and photographic image to fit planimetric horizontal control in the basemap with a zoom transfer scope. This is the least 2) Process the aerial photographs into planimetrically accurate orthophotographs, and interpret and directly trace habitat polygons onto the planimetric base map. Interpretation of the orthophotographs is performed using monoscopic airphoto interpretation techniques. Some loss of detail may occur since the orthophotography is a generation away from the original aerial photography. The process is expensive but accuracy is improved in areas with substantial vertical relief. 3) Delineate and simultaneously rectif' and digitize habitat polygons by using an analytical stereo plotter. The three-dimensional stereo model of the aerial photographs is leveled and scaled in the analytical plotter (AP) and the interpreter views a three-dimensional landscape during photo interpretation.  "}, {"section_title": "Spectral Interpretation", "text": "The broad range of spectral signatures encountered in Willapa Bay also proved to be a confounding variable in the interpretation of the eelgrass photography. The source of the spectral diversity comes from both biological and geologic influences. The substrate of Willapa Bay is highly varied, consisting of a mixture of basalt and sandstone deposited from the local drainage basins (Phillips, 1984). Consequently, the substrate tends to be dark in color with varied patterns of sediment distribution depending on geographic location within the bay. Willapa Bay is also prone to high levels of turbidity as a result of sediment input and high tidal stages. The high levels of turbidity prevented water penetration on the images in isolated areas; thus some areas of the bay were excluded from habitat assessment. The deposits from the local catchment also tend to be rich in nutrients, allowing for prolific growth of algae masking eelgrass. Algae mats could be found on eelgrass beds and bare substrate without distinguishable spectral variation, creating a broader range of spectral signatures found within the bay. Furthermore, there are two species of eelgrass that thrive in Willapa Bay, each with a unique signature. North American eelgrass (Zostera Marina) is larger leafed than Asian eelgrass (Zostera Japonica) and tends to occupy the inter-tidal zone (Backman, 1991;Phillips, 1984). The lighter hue of Asian eelgrass could easily be detected on the tidal flats, but could not be clearly distinguished from North American eelgrass in the inter-tidal zone. The combination of the two eelgrass species in the inter-tidal zone provided a unique spectral signature of its own, leading to three different signatures of eelgrass. There were other unidentifiable spectral signatures for which no source could be located. Several regions in the northern end of the study area had received sediment deposition following the flight mission and consequently no source for reflectance could be determined. The use of preliminary data gathered to measure spectral signatures was critical for the accurate interpretation of the Willapa Bay eelgrass photo set and will prove to be an integral component to future eelgrass distribution studies in Willapa Bay."}, {"section_title": "Minimum Mapping Unit", "text": "Determining the size of the minimum mapping unit for this study proved to be problematic due to the presence of a non-native rush, Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay. C-CAP guidelines suggest that a minimum mapping unit of .03 hectares on the ground is appropriate for SRV distribution studies under ideal conditions. However, the prolific growth of Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay created a situation where countless island polygons of Spartina spp., clones would need to be excluded from eelgrass beds if the .03 hectare minimum mapping unit was used. To avoid mapping Spartina spp. rather than eelgrass, the minimum mapping unit size was increased to 1/10\" or 2.54 millimeters on the map yielding a ground coverage mapping unit of .092 hectare. This is not a substantial deviation from C-CAP protocol, and it did not negatively affect the accuracy of eelgrass mapping because no small isolated beds of eelgrass scattered throughout the bay were excluded."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Shoreline Data", "text": "Accuracy assessments were completed measuring the location of delineated eelgrass polygons relative to the shoreline as depicted by the NOAA coastal mapping project. The requirements for shoreline mapping as set by NOAA suggest that shoreline maps exceed national map accuracy standards, and use a series of tide coordinated data, ground control and ground level surveys to achieve high standards (Dobson et al., 1995). The shoreline depicted is a combination the limits of emergent vegetation, the mean high water line, and/or the cultural shoreline. Shoreline features on the NOAA shoreline maps are of coarse resolution relative to the resolution of the eelgrass polygons. Factors that could account for discrepancies in the shoreline data from the two studies include the erosion of shoreline and the active emergence of vegetation into Willapa Bay. A certain amount of variation should be expected when mapping a feature such as a shoreline, and since its location only provides a cartographic reference, the discrepancies were not determined to be problematic."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment", "text": "Digital videography of eelgrass beds was collected on June 6, 1996 to measure the the smallest habitat unit of eelgrass visible on large scale video images. Imagery was aquired at 6000 feet taking altitude, yeilding a average scale of 1:3000 for each video frame. Flight lines (figure 4) were constructed using FliteMap software for Windows from GPS point data captured at 10 second intervals which are plotted on a crude base map. Individual video frames (figure 5) were isolated from the complete data set using a Easy Image software, a frame grabber. Video frames were assessed for spectral characteristics representative of eelgrass beds and area measurements were calculated. Video images were also overlayed with data from the digital data set for qualitative assessment of georeferencing accuracy.  Eelgrass beds with diameters of 1 mm were visible on the digital video images, yeilding an area of approximately .000 5 hectare. Isolated beds of eelgrass that could be identified on the larger scale videography were mapped as continuous beds off of the smaller scale aerial photography provided there were not areas of separtation that exceeded the minimum mapping unit. When digital eelgrass data was compared to the large scale digital videography the small eelgrass beds identifiable on the video images were part of larger eelgrass beds identified as single polygons in the digital data base."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Photo Acquisition In the summer months, when it is appropriate to monitor SAY in Willapa Bay, there are certain natural variables that complicate the acquisition of aerial photography optimal for monitoring SAY. Most notable is the common occurrence of morning fog that obscures the surface of the water from the air. Often when the fog has lifted by midmorning, sun angle has advanced to a degree that increases glint and glare off of the water surface. The window for aerial photograph procurement is further reduced by the tide schedule of the Pacific Ocean which is comprised of two low and two high tides daily which deviate from the mean low and high tides. Of the two low tides, one will be lower and is often below the mean low tide: this tide is referred to as a minus tide. Similarly, of the two daily high tides, one will be higher and is often greater than the mean high tide. Consequently, there are infrequent early summer days when a minus tide occurs in the early morning or early evening when the local environment is fog free. Limiting environmental factors need to be accounted for when guidelines for data acquisition are determined, thus alternative sources for data collection should be considered."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Data Sources", "text": "Although it is accepted that true color film is the most appropriate medium for the capture of photography use to study SAV (Jamison et al., 1983), alternative sources of data could be considered for both economic and utilitarian reasons. Color infrared (CIR) film is not known for its use in photographing benthic features, however, certain developing processes can be applied to the film that reveal submerged features (figure 6). Although, CIR would not be an appropriate choice for a solitary data set, it could be used as a secondary data set for verification activities. Such data sets are often available through other studies focusing on emergent plant species and copies could potentially be borrowed or a duplicate set of prints made. Satellite imagery has been applied to a few SAV distribution studies, but is not considered to have an accurate resolution to meet C-CAP requirements for mapping (Dobson et al., 1995). However, with technological advances in satellite imagery, satellite data may prove to be a very valuable resource for monitoring change in coastal environments. The resolution of imagery that satellites can provide may soon be close to \u00b1 5 meters (Avery and Berlin, 1992), and the cost of image acquisition over time could prove to be less than multiple sets of aerial photography. Another source of inexpensive, flexible data is true color digital videography. Often, videography can be obtained by a light aircraft and relatively inexpensive Videography is capable of capturing up to 60 frames per second, and can be stamped with a GPS location for the \"center of the mass\" of the frame. Post-processing of GPS data can provide a coordinate within \u00b1 5 meters of the true location. Both digital videography and satellite imagery can be used in digital image processing software packages for accurate interpretation and statistical analysis. Through accurate training of the software package, image processors can be used to detect fine differences in spectral signatures for classification of an image. Classes can further be analyzed for conditions such as density of biomass, species composition, and substrate composition -all necessary components of accurate change detection studies (Dobson et al., 1995). Following image classification, the data could georeferenced and geometrically corrected then exported directly into a geographic information system. A process that incorporates the strengths of color aerial photography and digital image processing could be used which might provide the most accurate image interpretation option. This process would follow the traditional data acquisition techniques of aerial photography, but rather than printing the photos on paper, a color diapositive could be produced. This product could then be scanned at a high resolution (>600 dots per inch) and used in an image processing software package for classification, georeferencing and geometric correction. The only significant drawback to this process would be the large amount of memory required for the scanned high resolution images."}, {"section_title": "Field Verification", "text": "Ground truthing activities within Willapa Bay are challenging on all levels. The shallow nature of the bay, the soft, multi-colored substrate, and the abundance of benthic features combine to create a spectrally varied quagmire with limited access. There are a multitude of small channels that become unnavigable when the tide is out -the optimal time for field activities. Access to the eelgrass beds from shore is very limited due to the abundance of private property surrounding the bay, and requires traversing mud flats that often will not support the weight of a field technician. Environmental conditions such as these may require a creative approach to field verification and accuracy assessment studies. Videography could be employed in this situation by selecting areas for assessment and flying low level transects to obtain large scale imagery that is georeferenced with differentially corrected GPS."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The C-CAP program guidelines are tested and accepted protocol for mapping SAV, and are valuable for producing data sets that are highly accurate and compatible with similar C-CAP data. However, it is fair to state that the local environment in Willapa Bay presented conditions that are outside the realm of addressed environments in the C-CAP guidelines. Future SAV mapping projects in Willapa Bay or other West Coast estuarine environments may require a modified set of criteria to follow, if the most accurate and compatible data set is to be produced. Ultimately, future studies can help shape the guidelines that will be applied to C-CAP sponsored West coast SAV mapping projects by testing and incorporating alternative methods of data acquisition, compilation, and verification into mapping procedures."}]
