In part 1 of the study, patients were 2:1 randomized to receive low-dose subcutaneous (SC) 300 mg crenezumab every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for 68 weeks; in part 2, patients were 2:1 randomized to receive high-dose intravenous (IV) 15 mg/kg crenezumab every 4 weeks (q4w) or placebo for 68 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in amyloid burden from baseline to week 69 assessed by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) in the modified intent-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 69 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and change from baseline to week 73 in 12-point Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog12) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).

However, it is hypothesized that the soluble oligomeric species of A\u03b2 are the forms that are toxic to neurons and that lead to hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau [1] . This cascade of pathophysiologic events is thought to result in synaptic dysfunction, loss of neurons, and neurotransmitter deficits [2, 3] . Anti-amyloid therapies are designed to modify the course of the disease by targeting this cascade.\nCrenezumab is a fully humanized immunoglobulin isotype G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to A\u03b2 oligomers while maintaining the ability to bind to other forms of A\u03b2 (monomers, fibrils, and plaques) [4, 5] . The IgG4 backbone confers reduced binding of Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) compared with an IgG1 backbone, and was shown in vitro to preserve Fc\u03b3R-mediated microglial phagocytosis and removal of oligomers while minimizing Fc\u03b3R-mediated inflammatory activation of microglia and release of proinflammatory cytokines [4] . This reduced effector function of crenezumab is hypothesized to reduce cytokine-mediated neurotoxicity and reduce inflammation at sites of A\u03b2 plaque deposition, particularly involving blood vessels. The latter was hypothesized to increase the risk of drug-induced amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in studies investigating anti-amyloid antibodies with full effector function [4] .\nThis phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was designed to evaluate the effects of crenezumab on brain amyloid plaque load as assessed by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and other biomarkers in patients with mild-to-moderate AD (ABE4955g, BLAZE; NCT01397578). The prespecified analysis of the florbetapir PET data used a cerebellar reference region for calculating standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). Although this was the widely accepted reference region at the time this study was designed, more recent evidence published near the conclusion of this study showed that using a subcortical white matter reference region reduces longitudinal variability of SUVR [6] [7] [8] . Based on those findings, additional exploratory analyses of the florbetapir PET data were conducted using white matter reference regions that result in reduced variability in tracking longitudinal florbetapir SUVR changes. Other fluid and imaging biomarkers of AD were also evaluated in this study. BLAZE was independent from the phase II study, ABE4869g (ABBY; NCT01343966), which used the same treatment doses and duration but did not include amyloid PET imaging or mandatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection and focused on changes in cognition and functioning as endpoints [9] ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "This study was conducted at 21 sites in the US, one site in Spain, and one site in France.

Part 2 of the study was initiated upon completion of recruitment for part 1. Both parts consisted of three periods: 1) a screening period (up to 42 days); 2) a treatment period (weeks 1-69); and 3) a safety follow-up period (weeks 70-85). Eligible patients that completed the week-73 assessment had the option to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study, GN28525, to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of crenezumab. All patients who enrolled in the OLE study received active drug at the same dosing frequency, dose level, and route of administration that they were assigned to in ABE4955g. Randomization was managed by a central IxRS vendor using dynamic hierarchical randomization, and in both parts of the study patients were randomized independently and stratified by apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE\u03b54) genotype (carrier vs noncarrier), MMSE score (< 22 vs \u2265 22), and study site. Site personnel were blinded to randomization details.\nAn acceptable safety and tolerability profile for crenezumab at the high dose (15 mg/kg q4w IV) was supported both by a phase I study, ABE4427g, and by results of a safety run-in assessment of ABE4869g, where no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose-limiting toxicities were observed [9] .

The SUVR is the ratio of the mean standard uptake value (SUV) of the composite neocortical region to the SUV of a reference region (as described below). The first pipeline, developed and executed by Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI; Molecular NeuroImaging LLC, New Haven, CT), was used for the predefined primary analysis and the post-hoc exploratory analysis. Baseline PET images were registered to the baseline T1 MRI. The transformation matrix derived from normalizing the MRI to standard space, T MRI , was applied to the PET images. Follow-up PET images were registered to the baseline MRI and then normalized by applying T MRI .

The analysis was conducted according to treatment assigned at randomization. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and was analyzed according to the treatment received (e.g., one patient was randomized to the placebo arm but received a single dose of crenezumab in error, and was therefore included in the crenezumab safety analysis).\nThe primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed as change scores (postbaseline value \u2212 baseline value). The baseline value was defined as the latest nonmissing predose value. Mean changes from baseline were compared across treatment arms using mixed modeling for repeated measures (MMRM) for endpoints with more than one postbaseline measurement (florbetapir PET, ADAS-Cog12, CDR-SB, and volumetric measurements from MRI), and using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for endpoints with only one postbaseline measurement (CSF A\u03b2(1-42), t-tau, p-tau, and FDG PET).

However, an exploratory analysis found a nonsignificant trend toward reduced cerebral-to-white matter SUVRs, a measurement with increased power to track longitudinal change in amyloid burden, in the high-dose IV-treated cohort. The possibility that higher-dose crenezumab treatment may be associated with reduced fibrillar A\u03b2 accumulation will be tested in ongoing phase III studies.\nTreatment effects were not observed for the other secondary endpoints of changes in FDG PET, CSF t-tau, and p-tau measurements. No treatment effect was observed in the clinical outcomes, ADAS-Cog12 and CDR-SB, in the overall study population, but in the mild subset (MMSE 20-26), a nonsignificant trend toward a clinical benefit was observed in the high-dose IV cohort, which was consistent with observations in the recently published phase II ABE4869g study [9] , suggesting that greater benefits for patients may be possible by treating earlier disease stages and with higher doses of crenezumab.\nInitial reports that used amyloid PET in clinical trials of amyloid-targeted therapeutics used cerebellar reference regions to calculate SUVR [19] [20] [21] , and similar methods have been used in more recent trials [22] [23] [24] . This reference region has been widely used based on the evidence from early cross-sectional studies that showed how SUVR could be used to quantitatively differentiate groups of individuals with different levels of cognitive impairment, but more recent reports analyzing the longitudinal florbetapir PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have demonstrated that reference regions containing subcortical white matter can reduce variability in the measurement of SUVR changes over time [6] [7] [8] 25] . Evidence of these improvements was first published near the time that ABE4955g was completing and prompted the initiation of two additional blinded analyses performed with processing pipelines that had been independently optimized and validated using ADNI data [6, 7] . Although these alternative methods (SUVR MNI-WM and SUVR BAI-WM ) used different white matter references and different image processing techniques, both demonstrated: 1) more consistent amyloid accumulation in the placebo arm; 2) reduced longitudinal variability across treatment arms; and 3) nonsignificant trends in reductions of amyloid accumulation in the high-dose IV crenezumab-treated cohort compared with placebo. Further justification for using subcortical white matter as an improved reference region for longitudinal florbetapir PET measurements has been shown in exploratory analyses of other therapeutic studies with aducanumab and solanezumab [26, 27] .\nAducanumab and gantenerumab have reported reductions in amyloid SUVR using cerebellar reference regions [22, 24] , but these antibodies bind amyloid plaque and have full immune effector function; thus, they may be acting by a direct plaque removal mechanism effecting greater changes in the amyloid PET signal. The results of this study appear consistent with the hypothesis that crenezumab may reduce the further accumulation of amyloid plaque by enabling the removal of precursor soluble oligomers, even if it does not dramatically clear existing plaques. Detecting this subtle effect on longitudinal plaque accumulation may have required the more sensitive white-matter reference methods.\nTreatment with crenezumab at both dose levels was associated with an increase in CSF A\u03b2(1-42), providing evidence for target engagement in the central nervous system, albeit not direct evidence of target engagement in the brain. Increases in CSF A\u03b2 relative to placebo were also observed in both dose groups in the ABE4869g trial [9] , providing further evidence of target engagement. CSF samples were collected at trough (prior to final dose) when there was only a 1.7-fold mean difference in crenezumab levels between the SC and IV cohorts, and this may explain why similar increases in CSF A\u03b2 were observed at both dose levels. The increase in CSF A\u03b2(1-42) associated with crenezumab treatment could reflect increased input of A\u03b2(1-42) into the CSF from the brain or periphery, decreased clearance of CSF A\u03b2(1-42) out of the CSF, and/or a shift in CSF A\u03b2 content toward more species that are detected by the A\u03b2(1-42) assay; thus, this observation does not definitively indicate a reversal of AD pathophysiology. Crenezumab treatment was also associated with a dose-dependent increase in plasma levels of A\u03b2(1-42) and A\u03b2 . Plasma increases in A\u03b2 have also been observed with solanezumab [28] and are thought to reflect an increase in the half-life of circulating A\u03b2 when bound to antibody. Additional studies are needed to better understand the effects of crenezumab on plasma A\u03b2, CSF A\u03b2, and amyloid PET, and the relationship of these pharmacodynamic effects to the underlying pathology and cognitive decline. Disease progression as evaluated using the cognitive and global measures ADAS-Cog12 and CDR-SB showed no treatment effect in the overall study population. However, in a subset of patients with milder disease (MMSE 22-26), a nonsignificant trend toward a treatment effect was observed in the high-dose IV group but not in the low-dose SC group. These data are consistent with results from the ABE4869g study which showed increasing treatment effect in ADAS-Cog12 in progressively milder subsets of AD patients [9] . Together, these two phase II studies suggest that higher doses of crenezumab may be needed to impact clinical outcomes.\nNo treatment effect on CSF t-tau or p-tau, or on FDG PET, was associated with crenezumab at either dose level. A clear relationship between changes in biomarkers of AD and clinical benefit is yet to be established in therapeutic studies [29, 30] . Discrepancies between biomarker and cognitive outcomes have been observed in trials of other anti-amyloid compounds, including bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, aducanumab, and solanezumab. In phase III studies in mild-to-moderate AD, bapineuzumab stabilized or slightly reduced (< 5%) amyloid plaque as measured by 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B PET but no clinical benefit was observed [20] . In a phase Ib study in prodromal-to-mild AD, aducanumab reduced amyloid load by as much as 19% at 1 year at the highest dose, and a dose-response relationship was observed for both amyloid removal and clinical benefit [22] . In a phase III study in prodromal AD, gantenerumab resulted in a 5.8% mean reduction in amyloid plaque levels at week 60 [24] . In that study, cognitive benefit compared with patients treated with placebo was not observed [24] , but there was evidence of efficacy in patients with faster disease progression who had higher drug exposure [31] . Recent data on gantenerumab, as well as phase IIb data from BAN2401, have confirmed that higher doses of full-effector function anti-A\u03b2 antibodies can result in more robust effects on amyloid plaque removal such that a substantial number of patients have their amyloid burden reduced to below the threshold for amyloid positivity within 1-2 years [32, 33] . Cognitive benefit was reported for BAN2401 [33] but this awaits confirmation in a larger study. In contrast, the monomer-only binding antibody solanezumab demonstrated no significant effect on amyloid plaque [34] and, although the phase III solanezumab studies did not meet their primary endpoint (ADAS-Cog14), a small but consistent effect on other cognitive and functional endpoints was detected in patients with mild AD [23] . Overall, modest (< 10%) reductions in CSF t-tau and p-tau have been observed in some studies [24, 35] , but CSF results are not available for all anti-A\u03b2 trials and thus far there is no consistent relationship between changes in CSF tau and changes in cognition. Given the discrepancies between the biomarker data and the clinical outcome across anti-A\u03b2 studies, replication in larger studies will be required to understand further the relationship between biomarkers and clinical benefit.\nOverall, crenezumab was well tolerated at the doses investigated in a mild-to-moderate AD (MMSE 18-26) population. No cases of ARIA-E were observed in ABE4955g, and only one asymptomatic case was observed in ABE4869g at the higher dose (a sulcal effusion in the right occipital, parietal, and temporal regions and in the left occipital region, reported at week 23 MRI assessment, in a 72-year-old APOE\u03b54 homozygous female patient treated with crenezumab IV) [9] . The low levels of ARIA-E observed in both ABE4869g and ABE4955g enable evaluation of crenezumab at higher dose levels compared with anti-amyloid monoclonal IgG1 antibodies with full effector functions.\nThe limitations of this study include the small sample size and the absence of testing of doses > 15 mg/kg, which limits the power of the study to exclude a significant treatment effect on clinical and biomarker endpoints. One phase Ib (GN29632; NCT02353598) and two phase III studies investigating crenezumab in an earlier AD patient population are ongoing (BN29552, CREAD: NCT02670083; BN29553, CREAD2: NCT03114657). GN29632 and BN29553 will further explore the potential effects of crenezumab on cognition, biomarkers, and safety in prodromal-to-mild AD (MMSE 22-30) at monthly doses of 60 mg/kg IV."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Here we report the results of the phase II ABE4955g trial evaluating the impact of crenezumab on brain amyloid load and related biomarkers in mild-to-moderate AD with evidence of brain amyloid pathology based on amyloid PET. The primary endpoint was not met. Exploratory analyses evaluated two alternative methods of analyzing longitudinal amyloid PET data using different reference regions. These methods reduced longitudinal variability and suggested a possible reduction in amyloid accumulation in crenezumab-treated patients. The trial also found a nonsignificant trend toward reduced cognitive decline in crenezumab-treated mild AD patients that was also observed in the ABE4869g study, suggesting that earlier treatment and higher doses may be associated with improved clinical outcome. Given the favorable safety profile of crenezumab, administration of an increased dose regimen in early AD patients in future studies may be possible to increase efficacy, without a corresponding increase in risk to patient safety. The two phase III CREAD studies (BN29552 and BN29553) for crenezumab are underway to test this hypothesis.\nGroup), and own stock or stock options in F. Hoffmann-La Roche.
