[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and aim: Toxic oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S; O-\u03b1S) has been suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of \u03b1S, O-\u03b1S, total and phosphorylated tau, and amyloid \u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b21-42) are thought to reflect the pathophysiology or clinical symptoms in PD. In this study, we examined correlations of the CSF levels of these proteins with the clinical symptoms, and with each other in drug-na\u00efve patients with PD. Methods: Twenty-seven drug-na\u00efve patients with PD were included. Motor and cognitive functions were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (COGNISTAT). CSF levels of total \u03b1S, O-\u03b1S, A\u03b21-42, total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181p) were measured. CSF levels of these proteins were compared with clinical assessments from the UPDRS, MoCA and COGNISTAT using Spearman correlation analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients among CSF protein levels were also evaluated. Results: CSF levels of \u03b1S were negatively correlated with UPDRS part III (motor score) (p < 0.05) and bradykinesia (p < 0.01), and positively correlated with COGNISTAT subtest of judgement (p < 0.01) and CSF levels of A\u03b21-42 (p < 0.001), total tau (p < 0.001) and P-tau181p (p < 0.01). Lower CSF levels of A\u03b21-42, total tau and P-tau181p were significantly related to worsening of some motor and/or cognitive functions. The CSF level of O-\u03b1S showed no correlation with any motor and cognitive assessments or with CSF levels of the other proteins. Conclusion: CSF levels of \u03b1S are correlated with some clinical symptoms and CSF levels of other pathogenic proteins in drug-na\u00efve PD patients. These correlations suggest a central role for interaction and aggregation of \u03b1S with A\u03b21-42, tau, and phosphorylated tau in the pathogenesis of PD. Although O-\u03b1S has been shown to have neurotoxic effects, CSF levels do not reflect clinical symptoms or levels of other proteins in cross-sectional assessment."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, but diagnosis based on assessment of clinical symptoms and radiological findings can be difficult, especially in the early phase. Therefore, biomarkers reflecting the pathophysiology of PD are required, and pathogenic proteins related to neurodegeneration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be candidates as such biomarkers. The pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy body, that is, abnormal aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) in the brain. Recently, oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein (O-\u03b1S) has been shown to have neurotoxic effects, and such oligomers may play a central role in the pathogenesis of PD [1] [2] [3] . Most studies of CSF levels of total \u03b1S and O-\u03b1S have shown that total \u03b1S is decreased in PD patients compared to normal controls [4, 5] , while O-\u03b1S is increased in PD [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, CSF levels of total \u03b1S and O-\u03b1S may reflect progression of the pathological background and clinical symptoms in patients with PD and may be candidate biomarkers for PD.\nIn Alzheimer's disease (AD), the CSF level of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)1-42 (A\u03b21-42) is decreased and that of tau is increased [7] . These proteins are established biomarkers for diagnosis of AD, and PD can present with AD pathology such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [8] . Previous studies comparing CSF levels of these potential biomarkers between PD cohorts and controls have shown that A\u03b21-42, total tau and phosphorylated tau (phosphorylated at threonine 181; P-tau181p) are significantly decreased in PD [9] . These findings suggest that the levels of these proteins in CSF are related to the pathological background of PD patients. Tau plays an important role in the structural integrity of the neuron, and phosphorylation of tau reduces its binding affinity for microtubules and causes self-aggregation, which results in neuronal damage [10] . In contrast, CSF levels of these proteins in PD are correlated with each other. For example, total \u03b1S levels are positively correlated with the levels of total tau [4, 5] , phosphorylated tau [4, 5] and A\u03b21-42 [4] . These correlations suggest interactions between these proteins.\nMany studies in PD patients at various clinical stages and under different medication have shown correlations between CSF levels of the candidate biomarker proteins and clinical symptoms, but the results have not necessarily agreed among studies. Correlations of CSF levels of these proteins with motor and cognitive functions are rarely compared in drug-na\u00efve PD patients. Therefore, in this study, we examined correlations of motor and cognitive functions, and CSF protein levels only in drugna\u00efve PD patients."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Patients", "text": "Twenty-seven patients with de novo PD were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of PD was made according to MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for PD [11] . Patients were first diagnosed based upon their clinical history and neurological findings before medication. The diagnosis of PD was confirmed when motor symptoms improved with dopaminergic medication. Clinical and CSF data for this study were obtained within the two months before medication. MRI findings in all participants indicated no abnormal intensity area or focal atrophy suggesting parkinsonism other than PD. Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) based on the fourth consensus report of the DLB consortium [12] were excluded. None of the participants had apparent cognitive impairment before and at least 1 year after onset of parkinsonism. Therefore, our participants had a spectrum from PD with normal cognition to PD with dementia (PDD) through PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). To exclude the effects of medication on clinical assessments and CSF protein levels, we focused on drug-na\u00efve PD patients. None of the patients had any other disease or were taking medications that might affect motor and cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Collection of CSF", "text": "Lumbar puncture was performed at the vertebral interspaces of L3-L4 or L4-L5 in a fasting state before treatment.

Briefly, 200 \u03bcL/well of diluted \u03b1S standards (range, 6.1-1500 pg/mL) using reconstituted stock and diluted CSF samples (200 \u03bcL/well) were added to the capture antibody-coated plate.

After washing, a mixture of 2 different chemiluminescent substrates was added and end-point luminescence was read with a microplate luminometer (SpectraMax L, Molecular Device, Tokyo). The concentration of \u03b1S was measured using standard curves with 4-parameter curve fitting.\nThe levels O-\u03b1S in CSF samples were measured using a single antibody sandwich ELISA, as described previously with some modification [6, 15] . An ELISA 96-well plate (Nunc Maxisorb; NUNC, Denmark) was coated by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg/mL of the anti-human \u03b1S monoclonal antibody 211 (Syn211; Thermo Fisher Scientific, IL), which recognizes amino acid residues 121-125 of human \u03b1S, in 200 mM NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6 (100 \u03bcL/well).

The plate was washed and incubated with 200 \u03bcL/well of an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Super-Signal ELISA Femto, Pierce Biotechnology), after which chemiluminescence in relative light units was immediately measured with a microplate luminometer (SpectraMax L, Molecular Device, Tokyo).

This scale was assessed using the total score for Part III (motor score) and subscores for tremor (items 16, 20, 21) . These neuropsychological tests were performed by examiners who were blinded to motor assessment and CSF findings. The MoCA is used to detect MCI and has a best score of 30. The COGNISTAT has 10 separate cognitive subtests: orientation, attention, languagecomprehension, language-repetition, language-naming, construction, memory, calculation, similarity, and judgment [20] . In the Japanese version of the COGNISTAT, the raw score of each subtest is converted to a standard score, in which average scores in normal controls are set to 10 and standard deviations (SD) in healthy controls are set to 1 [21] . For cognitive assessment using the COGNISTAT, we used the standardized score of each subtest. We have shown that the MoCA and COGNISTAT are sensitive for detection of subtle cognitive impairment in PD patients [22] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "CSF levels of proteins were compared with clinical assessments from the UPDRS, MoCA and COGNISTAT.

Three patients did not undergo the UPDRS and MoCA, and 8 did not take the COGNISTAT. CSF samples of all participants were watery clear and not bloody.

The number of participants in calculation of each correlation coefficient is shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The background of patients is shown in Table 4 .\nSpearman correlation coefficients of each CSF protein level with patient background and motor symptoms are shown in Table 1 , and those with cognitive assessment scores are given in Table 2 . For patient background, CSF levels of total \u03b1S, O-\u03b1S, A\u03b21-42 and total tau were not correlated with age, education, or duration from symptom onset, but P-tau181p was positively correlated with age (p < 0.05).

CSF levels of O-\u03b1S showed no correlation with those of any other proteins."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The results of this study showed that CSF levels of total \u03b1S are negatively correlated with UPDRS part III and bradykinesia scores, which indicates that these motor functions worsen as the CSF level of total \u03b1S decreases. This result agrees with those from the Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) study, which showed that the CSF \u03b1S level is negatively correlated with MDS-UPDRS part III (motor score) and the Hoehn and Yahr scale in drug-naive PD patients [23] . Therefore, total \u03b1S in CSF decreases with progression of PD, which may be due to aggregation and intracellular accumulation of \u03b1S [4, 5, 24] . In the present study, the CSF level of total \u03b1S showed a positive correlation with the COGNISTAT subtest of judgment, which suggests worsening judgment as the CSF total \u03b1S level decreases. This subtest requires patients to explain how to overcome a presented abnormal and critical situation; that is, it evaluates frontal/ executive function. Our results are consistent with those in Skogseth et al., in which it was also found that a lower CSF \u03b1S level was associated with reduced performance on executive function [25] .\nAlthough O-\u03b1S is toxic and mediates neural damage [1] [2] [3] , no clinical symptom correlated with the CSF level of O-\u03b1S in this study. In most studies of CSF O-\u03b1S, the level has been shown to be higher in PD patients than in normal controls [4] [5] [6] . Our results suggest that CSF levels of O-\u03b1S do not necessarily correlate with clinical symptoms or the extent of neuronal damage in a cross-sectional study. There may be a time lag between dynamics of CSF levels of O-\u03b1S and changes in clinical symptoms. On the other hand, O-\u03b1S accumulates in the brain, and therefore, intracellular O-\u03b1S may affect clinical symptoms in PD patients and may be related to motor and cognitive functions. However, the intraneuronal level of O-\u03b1S cannot be measured in a clinical setting. The CSF levels of total tau and P-tau181p as well as total \u03b1S were negatively correlated with bradykinesia scores. Bradykinesia is the earliest and most fundamental motor symptom in PD [11] . These correlations show that as the disease progresses, CSF levels of total tau, Ptau181p and total \u03b1S concurrently decrease. Similar associations of CSF total tau and \u03b1S with motor severity in de novo PD patients were found in the PPMI study [23] . In our study, CSF levels of total tau and P-tau181p also showed strong positive correlations with that of total \u03b1S.\nWaxman et al. showed that \u03b1S can induce aggregation of tau, and that phosphorylation of these aggregates then progresses in vivo [26] . Guo et al. showed similar results for \u03b1S cross-seeding tau aggregation in vivo [27] . Ishizawa et al. found tau-and phosphorylated tau-positive Lewy bodies in immunostaining of postmortem brain in Lewy body disease patients [28] . These findings suggest that tau and phosphorylated tau both aggregate with \u03b1S, which explains the correlation of their decreased CSF levels. Correlations of CSF levels of both total tau and P-tau181p with total \u03b1S were stronger than those with bradykinesia. This suggests that the interaction between these proteins is primary, and that bradykinesia then emerges. In AD, the CSF level of tau is increased, which may be due to releases of tau protein from damaged neurons into the CSF [7] . Although PD and AD are both neurodegenerative disease, the dynamics of tau may differ in the two diseases.\nIn the present study, the CSF level of A\u03b21-42, an AD biomarker, was positively correlated with MoCA score, which suggests that cognitive function deteriorates as the CSF A\u03b21-42 level decreases. In AD, a decrease in CSF A\u03b21-42 is thought to be due to its aggregation in Fig. 1 Distribution of CSF levels of total \u03b1-synuclein and clinical assessment scores. The graphs show CSF levels of total \u03b1S with a UPDRS part III scores, b UPDRS subscores for bradykinesia, and c COGNISTAT judgement scores.

The graphs show CSF levels of total \u03b1S with CSF levels of a A\u03b21-42, b total tau, and c P-tau181p.

Therefore, our results suggest that cognitive function deteriorates as aggregation of A\u03b21-42 progresses. However, the CSF level of A\u03b21-42 showed a stronger positive correlation with that of total \u03b1S in the present study. This suggests that \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 interact. It was previously shown that A\u03b2 enhances \u03b1S accumulation and neuronal deficits in vivo [30] , and an in vitro study indicated that A\u03b2 and \u03b1S might interact directly to form pore-like oligomers that contribute to neurodegeneration [31] . We previously showed that \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 act as seeds and affect each other's aggregation pathways in vivo, suggesting a molecular interaction between AD and PD [32] . Co-existence of \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 deposits in human brain is found in pathological studies, and PD patients present with an AD pathology of amyloid deposition, such as senile plaque [8] . Lewy bodies are found in 56.8% of AD cases [33] , A\u03b2 deposits are distributed throughout the medial temporal lobe in DLB patients [34] , and A\u03b2 deposition is associated with enhanced cortical \u03b1S lesions in postmortem brain of PD patients [35] . Therefore, \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 co-aggregate and their CSF levels concurrently decrease. The stronger correlation of the CSF level of A\u03b21-42 with the CSF level of total \u03b1S compared to that with the MoCA total score suggests that the interaction between these proteins is the primary event, with subsequent emergence of cognitive deterioration.\nIn the PPMI study, a correlation between CSF levels of \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 was not observed [23] . The PPMI study included earlier drug-na\u00efve PD patients diagnosed within no more than 2.6 years (median 0.4 years) from onset. In contrast, the present study included many PD patients with a longer duration from onset. Therefore, we calculated the correlation coefficients in patients with a shorter disease duration. The significant correlation between total \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 was preserved in patients with a disease durations of < 1 year (n = 7, r = 0.929, p < 0.01), but not in patients with a disease durations of \u22651 year (n = 20, r = 0.284, p = 0.225). On the other hand, CSF level of total \u03b1S correlated with total tau (n = 20, r = 0.767, p = 0.000) and P-tau181p (n = 18, r = 0.564, p = 0.015) in patients with a disease durations of \u22651 year and these results agree the PPMI study [23] . Difference in correlation of CSF level of total \u03b1S between A\u03b21-42 and total and phosphorylated tau proteins in patients with a disease duration of \u22651 year suggests dynamics of these proteins differ. A possible hypothesis to explain this difference is as follows. In earlier phase which was shown to be a disease duration of < 1 year in our study, these intracellular proteins aggregate as mentioned above. In later phase, neurocytotoxic change progress to promote the aggregation of extracellular A\u03b21-42, and the aggregates of A\u03b21-42 pull out \u03b1S from neurons. Consequently, correlation of CSF levels of \u03b1S and A\u03b21-42 becomes unclear. However the turning point of the earlier to later phase may differ in each patients and/ or cohorts due to unknown factors. Majority of participants in the PPMI study may have the pathophysiology of the later phase as hypothesized above. The reasons for the difference in correlations between our study and the PPMI study are uncertain. Future studies in other cohorts are required to investigate this correlation and elucidate the pathology of PD.\nThis study includes only drug-na\u00efve PD patients and the effect of medication is eliminated. Our results support a central role for interaction and aggregation of \u03b1S with A\u03b21-42, tau, and phosphorylated tau in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the study has limitations. The number of patients is relatively small and we did not include a normal control group. A larger number of participants and control group would have made our conclusions more comprehensive and meaningful. However, recruitment of patients who agree to lumbar puncture is difficult, since most patients with parkinsonism want to be examined without lumbar puncture, and we could not recruit healthy volunteers who agreed to undergo lumbar puncture. Consequently, only 27 patients agreed to participate in the study. However, therapies targeting pathogenic proteins are under development, and knowledge of the relationship between pathogenic proteins and clinical symptoms is important. Therefore, we believe our report is significant and contributes to understanding of the pathophysiology of PD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "CSF levels of \u03b1S correlate with some clinical symptoms and with CSF levels of A\u03b21-42, total tau and P-tau181p in drug-na\u00efve PD patients.
