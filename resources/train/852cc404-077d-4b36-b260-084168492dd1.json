[{"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 2019-nCoV) is a novel member in the genus of Betacoronaviridae and is responsible for the current, rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo this day, this virus, which has a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV but a higher human to human transmissibility [1] , caused more than 16 million infections and 648,000 associated deaths worldwide ( [2] 27 July 2020)\nThe outbreak of the virus began in China, in the city of Wuhan, in December 2019, followed by the shift of the epicenter to Europe in mid-March 2020 [3] . From Europe and Asia, the wave of infection moved to North and South America and as well to Africa. The first COVID-19 case in the Sahel region was reported from Senegal on the 2nd of March 2020 [4] . Within 3 weeks, the virus did spread to all Sahel countries, including Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Tchad, Niger, Sudan and Eritrea, reaching Mali on the 25th of March 2020 [5] ; [6] . Since the Sahel region is currently facing several challenges, including a severe food and security crisis, it is difficult to judge the effects, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the already overwhelmed healthcare systems [7] . Especially in conflict-affected areas where the population has only limited access to clean drinking water and handwashing facilities, hundreds of health centres are closed or are not operating due to the poor security situation. Furthermore, social distancing measures are difficult to implement in the dense African urban settings and the national governments struggle to divide the already insufficient budget between health, food and security emergencies [8] . Therefore it is not surprising that the medical and technical equipment as well as the laboratory infrastructure in those countries is sometimes outdated and not on a comparable level to most European countries or the USA. Hence, only limited genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 exists from the Sahel region, with no whole genome sequences being available from Mali to this date.\nOn 25.03.2020, the first two COVID-19 cases (a 49-year-old woman living in Bamako and a 62-year-old patient from Kayes, both returning from France) were confirmed in Mali [6] . To support the Malian public health system, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capabilities were established at the Centre d'Infectiologie Charles M\u00e9rieux du Mali (CICM-Mali) by training of scientific personnel and by providing testing reagents supported by the German Enhancement Initiative against Biological Threats in the G5 Sahel region. Based on the given training, the CICM-Mali was prepared as the second and central diagnostic center to support the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 for Bamako and its surrounding regions and started its activities on April 3rd.\nSince the confirmation of the first two cases in March 2020, a steady increase in the number of total cases and a fast spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within Mali was observed.

[11] Based on the current data available, 13 out of 100 000\nMalians get infected resulting in a moderate risk for the Malian population to acquire COVID-19, especially considering the fact that mitigation strategies, like social distancing, cannot be applied to the same extent as in Europe [9] . In order to analyse origins of existing infections, distribution patterns and hence limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, sequencing data of COVID-19 positive cases are needed.\nIn this study, we analyzed the first Malian genome sequences of SARS CoV-2 originating from patients from Bamako and its surrounding villages. Using comparative genomics we set the results in the context of available African genome sequences thereby providing data of underrepresented regions, like the Sahel, to the scientific community."}, {"section_title": "Patient sampling", "text": "Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples were collected from 217 suspected patients using "}, {"section_title": "RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 detection", "text": "Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at the Centre d'Infectiologie Charles M\u00e9rieux du Mali by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) according to the published protocol of [10] targeting the RdRp and E gene region.

Furthermore, nearest neighbour sequences to Malian genomes of this lineage are also locally widespread and originate from all over the world"}, {"section_title": "Special features of Malian genomes", "text": "Besides the division of the Malian genomes into the A (19B) and B (20A/C) clusters, two additional observations are worth mentioning.\nThe first one concerns sample M002672, belonging to the A (19B) lineage. Here, a 9 bp deletion at the nucleotide position 685, resulting in a 3 amino-acid deletion of the protein ORF1a, was detected. This microdeletion was already described in SARS-CoV-2 genomes derived from countries of the northern hemisphere like Iceland, Sweden, England, Wales, Canada and USA [22] , but has, to our knowledge, not been detected in African samples so far. Unfortunately, a phenotypic function of this microdeletion remains to this day elusive.\nThe second observation was made in samples M002673 and M002707 at position 14408 and 18973, respectively. In both samples quasispecies, indicated by the simultaneous occurrence of at least two isolates, were detected at the described position. Table 1 lists only the dominant/more frequently occuring mutation. As the quasispecies were observed independent of the sequencing technology (Nanopore and Illumina), artificially introduced mutations via e.g. PCR can be excluded. The C14408T mutation, which leads to the P314L conversion in ORF1b is a known mutation and next to D614D another hallmark for the B (20*) cluster. This mutation seems to provoke a positive effect for the virus and can hence be regarded as directed selection. In contrast, the G18973T mutation, leading to the amino acid exchange V1836F, was only detected once before in a German cluster (example strain: Germany/NRW-MPP-24/2020), but did obviously not manifest. Nevertheless, we had the rare opportunity to witness the evolution of the virus within a human sample.\nRegarding the variant screening we found only one variant in two strains, M002593 and M002659, which may confound evolutionary interpretations: G11083T. Position 11083 is a major homoplastic site in Orf1ab [23] which is geographically ubiquitous, and appears in strain M002659 both in the Illumina and MinION reads. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 25, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.23.20165639 doi: medRxiv preprint "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Up to now, only limited sequencing data of Northern Africa and the Sahel region is available compared to other regions of the world like America, Asia or Europe. Viral genomes spreading on the African continent are mainly accessible from states like South Africa [24] , the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Kenya [25] . For the Sahel region, genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 is only provided by Nigeria [26] and Senegal [5, 27] , while data from countries like Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, Eritrea and Sudan is still missing.\nWith our full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes originating from Mali, we want to contribute to the cohort of sequencing data from the Sahel region thereby enhancing the knowledge of the is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 25, 2020. . Since the A lineage contains the initial emerging pandemic strain, as well as Asian genomes [19] , we suggest a very early, but probably unrecognized onset of infections in Mali. Reasons that most likely encouraged the non-detection of the virus are on the one hand the fragile and overstretched health care system and on the other hand the transmission through patients with only mild symptoms being misdiagnosed or even not at all recognized. These listed reasons might also explain the relatively high mortality rate (5%) and the high estimated number of unreported cases in Mali.\nIn contrast, the B.1 lineage comprises sequences associated with the large Italian outbreak in February 2020 and represents to date (date 21.07.2020), together with its sublineage B.1.1, the worldwide prevalent virus clade [19] . The African continent, especially South Africa is dominated by lineage B (its origin still lying in Asia) and B.1 [24] . In Mali, only \u2153 of the patient samples were assigned to lineage B.1, thus giving rise to speculation that this viral lineage is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted September 25, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.23.20165639 doi: medRxiv preprint but also to reasonable national measures to restrict or terminate the SARS-CoV-2 spread within the country and hence worldwide.\nAvailable online: https://virological.org/t/introduction-and-local-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-cases-in-kenya/497 (accessed on Jul 10, 2020). 26.
