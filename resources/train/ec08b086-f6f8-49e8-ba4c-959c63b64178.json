Its prevalence is estimated to be 5.5 million 1 in 2017, with an estimated incidence of 476 000 in 2016 for people aged 65 years or older. Much of Alzheimer's research over the past decade has been dedicated to the identification and validation of biomarkers that reflect the underlying neuropathology of the disease. Biomarkers will help identify subjects early in their disease course, when therapeutic interventions might be successful. They also will help identify surrogate end points for progression, which will allow for clinical trials that do not require long follow-up to a clinical AD diagnosis.\nSeveral models have been proposed for time-varying AD biomarkers such as Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PIB-PET), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and magnetic resonance imaging measures (MRI). 2, 3 Relating these biomarker trajectories to time-to-event using a Cox regression model would allow for the prediction of disease progression. However, such an analysis presents a challenge, as imaging biomarkers are typically sparsely collected. This is problematic since the Cox regression with time-varying covariates requires observation of the covariate process at all failure times. The analysis could be simplified by treating the time-varying covariate collected only at study entry as a fixed baseline covariate representative of a subject's disease state at the time of measurement. However, in longitudinal AD studies, the time at study entry tends to be arbitrary, and the interpretability of such an analysis is tenuous. 4, 5 In a time-to-event analysis, a well-chosen time origin should align subjects with respect to risk, so that conditional on baseline covariates subjects are comparable. 6 In addition, the choice of time origin should address the goals of the analysis and provide meaningful estimates. 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] A natural choice of time origin in AD is pathological disease onset, a point at which individuals are comparable with respect to risk. However, disease onset precedes clinical symptoms by decades, and thus, the exact time of onset is unknown. As an alternative, the time of first clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a reasonable and measurable time origin. Birth is a plausible time origin since disease risk increases with age; however, individuals at a given age may not necessarily be comparable with respect to risk, even after conditioning on fixed covariates. In summary, while using study entry as the time origin would enable the use of the time-varying biomarker as a fixed covariate in the analysis, it would jeopardize the interpretability of the analysis.\nSeveral authors have considered the use of an incorrect time origin of study entry in a proportional hazards model with a fixed-time covariate. Assuming the true time origin is birth, Korn and colleagues 8 showed that fitting a proportional hazards model that uses study entry as the time origin does preserve the true regression coefficient corresponding to a fixed baseline covariate, provided that age at entry is included as a covariate in the model and the baseline hazard on the age scale follows an exponential form. Thiebaut and Benichou 13 and Pencina et al 11 investigated the practical ramifications of this result when the baseline hazard is not of exponential functional form (eg, Weibull or piecewise Weibull) and found that the bias in the regression coefficient was not large for a wide range of true values.\nIn the case of time-varying covariates, some simulation studies have suggested an extension of the result from Korn et al 8 ; however, this has not been established analytically. Cnaan and Ryan 4 argued that using an incorrect time origin would preserve the regression parameter of interest provided that survival on the age scale is exponentially distributed. In a simulation study, Thiebaut and Benichou 13 found that use of study entry as the time origin results in unbiased estimates for a Cox model with constant baseline hazard function and a fully observed time-varying binary covariate. Through simulations, Thiebaut and Benichou 13 and Griffin et al 14 illustrated that bias can result when an incorrect choice of time origin is used in a Cox model with time-varying covariates when the true baseline hazard is Weibull. There are no papers that consider estimation based on a time-varying covariate that is observed only at study entry, with the time origin taken to be either onset or study entry.\nThere is a considerable literature on dealing with sparse observation of time-varying covariates [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] in survival regression models; standard methods include imputation, likelihood estimation, and joint modeling. These methods are not applicable to many current Alzheimer's studies because of the their very sparse observation of the time-varying imaging biomarker. Relevant to this setting, Sperrin and Buchan 12 proposed a 2-stage method for analyzing survival data with time-varying covariates measured at a single, arbitrary time point. They assume that the covariate process can be expressed as the sum of a population-level function and individual time-independent errors. The first stage involves estimating the population parameters of the covariate function and then calculating for each subject the residual error relative to the observed value. In the second stage, the estimated residual for each subject is included as a covariate in a survival model. They provided an analytical argument for the use of birth as the time origin, rather than study entry. They showed through simulations that their 2-stage residual method has superior predictive ability, as measured by Brier and logarithmic scores, when birth is used as the origin and the estimated residuals and age are included in the model as covariates, compared with 2 competing models that treat the time-varying covariate as fixed: one from study entry that adjusts for age as a covariate and another from birth that does not adjust for age.\nIn this paper, we consider the analysis of time-to-event data in conjunction with a time-varying covariate that is observed only at study entry. We assume the true time origin for the risk model is known and precedes study entry. We extend the results of Korn et al to the case of time-varying biomarkers and derive the conditions for which treating a time-varying biomarker as fixed at study entry results in an unbiased regression coefficient estimator. We then extend the work of Sperrin and Buchan, 12 who proposed methods for relating a time-varying covariate with fixed-time residuals to time-to-event when the covariate is measured only at study entry, by incorporating time-varying residuals. Furthermore, whereas Sperrin and Buchan focused on predictive ability, we investigate bias and standard error estimation. We use the sigmoidal AD biomarker model 22 as the basis for this approach. We support our analytical results and methods with simulation studies. Finally, we apply our methods to data from the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project and from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and demonstrate the impact of different treatments of the time-varying biomarker."}, {"section_title": "NOTATION AND MODELS", "text": "For subject i, let U i denotes the time from disease onset to event, let C i denotes the time from disease onset to censoring, let E i denotes the time from disease onset to study entry, and let Z i (u) denotes a time-varying covariate. We use the notation Z i (u) to denote the history of Z up to and including time u. Then T i = U i \u2212 E i represents the time from study entry to event. The observed time from onset to event is Y i = min(U i , C i ), and i = I (Y i \u2264 C i ) is the status indicator. We assume that the time-varying covariates are collected only at study entry. The observed data are thus\nWe assume that the time-varying covariate, or biomarker, Z i (u), after transformation via f(\u00b7), satisfies a general additive error model, f(Z i (u)) = f(S(u)) + i (u), where S(u) is the population-level biomarker trajectory and i (u) is an individual-level time-dependent deviation. We assume that the individual-level deviations are defined by\nwhere a i and b i are randomly distributed, both with mean 0; consequently, i (u) has mean 0. When f is the identity function, we refer to (1) as the absolute error model since the individual-level deviations are on the same scale as the population-level trajectory. When f is the identify function and b i \u2261 0, the covariate model in (1) coincides with the covariate model provided by Sperrin and Buchan. 12 When f(x) = logit(x\u2215M), for some constant M, we refer to (1) as the logit error model.\nIn the setting of AD, many population-level biomarker trajectories are plausibly modeled using a sigmoidal function\nwhere the upper bound M is assumed to be known as the maximum value of the biomarker and the parameters and T 0 , which dictate the shape of the sigmoid, are not known. When T 0 = 0, S(0) = M\u22152; the value of T 0 determines the lateral shift of this curve. The parameter determines the rate at which the sigmoid accelerates to its maximum value with larger values indicating a faster rate of increase; at u = T 0 , the slope of the sigmoid is M \u22154. The covariate function S(u) should be selected on the basis of prior studies and subject matter understanding. Scatter plots of the cross-sectional data may also give insight into to the functional form of the covariate process. Choice of the error function, f(\u00b7), also requires consideration. The absolute error model may not be appropriate for covariates that are constrained by a maximum measured value, such as positron emission tomography amyloid, as it may lead to individual-specific trajectories that exceed the maximum value. The logit error model with time-varying deviations has an attractive interpretation when the population-level function is assumed to be the sigmoid in (2) . The individual-specific deviations modify the acceleration parameter, , and the shift parameter, T 0 , so that each subject is allowed to have an individual-specific trajectory. In particular, inserting the sigmoidal function (2) into the logit error model (1) yields an individual-specific sigmoidal covariate function,\n. The logit error model assumes that the time-varying covariate is linear on the logit scale, which may be appropriate only in some settings.\nWe assume that the true hazard function for the event of interest conditional on the history of Z, with time measured from onset, is\nfor some function g and baseline hazard function, 0U (u). In this paper, we consider the case g = f. In general, g should be defined to best capture the nature of the biomarker trajectory and its relationship to the hazard of the event."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS OF USING STUDY ENTRY AS THE TIME ORIGIN FOR COX MODELS WITH TIME-VARYING PREDICTORS", "text": "When an appropriate time origin precedes study entry and the covariate of interest is not time varying, Korn et al 8 provided sufficient conditions under which fitting a model that uses study entry as the time origin preserves the desired estimated regression coefficient corresponding to the fixed covariate.

Under these conditions,\u0302based on fitting the Cox model specified in (4) will be a consistent estimator of . We now extend the results of Korn et al to the case of a continuous time-varying covariate, w i (u), and provide conditions under which using study entry as the time origin and/or treating a time-varying covariate as fixed will preserve the Cox regression parameter of interest. Suppose that the true survival model is\nWe assume further that E and U are continuous random variables and that the time-varying biomarker w(u) is continuous and defined on the support of U. Without loss of generality, we assume that the support of E is contained in the support of U. In addition, we assume that \u2260 0, and the study entry times, E i , and biomarkers, w i (u), are not constant across individuals.\nWe consider 3 possible models that might be fit to these data. First, we consider the model that uses study entry as the time origin and adjusts for study entry time as a covariate\nwherew(t) denotes the history of w up to and including time t. In Theorem 1 part (a) below, we derive conditions on the true baseline hazard function under which the coefficient of w i (t + E i ) is equal to . Assuming only that 0U (u) = ce u , the Cox partial likelihood derived from (6) can be used for estimation of . Note that this extends the fixed covariate case (Korn et al 8 ). Next, we consider models that treat the time-varying predictor as fixed, using either onset or study entry as the origin, and derive conditions under which we obtain a consistent estimator of . If the value of the time-varying covariate is known only at study entry, it can be included in a Cox model as a fixed covariate in a second model with onset as the time origin:\nNote that estimation of this model must adjust for delayed entry (left truncation). If time from onset to study entry is known, we can include E i as a covariate in a third model using study entry as the time origin:\nThe case where there is no covariate adjustment for study entry time is included in this model when = 0. Alternatively, the time of study entry could be adjusted for through stratification or through covariate adjustment by a nonlinear function of E i , which we do not consider here. In Theorem 1 parts (b) and (c), we derive conditions under which the coefficients of w i (E i ) in (7) and (8) The proof for Theorem 1 is given in the Appendix. Theorem 1 provides guidelines for implementing Cox regression with a time-varying covariate using study entry as the origin or when the time-varying covariate is measured only at study entry. Theorem 1 part (a) shows that study entry can be used as the origin if the covariate process is fully observed or if its functional form is known, as long as the baseline hazard is of exponential functional form. These conditions are reasonable in some settings: In many instances, a covariate process can be modeled using subject-level knowledge, 23 and constant hazard functions have been empirically shown to model incidence in many epidemiological studies, 24 and exponential-form (Gompertz) baseline hazards are widely used to model mortality.\nIf the time-varying covariate is observed only at study entry and its functional form is known, then the covariate process can be treated as fixed in an analysis from onset, as long as the covariate function, w i (u), satisfies the condition in Theorem 1 part (b). An example of such a function is\nwhere L is the upper bound of the support of E and h is continuous; this is a time-varying continuous covariate function that is constant on the support of E but can vary for values of u outside of the support of E. Since we are mainly concerned with w(u) on the support of E, Theorem 1 part (b) indicates that treating a time-varying (ie, nonconstant) biomarker as fixed using onset as the origin is not valid.\nTheorem 1 part (c) shows that if the time-varying covariate is observed only at study entry, an analysis using study entry as the origin is valid only for special cases of the baseline hazard and covariate process. As discussed above, the baseline hazard assumptions are realistic in some settings. One example of a time-varying covariate that satisfies the condition in Theorem 1 part (c) is w i (t) = a i + a 1 t, a linear function with a subject-specific intercept. Thus, in some instances, it is reasonable to treat time-varying covariates as fixed in an analysis from study entry.\nIn Theorem 1 parts (a) and (c), when the true baseline hazard function is of an exponential form, the results of the theorem are contingent upon the incorporation of study entry time, E, into the model as a linear covariate. It can be shown, using arguments analogous to the proofs of Theorem 1 parts (a) and (c), that adjustment of study entry time through a transformation of E results in biased estimation; however, the extent of the bias is unknown. However, correct specification of E may be important if entry time is highly correlated with the biomarker. For the case of a fixed covariate, Pencina et al 11 illustrated through simulations that in an analysis from study entry, adjusting for E using a quadratic term and also through stratified methods can result in negligible bias.\nThe focus of this paper is the impact of the time-varying covariate (1), on the hazard function through the Cox model defined in (5). Theorem 1 part (a) allows for valid estimation of using study entry as the time origin provided that f, a i , and b i are known, E i is included in the model as a covariate, and 0U (u) = c exp{ u}. If the covariate process is known only at study entry, then it is not valid to treat the time-varying covariate as fixed in an analysis from onset because \nNote that the results of Theorem 1, parts (a) and (c), apply even when = 0. In contrast, Theorem 1 part (b) does not apply to this case. If = 0, then the true survival model is\nIf we fit the model in (7), it is easy to see that = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 0U (u) = 1U (u). In practice, this implies that fitting (7) when = 0 will yield\u0302= 0 without restrictions on w i (u)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "On the basis of our analysis in Section 3, it is not advisable to treat time-varying biomarkers measured only at study entry as fixed covariates for the time origin of disease onset. And for the time origin of study entry, this can be done only under strong assumptions on the baseline hazard function and the covariate function. Thus, lacking full observation of the biomarkers over time, we require an approach that will allow us to estimate the full biomarker trajectory based on cross-sectional observation of it and, importantly, does not require restrictive assumptions on the baseline hazard function of the functional form of the covariate process.\nAssuming that the time-varying biomarker follows the general error model in (1) and the true hazard can be modeled as in (3) for g = f, we provide methods for estimating the regression parameter when the fully observed time-varying biomarker is measured only at study entry.

Nonlinear least squares minimization was executed using the nls function in the stats package 27 with convergence parameters set to maxiter=1e4 and minFactor=1e-10 and with the default tolerance tol = 1e-5. Hazard regression was implemented using the function coxph in the survival package. 28 Cox models with time-varying predictors were fit using the time-transform option of coxph or using the counting process style input. R code is available in the Supporting Information.\nThe simulation results are given in Table 1 for varying values of , = 0.25, a = 0.5 and b = 0.05, and trunc = 0.2 for the fixed (a i ) and time-varying (b i ) individual-level deviations models, respectively. Means and standard deviations of simulated estimates are presented. Type I error and power were taken to be the proportion of simulations, which rejected the test statistic with probability less than 0.05 for = 0 and > 0, respectively. Type I error and power corresponding to = 0.5 are given in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively, for the parameter values used in Table 1 . For the case of fixed deviations (a i ) and a normal density kernel baseline hazard, the parameters originally chosen for the baseline hazard function to align with the AD setting result in a baseline hazard function that closely resembles an exponential and thus do not serve the purpose of illustrating results under deviations from the exponential. Thus, the parameters of the normal density kernel baseline hazard were then chosen to illustrate this contrast, (c, a, m) = (0.05, 30, 1), and the results for this parameterization of the normal kernel density baseline hazard function in the fixed deviations case are given in Table 1 .\nThe simulation results in column 1 of Table 1 confirm that fitting the true survival model, in (A), gives consistent estimates of . The second column demonstrates that the proposed method described in Section 4, which corresponds to model (A), performs nearly as well as fitting the true model in column 1 for all baseline hazard distributions considered (constant, exponential form, and normal density kernel), with slightly higher standard errors, because of estimation of the covariate process.\nWhen the covariate process follows the general error model in (1), Theorem 1 part (b) guarantees that treating a time-varying biomarker as fixed at its value at study entry will always produce biased estimates of if the true origin is used, for nonzero values of . This analysis corresponds to fitting model (B), and the results are listed in column 3 of Table 1 for \u2260 0 for both fixed and time-varying deviations and for all 3 baseline hazards considered and are as expected. When = 0, we expect the estimated regression coefficient to be zero (see discussion following Theorem 1); this is seen in the table, as well.\nTheorem 1 part (c) provides conditions for when using an incorrect origin of study entry and treating the time-varying predictors as fixed results in consistent estimates of . For the fixed deviation models (ie, a i ), the discussion following Theorem 1 ensures that inference is valid if study entry is used as the time origin and the time-varying biomarker is treated as fixed (with or without covariate adjustment for study entry time), as in models (C) and (D), provided that the baseline hazard is constant. Similarly, if the baseline hazard follows an exponential form and both the value of the time-varying biomarker at study entry and study entry time are included in the model as covariates, as in (D), estimates of are unbiased. For the time-varying deviations models (b i ), Theorem 1 part (c) guarantees that estimates of will be biased if study entry is used as the time origin and the time-varying biomarker is treated as a fixed covariate (with or without covariate adjustment for study entry time), as in (C) and (D). These theoretical findings are illustrated through our simulation results in columns 4 and 5.\nTheorem 1 part (a) corresponds to models (E) and (F). It asserts that for a constant baseline hazard, the model that uses study entry as the origin and includes f(Z i (t + E i )) as a time-varying covariate, with or without covariate adjustment for study entry time, will give consistent estimates of for fixed or time-varying deviations. For a baseline hazard that is of an exponential form, fitting the model that uses study entry as the origin, including both f(Z i (t + E i )) and study entry time as covariates, will give consistent estimates of . These results are supported through our simulations whenf (Z i (t + E i )) is used to approximate f(Z i (t + E i )). When the baseline hazard does not follow an exponential form, Theorem 1 part (a) guarantees that estimates of will be biased if a model is fit using study entry as the origin, including both f(Z i (t + E i )) and study entry time as covariates. For the case of the normal density kernel baseline hazard and fixed deviations, this is confirmed through our simulation results, whenf (Z i (t + E i )) is used to approximate f(Z i (t + E i )), with greater bias corresponding to larger values of . For the case of the normal density kernel baseline hazard and time-varying deviations, our simulation results indicate that the bias increases with .\nFor the models with fixed deviations (a i ), notice that fitting models (C) and (E) give identical results. The same is true for models (D) and (F). As noted at the end of Section 4.1, this is expected when the form of the covariate model is linear in u, as is the case with the sigmoid-based logit error model. Table 2 shows that the type I error is within 0.06 for all analyses that use onset as the time origin. For the analyses that use study entry as the origin, the type I error is less than 0.06 for baseline hazard functions that are constant, or follow an exponential form, provided that study entry time is included as a covariate (models (D) and (E); the type I error is inflated for all other analyses from study entry. This follows from Theorem 1 parts (a) and (c), which hold for = 0; specifically, when = 0 and the conditions of Theorem 1 parts (a) and (c) are not met, then the estimated regression coefficients are expected to be nonzero. Table 3 shows that the null hypothesis test is well powered, under the simulation parameters specified in Table 1 , for all analyses except for when onset is used as the time origin and the time-varying covariate is treated as fixed (model (B). In this case, the population-level covariate function is absorbed by the baseline hazard function, and the impact of the covariate is due to the individual-specific deviations, as in (9); it is likely that \u00b7 a i is close to zero for all subjects so that the likelihood of rejecting the null is also small. In additional simulations (not shown), variations in the truncation probability, trunc , had little effect on bias, type I error, and power. Larger values of a and b , the standard deviations of a i and b i , were associated with smaller standard errors and greater power, but had little effect on type I error. Varying , the acceleration parameter of the sigmoid S(u), gave comparable results with respect to bias, type I error, and power; however, greater values of were required to see bias in the case of a normal density-based baseline hazard and a covariate process with time-varying deviations (b i ). Reducing the sample size to n = 100 resulted in larger standard errors and less power, but had little effect on type I error and bias, except for the case of a normal density-based baseline hazard and time-varying deviations (b i ) where greater values of were needed to see bias.\nThe analytical standard errors from the Cox model do not account for the variability from estimating the sigmoidal parameters and may therefore be underestimated. Bootstrapped standard errors would account for the 2 sources of variation; however, bootstrapping within this simulation study is not computationally feasible. Because of this, we present the analytical standard errors. In Section 6, where we apply our methods to Alzheimer's data, we compare the analytical and bootstrapped standard errors."}, {"section_title": "APPLICATION TO ALZHEIMER'S DATA", "text": "We applied our methodology to 2 Alzheimer's studies: one from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC) and the other from the ADNI. We chose to study the impact of a single biomarker on disease progression.

This complements the existing literature on sigmoidal biomarker models for AD proposed by Jack and colleagues. 2 On the basis of this theoretical framework for Alzheimer's biomarkers and empirical evidence, we assumed a sigmoidal trajectory (2) for the time-varying biomarker in both analyses.\nWe fit models (A)-(E), and (F). We also fit the model that adjusts the lateral shift on the basis of an individual's disease severity in Section 4.3. To account for estimation of the covariate process in variance estimation, we used a simple bootstrap with 5000 resamples. For each study, we describe below the analyses, study population, biomarker, error model, origin, end point, and study entry definitions."}, {"section_title": "Global cognition", "text": "We obtained a limited dataset from the RADC that combines data from the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project. 29, 30 The biomarker was an average of a battery of 19 cognitive test z scores, 31 which was taken to be a measure of global cognitive function. The origin was defined as birth, the study entry was defined as the time of baseline visit, and the end point was defined to be time of death or time of last cognitive testing based on the Mini-mental State Examination, 32 which is the last time the patient is known to be alive. Only subjects with at least one biomarker measurement and who carried a diagnosis of MCI at the time of biomarker measurement were included in the study. The global measure of cognition was translated by 2 units to achieve positive values. Gender and body mass index 33 were included as covariates in the model that adjusts the lateral shift on the basis of an individual's disease severity.\nIn choosing an error model, we used graphical diagnostics to determine goodness-of-fit of the absolute error and logit error models based on the sigmoid, S(u), in (2) . The absolute error model assumes that Z(u) = S(u; , T 0 ) + a i + b i u. We used least squares to estimate and T 0 based on data (E i , Z(E i )) and plotted the residuals, Z(E i ) \u2212 S(E i ;\u0302,T 0 ), against study entry time, E i . We saw that the residuals were centered around zero with nearly constant variance, indicating that the sigmoid-based absolute error model with fixed deviations aligned well with the observed biomarker data. We also considered the sigmoid-based logit error model that assumes that the transformed biomarker, logit(Z i (u)\u2215M), is linear in u. We plotted the transformed observed biomarker values collected at study entry, logit(Z i (E i )\u2215M), against time at study entry, E i , and saw a nonlinear, decreasing trend that accelerates with time. On the basis of these diagnostics, we assumed the global measure of cognition followed a sigmoid-based absolute error model with fixed deviations. As a sensitivity analysis, we also fit the sigmoid-based absolute error model with time-varying deviations, the sigmoid-based logit error model with both fixed and time-varying deviations, and the following linear absolute error model,\nwhere and T 0 play similar roles as they do in the sigmoidal function. The corresponding severity adjusted model is given by\nwhere w i is a vector of individual-specific covariates reflecting disease severity, which alter the lateral shift of the linear function.\nDescriptive statistics are given in Table 4 . A total of 737 subjects were included in the analysis, of whom 473 experienced the event. A plot of the cross-sectional global cognition score at time of baseline visit with a fitted loess curve is displayed in Figure 1 . Although on the basis of cross-sectional, and not longitudinal data, a sigmoidal functional form is discernible, and a clear downward trend is present indicating a decline in global cognition with increasing age.\nThe results of the analysis are displayed in Table 5 . For each of the 6 covariate models assumed (absolute error, sigmoid a i , etc), the estimated regression coefficient of the biomarker, considering 2 different origins and treating the biomarker as time varying or fixed, is presented. Note that models (B), (C), and (D), which include the time-varying biomarker value at study entry as a fixed covariate, do not involve estimation of the covariate function and are thus listed with the same results for fixed (a i ) as for time-varying deviations (b i ). For these models, the 2-stage method proposed by Sperrin and Buchan 12 is comparable with our method. Assuming the sigmoid-based absolute error model with fixed deviations, a i , the hazard ratio comparing the biomarker level over a one unit difference in the biomarker is 0.60 (exp(\u22120.51)) based on our proposed method (A). It is 0.49 (exp(\u2212.72)) based on (E) that assumes the origin is study entry and treats the biomarker as a fixed covariate, adjusting for time between the origin and study entry. This difference highlights the importance of selection of the analytic approach for answering the clinical question. Given that there is support for the sigmoid-based absolute error model with fixed deviations based on our diagnostics, and it does not require any assumptions on the baseline hazard, we would report the hazard ratio of 0.60. For the birth origin analyses, the estimates from the model that treats the biomarker as fixed (B) are smaller in magnitude by approximately 30% than those from the model that estimates the full covariate trajectory (A), with the exception of the absolute error model with time-varying deviations (second row) where the effect is increased in magnitude by 30%. The estimates from the severity adjusted analyses using birth as the origin (column 3) are also moderately different from the estimated time-varying model (A), with more of a difference seen with the linear trend biomarker models, in which the change in magnitude of the regression estimates is more than 65%. This suggests that subject-specific adjustments to the sigmoidal model are potentially important. This is seen as well with respect to the covariate function parameter estimates given in Table S2 . When study entry is taken to be the origin, there are moderate differences across the 4 models that we fit (columns 4 through 7), and these estimates can vary dramatically from the estimates that are obtained when using birth as the origin (columns 1 through 3). In summary, for this data example, the choice of time origin and treatment of time-varying covariates do impact inference and thought must be given to the implications of these choices. Although the magnitude of the estimates for the models differ slightly, the direction of the effect among all models using both origins agrees.\nAs mentioned in Section 5, the analytical standard errors from the Cox model do not account for the variability in estimating the sigmoidal parameters and are likely to be underestimated. Table 6 compares the analytical standard errors with the bootstrapped standard errors. For the logit error models, the analytical standard errors are comparable with those that are obtained via bootstrapping. For the biomarker models based on the sigmoid with an absolute error model and based on the linear model, the analytical standard errors are greatly underestimated, suggesting that bootstrapped standard errors should be used."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal volume", "text": "We also analyzed data from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). Launched in 2003, the ADNI is a longitudinal study aimed at using biomarkers of AD and clinical and neuropsychiatric assessments to measure the progression of MCI and AD. 34 The origin was defined as birth, the study entry was defined as the first biomarker measurement, and the end point was defined to be the time of the first diagnosis of AD in the ADNI study. Only subjects with at least one biomarker measurement and who carried a diagnosis of MCI at the time of biomarker measurement were included in the study. Gender and APOE4 allele status were included as covariates in the model that adjusts the lateral shift on the basis of an individual's disease severity. After considering several potential markers in a preliminary analysis, we chose to focus on hippocampal volume, where a clear downward trend was seen in the cross-sectional plot. We standardized and shifted the values by 3 units so that all resulting biomarkers quantities were positive. Descriptive statistics for the study population are given in Table 7 . We used graphical diagnostics, as described for the Rush data, to chose an error model for these data. A plot of logit(Z(E i )\u2215M) against E i resulted in a clear linear trend with constant variability. In considering an absolute error model based on the sigmoid in (2) and linear trends in (14) , neither of the residual plots had mean zero. Therefore, we assumed a sigmoid-based logit error model for this analysis. We fit the sigmoid-and linear trend-based absolute error models as sensitivity analyses.\nThe results of the analysis are reported in Table 8 . There were only small differences seen across the 3 birth origin models and the 4 study entry origin models that were fit, regardless of the biomarker model chosen. This was likely due to short follow-up and only small variations in the measured biomarker levels but potentially a nonexponential functional form for the baseline hazard function."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In settings such as AD, using study entry as the time origin in a time-to-event analysis is convenient because time-varying biomarkers are often measured only at study entry and thus can be used as fixed baseline covariates. If study entry is not an appropriate time origin, the question of interest is \"under what conditions is it valid to use an incorrect time origin of study entry in a Cox model with time-varying covariates?\" The answer to this question for the case of fixed covariates was established by Korn et al. 8 We have extended the work of Korn et al to the case of a time-varying covariate; we have shown that using an incorrect origin of study entry is valid only for special cases of the baseline hazard function provided that the functional form of the covariate process is fully observed. We further examined the implications of treating a continuous, time-varying covariate as fixed at its value at study entry for both the onset and study entry origins; we showed that this is only valid in certain cases of the baseline hazard and time-varying covariate. These theoretical findings underscore the necessity for full observation of time-varying covariates or good modeling of them. This is challenging unless good prior data are available.\nFor situations in which the full covariate function is not available, we developed methods for estimating regression coefficients when the time-varying covariate follows the general error model f(Z i (u)) = f(S(u)) + a i + b i u, when only f(Z i (E i )) is observed; this is a generalization of the covariate model with fixed residuals given by Sperrin and Buchan. 12 While Sperrin and Buchan focused on predictive ability, we have examined the bias and standard errors of hazard model estimates.\nOur analysis of the RADC data provides an example of where the choice of time origin and biomarker model can dramatically affect estimation in the presence of a time-varying covariate. Estimates from an analysis from study entry that treats the time-varying biomarker as fixed are quite different from the estimates of our proposed model, even when time between onset and study entry is adjusted for as a continuous covariate. On the other hand, our analysis of ADNI data provides an example of when incorrectly viewing a time-varying covariate as fixed had little effect on estimation that was likely due to covariate measurements that are nearly constant over a short follow-up period. However, the choice of time origin did have a noticeable effect, suggesting that the baseline hazard was not of the requisite exponential functional form to permit the use of study entry as the origin.\nIn this paper, we assume that the history of the biomarker is not used for case ascertainment. If it were used, such as through a requirement that subjects' value for the biomarker be below a threshold, we would potentially have to adjust our estimation procedure in Section 4 to account for partial observation of the biomarker function, S. Furthermore, interpretation of results would be limited to the sample population.\nA main limitation of our results in Theorem 1 parts (a) and (c) is that the time of onset must be known. While exact onset dates are not known within the setting of AD, there are intermediate milestone times that may be known up to short intervals of time. And given the relatively long period of time during which biomarkers such as cognitive tests or amyloid are nonelevated, the error around the exact onset date may not be critical. However, if we cannot trust the purported time origin and revert to using study entry as the origin, the contribution of our paper is to identify when that is a reasonable approach and when it is not. Specifically, our analytical results show that it is valid to use study entry as the origin and treat time-varying covariates as fixed only when the baseline hazard measured from onset of disease is constant and the continuous, time-varying covariate process satisfies the condition in Theorem 1 part (c).\nThe strength of this work is that our analytical results and methods can be applied to any setting in which time-varying covariates follow continuous trajectories. It is important to note that our results are particular to the Cox model in which time-dependent population-level expressions are absorbed into the baseline hazard function, as in (9) . For example, the methods we proposed cannot be directly applied to accelerated failure time (AFT) regression, as the AFT model with time-varying covariates cannot be simplified in this way. However, Sperrin and Buchan 12 showed through simulations that including individual-specific deviations in an AFT regression model is superior in its predictive ability to the model that includes the time-varying covariate treated as fixed.\nAs serial biomarker measurements are increasingly collected in longitudinal studies such as the RADC studies and ADNI, possibilities exist for improved analyses via better parametric modeling, identification of both components of individual level deviation, a i and b i , and more efficient estimation of the dependence between the event time and biomarker. With 2 or more biomarker measurements per individual, our methods would allow for the estimation of the desired regression parameter whereas methods for Cox regression with missing data and joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data are not likely to be robust with so few covariate measurements.\nof i.
