[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose-Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a frequent pathology in aging and contributor to the development of dementia. Plasma A\u03b2 (amyloid \u03b2) levels may be useful as early biomarker, but the role of plasma A\u03b2 in SVD remains to be elucidated. We investigated the association of plasma A\u03b2 levels with severity and progression of SVD markers. Methods-We studied 487 participants from the RUN DMC study (Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cohort) of whom 258 participants underwent 3 MRI assessments during 9 years. We determined baseline plasma A\u03b238, A\u03b240, and A\u03b242 levels using ELISAs. We longitudinally assessed volume of white matter hyperintensities semiautomatically and manually rated lacunes and microbleeds. We analyzed associations between plasma A\u03b2 and SVD markers by ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension. Results-Cross-sectionally, plasma A\u03b240 levels were elevated in participants with microbleeds (mean, 205.4 C erebral small vessel disease (SVD) is frequently seen on neuroimaging of elderly as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and microbleeds 1 and is recognized as the most important vascular contributor to the development of dementia.\n2,3 Hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are the most common causes of SVD, 4 which are distinguished based on both the localization of the lesions and the distribution of neuroimaging characteristics, that is, whereas CAA predominantly affects cortical arteries and hence is characterized by lobar microbleeds, hypertensive arteriopathy typically affects small perforating end arteries in deep brain areas and is characterized by deep microbleeds.\nAlong with traditional vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, A\u03b2 (amyloid \u03b2) has emerged as contributor to SVD.

The Swedish BioFINDER study (Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably) reported associations between elevated plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels and WMH and microbleeds, 10 and the ADNI study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) reported elevated A\u03b240 levels in participants with lacunar infarctions. 12 Another study in elderly with CAA, Alzheimer disease, and mild cognitive impairment reported associations between elevated plasma A\u03b240 levels and increased WMH and lacunes in all groups. 9 In the populationbased Rotterdam Scan Study, elevated plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were associated with the extent of WMH and the presence of lacunes in APOE \u03b54 carriers only. 11 Unfortunately, we do not have data on APOE genotype for our participants. More recently, associations between elevated plasma A\u03b238, A\u03b240, and A\u03b242 levels and markers of SVD have been reported in 2 subsamples of the same population-based study. 23 Our results showing elevated plasma A\u03b2 levels in participants with SVD strengthen the evidence for an association between plasma A\u03b2 and SVD cross-sectionally.\nThe longitudinal design of our study enabled us to elaborate on the directionality of the associations between plasma A\u03b2 levels and cerebrovascular pathology. In our study, progression of WMH and incident microbleeds and lacunes were associated with elevated plasma A\u03b2 levels of \u22651 of the peptides. In contrast, the Three-City Dijon Study showed that decreased plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels were associated with WMH progression over time but did not find cross-sectional associations of plasma A\u03b2 with SVD markers. 13 Discrepancies in these results might be explained by the different study populations with variation in SVD burden, different assay designs, or how the analysis of the samples was done. Especially, the multicenter design might have complicated longitudinal SVD assessment. 24 Interestingly, in our study, associations were different for different A\u03b2 peptides: elevated A\u03b242 levels were associated with incident microbleeds, whereas elevated A\u03b238 and A\u03b240 levels were associated with WMH progression and incident lacunes. This might be explained by the characteristics of the different A\u03b2 peptides because the A\u03b242 peptide is known to have more tendency to aggregate compared with the A\u03b238 and A\u03b240 peptides. 25, 26 Plasma A\u03b2 levels are expressed as mean\u00b1SD (in pg/mL) and stratified by distribution of microbleeds. Statistical differences in plasma A\u03b2 levels vs group without microbleeds, analyzed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction.\n*P<0.05 unadjusted.\nA\u03b242 in the media of arterioles 27 might weaken the vessel walls and ultimately lead to hemorrhages, 28 although experimental studies would be required to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Altogether, our findings that elevated plasma A\u03b2 levels were not only associated with severity of SVD crosssectionally but also predicted the progression of SVD over time suggest that A\u03b2 pathology-either neurodegeneration or CAA-might contribute to the development and progression of SVD.\nSeveral mechanisms could explain the associations between plasma A\u03b2 levels and SVD. First, plasma A\u03b2 might enhance endothelium-dependent vasoconstriction, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion, which in turn might result in WMH and lacunes. [29] [30] [31] Second, an inverse relation could also explain our findings, that is, that cerebral hypoperfusion, or reduced cerebral blood flow, promotes overproduction of A\u03b2 and its secretion into the circulation. 32 Our findings showing associations between plasma A\u03b2 levels and progression of SVD markers over time support the first mechanism. Third, a relative overproduction of A\u03b2 might lead to enhanced A\u03b2 accumulation in the media of arterioles, 27 weakening the vessel walls and leading to microbleeds. Fourth, SVD might affect plasma amyloid levels through impairment in perivascular clearance, 33 leading to vascular amyloid deposits and decreased plasma A\u03b2 levels. Because we found elevated plasma A\u03b2 levels in participants with SVD, we consider the latter hypothesis less likely. Finally, the reported associations between plasma A\u03b2 and SVD might also be explained by mixed age-related pathologies, that is, SVD might interact with Alzheimer type neurodegeneration. This hypothesis has been supported by previous studies reporting the presence of WMH in patients with Alzheimer disease, 34, 35 although our findings that associations between plasma A\u03b2 levels and SVD markers were independent of markers for neurodegeneration attenuate this hypothesis.\nOur findings indicate that plasma A\u03b2 levels are elevated in participants with hypertension (Table III in the online-only  Data Supplement) , which, in turn, is associated with SVD markers (data not shown). This association between hypertension and plasma A\u03b2 is also reported in previous studies. 10, 12, 14, 15 In our analyses, we adjusted for hypertension to confirm that the associations between plasma A\u03b2 levels and SVD markers were independent of hypertension. In future, it would be interesting to study the interactions between blood pressure, plasma A\u03b2 levels, and cerebrovascular pathology in more detail.\nAdditional analyses on plasma A\u03b2 levels by distribution of microbleeds showed no clear distinction in plasma A\u03b2 levels between deep versus lobar microbleeds, although analyses might have been underpowered. Together with the associations found between plasma A\u03b2 levels and WMH and lacunes, these results suggest that plasma A\u03b2 might be a general cerebrovascular disease marker rather than specific for CAA.\nMajor strengths of this study include the large number of elderly participants with SVD in whom both plasma A\u03b2 levels and neuroimaging were assessed and the longitudinal design of the study with a long follow-up duration. The long followup duration enabled us to study progression of SVD makers, including WMH, lacunes, and microbleeds over the course of almost a decade. Furthermore, assessments of SVD neuroimaging markers and A\u03b2 levels were performed blinded to clinical data, limiting the risk of bias. Finally, our study has high external validity for patients with SVD in a general neurology clinic.\nSeveral limitations deserve consideration. First, because we only collected plasma samples at baseline, we were not able to perform repeated plasma A\u03b2 measurements. As a consequence, we could not assess the influence of changes in plasma A\u03b2 levels over time on progression of SVD markers. Second, we do not have information on APOE genotype, which precluded us from studying the interaction between APOE status, plasma A\u03b2 levels, and SVD markers. Third, attrition bias might have led to an underestimation of the effects. Because of the long-term follow-up of our study, a proportion of the participants was unable to complete the entire follow-up, which may have reduced power in analyses on progression of SVD markers over time because those lost to follow-up had more severe SVD already at baseline (Table I in the onlineonly Data Supplement)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Demographics, imaging characteristics, and plasma A\u03b2 levels of the study population are shown in Table 1 .

Additional analyses separating participants with 1 versus >1 microbleed or lacunes revealed similar results (data not shown). A similar pattern was observed for WMH severity: plasma A\u03b238 and A\u03b240 levels were positively associated with WMH volume (Table 2) . Additional adjustments did not change these associations. Higher A\u03b238/A\u03b242 ratios and lower A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios were observed in participants with presence of SVD markers, except for the association between A\u03b238/A\u03b242 ratios and WMH, but the significance of these associations was lost after adjustment for age, sex, and hypertension (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
