[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, associated with increased pituitary volume, may mediate observed alterations in stress reactivity in patients with psychotic disorder. We examined the association between pituitary volume, real-life stress reactivity and genetic liability for psychotic disorder.\nMethod. Pituitary volumes were derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 20 patients with psychotic disorder, 37 non-psychotic siblings of these patients, and 32 controls. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) was used to measure emotional stress reactivity [changes in negative affect (NA) associated with daily life stress] in the three groups, and biological stress reactivity (changes in cortisol associated with daily life stress) in siblings and controls. Interactions between group, stress and pituitary volume in models of NA and cortisol were examined.\nResults. Groups did not differ in pituitary volume. Patients showed significantly higher emotional stress reactivity than siblings and controls. In addition, emotional stress reactivity increased with increasing pituitary volume to a greater degree in patients than in controls and siblings. Siblings had higher cortisol levels than controls but did not show increased cortisol reactivity to stress. There was no interaction between pituitary volume, stress and group in the model of cortisol.\nConclusions. Higher pituitary volume was associated with increased emotional stress reactivity in patients with psychotic disorder, siblings and controls. The association was significantly stronger in the patient group, suggesting a process of progressive sensitization mediating clinical outcome."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Altered volumes of the pituitary gland have been associated with increased vulnerability for psychotic disorder (Garner et al. 2005) . Patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) display increased pituitary volume, compared to controls Takahashi et al. 2009) , as do individuals with early prodromal signs and subsequent transition to psychotic disorder, compared to those who do not make the transition (Garner et al. 2005) . In samples diagnosed with psychotic disorder, an inverse association has been reported between illness duration and pituitary volume (Pariante et al. 2004) , although not consistently so ). In addition, there is evidence for larger pituitary volume in firstdegree relatives of patients with psychotic disorder (Mondelli et al. 2008) .\nThe occurrence of pituitary enlargement in prodromal and antipsychotic (AP)-na\u00efve patients, and in their relatives, suggests that the enlargement is not due to AP medication. However, cross-sectional studies show positive associations between firstgeneration APs (FGAs) or prolactin-elevating secondgeneration APs (SGAs) and pituitary volume MacMaster et al. 2007) in FEP, although not all studies agree (Takahashi et al. 2009 ). In addition, a longitudinal study reported a dose-response effect of prolactin-sparing SGAs on pituitary volume, higher doses predicting reduced volume (Nicolo et al. 2010) . The mixed findings possibly reflect the fact that the pituitary gland is a highly dynamic organ, with many factors impacting on its volume over time. For example, studies have shown that women have larger pituitary volumes than men (Doraiswamy et al. 1992) , and that both endogenous and exogenous estrogens are associated with pituitary volume (Grams et al. 2010) .\nThe pituitary gland is a crucial organ involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response. In depression, increased pituitary volume is thought to reflect HPA axis hyperfunctioning. Exposure to stress activates the HPA axis through the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus, resulting in secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the pituitary, stimulating the release of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. Cortisol, through a negative feedback mechanism, regulates HPA axis activity. Persistently elevated cortisol levels can impair the negative feedback mechanism (Walker & Diforio, 1997) , resulting in HPA axis hyperactivity. As a result of HPA axis hyperactivity, patients become more sensitive to stressors, referred to as stress sensitization (Collip et al. 2008) .\nIncreased cortisol levels have been found in FEP patients (Ryan et al. 2004 ) and also in siblings of patients with psychotic disorder (Collip et al. 2011) , and may predict transition to a clinical psychotic outcome in young individuals at risk (Walker et al. 2010) . FEP patients in the acute phase also show nonsuppression of cortisol secretion in the dexamethasone suppression test and in the dexamethasone/CRH test (Herz et al. 1985 ; Lammers et al. 1995) . There is also evidence that patients with psychotic disorder are more sensitive to daily life stressors, resulting in increased levels of stress-related negative emotions (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001) and psychotic experiences (Myin-Germeys et al. 2005) . Genetic risk for psychotic disorder may also be associated with increased cortisol reactivity (Collip et al. 2011) , although other evidence suggests a blunted cortisol response to metabolic and psychosocial stressors in patients (Marcelis et al. 2004 ; Brenner et al. 2009 ; van Venrooij et al. 2010) .\nTo date, the association between pituitary volume and stress reactivity in psychotic disorder remains unclear. The present study is the first to examine pituitary volume in relation to cortisol levels and negative affect (NA) in the context of daily life stressors, using a genetically sensitive sample (patients at highest genetic risk, siblings of patients at higher than average genetic risk, and controls at average genetic risk). The hypothesis was that patients and, to a lesser extent, siblings would show increased emotional stress reactivity compared to controls, accompanied by larger pituitary volumes. Similarly, with regard to biological stress reactivity, we hypothesized that siblings would show increased cortisol reactivity, accompanied by larger pituitary volumes."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data pertain to baseline measures of an ongoing longitudinal study in Maastricht, The Netherlands.

Inclusion criteria were : (i) age 16 to 50 years, (ii) diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorder and (iii) good command of the Dutch language.\nDiagnosis was based on DSM-IV criteria (APA, 2000) , assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (CASH) interview (Andreasen et al. 1992) . Patients' diagnoses were : schizophrenia (n=11), schizo-affective disorder (n=2), schizophreniform disorder (n=1), brief psychotic disorder (n=2), and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (n=4). The CASH was also used to confirm the absence of a diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorder in the siblings, and the absence of a lifetime diagnosis of any psychotic disorder or any current affective disorder in the healthy controls. Six siblings and seven controls had a history of major depressive disorder, but none presented in a current depressive episode.\nParticipants were screened for the following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exclusion criteria : (i) brain injury with unconsciousness (>1 h), (ii) neurological diseases that might have affected brain structure/function, (iii) cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment (iv), severe claustrophobia, (v) metal corpora aliena, and (vi) women with intrauterine device status or (suspected) pregnancy.\nThe study was approved by the standing ethics committee, and all the subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the committee's guidelines."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS ; Kay et al. 1987 ) was used to measure psychotic symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

Subjects received a digital wristwatch that emitted a signal 10 times a day on 6 consecutive days, at unpredictable moments between 07:30 and 22:30 hours. After each ' beep ', subjects completed ESM self-assessment forms concerning current context, thoughts, emotions, and psychotic experiences. Subjects were instructed to complete their reports immediately after the beep, thus minimizing memory distortions. Reports were considered valid when subjects responded within 15 min after the beep, as determined by comparing the actual beep time with the reported time of completion. For inclusion in the analyses, a valid response to at least one-third of the emitted beeps was required (Delespaul et al. 2002) ."}, {"section_title": "ESM measures", "text": "In accordance with previous work, two different stress measures were computed : event stress and social stress (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001) .

This event was subsequently rated on a Likert scale (x3=very unpleasant, 0= neutral, 3=very pleasant). The responses were recoded to allow high scores to reflect stress. In the social stress assessment, participants were asked to evaluate the social context when other persons were present, by rating on a Likert scale (1=not true, 7=very true) the item ' I don't like the company ' and the subsequent item ' I would rather be alone '. The mean of these two items constituted the social stress scale. NA was assessed with five mood-related adjectives (down, guilty, insecure, lonely, anxious) scored on Likert scales (1=not at all, 7=very) after each beep. These were reduced to a single measure of mean NA with factor analyses (Cronbach's a=0.86)."}, {"section_title": "Salivary cortisol sampling", "text": "After each ESM beep, siblings and controls collected a saliva sample with a cotton swab from a salivette tube (Salivette ; Sarstedt, The Netherlands), placed the swab back in the salivette tube, and recorded the exact collection time.

Samples collected more than 15 min after the beep were excluded from the analysis. Salivary cortisol is a reliable and non-invasive measure of the free, unbound cortisol in blood. Radioimmunoassays were run in duplicate, using a tracer solution of cortisol-3CMO coupled with 2-[\n125 I]histamine and specific antibodies raised against cortisol-3CMO-BSA (Sulon et al. 1978 ) (Dr J. Sulon, University of Li\u00e8ge). The lower detection limit of the assay was 0.2 nmol/l. The intraand inter-assay coefficients of variation were <5% and <12 % respectively. All samples from an individual were analyzed in the same assay to reduce sources of variability.

Although there was no difference in pituitary volume between the groups, emotional stress reactivity was associated with a larger pituitary volume in all three groups, with a much more pronounced increase in the patients than in the other two groups (Table 3) . More specifically, each unit increase in stress reactivity was associated with an increase in pituitary volume of 0.20 S.D. in the patients. This phenomenon may indicate a mechanism of stress sensitization in the patients and mediate the onset of psychotic disorder. Stress sensitization occurs when early and/or frequent exposures to stressors alter the stress response system, sensitizing individuals to later stress, leading to increased biological and behavioral response to that stressor, even when less severe than the original stressor. Given that many environmental risk factors associated with psychotic disorder may be linked to stress, stress sensitization may represent a common mechanism linking multiple environmental exposures (Collip et al. 2008) . For example, evidence suggests that patients with psychotic disorder who report previous exposure to childhood trauma or other stressful life events (Myin-Germeys et al. 2003) show increased stress reactivity in daily life. Higher pituitary volume may be the result of differential functional states (e.g. increased stress reactivity/ hypercortisolism) or, vice versa, contribute causally to increased stress reactivity. However, as this is a crosssectional study, no definite conclusion can be drawn regarding the direction of this association. Post-hoc analyses revealed that FEP had higher and EIP had lower pituitary volumes than controls, in line with previous studies Upadhyaya et al. 2007) . In addition, the association between increased stress reactivity and pituitary volume was confined to the FEP group. These observations are in agreement with the hypothesis of two biologically distinct pathways resulting in mean group differences between (i) type 1 psychotic disorder, characterized by high levels of positive symptoms and an episodic course (Myin-Germeys & van Os, 2007 ; Lataster et al. 2010) , in addition to high stress reactivity and associated larger pituitary volume, and (ii) type 2 psychotic disorder, characterized by high levels of negative symptoms, cognitive impairments and a chronic course (Robins & Guze, 1970 ; Crow, 1980 ; Murray et al. 1992 ; van Os et al. 1999) , in addition to low stress reactivity and smaller pituitary volumes.

It has been suggested that elevated cortisol levels in patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder (Ryan et al. 2004 ; Mondelli et al. 2010) and their siblings reflect disturbances in the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis (Phillips et al. 2006) . A comparable observation in depression is that HPA axis hyperactivity is thought to reflect a lack of negative inhibitory feedback by circulating cortisol on the HPA axis, particularly at the level of pituitary cells producing ACTH, leading to an increase in the size and number of these cells. Persistently elevated cortisol secretion could also lead to resistance of the glucocorticoid receptors for cortisol (Pariante, 2006) .\nCortisol fluctuations in response to daily life stress, however, did not show a significant difference between siblings and controls, which does not agree with a previous study (Collip et al. 2011) . The present analyses, although based on the same cohort as described by Collip et al. (2011) , were carried out in individuals for whom MRI data were available, resulting in a sample size reduction. Thus, statistical The B coefficients represent the effect sizes of level of stress sensitivity compared to the reference level.\npower was insufficient to detect small differences in cortisol reactivity between siblings and controls and/ or as a function of pituitary volume.\nIn conclusion, although some evidence for HPA axis hyperactivity was found in siblings (increased mean cortisol values), cortisol reactivity was not mediated by group status or pituitary volume in this study. Larger studies are needed before more definitive conclusions can be drawn.

However, in a comparative study, Green et al. (2006) concluded that both methods yielded similar results.\nTwo different scanning sequences were used in this study, which could in theory have influenced the volume measurements. However, it has been shown that within-scanner measurements were reliable for subcortical volumes across scan sessions (Jovicich et al. 2009 ). Furthermore, no large or significant interaction was found between scan type and group on pituitary volume (x 2 =0.09, p=0.96). Similarly, adjusting the analyses for scanning sequence did not affect the direction or significance of the results.\nNumerous external factors can influence pituitary volume, such as the use of APs. According to the study by Nicolo et al. (2010) in FEP, SGAs reduce pituitary gland volume in a dose-dependent manner. Other studies report that prolactin-elevating medication increases pituitary volume in comparison with prolactin-sparing medication Mondelli et al. 2008) , but not all studies have found this association (Pariante et al. 2004 ; Takahashi et al. 2009 ). The present study did not find an association between cumulative lifetime exposure to AP medication and pituitary volume, but the groups were too small to examine differential effects of the AP group (SGA versus FGA). Adding lifetime AP medication as a confounder did not change the results (data available upon request). Exogenous estrogen exposure has also been associated with pituitary volume. Reduced pituitary volumes have been found in women taking oral contraceptives (Grams et al. 2010) but, by contrast, elevated pituitary volumes have been found in menopausal women using estrogens (Abech et al. 2005) . The present study did not find an association between lifetime estrogen exposure and pituitary volume. Larger studies investigating the association between estrogens and pituitary volume longitudinally are warranted. Nevertheless, there was a gender effect, in that pituitary volumes were higher in women than in men, possibly reflecting differences in endogenous estrogen levels (Doraiswamy et al. 1992) . The role of estrogen in psychotic disorder remains unknown. Evidence suggests that estrogens may exert a neuroprotective effect and possibly have AP properties (Boerma et al. 2010) . However, if estrogen could also lead to pituitary enlargement, this may potentially be less beneficial in terms of vulnerability for psychotic disorder. It is advisable to take estrogen measures into account when examining pituitary volumes."}]
