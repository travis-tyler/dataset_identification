[{"section_title": "", "text": "A new crowd sourcing project called CycloneCenter enables the public to analyze historical global tropical cyclone (TC) intensities. The primary goal of CycloneCenter, which launched in mid-September, is to resolve discrepancies in the recent global TC record arising principally from inconsistent development of tropical cyclone intensity data.\nThe historical TC record is composed of data sets called \"best tracks,\" which contain a forecast agency's best assessment of TC tracks and intensities. Best track data have improved in quality since the beginning of the geostationary satellite era in the 1960s (because TCs could no longer disappear from sight). However, a global compilation of best track data (International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)) has brought to light large interagency differences between some TC best track intensities, even in the recent past [Knapp et al., 2010] . For example, maximum wind speed estimates for Tropical Cyclone Gay (1989) differed by as much as 70 knots as it was tracked by three different agencies.\nThe heart of the problem is that TCs are very rarely directly observed. Thus, forecasters rely almost exclusively on the Dvorak technique [Velden et al., 2006] , a method developed during the 1970s and early 1980s by American meteorologist Vern Dvorak to classify TC intensity based on cloud patterns and temperatures from a single geostationary satellite image. The technique calls for the analyst to determine the center location of the system, the cloud pattern type, the degree of organization of the pattern, and the intensity trend. A maximum surface wind speed is determined after the application of a number of rules and constraints.\nThe Dvorak technique has been used for many years at all global tropical cyclone forecast centers and has been shown in many cases to yield a good estimate of maximum TC wind speed [Knaff et al., 2010] when applied properly. However, a level of analyst subjectivity is inherent in the procedure: the cloud patterns are not always clear, it is sometimes difficult to accurately determine the storm center, and the rules and constraints have been interpreted and applied differently across agencies. This introduces heterogeneity in the global TC record because the Dvorak technique is usually the only available tool for assessing the maximum wind speed.\nRecent work has tried to eliminate the human element in the Dvorak technique by automating the procedure. The advanced Dvorak technique (ADT) [Olander and Velden, 2007] uses objective storm center and cloud pattern schemes to remove the subjectivity. All other classification rules and constraints are then applied and combined with additional statistical information to produce automated intensity estimates. Although the ADT skill is comparable to experienced human Dvorak analysts, large errors can occur if the TC cloud pattern (e.g., \"eye,\" \"shear,\" \"curved band\") is not identified properly.\nCycloneCenter embraces the human element. It standardizes the classification procedure by condensing the Dvorak technique to a few simple questions that can be answered by global, nonprofessional collaborators. Each collaborator (\"user\") is presented with an enhanced-color infrared snapshot of a tropical cyclone and is guided through a sequence of questions, ultimately leading to the determination of a single maximum surface wind speed. One of the main advantages of this approach is the inclusion of thousands of users instead of the one to three who would normally classify a TC image. This allows the computation Tropical Cyclone cont. on page 287 Fig. 1 of measures of uncertainty in addition to a mean intensity. Nearly 300,000 images will be classified several times each within a few months-a feat that would take a dedicated team of 20 Dvorak-trained experts about 12 years to complete.\nThe tropical cyclone images come from the Hurricane Satellite Data ( HURSAT) data set [Knapp and Kossin, 2007] . HURSAT is a tropical cyclone centric collection of geostationary satellite imagery and data. CycloneCenter presents users with colorized, 3-hourly, infrared HURSAT images going back to 1978. The questions that citizen scientists will answer involve determining the type of cloud pattern (e.g., \"Does the TC have an eye?\"), the shape and nature of the clouds, and perceived intensity trends. Related storm morphology features highlighted by the classification procedure are recorded and will be analyzed.\nThe Dvorak technique has always used a series of gray shades to enhance the cloud temperatures in the infrared image. To make it easier for nonexperts to distinguish between temperature levels, a special color scale was developed for the CycloneCenter project. Figure 1 shows an example of an image that a classifier will see. The blue shades correspond to the coldest cloud tops, or areas with the strongest convection. The colors were selected to be color-blind friendly and easy to distinguish between cloud top temperature levels. The temperature scale intervals are consistent with the original Dvorak technique intervals.\nIt is anticipated that the data collection phase of CycloneCenter will last about 2 months. The unique data set will allow a number of different avenues of research. In addition to resolving differences in forecast agency intensities, it will now be possible to conduct a statistical evaluation of intensity, scene type, and cloud patterns. New insights into recent climatological changes in tropical cyclone intensity may also be found.\nThe CycloneCenter Web interface was created by the Citizen Science Alliance (CSA), a collaboration of scientists, software developers, and educators to facilitate the development of Internet-based citizen science projects. With the addition of CycloneCenter, CSA manages 13 active crowd sourcing projects that allow citizen scientists to perform tasks such as classifying galaxies, identifying solar storms, searching for new planets, and even transcribing ancient Greek texts.\nInterested readers are encouraged to learn more about and participate in the project at http:// www .cyclonecenter .org.\nThe CycloneCenter project is a collaboration between CSA, NOAA National Climatic Data Center, University of North Carolina at Asheville, and Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites-North Carolina."}]
