[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: The Stroke and Cognition consortium (STROKOG) aims to facilitate a better understanding of the determinants of vascular contributions to cognitive disorders and help improve the diagnosis and treatment of vascular cognitive disorders (VCD). Methods: Longitudinal studies with 75 participants who had suffered or were at risk of stroke or TIA and which evaluated cognitive function were invited to join STROKOG. The consortium will facilitate projects investigating rates and patterns of cognitive decline, risk factors for VCD, and biomarkers of vascular dementia. Results: Currently, STROKOG includes 25 (21 published) studies, with 12,092 participants from five continents. The duration of follow-up ranges from 3 months to 21 years. Discussion: Although data harmonization will be a key challenge, STROKOG is in a unique position to reuse and combine international cohort data and fully explore patient level characteristics and outcomes. STROKOG could potentially transform our understanding of VCD and have a worldwide impact on promoting better vascular cognitive outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Vascular cognitive disorders (VCDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurocognitive disorders with the salient feature being that cognitive decline is primarily attributable to cerebrovascular disease. The term VCD has a chequered history, and it includes not only vascular dementia (VaD; e.g., poststroke and multi-infarct dementia), but also cognitive impairment of vascular origin that does not meet the criteria for dementia. VaD is common and is generally considered to be the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] .\nThe prevalence and incidence of VCD varies depending on the diagnostic criteria applied and the populations studied. In 11 population-based European studies conducted in the 1990s, the age-standardized prevalence of VaD was estimated to be 1.6% compared to 4.4% for AD [2] ; the preva-lence of VaD was 0.3% in the age group 65-69 years and 5.2% in those aged 90 and above, and VaD accounted for 15.8% of all dementias in these studies [2] . The Canadian Study of Health and Aging used a broader concept termed vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) which consisted of three subgroups: VCI with no dementia, VaD, and AD with a vascular component. The authors estimated that approximately 5% of people over the age of 65 years had VCI, with 2.4% having VCI with no dementia, 0.9% having mixed (vascular and neurodegenerative) dementia and 1.5% having VaD [3] . Various clinical studies have shown that the prevalence of dementia is much greater in post-stroke patients, with 6 to 32% being reported as having dementia three months after stroke [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . A systematic review reported that dementia is 3.5 to 5.6 fold more frequent in patients with stroke than in stroke-free controls [9] . Because risk factors for stroke are modifiable, and its incidence has been shown to change with public health intervention, stroke may be regarded as a powerful and modifiable risk factor for dementia [10] .\nPoststroke dementia has emerged as an important subset of VCD primarily because of the large impact stroke has on the risk of VCD. The cognitive consequences of stroke as well as the associated burden of increased functional dependency, institutionalization, and mortality rates are increasingly being recognized [11] . However, many aspects of poststroke dementia are uncertain [5] , and the precise impact of a stroke on preexisting cognitive impairment has been disputed. Patients with stroke usually have a complex combination of large and small vessel disease in the brain; in older patients in particular, nonvascular pathology such as AD may also be present [12] . Some studies found that up to 10% of stroke patients have cognitive impairment that could be classified as dementia before their first stroke [4, 5, 8] , a finding that may be attributable to previous silent infarcts, noninfarct small vessel disease or AD pathology, or a combination of these. An American casecontrol longitudinal study reported that a stroke doubles the risk of dementia, that this excess risk diminishes with time, and that it does not apply to those .85 years [13] . According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, about onetenth of patients develop new dementia soon after first stroke, and over one-third are demented after a recurrent stroke [8] .\nAlthough older age and low levels of education have consistently emerged as key predictors of worse cognitive outcome soon after stroke [8, 14] , studies have shown inconsistent findings in relation to other risk factors, which include cerebrovascular disease risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, prior pathology, stroke features, and infarct characteristics [8, 9, 15] .\nMaking better use of existing data to improve stroke and dementia prevention and treatment is a priority for many governments and funders. The Joint Program for Neurodegeneration (JPND) thus recently funded several initiatives to improve data usage. Metacohorts is one of these initiatives focused on vascular contributions to dementia and the group identified over 90 studies, including over 600,000 subjects worldwide that included data relevant to vascular effects on neurodegeneration including cognitive consequences of stroke [16] .\nStroke and Cognition consortium (STROKOG) is a recently established consortium of prospective post-stroke/ TIA studies from around the world, including, at the time of writing, 25 studies with up to 12,092 patients from 16 countries and 25 institutions worldwide. By harmonizing data and conducting individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses on studies from around the world, STRO-KOG aims to better understand the longitudinal course of poststroke cognitive impairment and investigate differences in the prevalence of VCD as well as risk and protective factors between different countries and ethnic groups. In IPD meta-analysis, the original research data are sought directly from the researchers responsible for each study rather than extracting summary (aggregate) data from study publications or from investigators. The original data can then be re-analyzed centrally and combined, if appropriate, in meta-analyses. There are various advantages of conducting IPD meta-analyses over standard meta-analysis, such as the ability to investigate patient level characteristics, adjust for the same confounding factors across studies, address new research questions, and reduce publication bias [17, 18] . By harmonizing and conducting analyses on a rich collection of individual participant data, STROKOG can examine risk factors on the patient level and apply standardized methods of statistical analyses and dementia diagnosis that could produce more accurate prevalence estimates and more detailed information on the risk factors for VCD and the impact stroke has on cognitive decline. It is anticipated that the findings of STROKOG will help guide and optimize preventative strategies and health policy worldwide. STROKOG was officially established at the VASCOG (Society for the Study of Vascular Cognitive and Behavioral Disorders) 2015 meeting in Tokyo, Japan."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Membership", "text": "Studies are eligible to participate in STROKOG if they meet the following membership criteria: Official enrollment requires the study lead investigator to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which specifies a willingness to share nonidentifiable data for joint analyses. Studies that have restrictions on data use and data sharing may also participate in STROKOG by conducting in-house analyses using STROKOG protocols and providing summary data for pooling.\nAt the time of writing, there are 24 officially enrolled member studies of STROKOG and one unofficial member study which plan to obtain participants' permission to share data before signing the MoU. These studies and their key demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Supplementary Table S1 shows some salient findings from each member study. They represent 16 different countries, including one lower middle income country from across five continents (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America). In total, there are 12,092 participants, and for most studies, patients were recruited consecutively as they were admitted to hospital with a recent stroke.\nApproximately half of the studies admitted participants with a recent TIA, and those with a previous stroke were typically not excluded. The longest follow-up duration of the studies is 21 years and the median is 3 years.

Although de-identified data are not considered Protected Health Information by the National Institutes of Health of the United States, ethics review boards differ in their approach to this matter. A protocol for the deidentification of data has been developed. Additionally, each new project presented to STROKOG must be approved by an institutional review board and the HREC of UNSW informed about the project."}, {"section_title": "Research projects and data", "text": "The Sydney team will initiate the first project, collate study data and conduct the initial data harmonization and IPD meta-analyses across the different studies. STROKOG will follow guidelines for rigorous and effective harmonization [58] as well as for IPD meta-analyses and reporting [17, 59] . Original data sets supplied by members and the harmonized data sets, which will include derived data, will be held by the Sydney team on a secure database at the University of New South Wales. A STROKOG RSC member can propose a research project, which need to undergo an approval process by the RSC. If the prospective proposer of a project is not a member of the RSC or affiliated with a member study, the proposal can still go ahead if it is sponsored by a member of the RSC. A student may similarly request data for a research project if sponsored by a member of the RSC. Once approved, the proposer will be advised to form a Work Group for the specific project, with a clearly identified project leader. Other members of the consortium may volunteer to be part of the Work Group if they have a clear interest and expertise in the research project. The Work Group will address and be responsible for the planning, analysis, and publication of the approved project. Data held by STROKOG will be released to the Work Group; newly joined and existing member studies will be requested to provide additional de-identified data. Each cohort can opt-in or opt-out of participation; optingin represents a commitment to collaborate on the project. The central STROKOG data repository at UNSW, Sydney, will hold a copy of the data sets used for each project. The STROKOG data will not be used or accessed for any purpose other than contributing to an approved STROKOG project."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Challenges", "text": "Large international consortia face general challenges that include efficient communication among personnel involved with studies across different countries and a need for additional funding to enable the further use of previously collected data. Such challenges have been previously described by other consortia (e.g., by CHARGE [60] ).\nChallenges more specific to STROKOG are those associated with data harmonization, many of which have also been previously described [61, 62] . Neuropsychological test data are likely to be the most challenging set of data to be harmonized across studies due to heterogeneity in test instruments, administration, and criteria for defining impairment; however, the Sydney team has had experience harmonizing large data sets from diverse y Some studies also obtained PET scans from a subgroup of their participants: GRECOG-VASC (amyloid for 100 patients with poststroke cognitive deficit), STROKDEM (at 1 year), DEDEMAS (amyloid/FDG for incident dementia cases), CANVAS (amyloid at 3 years), STRIDE (PiB, n 5 50) and DSDB (SPECT, n 5 36). z ASPIRE-S is an unofficial member that is planning to obtain participants' permission to share data outside of Ireland before signing the MoU.\nx For the GRECOG-VASC study, only the 200 first patients from the Amiens center are included for STROKOG and the VASCOG criteria was used except for the threshold of cognitive impairment which was set at the 5th percentile.\nk PROSPER shares data at the summary level and not individual participant data. studies, for example, for the COSMIC consortium [63] . There exists much heterogeneity in measurement instruments used by different studies. Even when studies have used similar tests, different versions of tests were used, and tests might have been administered in nonstandard ways. Owing to differences in culture and language, questions and responses may have been worded differently. There is no consensus on how each neuropsychological test should be allocated to a specific cognitive domain as such tests are generally multifactorial. Table 2 shows the list of tests used in the studies under five cognitive domains; each test was assigned to a cognitive domain based on convention and previous work such as for COSMIC [63] . Demographic effects such as age, gender, and education need to be accounted for. Furthermore, adequate normative data may or may not be available in all regions or for all ethnocultural groups; not all studies included nondemented stroke-free controls whose test scores may be used to derive adjusted scores and to define cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "Advantages", "text": "The benefits of being able to reuse, combine, and compare data from multiple cohorts are obvious, and this approach has been recommended by the Lancet REWARD Campaign [64] . Cohort studies focused on stroke and cognition are expensive, labor-intensive, and very demanding of researchers' and participants' time. Multiple factors may limit the study sample size and duration. There already exists a wealth of data from previous or current studies that are underutilized and can be put to further use. Standard meta-analysis is one way of analyzing the combined cohorts of existing studies, but it is limited to published results and specific research questions. STROKOG's approach in harmonizing individual participant data from various studies is an economical use of previously collected data to explore both existing and novel research questions. According to the Cochrane Methods group, IPD meta-analyses are considered the \"gold standard\" of systematic review [65] . In IPD meta-analyses, individual participant data from all studies can be modeled simultaneously while accounting for the clustering of participants within studies [17] . It allows detailed participant-level exploration of cognitive disorders in relation to the individuals' characteristics. Additionally, statistical analysis can be standardized across studies where more appropriate or advanced methods can be used; baseline and potential confounding factors can be adjusted for consistency across studies; results for missing or poorly acquired outcomes can be reported, thereby reducing bias within study reporting; results for specific subgroups of participants can be obtained across studies; unpublished data can be included, thereby addressing publication bias [17] . Having access to a rich collection of individual participant-level data from international studies, STROKOG is in a unique position to apply IPD metaanalyses techniques and fully explore and examine patient Cracow study conducted neuropsychological tests under the five domains but these data were lost and not available. level characteristics and outcomes, which in turn could lead to facilitating a better understanding of various aspects of post-stroke cognitive impairment.\nA consortium such as STROKOG has the added benefit of informing new researchers of the need to standardize their measures and methods so that they are in step with other researchers in the same field. This is particularly important for stroke and dementia, as many researchers from low and middle income countries have recently become interested in this topic and are mounting studies that would benefit from comparability with existing studies. New studies therefore would have the benefit of validated measures and better comparability.\nThere is also the potential for the STROKOG database to be made available to nonconsortium researchers following consortium-based publications and with the approval of the RSC and the ethics review board. The scientific benefits of making large databases available to researchers worldwide have been demonstrated by the more than 250 publications that have resulted from the sharing of ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data [66] .\nThe research community that STROKOG proposes to create is likely to pay other dividends. It is expected that the productivity of the group will increase over time in quality and quantity; junior researchers will be supported, new ideas and lines of investigation will be generated and scientific interchange and collaboration will be facilitated. The benefits will therefore extend beyond the harmonizing and pooling of data."}, {"section_title": "Specific projects", "text": "The first project aims to describe the prevalence and profile of poststroke cognitive impairment, measured between 1 and 6 months after a stroke or TIA, in diverse geographical and ethnocultural settings as represented by the STROKOG member cohorts. The project is currently underway and is being coordinated by the Sydney team. A project proposal was approved by the RSC, and the following data are currently being requested: While many of the existing member studies have relevant data to contribute to the more general topics (such as 1 to 4 noted above), the more specific topics (5 to 8) will be best addressed by growing the STROKOG membership base.
