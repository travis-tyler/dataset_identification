The DOI is also responsible for migratory wildlife conservation; historic preservation; endangered species conservation; protection and restoration of surface-mined lands; and mapping geological, hydrological, and biological science for the Nation. The breadth of this mission requires scientific expertise in several disciplines to make informed and defensible management decisions on behalf of the American public. Much of this expertise is provided by way of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Nation's premier earth and biological science agency. Specifically, USGS biological and ecological research is largely conducted through a network of 16 science centers located throughout the Nation, each representing a distinct component of the USGS mission and a unique focal area of expertise in natural resource science. The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center (NPWRC) was established in 1965 to address key information needs for managing productivity of nationally significant waterfowl populations and habitats. Located in the heart of the Nation's prairie wetland and grassland resources, the center is ideally positioned for interdisciplinary research on migratory birds, land-use change, and wetland and grassland wildlife; and quantifying ecosystem services as affected by land management, conservation programs, and climate variability. During its more than 50-year history, the Center has produced a wealth of information on applied management issues, focusing on the priorities and footprint of the DOI. The Center has also developed long-standing and productive partnerships with a variety of land-management agencies, nonprofit organizations, and universities, fostering opportunities for creative and costeffective solutions to management and conservation issues. Today, the Center's science program is organized around five broad themes: (1) wildlife science, (2) ecosystems science, (3) climate-change science, (4) land-use-change science, and (5) analytics and decision support. Together, research conducted under these themes addresses the primary science information needs of land managers and policymakers across a vast portion of the Central United States and is strategically linked through our organizational structure to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration to address complex issues. The NPWRC celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2015 and published a report describing the first 50 years of biological research conducted at the Center (Austin and others, 2017) along with a bibliography of scientific products (U.S. Geological Survey, 2017). The scientific foundation developed at the Center during this timeframe provides the base for conducting applied research and enables the Center to quickly respond to emerging issues in the Northern Great Plains and beyond.

Our work highlights the downstream effects of factors driving land-use decisions on the ability of beekeepers to provide robust honey bee colonies to support the pollination industry on a national scale.

Consequently, active management of bison abundance and distribution in the park is necessary to conserve the species and the natural processes in which it plays a keystone role. This research involves the use of satellite GPS collars to locate marked bison at hourly intervals throughout a 4-year period. Locations will be used to map the distribution of bison activity in the park and develop models relating intensities of use to features of landscapes, characteristics of vegetation, and proximity to water.

One of those landscapes is the watershed of the upper Mississippi River. In this pilot effort, we are exploring the use of multiple models to quantify the effects of depressional wetlands in or adjacent to agricultural fields in a subwatershed of the upper Mississippi (that is, the Des Moines watershed) on reducing nutrient flows from croplands. We are also exploring the multiple effects of these cropland-embedded wetlands on the provisioning of habitat and other ecosystem services valued by society and how this additional information can be used in evaluations of nutrient flows to Mississippi River and ultimately Gulf of Mexico ecosystems.

Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) work to implement such an approach by serving as a venue for multiple conservation partners to work together (for example, Federal and State agencies), identify common problems, and support the development of science to better inform landmanagement decisions. The NPWRC has been supporting LCC partnerships in their goal to facilitate more effective responses to broad-scale conservation challenges since 2010. Although we have worked with multiple LCCs, our work has mainly been focused on the Plains and Prairie Potholes LCC. We have used decision analysis to structure and prioritize their science needs, conducted the research necessary to meet those needs, and used cutting edge analytical tools to support LCC strategic planning efforts.

Wetland simulation models indicate that climate change may result in increased drying of prairiepothole wetlands as increased evapotranspiration associated with warmer temperatures outpace increases in precipitation. Resultant effects include reduced water depths and volumes and shorter hydroperiods, with seasonal wetlands being most vulnerable. In this effort, we performed an in-depth literature review of climate-change effects on wetland ecosystems and upland management techniques with potential to mitigate identified effects. We also completed a field study in which uplands surrounding 12 prairie-pothole wetlands received burning, grazing, and control treatments. The literature review was published as a USGS Scientific Investigations Report. Results of this study can be used to inform upland management decisions made by land managers in efforts directed at influencing water levels in prairie-pothole wetlands. Contact: David M. Mushet,dmushet@usgs.gov, Products: Renton, D.A., Mushet, D.M., and DeKeyser, E.S., 2015 With scarcely 2 percent of native tallgrass prairie remaining today, it is imperative that we wisely manage what little remains to conserve prairie-dependent plants, pollinators, and other animals and ecosystem processes. Two commonly used methods of prairie management are prescribed fire and conservation grazing. Either method may present tradeoffs with respect to conservation of vulnerable plant, bee, or butterfly species, but at present those tradeoffs are not well described and resource managers do not have all the information necessary to develop optimal management plans for their goals. With this study, funded by the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, we aim to fill that knowledge gap by characterizing effects on bees and butterflies that are related to the management practice itself compared to those effects mediated by management-caused changes in vegetation. Further, we will relate bee and butterfly life history traits to their responses to fire and grazing to clarify if results can be generalized or are species-specific. Several species of butterflies varied in abundance between burned (black bars) and grazed (green bars) sites. Some of the least commonly encountered butterflies were present only on grazed sites (pooled 2016 and 2017 counts)."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Invasive Plant Species on Reproduction of the Rare Endemic Plant Dakota Buckwheat (Eriogonum visheri) at Badlands National Park", "text": "Endemism in plants is extremely uncommon in the Great Plains. Dakota buckwheat is a rare, endemic plant present in only a few locations at Badlands National Park and sites with similar soils outside the park. In an earlier study, the NPWRC inferred that of two common, coflowering invasive plants, Russian thistle was more likely than yellow sweetclover to interfere with Dakota buckwheat pollination. This inference was based on an analysis that grouped pollinating insects and flowering plants into groups, called \"modules,\" in which pollinators and plants were statistically more likely to interact with each other than with those outside their module. In this study, we explicitly test the impact of these two invasive plants on visitation, pollen limitation, and seed set of Dakota buckwheat. By doing the meticulous work this study requires, we will be able to better interpret other studies that only investigate visitation without assessing seed set and provide managers with information needed to manage invasive plants near this rare endemic plant.

In this research effort, we observed that as reconstructions matured, Canada thistle cover declined even though herbicides were not applied. There is no single best planting method for all situations. Ten years after planting, cover of planted, native nonplanted, and exotic species varied little among three planting methods (dormant-season broadcast, growing-season broadcast, growing-season drill) used in this study. Planting a seed mix with more species did result in reconstructions that harbored more species, but at the cost of lower proportional success. Exotic cool-season grasses may be the biggest threat to these reconstructions. None of the planting methods or seed mix richness levels slowed their increase. Knowledge gained from this research effort is useful to land managers aiming to improve invasion resistance in tallgrass prairie restorations."}, {"section_title": "Developing Evaluation and Monitoring Frameworks for Tallgrass Prairie Reconstruction", "text": "Tallgrass prairie species are planted on thousands of hectares of retired farmland each year. If the methods used and resulting characteristics of these prairies are recorded, compiled, and analyzed, they can provide a valuable resource for evaluating seed mixes, planting methods, and post-planting management. Toward this end, collaborators in the Prairie Reconstruction Initiative, funded by the FWS, developed a database to make data such as these available to researchers and the public. To begin this effort and to illustrate what can be learned by keeping good records of reconstructions, we gathered data from two refuges consisting of reconstructed prairies and evaluated the utility of retrospective information on planting methods, seed mix characteristics, and post-planting management in predicting reconstruction outcomes. Information gained from this effort will be useful for tallgrass-prairie evaluation and monitoring efforts in the Northern Great Plains.

On lands under its ownership, the FWS is working to restore native prairie integrity by reducing introduced species under the Native Prairie Adaptive Management (NPAM) program. Restoration actions consist of forms and timing of defoliation, including burning and grazing. Each year, managers face a difficult decision about whether to defoliate a prairie, and if so, which defoliation treatment to employ given the current type and degree of invasion and recent history of defoliation. Managers desire to learn about effectiveness and efficiency of these approaches through the decision-making and implementation process. The NPAM program provides real-time decision support to managers with the objective of increasing the cover of native grasses and forbs. 2008, the USGS and the FWS initiated a collaborative effort, the NPAM program. The NPAM program employs the principles of adaptive management to evaluate and improve management practices that address invasive plant issues and restoration efforts on FWS grasslands with time. Realistically, shifts in vegetation with time also may affect habitat quality and quantity for grassland birds, which have exhibited widespread declines in North America. In collaboration with the FWS, the NPWRC initiated a companion study that leverages the NPAM program effort to develop competing models for the response of grassland breeding birds to management treatments. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the response of grassland birds to various management treatments (rest, fire, grazing) that are being implemented to restore vegetation composition on FWS-owned grasslands, and to explore the effects of vegetation structure and composition as mechanisms for triggering grassland bird responses to management."}, {"section_title": "An Adaptive Management Framework to Control Invasive Annual Brome Grasses in Northern Great Plains Parks (Annual Brome Adaptive Management Project)", "text": "Invasion by annual brome grasses (cheatgrass and Japanese or field brome) into National Park Service units (parks) in the Northern Great Plains impacts park historical and ecological integrity by reducing native plant diversity and altering ecosystem functioning.

Uncertainty about the effectiveness of specific management treatments in controlling annual bromes and limited capacity to apply management treatments make the problem of managing bromes complex. The Annual Brome Adaptive Management project is tackling this problem through a cooperative effort between the NPWRC and seven parks and their supporting management and monitoring networks. The Annual Brome Adaptive Management project is developing a structured adaptive management framework that will guide parks and their supporting networks in making more effective and strategic vegetation management decisions."}, {"section_title": "Fish and Wildlife Disease", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Effects of Population Density on Prevalence of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), Physical Condition, and Vital Rates of Elk at Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota", "text": "CWD is a degenerative neurological disease caused by infectious proteins called prions. Although documented cases are invariably fatal, infected elk commonly survive for several months or longer, passing prions directly to other individuals and into the environment, where they bind to surfaces or soils and can persist for years. CWD reached Wind Cave National Park about 1997 and rapidly became the leading cause of mortality for adult elk. By 2016, prevalence reached about 24 percent in the eastern park, an unsustainable level that threatens persistence of the population. Although CWD constitutes a crisis for park management, it also presents an unprecedented opportunity for studying effects of population density on CWD prevalence, physical condition, and vital rates of elk. During 2016-17, the National Park Service removed 262 elk from Wind Cave National Park, reducing the population by about one-half. We are working with National Park Service partners to evaluate effects of the reduction and develop guidance for management of CWD and high-density elk populations not only at Wind Cave National Park, but in other parks and preserves.
