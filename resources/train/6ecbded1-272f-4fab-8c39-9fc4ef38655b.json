[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "For nearly a century, detecting the genetic contributions to cognitive and behavioral phenomena has been a core interest for psychological research. Recently, this interest has been reinvigorated by the availability of genotyping technologies (e.g., microarrays) that provide new genetic data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs-which represent pairs of nucleotide letters (e.g., AA, AG, or GG) found at specific positions on human chromosomes-are best considered as categorical variables, but this coding scheme can make difficult the multivariate analysis of their relationships with behavioral measurements, because most multivariate techniques developed for the analysis between sets of variables are designed for quantitative variables. To palliate this problem, we present a generalization of partial least squares-a technique used to extract the information common to 2 different data tables measured on the same observations-called partial least squares correspondence analysis-that is specifically tailored for the analysis of categorical and mixed (\"heterogeneous\") data types. Here, we formally define and illustrate-in a tutorial format-how partial least squares correspondence analysis extends to various types of data and design problems that are particularly relevant for psychological research that include genetic data. We illustrate partial least squares correspondence analysis with genetic, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. R code is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network and via the authors' websites."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Interests in the genetic contributions to psychological traits date back over a century, and these interests fostered advancements in measurement and assessment of genetic contributions to behavior. Thorndike (1905) initiated some of the earliest efforts \"to make modern statistical methods current in psychology\" (Sanford, 1908, p. 142) as well as in genetics, and he was soon followed by Fisher (1919) , who favored more formal approaches. Over a decade later, Thurstone (1934) suggested using \"factor analysis\" to understand cognitive abilities and personality traits. Thurstone favored these methods, in part, because he firmly believed \"that the isolation of the mental abilities will turn out to be essentially a problem in genetics\" (p. 32).\nThese same beliefs, interests, questions, and advancements have been revived in recent years with the advent of technology such as microarrays and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Today, in brain and behavioral sciences, one of the most typical types of genetic data-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; pronounced \"snips\")-lists the possible alleles of a nucleotide pair at a given position for the corresponding chromosomes (i.e., one maternal and one paternal). In practice, SNPs are detected as their DNA nucleotide pairs, called genotypes. These genotypes are in general classified as the major homozygote, heterozygote, and minor homozygote (e.g., AA, AG, GG, respectively, assuming that AA is found more often than GG in the population of interest) where zygosity is determined by allele frequency (e.g., G is a minor allele because it is less frequent than A). SNPs can provide insight into numerous diseases (Weiner & Hudson, 2002) , and many studies have shown associations of specific SNPs with particular diseases (Lakatos et al., 2010) , disorders (Clarke et al., 2014; Filbey, Schacht, Myers, Chavez, & Hutchison, 2010; Lantieri, Glessner, Hakonarson, Elia, & Devoto, 2010; Romanos et al., 2008) , personality (Munaf\u00f2 & Flint, 2011) , phenotypes (Cho et al., 2011) , and traits (Hamidovic, Dlugos, Palmer, & de Wit, 2010; Miyajima et al., 2008) .\nAnd now again-just as in the early days of Thorndike and Fisher-new statistical methods are being developed to understand how genetics may contribute to behaviors (or traits). Most of these modern statistical techniques are multivariate in nature. Some approaches include derivatives of independent components analysis (Liu et al., 2009; Yang, Liu, Sui, Pearlson, & Calhoun, 2010) , sparse multivariate regression approaches (Vounou, Nichols, Montana, & Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2010) , distance matrix regression (Zapala & Schork, 2006) , and path modeling (Frani\u0107 et al., 2013) . Further, some of these recent techniques are designed to simultaneously analyze behavioral and genetic data (Bloss, Schiabor, & Schork, 2010) , in part in order to increase statistical power to detect genetic contributions to traits, behaviors, and phenotypes (Schifano, Li, Christiani, & Lin, 2013; Seoane, Campbell, Day, Casas, & Gaunt, 2014; van der Sluis, Posthuma, & Dolan, 2013) . This boost in power can be particularly relevant in psychological research in which sample sizes can rarely reach \"standard\" sizes for genome-wide studies (i.e., N \u03f7 5,000).\nOne versatile family of multivariate techniques-the partial least squares (PLS) family-is particularly suited for analyzing two tables of data measured on the same observations, and has been developed into regression (Abdi, 2010; Tenenhaus, 1998) , correlation (Krishnan, Williams, McIntosh, & Abdi, 2011; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004) , and path-modeling approaches (Esposito Vinzi, Chin, Henseler, & Wang, 2010; Tenenhaus, Esposito Vinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro, 2005) . Further, PLS approaches have been used in studies on genetics and genomics (Michaelson, Alberts, Schughart, & Beyer, 2010; Moser, Tier, Crump, Khatkar, & Raadsma, 2009; Wang, Ho, Ye, Strickler, & Elston, 2009 ), integrating genetic and brain data (Le Floch et al., 2012; Tura, Turner, Fallon, Kennedy, & Potkin, 2008) , or genetics and clinical status (Chun, Ballard, Cho, & Zhao, 2011; Sullivan et al., 2008) . However, nearly all current approaches to analyzing SNPs (including PLS approaches) require SNPs to be treated as numerical dataoften because of particular inheritance models-even though SNPs themselves are intrinsically categorical. This preference for methods based on numerical assumptions is likely because, in part, of the lack of multivariate methods designed specifically for the analysis of categorical-or heterogeneous-data. Table 1 provides an overview of common analytical approaches and inheritance models used in association studies. As noted in Table 1 , the majority of approaches are naturally categorical-in which the goal is to test presence versus absence of particular genotypes. However, for practical, analytical, and statistical purposes, SNPs in association studies are (most often) represented through an allelic counting scheme (as found, e.g., in PLINK; Purcell et al., 2007) . With this coding scheme, a SNP is represented either by its number of minor alleles (e.g., as in de Leon et al., 2008 : 0, 1, or 2 minor alleles) or by its number of major alleles (e.g., as in Cruchaga et al., 2010 : 0, 1, or 2 major alleles). However, this counting scheme relies on two unrealistic assumptions about how SNPs might contribute to traits, behaviors, and diagnoses. With the first assumption, the (statistical) emphasis is always placed on the same allele (e.g., minor alleles) across all SNPs. The second-and more problematic-assumption states that the effect of SNPs is uniform and linear. A simple counterexample shows the limitations of strictly linear additive assumptions: The risk of Alzheimer's disease due to ApoE genotypes is neither uniform nor linear (see, e.g., Table 2 in Genin et al., 2011) . Furthermore, \"ApoE E4\" gene alleles are considered risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, whereas \"ApoE E2\" gene alleles are considered protective against Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al., 1994) . By contrast, \"ApoE E2\" is considered a risk factor for the inability to break down fats, and this inability could, in turn, lead to certain types of vascular diseases or obesity (Koopal, van der Graaf, Asselbergs, Westerink, & Visseren, 2014) . Thus, directionality of genetic effects becomes dependent on the field of study."}, {"section_title": "SNP Coding Problem and Solution", "text": "Furthermore, there are two other specific cases in which the [0, 1, 2] (and similar) coding scheme is problematic, especially when the \"risk\" allele is computed empirically (i.e., as a frequency of, say, the minor allele). First, the minor allele for a given SNP in one sample or cohort is not guaranteed to be the same minor allele in a separate sample or cohort. This discrepancy is more likely to occur in smaller samples such as candidate gene studies. Thus, an empirical \"2\" in one study could be an empirical \"0\" in another. Second, studies that employ aggregate scores, such as profile scores or multilocus scores (e.g., Blum, Oscar-Berman, Demetrovics, Barh, & Gold, 2014; Nikolova, Ferrell, Manuck, & Hariri, 2011; van Eekelen et al., 2011 )-essentially, the sum or average of the risk alleles across multiple SNPs-could in fact miss effects, if the risk is empirically defined and the emphasis is in the same direction (i.e., minor homozygote as \"2\"). In fact, ApoE is an example of such an effect. ApoE is genotyped by the two SNPsrs7412 and rs429358, in which the ApoE E4/E4 genotype (the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease) is produced by a major homozygote (i.e., 0) from rs7412, and a minor homozygote (i.e., 2) from rs429358. 1 When risk alleles and true inheritance patterns are unknown, we (of course) do not know which allele should be emphasized as the risk factor, nor whether an effect should be tested with linear assumptions. Furthermore, if more than one SNP contributes to an effect in complex ways (e.g., a haplotype) sometimes, the linear additive [0, 1, 2] coding can completely miss effects (Vormfelde & Brockm\u00f6ller, 2007) . So, applying these [0, 1, 2] values to all SNPs-and subsequently testing each SNP independently-could either miss an effect or even misrepresent the true inheritance pattern. This problem occurs because allelic counts do not represent how much a SNP actually contributes to an effect, but rather codes only for a presumed effect (i.e., a linear contrast applied to an ANOVA design) about each genotype (e.g., AA, AG, or GG). Thus, the most parsimonious approach to genetic association studies-especially when we do not know the inheritance pattern, the direction, or the size of the effect-is to treat each genotype (e.g., AA, AG, or GG) as a level of a categorical variable (e.g., rs6859). This representation closely matches the genotypic or codominant models of inheritance and is a more general approach to testing. In fact, prior work has shown that the codominant model (see Table  1 and Appendix A) is the best choice when choosing a single model if the true inheritance pattern is unknown (Lettre, Lange, & Hirschhorn, 2007) . Furthermore, because the genotypic or codominant models are the most general, there is no requirement for additional testing of other inheritance models (i.e., additive, dominant, and recessive) on the same data set (which would require corrections for multiple tests).\nHere, we present partial least squares correspondence analysis (PLSCA; Beaton, Filbey, & Abdi, 2013 )-a derivative of PLSand several of its novel extensions tailored for the particular data and design issues often confronted in genetic association studies within the psychological, cognitive, and neurological sciences. PLSCA (like traditional PLS) is designed to simultaneously analyze two tables of data. However, PLSCA is more versatile than PLS because it can analyze diverse types of data, such as two categorical data sets, one categorical and one quantitative data set, or two data sets in which each is a mixture of categorical and quantitative data within each table. This versatility of PLSCA makes it an ideal method for genetic association studies because (a) as a multivariate method, PLSCA can detect how multiple genotypes contribute to many various phenotypes (traits) simultaneously; (b) phenotypes (traits) can be either categorical (e.g., diagnosis, sex) or quantitative (e.g., summary score, brain size); and (c) PLSCA-when used with a fully categorical coding scheme to represent SNPs-is flexible enough to detect linear and nonlinear relationships within (e.g., genotypic) and between (genotypic-phenotypic) data sets.\nBecause a uniform and linear assumption could misrepresent the expected contribution of genetic data to traits, behaviors, and diagnoses, we present PLSCA with an explicit categorical coding scheme for SNPs that represents each genotype. However, it is worth noting that-with a proper coding scheme-PLSCA can also analyze other inheritance models or even analyze mixed inheritance models within a single analysis (see Appendix A [and R code] for a detailed discussion on how to apply PLSCA with other inheritance models). Therefore, instead of using allelic Genotypes and their numeric representations for a variety of analytical and inheritance models HWE\nQuantitative (interval or ratio scale)\nNote. HWE \u03ed Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Note that, in general, many of these models are naturally categorical. a Here, for HWE and the genotypic model, SNPs are presented generally where 'A' is the major allele and 'a' the minor allele. The major homozygote, heterozygote, and minor homozygote are denoted 'AA', 'Aa', and 'aa', respectively. b The model codes for the heterozygote as different from either homozygote.\nc Where, b means \"baseline\" and r means \"risk,\" assuming the risk is associated strictly with the minor homozygote (if the risk should be on the major homozygote, the scale can be reversed where r is associated with the major allele).\ncounts (i.e., 0, 1, and 2), we present PLSCA with SNPs as categorical variables (see Table 2 ). While this approach is rarely used in multivariate analyses, there is some precedence for analyzing genetic data as categorical (Greenacre & Degos, 1977; Park, Lee, & Kim, 2007) . Additionally, multivariate contingency analyses of genetic data exist in some domains, such as ecology and biology (Dray, 2014; Edelaar et al., 2015; Frantz et al., 2013; Gasi et al., 2013; Kocovsky, Sullivan, Knight, & Stepien, 2013) .\nPLSCA is a derivative technique of both correspondence analysis (CA; Abdi & Williams, 2010a; Greenacre, 2010) and partial least squares correlation (PLSC; Krishnan et al., 2011; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004) . CA is a multivariate technique designed specifically to analyze categorical data (as found, e.g., in a contingency table) in a 2 framework-a framework particularly well suited for identifying rare occurrences (Greenacre, 2007 (Greenacre, , 1984 . PLSC is a family of methods-often used in neuroimaging (Krishnan et al., 2011; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004 )-designed to analyze two tables of variables measured on the same observations (Abdi, Chin, Esposito Vinzi, Russolillo, & Trinchera, 2013) . Interestingly, PLSC has recently been shown to be the best approachamong several canonical correlation or covariance analyses-to detect genetic associations in high dimensional neuroimaging data sets (Grellmann et al., 2015) . Thus, PLSCA-by leveraging features of CA and PLSC-is particularly suited for analyzing complex genetic association studies (e.g., candidate gene or genomewide). PLSCA can analyze genetic data in conjunction with data that are well defined and robust (e.g., clinical measures), and can do so for very high-dimensional data (even when the variables outnumber the observations).\nThe remainder of this article is outlined as follows. We first formally define PLSCA, and then we explain how to use particular nonparametric inference methods (e.g., tests via permutation and bootstrap) with PLSCA. Next we present a tutorial on-and introduce several variants of-PLSCA. This tutorial is broken into several studies that aim to tease apart the specific genetic contributions to: depression, dementia, and differences in brain structures in Alzheimer's disease (via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] study). Each study highlights a particular variation of PLSCA.

The \"diag{}\" operator transforms a vector into a diagonal matrix when applied to a vector and extracts the vector of the diagonal elements of a matrix when applied to a matrix.

The matrix Z R is decomposed with the SVD (see Appendix B) as\nwhere (a) L is the rank of Z R , (b) U is the J by L orthonormal matrix of left singular vectors, (c) V is the K by L orthonormal matrix of right singular vectors, and (d) \u232c is an L by L diagonal matrix (i.e., the off-diagonal elements of \u232c are all 0), in which the elements of the vector diag{\u232c} are the singular values (ordered from the largest to the smallest). The squared singular values-called eigenvalues-express the variance of the data extracted by the components. In the PLSC nomenclature, the matrices U and V are also called saliences (Bookstein, 1994; Krishnan et al., 2011; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004) .

In this article, we tend to use the more ubiquitous nomenclature from PCA and CA rather than the more specialized nomenclature from PLSC.

Both X and Y store categorical variables that are expressed with group coding (a.k.a. \"disjunctive coding\" or \"indicator matrix coding;\" see, e.g., Greenacre, 1984; Lebart, Morineau, & Warwick, 1984) , as illustrated in Table 2 . With this coding scheme, the N levels of a categorical variable are coded with N binary vectors. The level describing an observation has a value of 1 and the other levels have a value of 0, and so the product X T Y creates a contingency table. Contingency tables are routinely analyzed with 2 statistical approaches, and thus we developed PLSCA in such a 2 framework. First, compute the vectors of the proportional column sums for X and Y, and call these vectors masses:\n(with 1 being a conformable vector of ones). In PLSCA, each level of a variable is weighted according to the information it provides. Assuming that rare occurrences are more informative than frequent occurrences, these weights are computed as the inverse of the relative frequencies (masses) and stored in diagonal matrices computed as\nAs in PLSC, the disjunctive data matrices X and Y are, in general, preprocessed to have zero mean and unitary norm.

PCA decomposes the total variance of a quantitative data \nNext, CA computes two matrices related to R, referred to in the 2 framework as observed (O R ) and expected (E R ).

These indices are called contributions, direction cosines, and squared distances.

However, its results can be complemented by a variety of inference tests. These tests are computed from nonparametric resampling methods such as permutation and bootstrap resampling. Resampling methods generate a large number (e.g., thousands) of new data sets to derive the distributions of various statistics. The observed statistics are then compared against their resampling based distributions to determine if the observed effects are \"significant.\""}, {"section_title": "Permutation Tests", "text": "The permutation approach creates new samples by permuting the original data according to the null hypothesis to evaluate (Berry, Johnston, & Mielke, 2011) . When all possible permutations are computed, this procedure creates an exact test for the null hypothesis (when only a random sample of permutations is used, the permutation test is asymptotically exact). In PLSCA, observations from X are reordered, whereas Y remains static. That is, a (random) permutation breaks the relationship between the two sets. Several tests can be performed with permutation resampling.\nOmnibus. The original 2 value of the entire table (R) is tested against a generated set of 2 values generated from permutations. To note, the sum of all the cells the contingency table R multiplied by the sum of the eigenvalues (called the \"inertia\") from CA is equal to the 2 computed directly from the contingency table. As a result, an alternate test could simply use the sum of the eigenvalues. A rare value of the observed 2 or total inertia (i.e., it is among the \u2423 largest values) of the permuted samples indicates a significant omnibus effect.\nComponents. In SVD-based techniques, it is often difficult to identify the components to interpret (Ra\u00eeche, Walls, Magis, Riopel, & Blais, 2013) , especially because large data sets generate large numbers of components. Permutation resampling can also be used to identify the stable components from PLSCA. While there are numerous methods of testing components (Malinvaud, 1987; Peres-Neto, Jackson, & Somers, 2005; Saporta, 2011) , we use a simple, but conservative, method (see \"lambda-test\" in Peres-Neto et al., 2005) .

In PLSCA, observations are assumed to represent a population of interest. New samples are generated by resampling (observations) with replacement from the original sample (i.e., the rows of both X and Y are resampled with the same resampling scheme). The distribution of the statistics computed from bootstrap resampling is a maximum likelihood estimation of the distribution of the statistic of interest (for the population of the observations). In addition, the bootstrap can be stratified to resample within a priori groups (e.g., Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, control). The bootstrap is used to derive two different types of inferential statistics: bootstrap ratios (BSRs) and confidence intervals.\nBSR tests. BSRs come from the neuroimaging literature (McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004) but are related to other tests based on the bootstrap (see Hesterberg, 2011 , for \"interval-t\") or on asymptotic theory (see Lebart et al., 1984, for \"test-value\") . The BSR test is a t-like statistic computed by dividing the bootstrap computed mean of a measure by its bootstrap derived standard deviation. Just as for the usual t statistic, a value of 2 would (roughly) correspond to significance level of \u2423 \u03ed .05, that is, P (|t| \u03fe 2) \u03f7 .05, and can be considered as a critical value for a single null-hypothesis test. Corrections for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni) can be implemented when performing a large number of tests simply by increasing the BSR threshold to correspond to a particular \u2423 value, that is, P (|t| \u03fe 3) \u03f7 .0013 or P(|t| \u03fe 4) \u03f7 3.17 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 ). Confidence intervals. Confidence intervals are created from percentile cutoffs of the bootstrap distributions. Confidence intervals are generated for anything with component scores except observations (because the observations are the units for resampling). Confidence intervals can be created for each measure (just like the BSR) or around groups of participants (e.g., Alzheimer's group, mildly cognitive impaired group, control group). Confidence intervals can be displayed on component maps as peeled convex hulls (Greenacre, 2007) or as ellipsoids (Abdi, Dunlop, & Williams, 2009) . When the confidence intervals of two measures or groups do not overlap, these measures or groups are significantly different at the chosen level (Abdi et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Interpreting PLSCA and Its Extensions", "text": "Here, we illustrate PLSCA-and its extensions-with subsets of data from clinical, neuroimaging, and genome-wide data from the ADNI (Phase 1 data).

The ADNI project is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. Michael W. Weiner (VA Medical Center, and University of California-San Francisco) is the ADNI Principal Investigator. Subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada (for up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org).\nFor this article, we used several types of data from the ADNI project. First, we extracted the diagnostic criteria (i.e., clinical classification) of individuals: Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment, or control. To note, we refer to our specific participant groups as the abbreviations AD (Alzheimer's disease), MCI (mild cognitive impairment), and CON (control). For example, \"AD\" refers to the Alzhiemer's disease group in this article, while \"Alzheimer's disease\" refers to the disease itself. We also extracted volumetric (mm 3 ) brain data (collected at baseline) from the following regions: ventricles, hippocampus, entorhinal, fusiform, and medial temporal. Volumetric brain data and diagnostic information were extracted from the R package ADNIMERGE.\nNext, we extracted three behavioral measures that are widely used in Alzheimer's research and clinical assessment: the MiniMental State Exam (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The MMSE is a brief measure designed to capture aspects such as memory, attention, and orientation (time, place). The CDR assesses behavioral aspects of dementia. The GDS is an assessment of depression for older populations.\nFinally, we extracted a specific subset of candidate SNPs from the ADNI genome-wide association data. According to the literature, these SNPs are strongly linked to various behavioral, neurological, and physiological aspects of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. We refer to this approach of selecting SNPs a priori as a \"candidate GWAS,\" as it can be seen as a compromise between genome-wide association and candidate gene studies. The general goal of our \"candidate GWAS\" is to determine whether SNPs (and genes) routinely associated with Alzheimer's disease are also associated with some of the diagnostic criteria used for Alzheimer's disease. All data and the ADNIMERGE package can be acquired from the ADNI project database."}, {"section_title": "Data Preprocessing", "text": "ADNI Phase 1 data (for this study) included 757 total subjects from three groups: AD (n \u03ed 337), MCI (n \u03ed 210), and CON (n \u03ed 210). Individuals were only used in these analyses if they had mostly complete data (i.e., \u054690%). Any missing datum (e.g., a SNP) was imputed to the mean of the entire sample. Behavioral, diagnostic, and genetic (i.e., SNP) data were recoded into disjunctive format (see Table 2 ). Volumetric brain data were transformed into Z scores before further processing (see Table 4 ).\nThe ADNI's genome-wide data set comprises 620,901 SNPs. ADNI's clinical data include separate genotyping for ApoE (see ADNI's clinical data). Because ApoE status is defined by two SNPs (rs429358 and rs7412), we can account for these SNP genotypes in the genome-wide data: Thus, we obtain a total of 620,903 SNPs. PLINK was used for genome-wide data preprocessing (Purcell et al., 2007) . We used the following quality control (QC) criteria: Participant and SNP call rates (i.e., completeness of data) \u054690%, minor allele frequency \u05465%, HardyWeinberg equilibrium 3 p \u0545 10 \u03ea6 , in addition to gender and relation checks. SNP-based QC criteria were computed from the CON subjects. After QC, 756 participants (AD \u03ed 336, MCI \u03ed 210, CON \u03ed 210) and 531,339 SNPs remained.\nFrom the genome-wide preprocessed data, we selected, for the studies of this article, 145 candidate SNPs because these SNPs-or their associated genes-are well-established candidates (e.g., ApoE) or have recently been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. These SNPs have been reported in Hollingworth et al. (2011) , Kauwe et al. (2008) , Potkin et al. (2009 ), Shen et al. (2010 , and Wijsman et al. (2011) , or from an aggregate source: AlzGene (www.alzgene.org; Bertram, McQueen, Mullin, Blacker, & Tanzi, 2007) . Two studies from this list (i.e., Potkin et al., 2009, and Shen et al., 2010) were also conducted on earlier versions of the ADNI data set."}, {"section_title": "Studies", "text": "We present five studies that illustrate PLSCA and its four different extensions. In general, these extensions map to some of the current variants of PLSC (Krishnan et al., 2011; McIntosh et al., 1996; McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004) , which often aim to simultaneously analyze neuroimaging and behavioral (or experimental design) related data.\nWe use \"simple\" PLSCA (as defined in PLS for Categorical Data) to illustrate the relationship between two categorical data sets: genetic (SNPs) and behavioral (MMSE, CDR, and GDS). Each extension of PLSCA is tailored to a particular problem of data type, data structure, or experimental design. The first extension solves the issue of data structured in blocks (i.e., MMSE, CDR, and GDS are separate \"blocks\" of variables within the set of behavioral data). Next, we define a discriminant version of PLSCA, called \"mean-centered\" PLSCA, which maximally distinguishes data based on a grouping variable (i.e., the three clinical groups). Similarly, we define \"seed\" PLSCA as a method to specifically to maximize the interrelationships within a particular set of categorical data-for example, we want to identify novel candidate SNPs from well-established candidate markers such as ApoE). Finally, we define a particularly useful version of PLSCA: \"Mixed-data\" PLSCA, which can analyze the relationship between one categorical data set (i.e., SNPs) and one quantitative (continuous, interval scale) data set (i.e., volumetric data from brain imaging)."}, {"section_title": "Simple PLSCA", "text": "Simple PLSCA was used to analyze the relationship between the behavioral data set and the SNP data set. A permutation test indicates that the omnibus effect was significant ( omnibus 2 \u03ed 23150.41, p perm \u03fd .001). For the components, only Components 1 and 3 (out of 68) reached significance (30.85%, p perm \u03fd .001, and 6.25%, p perm \u03ed .017, respectively), and were therefore kept for the analysis. Components 1 and 3 are presented in PLSC style (with normalized saliences as bar plots) in Figure 1 and CA style (with normalized saliences on component maps) in Figure 2 . As a noteworthy feature, PLSCA provides information for each level of all variables. This can be seen with the contrast of, for example, \"correct\" versus \"incorrect\" results on the MMSE (see Figures 2a and 2b ; horizontal axis). Likewise, the SNPs are coded in the same fashion, and provide information per genotype. The left side of Component 1 includes two very notable markers: the heterozygote and minor homozygote of rs429358 (a SNP used to assign the genotype for ApoE). We also see the minor homozygotes of rs7910977 and rs7526034, which have been associated, respectively, with \u2424-amyloid degradation (Kauwe et al., 2008) and structural changes in brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (Shen et al., 2010) .\nAdditionally, PLSCA shows that the heterozygote of rs2075650 and the major homozygote of rs157580 are also on the left side of Component 1, and therefore are also associated with dementia and deficits on the MMSE. Both rs2075650 and rs157580 are associated with the TOMM40 gene-a gene strongly linked to ApoE-and have been associated with Alzheimer's disease in previous studies (Potkin et al., 2009; Roses et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2010) . However, this conclusion runs counter to expectations because it suggests that the genetic contributions to pathological behaviors are not strictly because of standard \"risk\" (i.e., minor) alleles. Such a conclusion could be missed in a standard analysis using \"additive coding\" (see Table 2 ), but becomes explicit with a disjunctive coding scheme.\nIn contrast to the left side of Component 1, the right side of Component 1 is associated with \"healthy\" responses on the MMSE and CDR. This level of detail is advantageous because we can identify possibly protective genetic markers. Some of the alleles with the strongest effects are the heterozygote of rs157580 and the major homozygote of rs2075650 (TOMM40), as well as the major homozygote of rs429358 (ApoE). We can conclude that Component 1 is a \"pathological versus healthy\" dimension, and thus we can associate specific genotypes of SNPs (as opposed to entire SNPs) with pathological or healthy features.\nComponent 3. In general, the GDS items contribute a substantial amount of variance to the top side of Component 3 (see Table 4 Schematic of Escofier-Style Transformation\nContinuous data Subject 1 . All of these items are associated with geriatric depression (e.g., Q: \"Are you basically satisfied with your life?\" A: \"No\"; Q: \"Do you feel that your life is empty?\" A: \"Yes\"). Therefore, Component 3 can be described as a \"depression\" dimension. This component, therefore, suggests that some genes may contribute to geriatric depression and that this effect can be seen in early stages of cognitive decline (e.g., in MCI ( Figure 1d , Figure 2b , and Figure 2d ) reveals a strong effect of the minor allele of rs11525066, which has been previously associated with hippocampal atrophy (Potkin et al., 2009) . Bootstrap. BSRs can be used to identify important (e.g., \"significant\") variables, and can be graphically represented on component maps (see Figure 3) or as bar plots (see Figure 4) . Many of the significant behavioral variables for Component 1 correspond to either incorrect responses on the MMSE, or \"moderate\" to \"severe\" responses on the CDR (Figure 4a) . The complete list of SNPs associated with either pathological (left side of Component 1) or beneficial (right side of Component 1) behaviors can be found in Supplemental Materials (Table S1 ). Component 3 seems to oppose depression with mild impairment (top of Component 3) to depression with severe impairment (bottom of Component 3). The complete list of genetic markers associated with depression versus impairment can be found in Table S1 of the online supplemental materials.\nLatent variables and participants. In PLSCA, just as in PLSC, observations can be represented by the values of their latent variables (see Equations 14, 26, and 27) , and this provides maps in which the coordinates for one observation are its values of the latent variables for X and Y (see Figure 5 for PLSC style, and Figure 6 for CA style). These maps can be interpreted as scatterplots and the dispersion of the observations reflects their relationship (a perfect relationship will show the observations positioned on a line). Groups of observations can also be represented in these maps by averaging the component scores of the observations in a group and bootstrap resampling can provide confidence intervals for these groups (see Figure 5b and d) . Figure 5 indicates a clear distinction of individuals within groups for behavior versus genetics on Component 1. Furthermore, the groups are significantly different from one another because their confidence intervals do not overlap (Figure 5b) . Component 1 reflects a continuum for the groups: from CON to MCI to AD. These results indicate that there are specific behavioral and genetic signatures for each group. Component 3 (see Figure 5 and Figure 6a ) appears to show individual (as opposed to group) effects of geriatric depression."}, {"section_title": "Multiblock PLSCA", "text": "Multiblock PLSCA is a simple extension of PLSCA that includes multiblock projections (Abdi, Williams, Beaton, et al., 2012; Abdi, Williams & Valentin, 2013; Krishnan et al., 2011) . Often, the variables of these data sets are structured into related, but distinct, blocks (also called tables or subtables). In our example, the MMSE, CDR, and GDS are all distinct blocks of variables within the behavioral data set. It is worth noting that genome-wide data have several possible block structures (e.g., genes, haplotypes, and chromosomes). Multiblock PLSCA can be used to answer the following question: How does each behavioral measure uniquely contribute to the results?\nThe goal of multiblock PLSCA is to provide both an overall and a \"block\" point of view of the participants' latent variable scores. In general, the data are structured as\nwhere the columns of X (and subsequently Z X ) are partitioned into blocks. This block structure propagates to the rows of the matrix Z R and to its GSVD (cf. Equation 13):\nThe partition of U into blocks also propagates to the latent variables of X (see Equation 14):\nMultiblock analyses were conducted within the same analysis as \"simple\" PLSCA. Figure 7 shows the participants' latent variable scores, separately, for the MMSE (Figure 7a ), the CDR (Figure 7b) , and the GDS (Figure 7c ). The multiblock projection shows that the CDR and MMSE-as indicated beforeconstitute strong sources of variance for Component 1 (Figure  7a and b) . Finally, with the multiblock projections, the interpretation of Component 3 becomes clearer. The upper part of Component 3 is associated with strong features of depression (Figure 7c ), whereas the lower part is associated with severe dementia (Figure 7b )."}, {"section_title": "Mean-Centered PLSCA", "text": "Mean-centered PLSCA is a simple form of PLSCA also known as barycentric discriminant correspondence analysis (DiCA; Abdi, 2007a; William, Abdi, French, & Orange, 2010) . The goal of meancentered PLSCA to maximize the separation between a set of a priori defined groups. Alternatively, this can be thought of as finding the best set of variables that can be used to assign observations to a priori defined groups. In mean-centered PLSCA, a disjunctive design matrix for the a priori groups is X and the disjunctive data matrix (e.g., SNPs) is Y. Mean-centered PLSCA maximizes the separation between groups, and thus detects which SNPs patterns (because of participant groups) can be used to assign individual participants to clinical groups (i.e., CON, MCI, and AD).\nIn mean-centered PLSCA, the omnibus test is significant ( 2 \u03ed 785.60, p perm \u03fd .001). Because we have three groups, we have only two components: Component 1 explains 67% of the variance and is significant (p perm \u03fd .001), whereas Component 2 explains 33% of the variance but is not significant (p perm \u03ed .521). Figure 8a shows the groups (large dots) and individuals (small dots), and suggests a separation of all groups. Figure 8b shows the bootstrap confidence intervals around the groups. None of the intervals overlap; thus, all groups significantly differ from each other.\nThe genotypes closest to CON are more associated with this group than with any of the other groups. In Figure 8c , only significant SNPs (according to their BSR) are colored. In the lower part of the map in Figure 8c , we see the minor homozygote of rs12610605, which has been previously linked to Alzheimer's disease (Hollingworth et al., 2011) . However, mean-centered PLSCA shows that the minor homozygote of rs12610605 is much more associated with the MCI group than with any other group. Furthermore, we highlight a particular effect in Figure 8d , with two TOMM40 SNPs (rs157580, rs2075650) and one ApoE SNP (rs429358). Both the rs2075650 and rs429358 show a similar structure: an effect from left (major homozygote) to right (minor homozygote) that is somewhere between a linear and a multiplicative effect on Component 1. However, rs157580 appears to show a different inheritance pattern-a dominance effect-and in the opposite direction of both rs2075650 and rs429358: The minor homozygote and heterozygote of rs157580 are positioned closely to the major homozygotes of rs2075650 and rs429358 on Component 1. This finding highlights how PLSCA-with categorical coding-detects a variety of effects (without the need to explicitly model each of them). The effects observed on Component 1 could suggest a complex haplotype of the ApoE and TOMM40 SNPs that better describes AD risk than any single genotype.\nThus, mean-centered PLSCA indicates that (a) the genotypes on the right side of Component 1 are more associated with AD than with any other group, (b) the genotypes on the bottom of Component 2 are more associated with MCI than with any other group, and arguably the most important aspect, (c) the genotypes on the left of Component 1 are more associated with the CON group than with any other group. This level of detail can only be obtained from PLSCA and disjunctive coding. A complete set of significant SNP markers-for mean-centered PLSCA results-is provided in Table S2 of the online supplemental materials."}, {"section_title": "Seed PLSCA", "text": "The term seed partial least squares is commonly used in functional brain connectivity analyses (McIntosh, Nyberg, Bookstein, & Tulving, 1997) . In a \"seed\" analysis, there is only one data set, but a specific portion of that data set is extracted and treated as a second data set (i.e., a seed). In this case, the SNPs are still referred to as Y and can also be thought of as having a block structure (as in Equation 28):\nwhere Y s denotes one SNP in disjunctive coding (see Table 2 ). From Y, a particular set of SNPs are selected as \"seeds\" and removed from that matrix. The remaining SNPs are left in Y. If, for example, the first two SNPs are \"seeds,\" X and Y become The seed approach reveals similarity (and dissimilarity) of genotypes across SNPs. Seed PLSCA is a useful approach to find novel candidate markers. Seed PLSCA can be used to reveal which genotypes are most similar to \"candidate\" genotypes (e.g., SNP or gene alleles). This example uses rs429358 (APOE) and rs2075650 (TOMM40) as \"seeds.\" Seed PLSCA benefits from using an \"asymmetric\" visualization, in which the component scores of the \"seed set\" (i.e., X) are (cf.

Asymmetric visualization could be used for any form of PLSCA in which one data set is \"privileged\" over the other.\nIn seed PLSC, we use the asymmetric visualization for the seed SNPs. Thus, in seed PLSCA genotypes across sets that are close to one another co-occur frequently, genotypes that are in the exact same position co-occur precisely with one another, and genotypes that are far apart co-occur infrequently or in opposition. Figure 9a shows the plot of the first two components of seed PLSCA. Components 1 and 2 explain, respectively, 72% and 20% of the total variance. Note that the heterozygotes (upper left of Figure 9a 9a) of rs429358 and rs2075650 are distant from nearly all other genotypes. That is, the minor allele-based markers of the \"seeds\" are not close to any other genotypes. Furthermore, the major homozygotes of rs429358 and rs2075650 are very close to other genotypes (lower right of Figure 9a ). This indicates that major homozygotes of these SNPs co-occur very frequently, or exactly, with many other major homozygotes. Furthermore, Figure 9b shows the latent variables, via the distribution of participants with respect to their group. This figure shows that AD is more associated with the minor alleles than the other groups, whereas Figure 9c shows no real discernible pattern to separate individuals. The \"seed\" analysis suggests that although the major homozygotes are highly similar to other major homozygotes, the heterozygotes and minor homozygotes of rs429358 and rs2075650 express a relatively unique pattern. This uniqueness suggests that there is no novel candidate from this set of SNPs to match the ApoE and TOMM40 minor homozygotes and heterozygotes. "}, {"section_title": "PLSCA With Heterogeneous Data", "text": "Though we present PLSCA as a method for two categorical tables, PLSCA can be generalized to include continuous variables, because with a simple preprocessing (i.e., coding) approach, PLSCA can easily analyze mixtures of categorical and continuous variables. Specifically, in 1979, Brigitte Escofier proposed such an approach for analyzing mixtures of data with CA (Escofier, 1979) , and showed that a quantitative variable, noted x (i.e., a column from X) that is centered and scaled (i.e., it has mean of zero and norm one) can be used with CA if it is re-expressed as two variables computed as . Applying CA (following Equations 19 to 22) to an \"Escofier-transformed\" matrix (of a continuous data set; see Table 5 ) produces results identical to a PCA of X because this table is analogous to a complete disjunctive table (see Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "As in the previous examples, mixed-data PLSCA provides component scores for each set of variables, and latent variable scores for participants. However, one noticeable difference is that the continuous data set component scores-here, volumetric data of brain regions-are \"duplicated\" (also called \"bipolar,\" because each variable is represented by two poles; see Greenacre, 1984 Greenacre, , 2014 , and are denoted with \"\u03e9\" and \"-\" (see Figure 10) .\nIn this analysis, there was a significant omnibus effect (p perm \u03fd .001), but only Component 1 was significant (p perm \u03fd .001). Figure 10 shows the component maps for both the genotypes (Figure 10a and b) and the brain regions (Figure 10c and d) . Significant genotypes are presented in Table S3 of the online supplemental materials. In Figure 10 , we can see that there are particular genotypes associated with particular patterns of brain region volumes. More specifically, Figures 10b and 10d suggest that certain genotypes are associated with brain region volumes above the grand mean (right side of Figure 10b , and Figure 10d) but that other genotypes are associated with brain region values below the grand mean (left side of Figure 10b , and Figure 10d ).\nIn particular, Figure 11 shows that brain region volumes above the grand mean (Figure 11a ) are more associated with the CON group ( Figure 11b ) than with other groups. Further, we see that numerous major homozygotes-such as rs429358 (ApoE), rs7647307, and rs2075650 -are more associated with brain region volumes above the grand mean (Figure 11c ). Interestingly, however, some heterozygotes and minor homozygotes are also associated with brain region volumes above the grand mean. These include rs439401, rs667897, and rs337847. To note, although these SNPs have been previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, this implication has been almost exclusively via the assumptions of an \"additive\" model in which, typically, the minor alleles are assumed to be associated with risk factors. For example, rs337847 has been associated with hippocampal atrophy (Potkin et al., 2009 ). However, we show that the minor homozygote of rs337847 is more related to brain region volume above the grand mean than below the grand mean, a pattern that suggests the major allele of rs337847 is likely to be the risk factor."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "PLSCA was designed to address several challenges (e.g., the categorical nature of SNPs, rare occurrences, multivariate analysis) while simultaneously analyzing genetic data and data traditionally associated with the psychological, cognitive, and neuro- logical sciences. In the following sections, we highlight some of the affordances PLSCA provides."}, {"section_title": "Findings Conclusions", "text": "The analyses we performed, with each extension of PLSCA, added a unique perspective on the genetic contribution to Alzheimer's disease and associated traits. First, across several of our analyses (e.g., simple PLSCA and mixed-data PLSCA), we have shown that the additive risk model approach (e.g., emphasizing minor alleles as the risk factor) may be an inappropriate assumption to explain, for example, complex behaviors, traits, and diagnoses. In several of our analyses, a number of major homozygotes were associated with AD, MCI, and traits often associated with those groups (such as memory and attention issues; Figures 3 4). Furthermore, some minor homozygotes were associated with CON participants and nonpathological-and arguably \"healthy\"-traits (e.g., the minor homozygote of rs337847 is not associated with smaller regional brain volume, but rather regional sizes above the mean).\nThe results from both mean-centered and simple PLSCA suggest that there are unique genetic signatures per group. First, this provides a more distinct view of genetic risk factors for AD. Further, our results suggest that there are particular genetic (and behavioral) profiles of the CON and MCI groups as well. Given these unique profiles, the genetic markers associated with the CON group may suggest the existence of protective (against AD) genetic factors.\nHowever, we also show unique genetic and behavioral profiles for the MCI group. This group is somewhat associated with behavioral measures of geriatric depression. Because mild cognitive impairment is considered part of a pathological trajectory (Sperling et al., 2011) , this result is somewhat surprising. These findings suggest that the MCI group is not a homogeneous group necessarily on a path toward Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Rather, the MCI group could consist of (at least) two undifferentiable populations of individuals: (a) those on the path toward further cognitive decline (Dotson, Beydoun, & Zonderman, 2010) , and (b) those who suffer from depression with specific incidents of cognitive complaints or impairment (Richard et al., 2013) .\nFinally, we also show, via mixed-data PLSCA, that some genotypes are more associated with brain region volumes above or below the grand mean of the sample. However, we show that typical Alzheimer's disease risk-atrophy or shrinkage of brain regions-is not exclusively related to minor alleles. In fact, our results suggest that there is a complex interaction between SNPs-in which some major and some minor alleles contribute to protective or risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "Methods Conclusions", "text": "One issue of growing interest is, simply, how to concurrently analyze sets of behavioral and genetic variables. The joint analysis of behavioral and genetic data could boost power to detect genetic effects (Allison et al., 1998; Schifano et al., 2013; Seoane et al., 2014) . Additionally, these data are typically high-dimension (i.e., large number of variables) and low-sample-size (HDLSS). SVD (and thus eigen) based techniques tend to be reliable under particular conditions in HDLSS (Chi, 2012; Jung & Marron, 2009) , even in GWAS (Duan et al., 2013) . Thus, PLSCA is well suited for multivariate analyses of behavioral and genetic data.\nFurther, because PLSCA is a multivariate technique, it also has several other advantages over many currently used methods. Multivariate approaches are more beneficial than univariate approaches (Schmitz, Cherny, & Fulker, 1998) , especially with respect to multiple testing issues (Nyholt, 2004) . Additionally, PLSCA incorporates several nonparametric resampling methods for inference tests. Resampling methods are particularly relevant for data that are noisy or non-normal (Hesterberg, 2011) , or when conservative estimates should be made (Chernick, 2008) , all of which are conditions especially relevant in genetics (Gao, Becker, Becker, Starmer, & Province, 2010) .\nIn addition, PLSCA analyzes levels (genotypes) of SNPs, and does so in a 2 framework (i.e., CA), which is already used in many aspects of genetic analyses such as the (a) 2 tests of association or Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, and (b) explicit genotypic tests and the codominant model of inheritance. Furthermore, PLSCA generalizes PLSC, which has been shown to be robust in association studies with high dimensional data (Grellmann et al., 2015) .\nBecause of the features, properties, and categorical approach of PLSCA, interpretation of specific allelic and genotypic effects becomes more apparent. The more general approach (i.e., genotypic model coding) of PLSCA can be more advantageous than relying on any one model or testing all possible models (and then correcting for multiple tests), because if a particular inheritance model is apparent, PLSCA will reveal it on a component-bycomponent basis. For example, if we look at two of the analyses presented here, \"simple\" PLSCA and \"mixed-data\" (a.k.a. \"heterogeneous\", or \"mixed-modality\") PLSCA, we see evidence for two different genetic models for how rs429358 (an ApoE SNP) may contribute to different aspects of AD: (a) a linear additive effect with respect to diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (Figure 2 , horizontal axis), and (b) a dominance effect (presence of a minor allele) with respect to volume of brain regions (Figure 10 , horizontal axis). Finally, because components from (within each of) these analyses are orthogonal, they can be interpreted independently. For example, in \"seed\" PLSCA (see Figure 9) we can see that the \"seeds\" are roughly equidistant to the major homozygotes and heterozygotes, and we see, again, the same pattern for the heterozygotes and the minor homozygotes for both ApoE and TOMM40 on the first component ( Figure 9 , horizontal axis). However, the second component ( Figure 9 , vertical axis) shows a contrast of the heterozygote to both the homozygotes. Components configured in this way show two different genetic models of these two SNPs (in ApoE and TOMM40) with respect to the other SNPs: The first component implies a linear model, but the second component implies a heterozygous effect. Overall, the inheritance of ApoE and TOMM40 markers appears to be quite unique when compared to other risk markers.\nBecause of the features of PLSCA, we have shown a much more detailed perspective, within a limited set of SNPs, of the genetic contributions to AD and associated behaviors. We were able to associate very specific genotypic contributions-contrary to usual risk assumptions-with standard and robust measures often used in clinical and diagnostic settings for Alzheimer's disease. The level of detail that PLSCA provides could shed more light onto the genetic contributions to complex traits and diseases, such as identifying possibly protective genetic markers. Future work includes combining PLSCA with (a) regularization and sparsification techniques, and (b) predictive and path-modeling approaches-to create PLS-based regression and path-modeling approaches designed for categorical data."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A Alternative and Additional Strategies With Partial Least Squares Correspondence Analysis (PLSCA): Testing Other Genetic Models", "text": "We present a multivariate strategy that is both parsimonious and, arguably, the most general approach (i.e., genotypic/codominant) to detecting associations between many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits (or behaviors, diagnoses, etc.). However, the completely categorical approach that we present is not the only approach to association analyses. In this appendix, we briefly discuss how to use PLSCA with other models of inheritance (e.g., additive, dominant, recessive).\nSometimes it might be advantageous to test a specific genetic model of inheritance, especially if the model is known (Lettre, Lange, & Hirschhorn, 2007) . As in Table 1 , we have noted a number of formats taken by genetic data for a variety of analyses and inheritance models. Generally, there are six widely used models: codominant (or genotypic), dominant, recessive, heterozygous, additive, and multiplicative. While the additive model is one of the most commonly used models, the codominant and genotypic models are the most general, quite powerful, and the best fit when an inheritance model is unknown (Lettre et al., 2007) . While multiple models can be tested in succession, this procedure becomes impractical with large data sets for two reasons: computational expense and correcting for multiple tests (especially because the standard genome-wide association studies threshold is already very conservative: p \u03fd .05 \u03eb 10 -8 ). Thus, we recommend the fully categorical approach (\u00e0 la the genotypic model), especially because in the psychological, cognitive, and neurological sciences, we may not know which model is most appropriate in order to explain complex behaviors, traits, and diagnoses.\nWe briefly illustrate how data could be recoded for a variety of formats, in addition to recommendations for how to approach PLSCA with different inheritance models. To note, most formats discussed are easily exported from most genetic association software (e.g., PLINK). The disjunctive recoding and analyses can be achieved with the ExPosition and TExPosition packages (Beaton et al., 2014; Beaton, Rieck, Fatt, & Abdi, 2013) . Example data and code are available at https://code.google.com/p/exposition-family/ source/browse/Publications/PsyMet_2015 and http://www.utd.edu/ herve/PsyMet_2015"}, {"section_title": "Categorical Models", "text": "Four of the six commonly used genetic models are categorical in nature. These models are (a) codominant, (b) dominant, (c) recessive, and (d) heterozygous. Because PLSCA is presented in a format that aligns with codominant (and genotypic) model(s), we forgo that discussion here and focus on the other three categorical models. The categorical models can be used in any of the PLSCA approaches with another categorical data set (e.g., surveys, diagnosis). If the genetic data are categorical and the trait data are quantitative, the mixed-modality version of PLSCA must be used. Table A1 illustrates how to code for dominant, recessive, and heterozygous models. Both the nominal genotype and (standard) additive approach are provided for reference (Table A1 , a and b). SNPs are presented in a general format in which \"A\" is the major allele and \"a\" the minor allele. The major homozygote, heterozygote, and minor homozygote are presented as AA, Aa, and aa, respectively.\nDominant. The dominant model assumes that just the presence of a minor allele is considered a risk factor. Essentially, genotypes become dichotomized between the major homozygote vs. the other genotypes ([AA] vs. [Aa \u03e9 aa]). Categorical and disjunctive coding for the dominant model can be found in Table  A1 , c and d.\nRecessive. The recessive model assumes that only the minor homozygote is the risk factor. Essentially, genotypes become dichotomized between the minor homozygote vs. the other genotypes ([AA \u03e9 Aa] vs.\n[aa]). Categorical and disjunctive coding for the recessive model can be found in Table A1 , e and f.\nHeterozygous. The heterozygous model assumes that just the heterozygote confers either a risk or protective factor. Essentially, genotypes become dichotomized between the heterozygote vs. the homozygotes ([AA \u03e9 aa] vs.\n[Aa]). Categorical and disjunctive coding for the heterozygous model can be found in Table A1 , g and h.\nIn sum, any of these categorical coding approaches are easily exported by most genetic association software, and can be used trivially with PLSCA."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Models", "text": "In general, there are two quantitative genetic models: (a) additive, and (b) multiplicative. Here, we outline how to use PLSCA with these models in two different formats: representation of each genotype with a quantitative value in a disjunctive format (i.e., a compromise between quantitative and co-dominant coding), in addition to representation of just SNPs (i.e., strictly quantitative).\nA compromise between quantitative and categorical. Additive coding expects equal risk between ordinal pairs of nucleotides. That is, the risk value between the major homozygote and the heterozygote should be equal to the risk value between the heterozygote and the minor homozygote (e.g., 0, 1, 2). In Table A2 , Part c, we provide an example of how to code the additive model in the disjunctive format. In disjunctive format, there are three possible configurations: Note. Here, SNPs are presented generally where \"A\" is the major allele and \"a\" the minor allele. The major homozygote, heterozygote, and minor homozygote are denoted \"AA\", \"Aa\", and \"aa\", respectively. Example of (a) nominal, (b) additive, followed by (c) dominant (dominant genotypes marked as \"D\"; nondominant marked as \"N\") with (d) the disjunctive form of dominant, followed by (e) recessive (recessive genotypes marked as \"R\"; nonrecessive marked as \"N\") with (f) disjunctive form of recessive, followed by (g) heterozygous (heterozygous genotypes marked as 'H', non heterozygous marked as 'N') with the (h) disjunctive form of heterozygous. Disjunctive data for dominant, recessive, and heterozygous models are essentially dichotomized, and thus presented as disjunctive code for two categories. Note. Here, SNPs are presented generally where \"A\" is the major allele and \"a\" the minor allele. The major homozygote, heterozygote, and minor homozygote are presented as \"AA\", \"Aa\", and \"aa\", respectively. Example of (a) nominal, (b) additive, followed by (c) a compromise between linear additive and disjunctive. Here, coding exists only for the presence of a major allele ('A') or a minor allele ('a'). If a subject has the heterozygote, they receive equal parts major and minor homozygote, and (d) a compromise between multiplicative and disjunctive. Here, coding exists only for the presence of a major allele ('A') or a minor allele ('a'). If a subject has the heterozygote, there is a larger emphasis on the minor allele than the major allele."}, {"section_title": "(Appendices continue)", "text": "However, if the quantitative inheritance model should place more emphasis on a particular allele, then only one set of these values changes: those associated with the heterozygote. If, for example, there should be more emphasis on the minor allele when it is present (e.g., the heterozygote and minor homozygote; analogous to a dominance model), then the heterozygote can be coded as different values that sum to 1 (e.g., [0.25 0.75], [0.1, 0.9] ) that best describes the risk of a minor allele (see Table A2d ). To note, as long as the sum of the columns that span a single variable (e.g., SNP1) sum to 1, this pattern meets the criteria for disjunctive coding. When the values are within the interval of [0 1], this is often called \"fuzzy coding\" or \"bipolar coding\" (Greenacre, 2014; Lebart, Morineau, & Warwick, 1984) . This format is still considered a categorical table and the same rules apply as in the other categorical coding formats. If the genetic and trait data are both categorical, standard PLSCA applies. If the genetic data are categorical and the trait data are quantitative, the mixed-modality version of PLSCA must be used.\nQuantitative models as they are. If a researcher wishes to use SNPs in a quantitative format, represented by single columns, as one of their data sets (see, e.g., any of the \"additive\" examples in Tables 1, 2, Table A1, and Table A2 ), then there are only two options in the PLSCA framework. First, if the SNPs are quantitative but the trait data are categorical or dummy coded (e.g., diagnostic group; see mean-centered PLSCA), then the mixedmodality PLSCA approach applies, wherein the SNPs are treated as quantitative (and thus duplicated, as in Table 4 ). To note, there is one particular circumstance that essentially reduces to a simple regression: If the SNPs are quantitative and the categorical data simply designate whether a subject is either a \"case\" or a \"control,\" this will produce only one component that best separates \"case\" from \"control\" groups.\nSecond, if the SNPs and the traits are quantitative, then both data sets must be recoded as in Table 4 . However-because PLSCA generalizes PLSC-this simply reduces to a standard PLSC (within a constant scaling factor) between the SNPs and the traits. If both sets are treated as quantitative, it is best to just perform PLSC because it reduces the required computational time and memory (i.e., there is no duplication of columns).\nThe Generalized SVD (GSVD)\nThe GSVD 5 differs from the SVD in that there are constraints placed upon the rows and columns. The constraints are represented by positive definite matrices of sizes J by J and K by K applied to the rows and columns, respectively. These constraints matrices are often diagonal matrices, and when this is case, they are usually called masses or weights. We denote the weights for the rows, W J , and the weights for the columns, W K . Decomposition of a matrix is the same as in Equation B1 , with the following constraints:\nwhere component scores for the J rows and K columns are computed as\nThe GSVD is a very powerful technique and, with the correct selection of weights, can generalize many techniques (e.g., multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis). For a comprehensive list of techniques that the GSVD generalizes, see Appendix A in Greenacre (1984) . 5 There are actually two techniques called the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). One described by Van Loan (1976) , and extended by Paige and Saunders (1981) , was designed for decomposition of two matrices that share the same columns, in which, typically, one matrix is ill-conditioned. The other, which is the one we refer to, is described as an approach to the SVD with constraints placed on the left and right singular vectors, as described by Greenacre (1984) , Lebart et al. (1984) , and Abdi (2007b) ."}, {"section_title": "Appendix B The Main Tool: The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition", "text": "The singular value decomposition (SVD)-and, by extension, the generalized SVD (GSVD)-is the core tool for many techniques such as principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, partial least squares, and numerous related techniques. The SVD is a generalization of the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD; see Abdi 2007c). The EVD decomposes square, symmetric tables, whereas the SVD decomposes rectangular tables (Yanai, Takeuchi, & Takane, 2011) .\nThe SVD produces orthogonal components (sometimes called dimensions, axes, principal axes, or factors). Components are new variables computed as linear combinations of the original variables of the original data matrix. Because components are orthogonal (i.e., two different components have zero correlation), they can also be obtained as a simple geometric rotation of axes with respect to the original variables (Jolliffe, 2002) . The first component always explains the maximum variance in the data. Each following component explains the next largest possible amount of remaining variance under the condition that components are mutually orthogonal.\nObservations and measures are assigned values for each component, called component scores. The values reflect how much an observation contributes to the variance of each component. Additionally, component scores of observations or measures can be plotted, with respect to components, to produce component maps (much akin to scatterplots). Component maps show the spatial relationship between observations, between measures, and between the two sets (Greenacre, 1984) : Items close to each other are similar, and items far apart differ."}, {"section_title": "The SVD", "text": "The SVD is the core of most linear multivariate techniques (see Abdi, 2007b) . The SVD decomposes a data matrix R-with J rows and K columns-into three matrices:\nwhere R has rank L, U is a J by L matrix of left singular vectors, V is a K by L matrix of right singular vectors, and \u232c is an L by L diagonal matrix in which diag{\u232c} stores the singular values (and diag{\u232c 2 } stores the eigenvalues). Furthermore, U and V are orthonormal matrices such that\nComponent scores for the J rows and K columns are computed as\nand can be plotted-often with two components at a time-to produce component maps."}]
