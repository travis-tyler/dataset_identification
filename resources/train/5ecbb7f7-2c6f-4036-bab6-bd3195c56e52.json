Public transit and other modes of transportation were also suspended in neighbouring cities (IPAC, 2020).\nThe responsible infectious agent was identified in an emerging coronavirus, named as \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2\" (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with which it shares a common genetic basis, the emerging coronavirus has a zoonotic origin, with a human-to-human transmission (Tiwari R et al, 2020 ). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) due to the novel coronavirus. This decision was made due to concern of further global spread after cases being confirmed in 4 other countries (Japan, Vietnam, Germany, and the United States) (WHO, 2020). From Besides the various responses to the pandemic in terms of public health policies, differences in the outcome of flattening the curve could be explained taking into account an array of climatic, social and demographic parameters, including temperature, weather (Tosepu et al., 2020) and pollution (Copat et al., 2020; Ricc\u00f2 et al., 2020) , country development, income and gross domestic product (Lippi et al., 2020; Mukherji, 2020) , and population ageing (Petretto and Pili, 2020), among others. Concerning climatic factors, a positive association between COVID-19 cases and 14-day lagged temperature was found, whereas a negative association between COVID-19 cases and 14-day lagged wind speed could be detected. Furthermore, higher rates of COVID-19 cases were reported where absolute humidity was in the range 5-10 g/m3 . Pollutants, such as PM2.5 and NO2 and to a lesser extent PM10, have been found to contribute to COVID-19 and mortality rate, as potential triggers (Copat et al., 2020) . The COVID-19 induced death rate was reported to be positively associated with economic variables, such as the countries' gross domestic products (Lippi et al., 2020) , income, and Gini's inequality index (Mukherji, 2020) . Moreover, social and health parameters, including old age, male gender, ethnicity, comorbidities (diabetes, cancer and other chronic-degenerative disorders) have been found to correlate with COVID-19 fatality rate.\nThe growth rate of an infectious disease for a country is an important measure of how it spreads in the country and the time at which the peak value occurs. It is usually estimated by fitting the cumulative number of cases of the initial growth phase of the disease to exponential, logistic, Richard's and delayed logistic models (Chowell et Nishiura et al. 2009 ). Since the number of cumulative cases for COVID-19, initially grows exponentially, but eventually slows and approaches a limit, the dynamics is qualitatively similar to that of a logistic curve.\nThus, we estimate the growth rate of COVID-19 for the first 'wave' for each country using the least-squares fitting method.\nAs previously mentioned, and briefly over-viewed, several studies have performed various analyses with the objective of identifying predictors of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the response of the different countries to the pandemic. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation has assessed all the variables in a whole picture, whereas it can be expected that there is a subtle and complex interplay among the various parameters.\nMoreover, it has not been done in a systematic way at the global level, utilizing a crosscountry approach. As such, we aim at analysing how the implementation of NPI as well as climatic, social, and demographic variables affected the growth rate of COVID-19, to shed light on the covariates which may have a larger influence on the initial growth and should therefore be investigated further at both the global and national/sub-national scales. This work is not meant to be exhaustive or definitive, but rather to help reveal baseline epidemiological differences across countries, shape the direction of further research on COVID-19 and potential future outbreaks, and understand infectious disease transmission in general."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": "the rate of change in cumulative cases of a logistic growth model to daily confirmed cases data obtained from Our World in Data Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases dataset using the least-squares fitting method. We chose a logistic model because mechanistic models (like compartmental ones, such as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Removed or SIR model and its variants) require a complex parametrization procedure, which is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, especially during the early phases of a pandemic, due to the lack of detailed data. Phenomenological models, instead, being data-driven, do not suffer from such shortcomings. Moreover, among the four most commonly employed phenomenological models (namely, exponential, Richards, logistic and delayed logistic models), the logistic one More in detail, in the logistic model, the cumulative number of cases c(t) is assumed to satisfy the following equation:\nWhere K is the epidemic size which c(t) approaches, r is the speed of the epidemic growth J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (the response variables). Solving this, we have that: We truncate all time series on the day with the highest daily count, because some countries have lingered near peak daily count for much longer than a logistic growth model would predict, which would pull the model peak later than the actual date of peak incidence and thereby underestimate r. We included all countries with at least a 6-day period of at least 30 daily cases as of April 23, 2020, after truncating at the peak.

The current study aimed at investigating all variables altogether at a global level, using a systematic and reproducible approach. However, despite these strengths, the present study suffers from a number of limitations that should be properly acknowledged.\nThe major shortcoming is given by the assumption of a constant growth rate, whereas it has been widely acknowledged that the growth rate of COVID-19 changes over time, which could be affected by various epidemiological, social, economic, and NPI factors, resulting in a change of the growth rate over time for different countries. Future studies should replicate the present findings utilizing time-varying values of the growth rate.\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Based on available data and the results obtained, NPI put in place by governments around the world alone may not explain the initial growth rate of COVID-19, whereas demographic, climatic, and social variables play a greater role in the initial growth rate of the virus, although restrictions on international movement relative to other NPI had a relative significance in terms of the growth rate.
