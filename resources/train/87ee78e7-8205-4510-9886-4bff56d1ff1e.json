[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Since the first discovery of coronavirus in domestic poultry in the 1930s, to date various novel coronaviruses strains have been often reported causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and neurologic diseases in animals, including humans [1 -3] . The earlier human-infected coronavirus strains such as NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43 are known to be associated with mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses. While the three major human infected coronaviruses viz., the SARS-CoV-1 of 2002 popularly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [5] , the 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [6] and the new SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the current pandemic that was first identified in Wuhan City (China) in 2019 [7, 8] , are associated with a high rate of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this pandemic as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 th of January 2020 [9] . All these three coronaviruses belong to the betacoronavirus genera of the coronaviridae family [10] , with a genome size of approximately 30 Kb [11] . Comparative genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences exhibited 79.5% and 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and SARSr-CoV-RaTG13 strain originated from bats, respectively. Thus, indicating its partial similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and bats as the most probable host organism [12] . Further, high sequence-structure conservation noted between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 genomes, speculated that they have a common ACE2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) [13] . Moreover, in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has relatively higher contagiousness and morbidity (with a R o value ranging from 2.2 -3.77); but a lower mortality rate (3.4%) [14, 15] .\nThe four major structural glycoproteins responsible for coronavirus pathogenesis in the host are (i)Spike (S), (ii)Membrane (M), (iii) Nucleocapsid (N) and, (iv)Envelope (E) proteins ( Figure 1 ) [16] . Particularly, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) region of the S protein facilitates the viral entry into the host cells via binding to the receptor, ACE2 [17, 18] , triggering a cascade of multiple events initiating the fusion of both viral and host membranes. [19] . Earlier studies on vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have identified that the RBD region of the S protein on the virus surface is the target for ideal vaccine development, as it reduces host immunopotentiation and generates neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus [20] [21] [22] . Many SARS-CoV-1 vaccines have been in the advanced stage of development and tested using various animal models [23] . Although these vaccines showed encouraging results in animal models, only a few of them have reached the initial phase I clinical trials before the next round of funding dried up. Nonetheless, virus eradication was possible through preventive measures and social distancing [23] .Due to the absence of clinically approved vaccines against coronavirus, the COVID-19 disease has J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 | P a g e created a global menace to public health while the spread of the virus infection is continuing across the globe.\nAccess to multiple coronaviruses genome sequences now provides abundant opportunities for the application of bioinformatics approaches to unravel the evolutionary origin of new strains and the mechanism of viral entry and pathogenesis in the host. A study performed in this direction by Pachetti et al. has identified the genomic hotspots that are likely to mutate easily by carrying out genome alignment of 220 sequences from coronavirus isolates across several countries. With this prior knowledge, they hypothesized that the occurrence of such transformations might determine the variation in the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infected people in different geographic regions [25] . Another recent study, using an integrated network approach by combining protein-protein interaction and SARS-CoV-2/Human Interactome, has shed light on the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 by finding out the mechanism of host interaction [26] . Besides, sequence information, the availability of crystal structures in RCSB PDB (Protein Data Bank) of SARS-CoV-1 (PDB Id: 2GHV) [27] and SAR-CoV-2 S proteins complexed with ACE2 receptors (PDB Id: 6M0J) [28] have identified the conserved residues responsible for the host receptor-binding in SARS-CoV-2 based on comparative sequence-structure similarity against SARS-CoV-1 [29, 30] . Furthermore, using a computational approach the probable host range of SARS-CoV-2 has been predicted by analyzing the conserved amino acid properties located within the binding site interface [30 -32] . Moreover, by employing molecular docking and dynamics simulation approach, the interaction of human SARS-CoV-2 E protein with various phytochemicals has been analyzed, which might be utilized as potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 [33] .While in silico approaches using immunoinformatic tools and databases are now indispensable in the search of potential immunogenic targets for drug and vaccine development and also have been demonstrated successfully in diseases like HIV-1 [34] and cancer [35 -37] , its application in the identification of potential vaccine candidates against coronaviruses is just beginning to emerge in the last few years [38] .Recently, few studies using immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology approach have identified promiscuous T-cell and B-cell epitopes as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 which may excite cellular and humoral immune response [39 -42] . Using similar bioinformatics methods, an epitope-based vaccine construct was suggested based on linear amino acid motifs which are found to be conserved in a wide range of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 [43] . Similarly, using known immunogenic epitopes from the SARS-CoV-1 genome available on IEDB and ViPR immunology databases, homologous amino acids present at the equivalent position in SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed for vaccine design [44] . These studies conclusively highlight the potential utility of the next-generation bioinformatics approaches in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 | P a g e providing greater insights into coronavirus genome structure and molecular mechanism of viral pathogenesis in the host organism.\nTo further accelerate the ongoing experimental studies, various bioinformatics databases, tools, and web servers have been recently developed which systematically stores various genomic, epidemiology, and biological data pertinent to coronaviruses. These publicly available comprehensive resources can also be applied as platform tools for deriving useful information from complex and large datasets scattered across different databases. Therefore, in the present review for the first time, various computational resources have been discussed along with the integrated features they provide specifically for coronavirus research.\nWe have categorized these popular tools and databases depending on the utility and application such as for the detection of coronavirus, comparative genomics analysis, vaccine and drug discovery, molecular docking, and other applications in coronaviruses study ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). This review will certainly constitute an important resource for experimental biologists, immunologists, vaccinologists, and computational biologists across the globe to spur R&D efforts on designing strategies to combat COVID-19 disease. identification and characterization of coronaviruses [66] , nevertheless the high mutation rates in the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge for the efficiency of available assays [67] . In with information on its target type, techniques, target, sequence, genomic region, and detection protocol, diversity study at a genetic level across the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and a quick guide to perform laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2.Users can retrieve an oligonucleotide with a specific CoV2ID score by browsing through the search tab or can manually design a novel oligonucleotide under the \"Genome variation\" of the database."}, {"section_title": "Resources for Host-Pathogen Genomics analysis", "text": "The necessity of achieving an urgent solution for the ongoing pandemic has led to the sequencing of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
