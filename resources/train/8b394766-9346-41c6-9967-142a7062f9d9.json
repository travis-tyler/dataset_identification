[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "These Web Tables focus on the experiences of 2015-16 bachelor's degree recipients 1 year after completing their degree. The data are from the 2016/17 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:16/17), a nationally representative, longitudinal sample survey of students who earned a bachelor's degree during the 2015-16 academic year. B&B:16/17, the first follow-up, was conducted in 2017, about 1 year after the respondents earned their bachelor's degrees.

Samples drawn for such NCES studies as B&B are not simple random samples; therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling errors cannot be applied to these data. PowerStats takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by PowerStats involves approximating the estimator by replication of the sampled population using a bootstrap technique. With PowerStats, users can replicate or expand on the tables presented here. The output from PowerStats includes the table estimates (e.g., percentages or means), the designadjusted standard errors, and weighted sample sizes for the estimates. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), PowerStats prints the double dagger symbol ( \u2021) instead of the estimate."}, {"section_title": "VARIABLES USED", "text": "The variables used in these Web Tables are listed below.
