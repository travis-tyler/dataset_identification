[{"section_title": "", "text": "How have the demographics of PhD graduates changed from those in earlier decades? Have highly selective PhD producing universities maintained their share of science and engineering PhDs or have newer institutions and programs increased their proportion of doctorates? Do most science and engineering PhDs matriculate at the most prestigious colleges and universities or do recent PhD graduates come from a wider set of baccalaureate programs? Has there been a shift in the bachelor's origins of science and engineering PhDs from the larger most selective colleges and universities to the smaller but still most selective liberal arts colleges? This paper uses data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) to examine these questions about the origins of new US-trained science and engineering PhDs in 2000 compared to earlier decades. The data document a significant shift in the demographic origins of new UStrained science and engineering PhDs from US born white males to women, minorities, and foreign-born persons They show that the proportion of PhDs from less selective doctoral programs and universities has increased noticeably. The data also show that the number of bachelor's graduates earning science and engineering PhDs from the most selective liberal arts colleges increased modestly relative to the number earning PhDs from the selective research universities. Still, both the number and proportion of bachelor's graduates obtaining science and engineering PhDs are bigger at the research universities"}, {"section_title": "The New Demography of US trained science and engineering PhDs", "text": "PhD graduates from US universities in the early 2000s differ markedly from the graduates three or four decades earlier. In the 1960s and early 1970s the vast majority of PhDs graduating in the sciences and engineering from US universities were native born white males. In 2000, native born white males were a distinct minority of graduates. Figure 1 shows the decline in the native born male share of PhDs. In 1966, 71% of PhD graduates were US-born males; 1 6% were US-born females; and 22.5% were foreign born students. In 2000, 36% of PhD graduates were US-born males; 25.4% were US born females; and 38.9% were foreign-born. In addition, the graduates obtaining science and engineering PhDs in 2000 are older than earlier cohorts of PhDs. In 1966, the median age of a science and engineering PhD was 30. In 2000 the median age of a science and engineering PhD was 32. Measured by mean ages, the aging of new graduates was even greater: in 1966 the mean age of a PhD graduate was 31.5 years; in 2000 the mean age was 33.9. The upward trend in the foreign-born share of US science and engineering PhDs did not occur smoothly. Figure 2 shows that the foreign proportion of US trained PhDs rose gradually from the 1960s through 1980 and then increased sharply to the mid 1990s, leveling off at about 40%. To see whether foreign born PhDs come largely from US baccalaureate backgrounds or receive their undergraduate training overseas, we tabulated the location of undergraduate degrees of foreign-born PhDs. These statistics show that the vast majority of foreign-born PhDs obtained foreign bachelor's degrees. The late 1980s-early 1990s jump in the foreign-born share of PhDs, in particular, came primarily from students educated overseas. Still, there was a substantial increase in the proportion of US science and engineering PhDs granted to foreign born students with US bachelor's education. From 1958From to 1968 The 71% figure in 1966 for males refers to \"non-minority males\", which we assume that the foreign-born have become a majority of graduates in some disciplines, including branches of engineering, while increasing in all fields. Among US citizens, there has also been a substantial upward trend in the proportion of PhDs granted to minorities -Asian and Pacific Islanders, blacks, and Hispanics. The US minority proportion of all PhDs has risen from less than 3% in 1966 to 9% in 2000. and engineering PhDs also reflects a 37% drop in the number of US citizen white males gaining PhDs from 1973, when 12,518 white men earned science and engineering PhDs, through 2000, when 7829 white men earned science and engineering PhDs 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation", "text": "The demography of PhD production reflects the decisions of students, PhD granting institutions, and undergraduate institutions, influenced by government stipend and R and D policies and by the labor market for scientists/engineers and other high level occupations. On the student side, the changed demographic composition of PhD graduates presumably reflects differential economic incentives to earn PhDs compared to other career alternatives. Foreign born students, particularly those with foreign bachelor's degrees can often earn much more from a US doctorate than from working in other careers in their native country, in part because the science and engineering doctorate opens the door to working in the US or working for US and other multinational firms. Since American students have diverse other US educational prospects, such as medical school, law school, business school, and can work as a scientist/engineer or college graduate without a PhD, they have less incentive to invest in a science and engineering PhD than otherwise comparable foreign-born bachelor's graduates. Equally important, increases in the number of young persons earning bachelor's degree overseas has increased the potential supply of bright students to science and engineering in the US as well as in the students' native countries. By contrast, there is no clear explanation why women and minorities have chosen science and engineering PhDs in increasing numbers while fewer white men have gone on to earn ---science and engineering PhDs. US born women and minorities enter the same job market as white men, so these patterns cannot readily be attributed to markedly different market opportunities. One possible explanation is that opportunities outside science and engineering for women and minorities are sufficiently worse to make earning a PhD financially more attractive to them. Given flows of women and minorities into medical and law schools and observed earnings patterns, this cannot be much of the story, however. Another possibility is that the influx reflects an adjustment in the flow of women and minorities toward a previously unattainable \"equilibrium\" share of degrees. This explanation predicts that relatively more women and minorities will invest in PhD programs than will white males at the same earnings opportunities as those facing white men until the share of women and minorities among PhD scientists and engineers reaches approximate parity with their share of college graduates. At that point, the flows of women and minorities into science and engineering PhDs would presumably follow the same pattern as the flows of white male PhD graduates."}, {"section_title": "Who Produces PhDs?", "text": "The number of universities and programs has increased substantially. Between 1960 and 2000, the US university sector \"produced\" an increasing number of Calculations that simply ignore these respondents give results similar to those in the figures. PhDs in science and engineering. There were 6,520 science and engineering PhDs in 1960;18,052 in 1970;17,775 in 1980;22,868 in 1990 and25,951 in 2000. A priori, the increased number of PhDs could have come from increased PhD production at the larger leading universities; from proportional increases in degrees among all PhD granting universities; or from increases in the number of degrees from universities with smaller or less prestigious programs or with newly formed programs. Our analysis shows that the growth of science and engineering PhDs in the US was fueled by an expansion of degrees from smaller, lower quality institutions rather than from increased numbers of graduates from elite universities. Table 1 present the data for this conclusion. It shows how the distribution of science and engineering PhDs changed over time along the specified dimensions. The columns \"by number of doctoral degrees\" give the distribution of degrees by the number of PhDs granted. They show that the proportion of PhDs granted by the ten largest PhD granting institutions fell from 24.1% in 1970 to 16.7% in 2000; that the proportion of the next largest fifteen PhD producers fell from 21.6% to 17.5%; while the proportion of the next 15 largest producers fell by 0.9 percentage points. As a summary of the overall concentration of science and engineering PhDs among large PhD producing universities, we calculated the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of concentration (HHI in table 1). This index is the sum of squares of the proportions of degrees given by each degree granting institution It is a standard measure of concentration in industrial organization, used for instance by the US Department of Justice. 2 Analysts of industrial organization consider markets in which the index is between 1000 and 1800 points to be moderately concentrated, and those in which the index exceeds 1800 points to be concentrated. From this perspective, the drop in the index for PhD granting universities from 123 to 78.7 ---2 See www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/testimony/hhi.htm implies that PhD-production went from moderately concentrated to highly competitive. The columns labeled \"Carnegie classification of institutions of higher education\" in Table 1 use the Carnegie Foundation's well-established taxonomy of higher education institutions 3 to divide them into three groups: leading research universities; doctoral universities that grant at least 20 degrees in any field or 10 or more in three fields, but which did not fit the criterion for being a research university; and all other institutions. The data shows a drop in the proportion of degrees from the research universities, and corresponding increases in the proportion of degrees from doctoral universities and other institutions. The next set of columns in Table 1, labeled \"number of high quality programs\" classifies universities by the number of PhD programs that attained high rankings in the National Research Council rankings for 1982. These columns show a decrease in the share of PhD production in universities with 10 or more and with 3 to 10 high quality programs, and a rise in the proportion of science and engineering PhDs from universities with no top program. In sum, the increase in science and engineering PhDs in the US largely took the form of expansion of smaller and less prestigious programs. Between 1966 and 2000 over 2/3rds of the nearly 15,000 increase in the number of PhDs granted in the sciences and engineering occurred ---3 http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/Classification/CIHE2000/background.htm among institutions below the top PhD producers, while 83% of the growth occurred among universities with few high quality programs 3 . This pattern of expansion in smaller and lower quality institutions contrasts with pattern of growth in many other sectors of the economy where large enterprises dominate markets and where increases in production typically come from those large firms (automobiles, steel, software). The simplest economic story for why the higher education sector expanded PhD production by developing new or small PhD programs rather than by major research universities increasing their doctorate programs is that the cost schedule for producing PhDs is very inelastic, due to capacity constraints set by faculty, plant, or other characteristics of existing programs. This contrasts with potential increasing returns to scale (at least up to much larger production) in many other sectors. Expansion of PhD production through lower quality doctorate programs may also, however, reflect the US system of financing higher education. In the public sector, legislatures may be willing to fund a new PhD program in their state universities, but not to support the education of students from their state at a program in some rival state. In the private sector, institutions may find it easier to raise funds to improve the quality of existing programs rather than to develop a \"clone institution\" at some other location."}, {"section_title": "Who Gets PhDs Where?", "text": ". Have the growing number of foreign-born and female PhDs obtained their degrees in the same doctoral institutions as US born men, or are they disproportionately represented in the smaller or less prestigious universities? To answer this question, we calculated the distribution of PhDs among US-born men, foreign-born persons, and US born women at universities with 3 or more top rated PhD programs and at universities included in the top 40 PhD granting programs in term of degrees granted. 4 We then compared the representation of these groups at these universities to their representation among all PhDs in 1973 and 2000. or more high quality PhD programs and in large PhD producing universities. This means that the drop in male science and engineering PhDs occurred disproportionately at less prestigious The 40 largest PhD universities produce 50-60% of PhDs, according to table 1. Tabulating smaller PhD granting institutions. For foreign born students the relative representation ratios in universities with 3 or more high quality PhD programs and in large PhD producing universities exceeded 1.00 in 1973 and remained above 1.0 in 2000, which implies that the huge increase in their shared of PhDs occurred with little fall in the quality of universities where they earned their PhDs. The situation for women is quite different. As their share of science and engineering PhDs increased, the relative representation in high quality and large PhD granting universities fell. In 1973 women were slightly less likely to obtain a PhD at these universities than other demographic groups. In 2000 women were much less likely to obtain a PhD in the higher quality and larger universities than other demographic groups. There are several possible explanations for why the increase in female science and engineering PhDs occurred disproportionately at less prestigious smaller PhD granting institutions. One possibility is that women enrolled in smaller newer PhD programs because those programs specialized in biological science areas which were particularly attractive to women. Another possibility is that women were more geographically limited in their choice of PhD programs than men or the foreign-born because of family issues. It is also possible, however, that women had difficulty gaining admission to the most prestigious and larger programs. We have not examined these or other possible causes for the disproportionate growth of female science and engineering PhDs in the lower quality and smaller universities."}, {"section_title": "Baccalaureate Origins of PhDs", "text": "Some colleges and universities produce relatively large numbers of students who go on to  (1970, 1976, 1987, and 1994) classified institutions of higher education by the range of programs and/or degrees offered, enrollment size, and amount of Federal funds received for research. We use the 1994 Carnegie Classification to study the baccalaureate origins of scientists and engineers who recently received their doctorate from U.S. institutions.   in \"own-PhDs\" is not limited to those institutions. Taking all PhD-granting institutions in the flow matrix, we find that the percentage of PhDs granted to persons with a baccalaureate from the same school fell from 14% to 10%, on average."}, {"section_title": "Destinations of Bachelor's Graduates", "text": "We examine next the distribution of bachelor's graduates among doctorate granting universities -the rows of the [A ij ] matrix. For each of the bachelor's origin -PhD destination groupings in table 4, we calculated the conditional probability that graduates from a given type of bachelor's institution earned a PhDs at the specified types of universities. Table 6 summarizes our tabulations. Each statistic in the table gives the percentage of science and engineering PhDs from the bachelor's source category who earned their PhD in the destination doctorate category. The probabilities that a bachelor's graduate earned their PhD in the specified destination category are lower in all cases in 1995-99 than in 1970-74. This shows that graduates from large bachelor's origin schools, from research institutions, and from selective bachelor's programs were less likely to obtain their PhD at major or high quality PhD universities over time. Graduates from the best bachelor's programs were more dispersed among PhD programs in 1995-99 than they were in 1970-74. Finally, we have tabulated the number of science and engineering PhDs from the most selective four year institutions using the Barron's categorization, and divided the institutions into two groups: small liberal arts schools (such as Oberlin) and large research universities (such as Harvard). During the weak job market for bio-science PhDs in the 1990s (Freeman, et al, 2001), some academics and university administrators worried that undergraduates at leading research institutions were not pursuing bio-science careers because they observed first-hand the difficult economic conditions facing the post-docs and graduate students in science labs. By contrast, equally able and interested students at liberal arts colleges were reported to be pursuing bio-    1 9 5 8 1 9 6 0 1 9 6 2 1 9 6 4 1 9 6 6 1 9 6 8 1 9 7 0 1 9 7 2 1 9 7 4 1 9 7 6 1 9 7 8 1 9 8 0 1 9 8 2 1 9 8 4 1 9 8 6 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 2 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 8 2 0 0 0 Foreign-born with US bachelors Foreign-born with Foreign Bachelors    "}]
