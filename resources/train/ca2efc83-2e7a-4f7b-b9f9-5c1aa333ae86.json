[{"section_title": "", "text": "To develop a proper treatment and prevent COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from COVID-19 patients and its structure was identified 6 . The genetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is largely similar to previously emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) 7 . For instance, the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 displays the 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV and both viruses target human alveolar epithelial cells with high specific binding simultaneously used for treatment of COVID-19. For instance, although chloroquine and remdesivir, recent the most popular drugs, have broad-spectrum antiviral effects and are currently utilized to treat COVID-19, however their effectiveness and mechanisms have been is currently under debate 9, 10 . Concisely, ritonavir and lopinavir used as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are also combined with appropriate interferons in the treatment of COVID-19 7 , ribavirin may has potential for the treatment of COVID-19 owing to its approved antiviral activity towards respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), SARS and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) infections 11, 12 . However, all chemical drugs mentioned here exhibit some side effects and their effective antiviral activity to SARS-CoV-2 and pharmaceutical mechanisms have been not clearly documented yet.\nFrom ancient days to today, people have consumed plants not only as food but also a medicine for viral infections owing to their secondary metabolites long while their mechanism of action is not well elucidated yet.\nLaboratory studies have demonstrated that plants as \"called herb medicines\" have protected people from various infectious diseases with a variety of ways including boosting immune system, degradation of virus nucleotides for inhibiting the replication and prevention of virus entry to host cells 13, 14 . For instance, during outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, various plants have been benefited to treat the virus infected patients. And they successfully inhibited virus replication and virus entry [15] [16] [17] [18] .\nWe mainly focus on the discussion on food and supplements, Curcuminoids and Zinc, which Today, number of COVID 19 cases and mortality rate especially in the elderly and chronic disease group has been increasing day after day owing to aggressive infection of SARS-CoV-2.\nConsidering the increase in Zn deficiency in the elderly population and some chronic diseases, perhaps Zn replacement as a part of routine treatment to these patients seem to be a suitable option to both support the normal immune response and benefit from the antiviral effects of Zn 36 . Zn deficiency affects both the natural and acquired immune system which can be boosted with inflammatory response, is required for SOCS-3 expression and a Zn-mediated mechanism is also needed to limit the inflammatory response 31 . Therefore, Zn may also be important in suppressing the excess inflammatory response."}, {"section_title": "Inhibition of Entry into the Host Cell", "text": "It is reported that curcumin has antiviral activity with multi-mechanisms [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] 52, 53 . Then, binding affinity of the virus to ACE-2 receptor though S-Protein is affectively speculated and SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked."}, {"section_title": "Inhibition of Viral Replication", "text": "RNA viruses form endosomal double membrane vesicles (DMV) structures during their proliferation in the host cell. Hereby, they transcribe mRNA and Genomic RNAs in RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity 54 . In this process, both RdRp enzyme and new generation transcripts will be protected from antiviral defense systems in cytoplasm 54 . Unlike other RNA viruses, numerous DMVs in coronavirus-infected cells bind to each other to form modified broad folded areas, including ER 55 . The curcumin can be attached to RdRp (Figure 1 Step 3) and as well as to dRNA (formed during the genomic transcription (Figure 1 Step 4) of new generation virions) thanks to polyphenol structure, thereby enables the activation of cellular signaling pathways such as apoptosis (Figure 1 Step 8) 56 . There are other mechanisms that increase the chances of curcumin being effective in COVID-19 therapy. Curcumin is effective in inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo biosynthesis of guanin nucleotides during viral replication 57 . In addition, a study using Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), an enveloped virus such as SARS-CoV-2, has been explored to irreversibly inhibit plaque formation in enveloped viruses 58 .\nZn supplementation is important in systemic antiviral response as well as specifically inhibiting viral replication 59 . It is worth to mention that it has been previously shown that zinc can inhibit SARs-CoV RNA polymerase 60 "}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "Journal Pre-proof ( Figure 1 Step 3) and led to reduction in template binding 55 . Furthermore, halting the RNA replication of different RNA viruses were also achieved zinc and zinc ionophores [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] .\nIt should be kept in mind that recent study has revealed a conserved, but cryptic epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV which suggest the antiviral compounds which has activity against SARS-CoV might show activity against SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "An Ion Carrier for Fighting SARS-CoV-2: Curcumin-Zinc Ionophore", "text": "The recent work proposed that zinc ionophore (pyrithione) could be much more effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication compared to Zn itself owing to its low cellular uptake. Curcumin acts as natural zinc ionophores and can promote the cellular uptake of zinc and can be used with zinc to increase the effectiveness of these compounds in the inhibition of the virus.\nZnT transporters are known to function as Zn 2+ / H + modifiers, transporting Zn from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space or intracellular compartments 68 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Perspectives", "text": "Clinical studies have suggested that curcumin, zinc and zinc-ionophores have great potentials for their antiviral activities towards viral infections. Hence these food supplements can be used as "}]
