Seamless changes in the AD continuum take years if not decades to progress from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with gradual evolution of clinically probable AD to confirmed AD [1] [2] [3] . Early detection and accurate diagnosis of AD require careful medical assessment, including patient history as well as physical and neurological examinations. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a 30-point questionnaire [4] [5] [6] , is a brief cognitive assessment tool commonly used to screen for dementia, and the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical memory (LM) test is widely used to assess verbal memory and is considered a sensitive test of AD [7] .\nNeuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown to provide biologic evidence that cognitive decline is neurodegenerative [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , as they contain detailed information regarding the subcortical structures, good contrast of the gray matter, and the integrity of the brain tissue. Specifically, it is known that changes including cortical damage, focal lesions, and gray matter loss in the occipital, parietal, prefrontal, and temporal lobes can be understood using MRI scans [23] . Cortical atrophy is closely related to dementia and cognitive decline. For example, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is considered as a variant of AD in some studies [24] [25] [26] [27] , and this might spread to other brain regions that are commonly damaged in AD patients [28] . Brain MRI scans are characterized as complex, unstructured data structures and thus require sophisticated means by which to perform efficient, quantitative analysis. Although the diagnostic and psychometric strengths and limitations of neuropsychological tests and MRI scans have been tried and tested, there is a limited body of work that has attempted to understand the cumulative impact of combining these data sets for diagnosis of MCI.\nMachine learning techniques have been widely used over the past few years for the analysis of biomedical imaging data and nonimaging data. More recently, a machine learning framework known as deep learning, which is based on artificial neural networks, has received increased attention because of its remarkable success in predicting various clinical outcomes of interest. In subspecialties that rely on imaging data, scientists have developed convolutional neural network (CNN) models, which are efficient deep learning techniques for object recognition and classification [29] . CNN models have proven ability to detect patterns within image data sets and predict corresponding outputs for common tasks such as classification with superior accuracy. Inside a CNN, a series of filters, with a size equivalent to a small image patch, automatically search through the whole image to find similar spatial features of the image. These filters can be learned and independently updated, so that a collection of them can detect critical information for a specific task and data set. Such approaches can be used in a relatively straightforward fashion to train deep learning models on 2D MRI scans. Other forms of deep neural networks based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture can be used to train nonimaging data sets such as the ones based on the MMSE and LM test results. Although these models can be informative on their own, a framework to combine all these models and the information contained therein will enhance their clinical utility. Fusion of similar forms of data has been previously performed to improve the prediction for the diagnosis of cognitive status. For example, different image projections, for example, axial, sagittal, and coronal, were combined to generate a unified model that was associated with MCI [30] . Structural MRI was also combined with positron emission tomography for similar purposes [31] [32] [33] . However, there is a limited body of work that has investigated how to efficiently combine MRI data with other nonimaging data sets such as the ones derived from the MMSE and LM tests.\nThe ability to efficiently distinguish individuals with MCI from the ones who have NC is crucial within the realm of early detection of AD, as the changes that need to be captured may only be subtle. Our hypothesis is that combining structural information derived from neuroimaging data and functional information derived from wellknown screening tools and cognitive assessment methods can result in a better combined metric of diagnosing MCI."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Our goal was to create a predictive model of MCI by considering detailed structural and anatomic information contained within the MRI images as well as cognitive function assessed using the MMSE and LM tests. We first developed three individual machine learning models, one using MRI scans alone, another using only MMSE results, and third using only LM test results. Later, we combined the prediction of these models using majority voting, thus exemplifying multimodal data fusion."}, {"section_title": "Study participants and measures", "text": "Our proof-of-principle study was conducted using the data provided by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), which was established by the National Institute on Aging/NIH in 1999 to facilitate collaborative AD research. Specifically, we selected a cross-sectional collection of individuals from the NACC data set (Table 1) , with one MRI scan from each participant based on the following criteria: (1) participants were clinically diagnosed as either NC or MCI; (2) participants had both LM and MMSE test scores; (3) MRI scans with at least 20 slices were taken in the axial plane; (4) type of MRI was either T1 weighted or FLAIR as they both are fluid suppressed with dark cerebrospinal fluid and relative bright white and gray matter [15] ; and (e) dimension of each cross-sectional slice of the MRI (height or width) was about 256 pixels so as to make this slice amenable for training the machine learning model. This search resulted in the selection of 386 unique cases. Among them, there were 303 individuals who were diagnosed as NC and 83 individuals who were diagnosed as MCI (82 amnestic MCI and one nonamnestic MCI).\nEach of the 386 MRI scans had a variable number of 2D cross-sectional images (or slices), and the location and orientation of the brain within each scan were also different. To utilize each of these scans, we first grouped all 2D slices per participant in 20 bins and then selected the first 2D slice from each bin. We then manually selected a \"signature\" slice from the 20 slices for each scan merely based on highest similarity of anatomical features without knowing any information about clinical diagnosis that was going to be predicted. This \"signature\" slice was considered as slice 1 for modeling ( Fig. 1 ) and largely covered cross-sections of the occipital horn, frontal horn of lateral ventricle, and thalamus. The next two adjacent slices in the superior direction were selected as slice 2 and slice 3, respectively. As a result, the selected slices covered various regions including lateral ventricles, inferior temporal, and middle temporal cortices. All these anatomic areas were previously reported as regions of interest that correlated with AD and MCI [34] .\nWe selected three features including MMSEORDA (orientation subscale score-time), MMSEORLO (orientation subscale score-place), and NACCMMSE (total MMSE score) to generate a model based on MMSE results alone. A previous study has shown that MMSE orientation (e.g., time or place) was the domain with the largest extent of change over time in AD patients [35] , and two other studies found that MMSE orientation is impaired early in the disease process [36, 37] . Also, we selected all the features that are considered as part of the LM test to generate an LM test-based model. This includes LOGI-PREV (total score from the previous test administration), LOGIMEM (total number of story units recalled from this current test administration), MEMUNITS (total number of story units recalled), and MEMTIME (time elapsed since first recall to delayed recall). The numeric value of the data was derived from the NACC Uniform Data Set Researcher's Data Dictionary (version 3.0, March 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Training and validation of the MRI models", "text": "For each 2D MRI slice, we adapted the Oxford University's Visual Geometry Group's (VGG-11) model [38] , pretrained on millions of images with 1000 object classes by incorporating minor changes to fine-tune the framework and to associate MRI image features with the clinical diagnosis of cognitive status (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1 ). Specifically, we inserted the batch normalization layer after every convolutional layer and a dropout layer after every max pooling layer within the VGG-11 architecture. We also added two fully-connected (FC) layers after the output layer of VGG-11 to perform binary classification on the output of VGG-11 that formed the deep neural network. After the first newly added FC layer, we added a dropout layer with rectified linear unit activation, and a softmax function was applied on the second FC layer. A similar approach was developed on another well-known CNN architecture (VGG-16), where dropout layers were added to avoid model overfitting [39] .\nThe original data were split in 2:1:1 for training, validation, and testing. Care was taken to ensure that each split had the same proportion of NC and MCI cases. The original MRI slices were cropped to 224 ! 224 pixels and were normalized to 0 to 1 to make them compatible with the input requirements of the pretrained VGG-11 model. For completeness, we performed model training and testing 5 different times. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for each performance metric over the five iterations to demonstrate model behavior due to random splitting. We set the class-specific weighted cross-entropy as the loss function to be optimized through the stochastic gradient descent algorithm [40] . The explicit form of the loss function is as follows:\nwhere y _ i is the label of the i th scan, which takes value 0 if the i th scan is associated with NC and 1 if the i th scan is associated with MCI. y i and 12y i are the probabilities, predicted by the model, that the i th scan is associated with MCI or NC, respectively. The class-specific weights, w MCI and w NC , can be tuned as hyperparameters to alleviate the influence of data imbalance. The value of w MCI and w NC was set at 4 and 1, respectively, in our MRI models.\nWe performed model training using a transfer learning strategy, which is a well-known approach to train imagebased classification problems [41, 42] . We froze all the pretrained VGG-11 parameters and trained the externally added FC layers on the training data. During the training process, the parameters of the FC layers were saved when the F1 score calculated on the validation set was at maximum. Then, we performed fine-tuning of the deep neural network after the saved parameters of the two FC layers were loaded into the model. The network with highest F1 score on validation set was saved and used for testing. For the aforementioned two stages of training (training the FC layers and full network fine-tuning), we used a batch size of 20 using backpropagation with a gradient descent optimizer whose momentum was set to 0.9 and the learning rate was set to 0.05.\nBoth dropout and batch normalization layers can efficiently decrease the risk of overfitting and increase the model generalizability. During training, nodes in front of dropout layers were randomly deactivated by dropout according to the probability \"p\" [43] . Thus, only part of the model parameters selected randomly were updated by the gradient descent algorithm. With batch normalization, output from the previous layers of batch normalization was scaled and shifted by\nwhere x i is the i th element of the output, and m B and s 2 B are the mean and variance of x i calculated over a batch [44] . The scale parameter g and shift parameter b were learned through the training process along with other parameters within the model to reduce internal covariate shift and stabilize training process. Fig. 2 . Schematic of the modeling architecture. Three deep neural network models (VGG-11) were independently trained and tested on three slices, respectively. Max, mean, and majority voting were performed on the outputs of the three VGG-11 models. Predictions from the three voting methods were then combined by majority voting again to generate a fused MRI model. Two MLP models were independently developed on MMSE and LM test results, respectively. Finally, predictions from the three base models (MRI model, MMSE model, and LM model) were combined by applying another majority voting to generate a final prediction of multimodal fusion model.

The total MMSE score or delayed LM score does not contain all the available information within the MMSE and LM test results. Thus, we developed two independent MLP models taking into account the subscores within the MMSE and LM test, respectively, to predict MCI.\nBecause the input layer can have any number of nodes, we can take all available features from the MMSE and LM test to build MLP models for MMSE and LM. The combination of linear transformation and nonlinear activation functions makes MLP a good choice that is capable of exploring complex underlying relationships between selected examination features and the diagnosis of MCI.\nBoth MMSE and LM models have one input layer in which the MMSE model has 3 nodes and LM model has 4 nodes, one hidden layer with 20 nodes and one output layer with two nodes. In addition, sigmoid and softmax nonlinear functions were added at the hidden layer and output layer, respectively. These models were trained using backpropagation with a gradient descent optimizer whose momentum was set to 0.9 with learning rate 0.05. Loss function used for training the models was the same as defined in Equation 2. The class-specific weights, w MCI and w NC , were set at 4 and 1 for LM model and was set at 5 and 1 for MMSE model, respectively. The model with the highest F1 score on validation set was saved during the training process and used to further evaluate performance on the testing set."}, {"section_title": "Model fusion and visualization of majority voting", "text": "The predictions from these trained VGG models were then combined using a series of voting approaches.

Mean voting takes the mean probabilities predicted from each modified VGG-11 model trained on the three slices as the final prediction defined as\nHere, P i NC and P i MCI are the probabilities predicted from the i th model that one specific scan belongs to NC or MCI, respectively.

Majority voting takes the label, NC or MCI, which was predicted for equal or more than 2 times as the final prediction. Then, using the fused MRI model based on the three independent 2D scans along with the MLP models generated with MMSE and LM test results, respectively, we performed majority voting to generate a multimodal fusion model to predict MCI.\nTo visualize and evaluate the performance of the multimodal fusion model, we also performed a subgroup analysis where cases were split into eight categories defined based on the predictions made by the fused MRI, MMSE, and LM model, respectively.

Similar model performances on the three slices indicate that the VGG-11 architecture was able to capture the nuances of the 2D image regions in a consistent fashion. Moreover, each image represented a unique location within the brain that presumably was able to correlate with the corresponding diagnosis with high accuracy. A series of voting techniques were performed to generate the consistent prediction from the MRI scans.

However, the MMSE and MRI models have their own strengths, such as higher recall value than that of the LM model. These differences highlight the power of each test, and the models are developed using individual tests alone. They also point to the importance of fusing these models so as to be able to gain additional insight on cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Multimodal fusion model", "text": "Given the predictions from the three base models, that is, the MRI model, the MMSE model, and the LM model, final prediction of the fusion model was performed using majority voting on the predictions of three base models (Fig. 6 , Table 3 ). Specifically, the accuracy of the multimodal fusion model outperformed each base model by 7.8%, 6.6%, and 1.8%, respectively. The predictive performance of the fused multimodal model outperformed that of the three base models in accuracy, recall, F1 score, and MCC. The precision of the fused multimodal model is slightly lower than that of the LM model.\nWe also performed a subgroup analysis to further evaluate the performance of the multimodal fusion model (Fig. 7) .

To avoid any overlap, each case was assigned a random location around the related cluster.

For example, cluster E denotes all cases where both the MRI and the LM models predicted the outputs as NC, but the MMSE model predicted the output to be MCI. But after majority voting, the multimodal fusion model predicted the NC label because 2 of 3 base models voted NC. Among the 21 cases that belonged to this category, majority voting made 18 right decisions by correcting the mistakes made by the MMSE model and 3 wrong deci- In summary, from the three base models developed on MRI scans, MMSE, and LM test results, respectively, we observed that the LM model outperformed the fused MRI model and MMSE model, as revealed by most performance metrics. However, the MMSE and MRI models both have higher recall value than the LM model based on our experiments. We then performed the model fusion using majority voting on the three base models, as this strategy carefully generated the best performing model whose predictive performance had higher accuracy, recall, F1 score, and MCC than what any of the single models could achieve by themselves (Fig. 7) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We explored the effectiveness of combining various forms of data with the underlying assumption that additional information can be gained from multiple data modalities to better assess MCI.

The core clinical criteria for AD and MCI will continue to be the cornerstone of the clinical diagnosis, but biomarker evidence is expected to improve the pathophysiological accuracy of the diagnosis in the research setting. One implication in the original criteria of AD dementia is that memory impairment is always the primary cognitive impairment in all patients. However, it is critical to examine cognitive domains in addition to memory that might be impaired. These cognitive domains include language, visuospatial skills, executive functions, and attentional control. Our motivation to combine the predictions from the MMSE model with the LM model is to comprehensively consider the cognitive impairment in various domains. Biomarkers can be used to assist and enhance the clinical diagnosis of AD and MCI. The progress of the gradual cognitive decline can happen along with a wide range of structural changes in the brain, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with language disorder and posterior cortical atrophy relevant to visual disability. However, considering MCI is not biomarker confirmed, we designed the deep learning model to explore the differences between participants with NC and MCI automatically from the data set. We expected the MRI model, carrying comprehensive structural information of the brain, can further push the diagnostic accuracy from MMSE and LM models to a superior level."}, {"section_title": "Data sets for model development", "text": "Compared with other brain MRI data sets, including Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), the NACC has its own strengths and limitations. The LM test provided well-validated verbal memory data that were sufficient for these proof-of-concept analyses. ADNI and OASIS use list learning tests for their measure of verbal memory, but the data present greater complexity for this type of analysis.

MRI scans included in ADNI and OASIS data sets were collected with consistent MRI settings, so that the size and contrast over different MRI scans are consistent. However, MRI scans in NACC data sets were collected from different NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the United States. The inconsistency of the MRI settings in different centers made the procedure of analyzing MRI scans more complicated. First, owing to the fact that the dimensions of MRI are all different, we could not apply automatic 3D brain registration techniques on those MRI scans whose number of slices ranges from 20 to more than 200. In addition, the inconsistency made developing 3D CNN on the NACC MRI data extremely challenging because the CNN model used in classification task needs to take fixed-sized data as input. To diagnose those with only limited slices within an MRI scan, fusion of 2D CNN models can be an interesting choice. Thus, we manually selected 3 slices from each scan based on anatomical landmarks to decrease the effect of misalignment, that is, inconsistent location and orientation of brains within each scan.

Many researchers indeed believe that we are just at the beginning stages of this revolution as more advances in data-learning technologies can profoundly impact the way we make use of biomedical data. Given the right infrastructure, deep learning algorithms are now arguably the primary choice for image-based classification of clinical phenotypes as they have shown to be more effective than using traditional machine learning models for these tasks [49, 50] . Significant progress has been made in the field of AD where both traditional machine learning and deep learning methodologies have been implemented to identify various patterns and perform segmentation within the brain as well as develop diagnostic models for accurate detection of clinical phenotypes. The traditional way of training CNN models requires large amounts of imaging data as there are thousands to millions of parameters that need to be estimated to obtain reasonably accurate predictions using them. This approach is not practically feasible to analyze neuroimaging data because only a limited number of labeled cases are generally available. Moreover, training a CNN model de novo with limited cases can easily lead to model overfitting. Therefore, we leveraged transfer learning that allowed us to fine-tune the weights of a pretrained deep neural network, thus making it practically viable to use deep learning for data sets with limited cases [41, 42] .\nWe observed that adding dropout and batch normalization layers between convolutional blocks efficiently stabilized and accelerated the training process. Because we were dealing with a slightly imbalanced data set (NC-MCI ratio: 3.65), the model can get stuck in local minima during training. Increasing the learning rate is typically one trick to avoid this issue, but naively increasing the learning rate without batch normalization can cause gradients to explode or even vanish [44] . Thus, we performed batch normalization, rescaled, and shifted the outputs between the intermediate layers within the deep neural network, to allow the model to get trained with large learning rate in a stable fashion. We also added dropout layers to overcome overfitting, as this technique is well known to improve the generalizability of the model [43] ."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations and future directions", "text": "Incorporating biomarkers into the diagnosis of MCI has some limitations. There are a broad set of biomarkers correlated with AD including b-amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, and cortical atrophy [47] . It is still not clear how to select a subset of biomarkers for specific diagnosis and how the information contained in these biomarkers should be collected and analyzed in a standardized fashion. Another limitation of this study is that we do not know whether the subjects diagnosed as MCI can be placed on the AD continuum because there is no confirmed biomarker for MCI due to AD. Moreover, it is known that Lewy body and cerebrovascular disease also cause impairment in cognition [47] .\nIn future, one could envision the use of MRI in conjunction with clinical core assessments to provide more specific and accurate diagnosis of AD and other non-AD-related dementias. Neurobiological changes in the brain occur years before symptoms of impaired cognition appear, and patients with similar clinical symptoms of MCI may have substantial heterogeneity in biomarkers [51] . Thus, it is important to detect early stages of cognitive impairment and predict the future direction of the disease toward various dementias. Ultimately, we envision development of diagnostic software that can be built based on the deep learning models to automatically analyze various types of data. Models based on each data modality may result in specific predictions with bounded accuracies, and approaches such as majority voting can help unify these findings and even enhance the overall diagnostic accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "By adding seemingly disparate information, such as MRI scans, to screening tools such as MMSE and neuropsychological examinations such as LM test, which are well known and widely used to detect MCI in aging individuals, performance of deep-learning models for MCI diagnosis can be greatly enhanced.

For these models to reach mainstream clinical practice for real-time assessment of MCI, they need to be evaluated on multiple cohorts in the form of retrospective data analysis as well as prospective trials.
