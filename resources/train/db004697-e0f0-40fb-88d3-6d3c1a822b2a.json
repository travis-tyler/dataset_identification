[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In a recent machine learning study classifying \"brain age\" based on cross-sectional neuroanatomical data, clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals were observed to show deviation from the normal neuromaturational pattern, which in turn was predictive of greater risk of conversion to psychosis and a pattern of stably poor functional outcome. These effects were unique to cases who were between 12 to 17 years of age when their prodromal and psychotic symptoms began, suggesting that neuroanatomical deviance observable at the point of ascertainment of a CHR syndrome marks risk for an early onset form of psychosis. In the present study, we sought to clarify the pattern of neuroanatomical deviance linked to this \"early onset\" form of psychosis and whether this deviance is associated with poorer premorbid functioning. T 1 MRI scans from 378 CHR individuals and 190 healthy controls (HC) from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS2) were analyzed. Widespread smaller cortical volume was observed among CHR individuals compared with HC at baseline evaluation, particularly among the younger group (i.e., those who were 12 to 17 years of age). Moreover, the younger CHR individuals who converted or presented worsened clinical symptoms at followup (within 2 years) exhibited smaller surface area in rostral anterior cingulate, lateral and medial prefrontal regions, and parahippocampal gyrus relative to the younger CHR individuals who remitted or presented a stable pattern of prodromal symptoms at follow-up. In turn, poorer premorbid functioning in childhood was associated with smaller surface area in medial orbitofrontal, lateral frontal, rostral anterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal regions.

Neuroanatomical deviance, as assessed using quantitative metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, has been suggested as potentially relevant to this goal. Several studies have observed a steeper rate of cortical thinning, particularly in heteromodal association regions, among clinical high-risk individuals (CHR) who convert to psychosis compared with those who do not convert and healthy controls (Borgwardt et al., 2008; Cannon et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2018; Pantelis, 2003; Sun et al., 2009 , Takahashi et al., 2009 .\nHowever, prior studies have obtained conflicting results as to whether individuals at CHR with poorer clinical and functional outcomes manifest measurable neuroanatomical deviance at the time of baseline evaluation (i.e. when help-seeking individuals were initially evaluated and met criteria for a psychosis-risk syndrome), as would be necessary if these measures are to have utility as predictive biomarkers (Borgwardt et al., 2007; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011; Mechelli et al., 2011; Pantelis et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2009; Velakoulis et al., 2006) .\nThe wide age range of CHR samples (typically, 12-35 years) represents a major challenge for elucidation of neuroanatomical markers predictive of psychosis, given that deviance on such measures is only ascertainable with respect to age-appropriate norms, and there are marked developmental changes in brain structure across this age span Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017) . Further, given the heterogeneity in the timing of potentially relevant risk exposures and age at onset of prodromal symptoms and subsequent psychosis, the degree to which CHR cases manifest neuroanatomical deviance may well depe nd on their age at evaluation.\nOther factors that likely contribute to the inconsistent findings of prior MRI studies of CHR"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "samples include the use of relatively small sample sizes and uneven application of statistical controls for multiple testing.\nTo overcome these limitations, we recently performed a machine-learning analysis of \"brain age\" using MRI measures in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2) sample (Chung et al., 2018) . A neuroanatomical-based age prediction model was developed using a supervised machine learning technique with T1 MRI scans from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study and then applied to NAPLS2 scans for external validation and clinical application Chung et al., 2018; Jernigan et al., 2016) .\nThe PING-derived model accurately predicted NAPLS healthy control subjects' chronological ages, providing evidence of independent, external validation. CHR individuals ascertained at younger ages (i.e., 12 to 17 years) were observed to show deviance from the normal neuromaturational pattern (i.e., a gap between \"brain age\" and chronological age), which in turn was associated with greater risk of conversion to psychosis and a pattern of stably poor functional outcome. In contrast, individuals who were 18 years of age or older showed agenormative neuroanatomical profiles at ascertainment (i.e., no gap between \"brain age\" and chronological age). A reevaluation of our prior findings showing a steeper rate of cortical thinning over time among CHR cases who converted to psychosis revealed that this effect was unique to the cases who were 18 years or older at ascertainment and did not apply to the younger cases (Cannon et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2018) . This pattern is consistent with the view that neuroanatomical deviance manifesting in early adolescence marks vulnerability to a form of psychosis with an insidious onset and debilitating course of illness, while accelerated cortical thinning marks vulnerability to a more acute onset form of illness that does not manifest until late adolescence and early adulthood.\nIn the present study, we address two additional issues concerning the \"early onset\" form of psychosis. First, we aim to determine whether neuroanatomical deviance in early adolescence is associated with poorer premorbid functioning during childhood, as would be expected if this pattern is associated with a more insidious onset. Second, we aim to clarify whether the neuroanatomical deviance associated with onset of psychosis in early adolescence is distributed in brain regions previously linked to schizophrenia, including superior, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, superior temporal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus (Borgwardt et al., 2007; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011; Mechelli et al., 2011; Pantelis et al., 2003) .\nAlthough the \"brain age\" approach can quantitatively assess deviations in brain maturation at the single subject level, a feature that makes it particularly useful for prediction purposes, the anatomical features selected by the algorithm are not necessarily indicative of risk for a particular disorder (Chung et al., 2018) . By design, the fitted model parameters are data-driven, characterizing the regularized maturation pattern among brain structures that tracks with variations in chronological age among typically developing individuals. In other words, this \"brain age\" composite metric is not optimized for detecting schizophrenia risk per se and would presumably be sensitive to any condition in which cases deviate from the normal pattern of agerelated neuroanatomical change during childhood/adolescence. Machine-learning algorithms trained to predict psychosis as an outcome could potentially yield a psychosis-specific pattern of neuroanatomical deviance (Koutsouleris et al., 2009) . However, in the NAPLS2 study, such models were found to perform poorly compared with the \"brain age\" classifier, probably because the structural brain changes related to psychosis onset occur against the backdrop of the gradual gray matter decline that is part of normative adolescent brain development and because heterogeneity in the pathways leading to full psychosis works against the accuracy of machine A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T learning algorithms trained on an outcome that treats all converters as exemplars of a unitary outcome class (Chung et al., 2018 ).\nHere we report the results of group contrasts of the baseline MRI data according to 2-year clinical outcome in the same NAPLS2 sample that was used in the brain age prediction study.\nThis analysis provides added value to the \"brain age\" prediction results in that it provides a more direct test of neuroanatomical changes associated with risk for psychosis and whether these effects are moderated by age at ascertainment and associated with poor premorbid adjustment.\nBased on the foregoing, we hypothesized that CHR individuals who are 17 years of age or younger would show smaller cortical volumes in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal areas. We also predicted that the younger CHR adolescents with persisting or worsening prodromal symptoms would show a greater degree of neuroanatomical deviance at baseline than those who are on the course of remission. We further hypothesized that the preexisting neuroanatomical deficits among younger CHR adolescents are associated with poorer premorbid functioning in childhood.\nMRI scanner reliability and the effectiveness of the statistical correction method implemented in this study to reduce scanner related variance were assessed using human traveling subjects data. Detailed information about the human traveling subjects, scanning equipment, and prior reliability study results are documented in previous publications (Cannon et al., 2013) . Briefly, each of these sites recruited one healthy subject (4 males, 4 females) between the ages of 20 and 31 (mean = 26.9, SD = 4.3), who was scanned twice on successive days at every site for a total of 128 scans (8 subjects x 2 scans x 8 sites). Scanning was conducted from May 4 through August 9 of 2011. There were no equipment or software changes at any of these sites during this period.\nReduced cortical thickness was observed in lateral occipital, pre-and post-motor regions, parietal cortex, and temporal cortices. As cortical volume is a composite measure of thickness and area at each vertex, many of the clusters with diminished cortical volume substantially overlapped with significant clusters revealed in surface area and cortical thickness maps.\nidentical set of analyses to our cohort that is grouped into CHR-C vs CHR-NC. The results are presented in the supplementary materials.\nolder CHR adolescents (cortical volume: F = 0.12, P = 0.91; surface area: F = 0.09, P = 0.76; cortical thickness: F = 1.53, P = 0.21, n = 261).\ndiscrepancies in the results may be due to differences in the strategy of recruitment (communitybased vs help-seeking), methodological differences in image processing, and demographic differences (age range). Nevertheless, given that both PNC and the NAPLS2 datasets have comparable sample size with an age range that encompasses early to mid-teenage years, the considerable overlap in regions showing cortical deficits in both cohort studies demonstrate manifestations of cortical abnormalities among individuals with attenuated symptoms of psychosis, especially among those who were ascertained in early adolescence.\nWe further investigated whether neuroanatomical deviance in early adolescence at the time of baseline evaluation is predictive of clinical outcome. While both better (CHRStable/Remitted) and poorer (CHR-Converted/Decline) clinical outcome group showed significant reduction in cortical indices compared to the healthy controls, regardless of their clinical outcome, the effect sizes of the poorer clinical outcome group were generally larger relative to the better outcome group. Within the CHR individuals, the group with poorer clinical outcomes showed significantly reduced surface area in superior, medial, and lateral prefrontal regions, rostral anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal gyrus compared with the better outcome group. This regional pattern is consistent with previous findings from at least two VBM studies, which have also reported gray matter volume loss in these brain regions among high-risk individuals who later developed psychosis compared with those who did not (Mechelli et al., 2011; Pantelis et al., 2003) . Performing a surface-based analysis in the present study further revealed that the volumetric differences from previous studies might be driven by surface areal deficits and that this neuroanatomical profile might underlie insidious onset form of psychosis.\nGiven that CHR individuals in both poorer and better outcome groups show cortical abnormalities, it does not appear that there is a critical threshold that could reliability determine\noutcome in terms of a discrete construct, hence the preexisting neuroanatomical deviance as a marker of vulnerability for psychosis should be best regarded as a continuum.\nReduced surface area in superior and medial frontal cortex, precuneus, rostral anterior cingulate, and temporal regions among individuals in early adolescence were associated with poorer premorbid functioning in childhood. Interestingly, reduced surface area in many of these overlapping regions were also predictive of poorer clinical outcome. As the cerebral cortex undergoes rapid surface areal expansion and folding during the pre and peri-natal period, disturbances during early brain development could exert persisting effects on the dynamic cascade of post-natal brain maturation (Raznahan et al., 2012; Rees & Inder, 2005; Smith et al., 2015; Walhovd et al., 2012) . Support for this view was observed in that normative variation of birth weight, which is a widely used proxy indicator of perinatal health, was robustly associated with surface area in widespread brain regions in typically developing individuals (Raznahan et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2012) . In the context of schizophrenia, adult patients with history of obstetric complications such as intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) or fetal hypoxia manifested greater structural brain abnormalities (Cannon et al., 2002; van Erp et al., 2002) . In particular, recent studies suggest that previously reported gray matter volumetric differences associated with obstetric complications among schizophrenia patients is better explained by smaller cortical surface area, rather than cortical thickness (Haukvik et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2015) . Therefore, although we do not have prospective information of early life risk factors, such as objective records of obstetric history, for the NAPLS2 sample, it is plausible based on the prior literature that alterations in surface area among younger CHR adolescents may reflect manifestations of early neurodevelopmental insults. The mechanism behind the specificity of surface area deficits, which are predominantly observed in heteromodal association regions, is unclear; in the context of brain development, it could be that the developmental processes in\nphylogenically newer areas (higher-ordered association cortices) are more vulnerable to early life disturbances than the older regions (lower-order somatosensory and visual cortices) or it could be that neural insults specific to these regions during early brain development become a risk factor for psychosis (as opposed to other kinds of neuropsychiatric outcomes).\nConversely, cortical thickness was not associated with premorbid functioning, suggesting that developmental factors that shape cortical thickness may be less sensitive to early life risk factors. Alterations in cortical thickness measures in younger CHR adolescents were generally observed in primary motor, sensory or in the posterior regions; parts of the brain that have been identified to mature earlier than higher order association areas in structural brain MRI measures (Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017) . Non-linear monotonic decrease in cortical thickness that extends from childhood to early adulthood is thought to be a composite signal of numerous normal neuromaturational processes such as synaptic pruning, dendritic retraction and intracortical myelination (Catts et al., 2013; Huttenlocher, 1979; Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 1997; Walhovd et al, 2016) . In reflection of these normal brain maturational events, the rate of cortical thinning in the unimodal and the posterior regions reaches its peak in childhood, whereas cortical thinning in the associative and anterior regions typically extends through mid to late adolescence. Given that the spatiotemporal sequences of the cortical maturational pattern are highly regularized, reduced cortical thickness in the lower-order cortices in relation to psychosis risk may be a result of abnormal neuromaturational events or a disease process that co-occurs in the order in which these regions mature (i.e. starting with lower ordered posterior regions and continuing up to anterior associative regions). As another possibility, environmental risk factors, such as childhood trauma or drug abuse interacting with high genetic loading of schizophrenia, may have contributed to the alterations in cortical thickness (Habets et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, further work is needed to replicate this pattern of findings and to clarify these interpretations.\nIn our previous work, brain age deviation score (i.e. brain age gap) did not correlate with premorbid functioning (Chung et al., 2018) . This may be due to the fact that the version of the brain age model that we used considers different aspects of brain morphometry simultaneously (i.e., surface area, cortical thickness, subcortical volume) to predict chronological age, whereas premorbid functioning was specifically associated with surface area measures only, but not with cortical thickness. Given our interpretations that differential patterns of alterations in cortical thickness and surface area reflect heterogeneity in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disturbances, our findings suggest that the brain age metric is useful for quantifying gross deviation from normal developmental pattern of neuroanatomical changes at an individual subject level, but lacks sensitivity for detecting distinct patterns of neuroanatomical deviance that confers risk for psychosis.\nSigns of neuroanatomical compromise were not observed among CHR individuals who were ascertained at 18 years of age or later. The null findings of cortical deficits between the groups could be explained by better sensitivity of CHR criteria in recruiting acute-onset forms of psychosis in late adolescence or early adulthood who are expected to be neuroanatomically similar to typically developing age-matched peers throughout most of the premorbid period but show a rapidly increasing deviation prior to the onset of psychosis (Cannon et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2018) . Also, CHR individuals with more insidious onset who might show greater manifestations of pre-existing brain abnormalities are likely to be underrepresented among in the older group as they are more likely convert to psychosis before reaching late adolescence.\nOur evaluation of the between-scanner reliabilities using the human traveling subject data indicate that raw ROI measures of surface area and subcortical volume were mostly in the good to superior range. In contrast, between-site reliabilities for cortical volume and cortical thickness measures were relatively modest. In this study, we adjusted for the scanner offsets based on prior"}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were recruited through the NAPLS2 consortium, consisting of eight sites (UCLA, Emory, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Zucker Hillside Hospital, UNC, UCSD, Calgary, Yale) studying the psychosis prodrome in North America (Addington et al., 2012) .

The CHR cases met the Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes (COPS) based on the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) for the presence of one or more of the three psychosis-risk A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T syndromes: Brief Intermittent Psychotic Syndrome, Attenuated Positive Symptom Syndrome, and genetic Risk and Deterioration Syndrome (McGlashan, Walsh, & Woods, 2010) .\nParticipants who meet criteria for attenuated psychotic symptom present onset or worsening of at attenuated positive symptoms in the past 12 months in at least one of the following five symptom domains: unusual thought content, suspicion/paranoia, grandiosity, perceptual anomalies, and disorganized communication.

Genetic risk was defined as a family history of psychosis in first-degree relatives or a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder.

However, given that only about 22% of the CHR individuals convert to psychosis within 1 year (Fusar-Poli et al., 2012) , this approach results in a relatively small number of subjects in the CHR-C group (and an imbalance compared with the CHR-NC group for estimating means and variances), which significantly attenuates statistical power when performing group based statistics. In addition, while some of the non-converters show signs of remission at follow-up evaluation, some continue to exhibit sub-clinical symptoms of psychosis that persist or worsen over time (Addington et al., 2011) . Therefore, in this study, we defined clinical outcome based on Current Clinical State criteria in the SIPS, which classifies clinical status by evaluating the course of symptoms in the month prior from the point of assessment (Woods et al., 2014) . CHR individuals with partially (\"symptomatic\") or fully remitted prodromal symptoms at follow-up were grouped together and labeled as the \"CHRStable/Remitted\" group, whereas CHR individuals with persisting or progressing severity of prodromal symptoms or those who converted to psychosis were grouped together as the \"CHRConverted/Decline\" group.

Therefore, we tried to further improve between-site reliability by modeling scanner related variance in the regression of A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T age among typically developing adolescents and young adults (i.e., NAPLS2 healthy controls) with a linear mixed effects model. Age, sex, and ICV were treated as fixed factors and scanner ID was treated as a random intercept for each neuroanatomical measure. After fitting the model, random intercept parameters fitted for each scanner were derived to adjust the differing intercepts of age regressions across scanners for both healthy controls and CHR cases. This approach capitalizes on an assumption that there is a true \"fixed\" slope of age in a typically developing population for a given neuroanatomical region; the assumption is widely supported by previous studies that have consistently shown that the shape of the non-linear age trajectories, between childhood and early adulthood, for a given structural brain measure are remarkably parallel across multiple independent datasets (Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2017; Tamnes et al., 2010) . This pattern was also observed in our dataset when age-trajectories were modeled separately by each scanner (see Figure 1 ). For the purpose of estimating the variance of scanner as a random effect, the age trajectories were modeled only among healthy controls, as the agerelated variance in the CHR group would be more variable due to the heterogeneity in the underlying disease process. Although it is well known that the shape of the developmental trajectories for neuroanatomical measures is best characterized as a non-linear process (Fjell et al., 2010) , fitting a linear model is appropriate to prevent overfitting of the data, especially for sites with small sample size. MRI scanners that assessed less than ten control subjects were dropped from this analysis because scanner related variance could not be reliably modeled.

As premorbid functioning was defined as the period preceding the onset of the first attenuated psychotic symptom that contributed to the participant meeting COPS criteria, PAS ratings beyond the childhood period\nwere not applicable for CHR individuals in early adolescence (age 12 -17) (Lyngberg et al., 2015) .

In order to compare our results with other independent studies, we adapted the previously used statistical models as closely as possible and applied them to the NAPLS2 data. Statistical whole-brain maps were generated and P values for comparisons between individuals at CHR and healthy controls were mapped at each vertex. Linear mixed models were fitted at each vertex across the surface, with cortical volume, area, and thickness as dependent variables, after partialing out the effects of age, sex, and ICV. Scanner offsets were estimated as random effects and adjusted using the linear mixed model as proposed above. Z Monte Carlo simulations, one of the features implemented for multiple comparison correction in\nFreeSurfer (Hagler, Saygin, & Sereno, 2006; Hayasaka, 2003) , was applied with a clusterforming threshold of P < 0.05 (two-sided).

GAM fitting has\nshown to have some advantages over the use of polynomial models, as the shape of the function does not have to be pre-defined, and the placement of the peaks of these polynomial fits could be erroneously variable depending on the age-range sampled for a study (Fjell et al., 2010) .\nNonparametric smoothing splines were fitted for the age term to allow greater flexibility without any restrictions on the shape of the curve. Degree of smoothness was defined using the thin plate regression spline and was regularized based on restricted maximum likelihood to guard against overfitting. Group status and other potential confounding variables such as sex, maternal education, ethnicity and ICV were also tested as conventional parametric linear terms.\nSignificance of the age by group interaction term was tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the mgcv package.\nNeuroanatomical measures for all subjects were transformed into Z scores based on the means and standard deviations of the control group, after partialing out variance associated with age, sex, ICV, and scanner using the GAM fitting method as described above. Study participants were then partitioned into an early adolescent group (age range: 12 ~17) and a later adolescent/young adult group (age range: 18 ~ 35). As effect sizes are expected to be modest and statistical power is significantly reduced due to partitioning the sample based on age, a series of statistical tests was performed in a hierarchical manner. First, the global measures of cortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area were tested. If significant association was detected at the global level, then parcels from the Desikan atlas of both hemispheres were utilized to examine regional specificity. False discovery rate (FDR) was set to 5% for testing 68 ROIs (34 ROIs per hemisphere) per cortical index (i.e. cortical thickness, surface area, cortical volume) to correct for multiple comparisons (Benjamini & Hochberg, 2000) . We did not implement vertexwise whole brain analysis for the partitioned sample by age, as this method requires substantial statistical power to survive the stringent correction for multiple comparisons that is imposed for\ntesting all vertices. Subcortical and ventricular volume measures (31 structures) were also tested using the same approach (Fischl et al., 2002) . This strategy was also implemented when performing tests in relation to antipsychotic medications and premorbid functioning.\nFor discerning regional neural correlates of clinical outcome within the CHR individuals, we performed a priori hypothesis testing to reduce the risk of being underpowered (falsenegative). We predicted that CHR-Converted/Decline group would show cortical deficits in lateral and medial prefrontal, parahippocampal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal regions relative to CHR-Stable/Remitted group, as these regions were most frequently implicated in predicting clinical outcomes among high-risk individuals (Borgwardt et al., 2007; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011; Mechelli et al., 2011; Pantelis et al., 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Adjusting scanner-specific variance using age-related developmental patterns", "text": "For nearly all of the neuroanatomical measures, ICC WI values were in the excellent range "}, {"section_title": "Cortical gray matter deficits in individuals at clinical high-risk", "text": "Based on GAM analysis, CHR individuals exhibited significantly smaller total cortical volume (t = -3.49, P < 0.001), total surface area (t = -2.56, P = 0.012), and mean thickness (t = -3.34, P < 0.001) compared with healthy controls (CHR: n = 428, HC: n = 205).

As shown in Figure 3 , the 95% confidence intervals for GAM fitted splines did not overlap among individuals between approximately 12 and 17 years of age.\nSignificantly smaller cortical indices were observed among the CHR adolescents who were under 18 years of age (volume: t = -3.90, P = 0.005; surface area: t = -2.8, P = 0.018; thickness: t = -2.84, P = 0.016; CHR = 197, HC = 68). There were no group differences among subjects who were 18 years of age or older (P values over 0.33).\nIn order to examine the spatial patterns of cortical deficits in CHR cases, vertex-wise whole brain analysis was conducted for each cortical measure. As shown in Figure 4 , CHR individuals exhibited widespread, significantly smaller areas of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness relative to controls after correcting for multiple comparisons.

When group differences were tested across all surface area ROIs, individuals with poor premorbid functioning exhibited reductions in medial orbital frontal, lateral frontal, rostral anterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporal regions (See Table 6 for the complete list of ROIs). Smaller surface area was associated with poor functioning even when median childhood PAS score in the CHR group (PAS = 0.22) was used as a threshold (t = 4.19, P < 0.001), and also when the control subjects were excluded from the analysis (see supplementary materials).

In terms of regional specificity for the younger group, vertex-wise between-group analysis revealed reduced cortical volume in dorsal lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, fusiform and inferior temporal regions, which resembles the spatial distribution of cortical deficits in multiple early disease stages of psychosis (Borgwardt et al., 2007; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011; Mechelli et al., 2011; Pantelis et al., 2003 , Satterthwaite et al., 2016 . Evidence of cortical volume loss in the CHR sample were further explained by a differential regional pattern of smaller cortical thickness and surface area. Given that cortical volume is a composite index reflecting both cortical thickness and surface area at each vertex, diminished cortical volume in dorsal lateral prefrontal, medio-orbital frontal, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal and temporal cortices were primarily driven by smaller surface area, while alterations in cortical thickness better explained cortical volume loss in pre-and post-central regions, precuneus, inferior temporal cortex, and lateral occipital cortex.\nAligned with our findings, youth with attenuated psychosis spectrum symptoms in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) also showed reduced gray matter volume in similar brain regions including medial and orbital frontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, parahippocampal, and fusiform areas (Satterthwaite et al., 2016) .

In this study, we showed that the scanner related adjustment we made improved between-site reliabilities of cortical thickness measures from mostly in the fair to good range into good to excellent range. A clear advantage of this approach is that the scanner related variance could be further reduced at post-hoc as long as there was sufficient sample size of healthy controls assessed at each scanner to reproduce the age related slope and intercept estimates.\nThere are some limitations to this study. Age at ascertainment is not an optimal measure for estimating age at prodromal symptom onset, as it does not consider the recency of when the symptoms emerged. This makes it difficult to model developmental trajectories of neuroanatomical structures as a function of age at onset. However, determining the age when prodromal symptoms first emerged is challenging as clinicians have to rely on subjects' retrospective memory to identify subtle symptoms that are linked to psychosis. Similarly, PAS also relies on retrospective memory; hence recalling the level of functioning during childhood is susceptible to bias, especially for the older participants as they have to recall more distant memories. Also, additional investigation is required to confirm whether neuroanatomical abnormalities observed among the younger CHR cases are indeed linked to exposure to early neurodevelopmental risk factors (e.g., obstetric complications) as objective medical records of birth complications were not available for this sample.

These early-manifesting cortical alterations overlap with brain regions that have previously been linked to schizophrenia and are associated with worsening clinical outcome in this sample. Based on this evidence, it would seem overly simplistic and highly misleading to view individuals experiencing attenuated symptoms of psychosis as a homogenous group with respect to variation in neuroanatomical structures (e.g., Figure 3 ). Instead, variation in neuroanatomical measures must be considered with respect to the age of the individuals at the time of ascertainment for a psychosis risk syndrome, which in turn likely reflects heterogeneity in exposure to early risk factors and premorbid course. CHR individuals with poor premorbid functioning in childhood and earlier ages of prodromal symptom onset are expected to exhibit greater neuroanatomical deviation relative to age-matched peers prior to onset of psychosis. This interpretation suggests that structural brain measures assessed at baseline are likely to be sensitive primarily to \"insidious\" or \"early\" onset forms of psychosis among individuals at CHR. Nonetheless, this age moderated pattern needs to be replicated in independent datasets to confirm the generalizability of our findings. In addition, future work is encouraged to investigate whether the neuroanatomical profile linked to \"early\nonset\" forms of psychosis increase likelihood for experiencing later neuromaturational disturbances (e.g. disrupted synaptic pruning) once they become older adolescents. h Because this was a naturalistic study, individuals were treated in their respective communities according to prevailing standards and the judgment of the treating clinicians, who were often primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists.\ni \u03c7 2 Test performed within CHR group."}]
