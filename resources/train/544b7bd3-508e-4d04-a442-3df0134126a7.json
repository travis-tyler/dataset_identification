It is the largest single fellowship program in the country, supporting approximately 1000 new NSF fellows each year. GRF awards are made to aspiring research scientists and engineers through a merit review process based on an evaluation of each applicant's abilities as demonstrated by academic records, recommendations, and Graduate Record Examination scores. Awards are made for three years and are portable, enabling recipients to enroll in the program of their choice. Between 1978 and 1998, the NSF fellowships were awarded in two competitions -Graduate Fellowship (GF) and the Minority Graduate Fellowship (MGF). This latter competition was eliminated in 1998 in response to a lawsuit. By 1993, 43% of new NSF fellows were women. That year in the GF program new fellows were 10% each Asian/Pacific Islander or Hispanic, 6% African American, and 2% Native American. In the MGF program, 48% of fellows were Hispanic, 36% were African American and 8% each were Native American or Asian/Pacific Islander. Fellowship support is intended to enhance a student's opportunity to define a research topic, complete a degree quickly, and lead to successful entry into research careers."}, {"section_title": "PRIOR STUDIES", "text": "Four studies of NSF fellows conducted by the National Research Council (NRC) have looked at GRF program outcomes (Harmon, 1977;Snyder, 1988;Baker, 1994Baker, , 1995. Outcome indicators have included completion rates, time to degree, subsequent academic appointments, success in obtaining research grants, and, in the 1977 study, publications and citations. The Snyder and Baker studies used applicants for GRF judged qualified but not awarded fellowships as a comparison group (Quality Group 2 non-awardees). These studies confirmed that students supported by the GRF are well qualified, attend outstanding graduate programs, are more likely to complete doctorates than non-awardees, and are likely to become successful scientists. However, the last cohort of NSF fellows to be included in an analysis of outcomes was 1981 fellows, and both the science and engineering environment and the university context for graduate education have changed dramatically since that time."}, {"section_title": "THE STUDY PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY", "text": "In 1998, NSF contracted with West Ed to undertake a program evaluation of the Graduate Research Fellowship program. The interim evaluation report was provided to NSF in the summer of 1999 (Goldsmith, Presley and Cooley, 1999). In this paper, we will address three of the overarching research questions of the study: 1. Do recent NSF fellows show evidence of more timely completion of degree and early career success? 2. Do GF and MGF fellows experience similar educational and career success? 3. Does the individual award aspect of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship enhance the educational experience and career options of fellows? The study design built on the strengths of prior GRF studies that used existing data sources but for the first time sought to address broader issues of program impact through a multi-methods approach to the evaluation. There were three interrelated components to the study: extending outcomes information for three five-year cohorts from 1979 to 1993 using the Survey of Earned Doctorates and NSF's Cumulative Index2; designing and administering a questionnaire sent to more than 1400 NSF fellows and a comparison group of non-NSF fellows in selected disciplines (1989-1993 cohort); and 149 interviews conducted with graduate students and 75 interviews with faculty, staff, and administrators during site visits at 6 research universities."}, {"section_title": "RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Funding Graduate Education", "text": "While there is no debate that financial support benefits graduate student completion rates, there remain serious policy questions nationally about the best ways to fund graduate education 2The Cumulative Index of NSF Fellowship Applicants and Awardees contains information on all applications to the NSF GRF program, including applicant demographics, educational data, test scores, and fellowship status. (Federation of Societies for Experimental Biology, 1997;Nettles, 1990a;Wagner, 1992;Bowen and Rudenstine, 1992). Research assistants assist faculty with sponsored research; teaching assistants help institutions to meet instructional commitments; and program assistants contribute to administrative needs. Training grants enhance programmatic aspects of graduate education, and the report of the Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPUP) (NAS, 1995) recommended adjusting support mechanisms to include new education/training grants to institutions and departments. Only fellowships are designed solely to benefit the graduate student recipient, and yet concerns have been raised that this form of funding may lead to student isolation from peers and faculty. For NSF, the GRF program has been the major instrument for directly funding graduate students, and the program now costs over $60 million each year. Graduate students also are funded by NSF as research assistants through the agency's support of sponsored research. Furthermore, NSF has recently initiated graduate training grants awarded to institutions. "}, {"section_title": "Current Research", "text": "A number of studies have examined the distribution of financial aid at the graduate level (Hauptman, 1986;Educational Testing Service, 1987;Nettles, 1990b;Millet & MacKenzie, 1995;Rapoport, 1999), but there are relatively few that have examined empirically the impact of fellowship funding on graduate school success, especially in comparison to other modes of support. Bowen and Rudenstine (1992) compared student outcomes (completion and time to degree) of several national fellowship programs and concluded that fellowships enhance time to degree but not completion rates. Ehrenberg and Marvos (1996), in contrast, found that financial support patterns at Cornell had their strongest impact on program completion and influenced time to degree much less. Smith, Wolf and Busenberg (1996), in a study of Ford Minority fellows, Mellon Fellows and some Spencer Fellows, noted the important networking links provided by fellowships. The earlier studies of NSF's GRF program found that more NSF fellows than non-awardees completed doctorates and that they did so in a shorter amount of time (Harmon, 1977, Snyder, 1988, Baker, 1994, 1995. Our study extends this body of work in the following ways: It extends analysis of the NSF national fellowship data set to 1993 recipients. It is not limited to findings from one or a few institutions. It includes primary data (survey and site visits) to complement secondary data analysis. It covers a period when (a) the proportion of female fellows increased (from 29% in 1979 to 43% in 1993), and (b) the MGRF competition was in place. This allows us to examine differences in fellowship impact by gender and race/ethnicity. It includes for the first time a comparison group of non-NSF funded peers who may not have applied for GRF funding. It includes non-completers and those still enrolled in addition to completed Ph.D.s. It addresses difficult methodological issues of identifying and locating former students. It begins to assess differences in impact of fellowships and training grant support, in addition to traditional graduate assistantships (RA, TA, PA)."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) Analysis", "text": "We matched the Cumulative Index (CI) to NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates through 1997 (the latest year available) to measure attendance patterns, completion rates, and time to degree of 9035 NSF fellows who received first-year awards between 1979 and 1993. Since the Minority Graduate Fellows competition began full implementation in 1979, starting with that year allows a nearly complete analysis of MGF fellows through 1993. Program quality rankings were obtained from the National Research Council's most recent study of doctoral programs (National Research Council, 1995). As in prior studies, we compared the performance of NSF fellows to nonawardees in the Quality Group 2 category (N= 3308). We examined differences by discipline grouping, gender and GF/MGF competitions."}, {"section_title": "The Graduate Student Follow-up Survey", "text": "A 52-item survey questionnaire was designed to collect information on the graduate education experience and early career paths of NSF fellows and program peers (1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993) entering cohort) who did not receive NSF GRF funding. The cohorts of NSF fellows and program peers who entered their graduate programs between 1989 and 1993 are currently passing through the transition from graduate school to postdoctoral study and employment. We included those who did not complete graduate programs to discover the reasons for not completing degrees and to gather information on their career paths. The instrument and survey methodology received OMB approval in December 1998. We administered the Graduate Student Follow-up Survey to three samples, each responding to specific issues to be addressed in the GRF evaluation. fellows who received their awards between 1990, when the program was initiated, and 1993. Again they were randomly selected from the CI (N=143). The Disciplinary Sample. The Snyder (1988) and Baker (1994Baker ( , 1995 studies used Quality Group 2 non-awardees as the comparison group, as did we for the SED analysis. The strength of this approach is that those in the comparison group survived the fellowship review process. Having done so, the Quality Group 2 non-awardees were considered comparable to fellows not only using such measures as Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores but also with regard to their ability to write a strong research essay and the strength of personal recommendations. However, this comparison group is also limited to individuals who applied for an NSF graduate fellowship. Furthermore, QG2 non-awardees are not necessarily enrolled in the same graduate programs as the NSF fellows, allowing institutional effects to intrude into the design. Ideally, a random sample of graduate students who were similar to GRF awardees in all respects except for having been awarded an NSF fellowship would be created. However, no database had existed from which to draw such a sample. We identified a database that allowed the selection of a comparison group that is not limited to NSF applicants. Since 1989, the American Association of Universities (AAU) and the Association of Graduate Schools (AGS) have been working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS) on a database on doctoral students. The AAU/AGS Doctoral Education Database contains data on doctoral students since 1989 from 40 institutions in four NSF disciplines: Biochemistry, Economics, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. We used the database to identify peers entering the same graduate programs as NSF fellows. We administered the Graduate Student Follow-up Survey to all NSF fellows and a sample of twice the number of their program peers in the disciplines of Biochemistry, Economics, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering at 16 institutions (N=1131).3 The \"program peers\" comparison group was drawn from students who began the same graduate programs at the same time as the NSF fellows but who did not receive (and may not have applied for) an NSF GRF. The 16 institutions included 15 participants in the AAU/AGS database that was used to sample the program peers and one non-participating institution with a large number of NSF fellows that agreed to provide comparable data and a program peer sample. We only included institutions that had at least two NSF fellows in the database who entered the four disciplines from 1989-1993. Because of the concentration of NSF fellows by field in a few institutions, we estimate that we included in the survey approximately 61% of 1989-1993 fellows in Biochemistry, 81% of fellows in Economics, 62% of fellows in Mathematics, and 71% of fellows in Mechanical Engineering. Locating Survey Recipients. Locating survey recipients proved to be a very difficult task. NSF does not track former fellows and had no follow-up addresses. So we began by requesting current addresses from the institutions in which fellows (all three samples) and program peers had been enrolled. Although most institutions provided mailing addresses to us, many of these were no longer valid. We sent two postcard follow ups to individuals whose questionnaires were not returned either completed or as undeliverable. We hired a private investigation firm to further search for current addresses. Again, addresses were not found for some people, and for others, surveys were returned as undeliverable. We calculated our response rates on a base that discounts surveys that were undeliverable. This provides a very conservative response rate since it is highly likely that others did not receive surveys, even though those surveys were not returned as undeliverable. There was Some overlap of individuals among the samples, and the analysis was conducted by sample. We also took care when looking at findings across samples because of the significant disciplinary and institutional differences in the samples."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Site Visits", "text": "We conducted site visits at six major research universities that are identified as Institutions A-F in this paper4. Four of these universities enroll very large numbers of NSF fellows, and the other two were selected for institutional and geographical balance. The six institutions included two private and four public universities located in the Northeast (1), Southeast (1), Midwest (1) and on the West Coast (3). The two private institutions enroll more graduate students than undergraduate students, and the six universities range in total enrollment from 10,000 to 40,000. These universities currently enroll between 38 and 293 NSF fellows in all programs and a total of 962 NSF fellows. Five of the six universities visited were also included in the survey for the Disciplinary sample. Two-person teams conducted interviews over a two-to four-day period at each institution. Interview protocols received OMB approval in December 1998. In addition to administrators and staff responsible for graduate studies and fellowships across the university, we interviewed faculty, staff; and students in 19 departments that correspond to the 4 disciplines selected for the survey of fellows and program peers: Biochemistry (5), Economics (3), Mathematics (6), and Mechanical Engineering (5). Teams created site reports for each institution that were combined in Hyperqual2, a qualitative data analysis, program (Padilla, 1993). The data was then sorted using a coding plan to identify patterns and issues for analysis. At the six institutions, we interviewed 75 administrators, faculty, and staff. We interviewed 149 students (73 NSF fellows and 76 peers). Only one student interviewed (a peer) indicated having a disability. There was more gender balance among the NSF fellows interviewed. Although only 5.5% of NSF fellows and 6.6% of peers interviewed were Hispanic, the NSF fellows were more racially diverse. Since only U. S. citizens and Permanent Residents are eligible for the GRF, there were no international students among NSF fellows; however, 14% of the peers interviewed were international students . Most of the NSF fellows and peers interviewed were in the second through fourth year of their graduate program. For a definitive comparison of completion rates, we needed a large group of non-fellows to compare with fellows. As in past studies (Snyder, 1988;Baker, 1994Baker, , 1995 we used Quality Group 2 (QG2) non-awardees because they were assessed in the application process to be equivalently qualified as QG2 awardees. We used the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) through the most recent year available (1997) to look at completion rates for 9035 fellows and 3380 QG2 non-awardees."}, {"section_title": "FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE", "text": "We used nine-year completion rates for the two five-year cohorts of fellows (1979-1983; 1984-1988) because these maximize our ability to compare groups over time using the most recent SED data (1997).

QG1 fellows are most likely to complete doctorates, and this has not changed over time. Further, and most importantly for our research question, QG2 fellows are more likely to complete doctorates than QG2 non-fellows after nine years, but at the four-year mark, completion rates are similar for both QG2 groups. Across all disciplines, nine-year completion rates have risen from 67% to 70% for QG1 fellows and from 62% to 65% for QG2 fellows. Nine-year completion rates for QG2 non-awardees have remained the same (57.4% and 57.5% between the two cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Four-Year Doctoral Completion Rates Completion Rates by Gender over Time Doctoral completion rates for women fellows are now only slightly lower than for men (Table A.2). Completion rates for 1984-1988 women fellows in most discipline areas are within \u00b14 percentage points of those for men. The largest discrepancy is in Social Science fields, where just 46% of women had completed doctorates in nine years, compared to 58% of men who had done so. Women fellows' doctoral completion rates are also lower in this discipline than they are in any other discipline area. Importantly, the distinction between NSF fellows and non-fellows is greater for women than it is for men, with 70% and 66% of QG1 and QG2 fellows graduating, compared to 55% of QG2 non-awardees, and 37% of fellowship decliners. (Table A.3) The GRF award seems to provide a particular advantage to women fellows in moving to doctoral completion."}, {"section_title": "Time To Degree", "text": "The length of time it takes for doctoral students to complete their programs, time to degree (TTD) is a commonly accepted and long-standing measure of success. It is of limited value when looking at trends, however, because it measures elapsed time from first enrollment in graduate school to receipt of the doctoral degree, rather than number of years enrolled. Many graduate students do not proceed directly to completion but may stop out temporarily before returning to finish. This persistence over time will affect the patterns of years to completion and increased completion rates will likely result in increases in TTD . In this study, we measured the number of fellows who had completed their doctorates within a nine-year period from the time they first enrolled in graduate school, and we did so for two cohorts of GRF fellows those who initially enrolled between 1979-1983, and those who first enrolled between 1984-1988 -in order to determine any apparent trends in TTD between earlier and more recent fellows (Figure 3). Time to degree is converging around six years. The percentage (roughly two-thirds) of fellows in each cohort who completed their doctorates in six years or less is roughly the same for the two cohorts (67% and 68%). But the modal number of years shifted clearly to six for the 1984-1988 group, compared to being evenly spread between five and six years for the earlier cohort. Furthermore, the tails of the distribution are shorter for later groupsmaller proportions completed in four years (14% compared to 17%) but smaller proportions also completed in eight or nine years (14% compared to 17%). So is time to degree going up for GRF fellows? The answer is \"yes\" and \"no,\" depending on the time lens brought to the observation."}, {"section_title": "Figure 3", "text": "Years to Doctorate for GRF Fellows Completing in Nine Years For the programs we visited, faculty and student estimates of TTD ranged from five to six years, with only one program indicating an average of four years for completion (Institution C-EC). Some NSF fellows believe that they will finish in less time because of the GRF, while others indicate that they choose more coursework or research time over speedy completion. In most programs, NSF fellows do not complete in less time, although some faculty speculated that they might. Given that GRF fellows would be freed up from having to TA or RA every quarter, one faculty member commented, \"if students take advantage of it, they should finish faster.\" The Chair was even more emphatic: \"They spend on average one year less in the teaching rotation, and that translates to getting done six months faster.\" (A-EC) Since NSF fellows are among the top students, the Vice Chair noted that it makes sense that they might finish the program in less time, although they have no data to confirm this. (A-M). They tend to take more courses overall, rather than getting through more quickly. (C-ME) Career Aspirations From our site visits we learned that both fellow and peer career aspirations frequently shifted. Many became less inclined to pursue academic careers as time passed a shift precipitated by a number of factors, including the tight competition within the academic job market, better pay in the private sector, and especially, disillusionment with academia. Some discovered that they did not enjoy teaching, or that they did not enjoy theoretical research. Others, both men and women, were disillusioned by academic politics or by work demands and challenge of balancing an academic career and family priorities. We were not surprised to find little difference in early career paths for 1989-1993 fellows and peers in the four disciplines. Most NSF fellows and peers in Mechanical Engineering are pursuing careers outside of academia. The majority of NSF fellows in Mathematics and Biochemistry remain still in higher education, most holding postdoctoral positions or its non-tenure track equivalent in Mathematics. Only in Economics do fellows show a higher likelihood than their peers of holding a tenure-track position. This difference, however, may be related to the fact that almost half of fellows' program peers in Economics were international students. Economics peers were more likely to be employed as an owner/partner/consultant than were fellows (23% compared to 0%) (Table A.4). Do GF and MGF fellows experience similar educational and career success? We looked at experiences of fellows in the two competitions, the Graduate Fellowship and the Minority Graduate Fellowship. We remind the reader that these programs do not distinguish between the ethnicity of GRF fellows, but between the competition under which they were considered. In 1993, 18% of GF fellows were members of underrepresented groups. All MGF fellows were members of underrepresented groups. MGF fellows are somewhat less likely than GF fellows to attend and graduate from programs with reputations that are among the top five or ten institutions (NRC, 1995). Of those fellows who had graduated by 1997, 62% of GF fellows did so from programs rated as Distinguished compared to 44% of MGF fellows. This difference, of course, begins with decisions about where to apply to graduate school. NSF fellows valued most highly the prestige that came with winning a GRF. Over two-thirds believed the award made them an asset to faculty. For some MGF fellows (as well as some WENG fellows), however, the award carried with it not just prestige, but a certain amount of stigma associated the assumption by some that the award was not merit-based."}, {"section_title": "Doctoral Completion Rates", "text": "Doctoral completion rates for MGF fellows are increasing faster than for GF fellows.  (Figures 4 and 5). The modal TTD, however, shifted from fairly equal percentages completing in five and six years, to a peak at six years for both groups. Those taking more than six years were more likely to finish in just seven than were 1979-1983 fellows. These shifts in TTD, especially noticeable for MGF fellows, are related to the substantial increase in the overall percentage of fellows completing doctorates. When TTD calculations are based on a Years to Doctorate for GF Fellows Completing in Nine Years   [ . 1979. -83 El 1984 Years to Doctorate for MGF Fellows Completing in Nine Years changing percentage of completers, we can infer little about the meaning to changing patterns over time. What we can say, however, is that about one third of GRF fellows are still taking more than six elapsed years to earn doctorates. Career Aspirations MGF fellows were less likely to respond to our survey than were GF fellows, and those who did respond were less likely to complete the section on employment (with the exception of those in Engineering). We have scant information, therefore, to assess the comparative early careers of 1989-1993 GF and MGF fellows. Looking only within Engineering, employment and professional productivity patterns are quite similar for the two groups. Does the individual award aspect of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship enhance the educational experience and career options of fellows? The timing of admissions to graduate programs and awarding of the GRF results in virtually no fellowship impact on admission at the programs we visited. However, having a GRF may be an asset when changing programs, although very few take advantage of this option, or for late admission. Furthermore, once an admitted student receives GRF funding, some programs actively recruit them and enhance the fellowship with additional financial support. The GRF award makes a discernable difference to the graduate student experience programs that rely heavily on teaching assistantships as a source of graduate student support. Reduced teaching responsibility frees NSF fellows to pursue additional coursework or explore additional research avenues, thereby broadening as well as deepening their educational experience. We found that in departments with training grants such as Biochemistry, NSF fellows reported little differential experiences from non-fellow peers. On the other hand, fellows in departments like economics and mathematics with little sponsored research were greatly advantaged in their flexibility to choose faculty mentors and research topics. Where teaching assistantships are the primary means of graduate student support such as in mathematics, multiyear fellowships like the GRF provide very valuable time for study and individual research. Interestingly, across departments (including those with training grants) and disciplines, some NSF fellows felt that their funding enabled them to work with the newer/younger faculty who were seen to be doing cutting-edge research but may not yet have research grants to support graduate students. Individual fellowship funding is thought to carry with it dangers of intellectual and social isolation and reduced opportunities to teach (National Science Board, 1998). While about 20% of survey respondents identified reduced teaching opportunities as a disadvantage, less than 6% of Disciplinary fellows and MGF fellows cited other disadvantages such as lack of office space, isolation, and less opportunity to work with faculty on their research projects. WENG fellows were somewhat more likely to identify lack of office space (9%) and less opportunity to work collaboratively with other students (11%). We found no evidence that the individual award aspect of the fellowship enhanced fellows' career options, although there was some speculation that having the GRF was an asset in getting postdoctoral fellowships or research funding. The prestige factor associated with having won a GRF fellowship was cited as being beneficial to graduates in their job search. The broadest finding from our study, but one that it is important to confirm, is that the GRF program continues to play a distinguished and vital role in graduate education. Since its inception in 1952, other fellowship programs have emerged, some conferring equivalent stature on their recipients, or providing higher levels of funding, but none approach the scope or size of the GRF program. With more than 8000 applicants and up to 1000 new fellowships awarded each year, the GRF program reaches all of the fields supported by the National Science Foundation by identifying and supporting those students with the potential to become leaders among the next generation of scientists and engineers. The value of the GRF program stems not only from the direct fmancial support available to fellows, but also from the prestige that success in this national competition confers on NSF fellows and the program's impact on graduate programs. With one major exception a Vice President for Research [C] who was concerned that \"this fellowship program has less cachet than before\"senior university administrators had very high praise for the GRF program and its contributions to graduate education. A former NSF GRF fellow himself, the Vice-Provost is clear about the value of the program and its significance to [Institution D]: \"I can't say enough about the importance of the program. If I had to create a list of the ways which Federal government is spending its money on research, or indeed how the Foundation is spending its money on research, the NSF fellowship program in my way of thinking would be at the top.\" (D) \"It is one of the most prestigious [fellowship programs]. The money is not so great, but it says a lot about our institution that they come here.\" \"It is certainly one of the premiere programs. The honor to the student would be hard to state -how prestigious it is to the student.\" \"It has importance to the graduate enterprise nationally.... More top students enhance the quality of graduate education.\" \"It is of immeasurable value and enriches the enterprise.\" (E) \"[Eliminating GRF] would send a signal to the community that would be very confusing and perhaps discouraging for graduate study.... I think that this is a uniquely successful program. A national competition and students can take the funds anywhere they want. It gives them a degree of choice, makes them very eligible to be recruited by top graduate programs.\" (A-M)"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In response to the three specific research questions, we found a positive effect for female fellows and recipients of MGF fellowships, suggesting that the 'signaling effect' both to the individual and their department is important. MGF recipients showed marked improvement since the last study (Baker, 1995) in closing the gap for completion rates in comparison to GF recipients. The importance of the individual award aspects of the fellowship varied by discipline and by the other sources of graduate funding support available in individual departments. The multi-methods approach of this study helps to demonstrate the importance of disaggregating the effects of financial aid for graduate students. The impact of particular types of funding will be quite different from graduate program to graduate program and the decentralized organizational structure of the graduate education system in the U.
