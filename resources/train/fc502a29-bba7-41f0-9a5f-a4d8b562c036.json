[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "I N order to block the progress of increasing senior population with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have developed a new diagnosis-assisting tool named the neuronal activity topography (NAT) system which consists of a 21-channel EEG meter connected with a remote server via the internet, where the mathematical manipulations are executed. The system is of extremely low cost, noninvasive, highly sensitive to anomalous cerebral neuronal activities, completely free from exposure to radiations, and easy to operate. Its mathematical backgrounds and some examples of clinical applications are described in this paper.\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms are affected by severity of AD [1] , [2] , and anomalies of the EEG rhythms have been investigated by various techniques, for example, LORETA [3] , the blind source separation technique applied to detection of mild cognitive impairments (MCI) [4] , and techniques using coherence or fractal dimension of EEG signals [3] , [5] . A number of researchers tried to extract meaningful information involved in EEG signals of AD patients [6] , [7] , but little has been used clinically for assisting diagnosis of AD and the related brain disorders.\nWe previously tried computer simulations for clarifying the relation between local cerebral neuronal activities and EEG signals based on a 3-D brain cortex model and clarified that the scalp potential distribution of a normal subject is well approximated by a potential distribution generated by an equivalent current dipole source, and the degree of approximation, dipolarity, is close to unity. However, local neuronal impairments distort the otherwise smooth potential distribution and lower the dipolarity. Clinical observations show that the dipolarity becomes unstable in the presence of neuronal impairments somewhere in the brain [6] - [8] .\nClinically the EEG alpha component has been used in evaluating the mean dipolarity D \u03b1 and its standard deviation D \u03c3 . These values are very sensitive to neuronal impairments as well as to local enhancement of neuronal activities caused by tasks. This technique named diagnosis method of neuronal dysfunction (DIMENSION) has been clinically used as a sensitive monitoring tool for the brain rehabilitations since 2000 [8] - [11] , but it is not applicable to assist the differential diagnosis because no information about locality of neuronal impairments is included in DIMENSION. These observations, however, gave us a hint for developing the NAT system.\nThe EEG signals are generated by activities of cerebral neurons and they are rich in information about neuronal activities. To characterize the local neuronal activities, a pair of markers, sNAT and vNAT, has been introduced. The marker sNAT refers to power partitions over the frequency components of the EEG power spectra characterizing enhancement or suppression of neuronal activities, which denote the neuronal hyperactivity or hypoactivity as compared with those of the normal controls 0018-9294/$31.00 \u00a9 2013 IEEE (NLc). The marker vNAT refers to the modulation of the occurrence rate of neuronal activations, which might play a crucial role in the biological signal transmission through the neuronal networks. When vNAT is larger or smaller than that of the NLc, the collective neuronal activities are in the undersynchrony or oversynchrony, in other words, less coherent and more coherent, respectively. The sNAT marker consists of 210 submarkers referring to the ten frequency components of 4.68, 6.24 through 18.72 Hz on each of the 21 signal channels, and similarly the vNAT marker also consists of 210 submarkers referring to the ten frequency pairs of (4.68: 6.24) Hz, (6.24: 7.80) Hz,. . ., (18.72: 20.28 ) Hz on each of the 21 signal channels. They cover the \u03b8, \u03b1, and \u03b2 frequency bands, which show different behaviors in maintaining the brain activities. Each submarker has its own roles in characterizing the cerebral neuronal activities, and the neuronal activities are represented as a point in the 210-dimensional NAT space. The states of patients with a specified brain disease make a cluster within the NAT space and their mean state is regarded as the template state of the specified disease.\nThe likelihood of a test subject to a given template state is defined as a function of the normalized distance between these states in the NAT space. The sensitivity and specificity curves are obtained against the binary likelihood (difference likelihood of the two template states). Screening AD patients from the NLc can be made with sensitivity of 75%, and screening MCI-AD patients (MCI patient developing moderately severe AD within 12-18 months) from the NLc is made with sensitivity of 85%. The likelihood diagram spanned by a pair of binary likelihoods of ADc (control AD) and NLc relating to sNAT and to vNAT enables the longitudinal monitoring of the patient brain state. This diagram enables detection of a subject approaching ADc by repeating the NAT screening test. Comparison between the NAT images and SPECT images shows that the neuronal hypoactivity combined with the undersynchrony causes neuronal impairment.\nNAT is sensitive to functional abnormalities of cerebral neurons and allows repeated applications because it is completely free from exposure to radiations and has a low running cost with the internet analyses. It will open a way toward prevention of AD. NAT will be applicable to various brain diseases, and its mathematical background is described in the present study."}, {"section_title": "II. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. EEG Recording and Preprocessing", "text": "The EEG recording is performed in an awake, resting state with eyes closed for 5 min. The scalp potentials are recorded with 21 electrodes located at Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, Fpz, Fz, T3, T4, T5, T6, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz, O1, O2, and Oz of the International 10-20 System. The EEG data are sampled at 200 Hz per channel and band-pass filtered to pick up signals in a frequency range of 4-20 Hz. This frequency range minimizes the effect of artifacts contaminating the recorded signals (see Fig. 2 ). The recorded signal sequence is divided into segments of 0.64 s, which we found is optimal in the following analyses.\nThe discrete Fourier coefficient is denoted as X j,m referring to signal channel j and frequency mf 0 where m is a positive integer running from 3(mf 0 = 4.68 Hz) to 13(mf 0 = 20.28 Hz) with f 0 = 1.56 Hz (=1/0.64 s). After removing segments including sampled data larger than 100 \u03bcV in amplitude, the signal reference zero is reset to the instantaneous mean value of the recorded signals with the 21 electrodes to eliminate the effect of the location of the reference electrode on the right earlobe."}, {"section_title": "B. Normalized Power Spectrum", "text": "We are going to derive dimensionless markers from the EEG signals which characterize stochastic nature of the cerebral neuronal activities generating these signals. The discrete power spectrum PS consists of the ten frequency components |X j,m | 2 seg for m = 3-12 on signal channel j . The subscript attached to the averaging symbol denotes, hereafter, that the averaging is performed on this variable. In the present case, the averaging is performed across all of the segments. Dependence of the EEG signal level on individual subject is eliminated by normalizing it to its mean level.

This marker characterizes the fractional partition of the EEG power over the ten frequency components.\nAnother role of the collective neuronal activities is the signal transmission through the neuronal networks. The biological signal is encoded as the modulation of the occurrence rate of neuronal activities. The organized modulation mode introduces coherence in the collective neuronal activities, and the coherence causes spiky variations of the power spectrum. . Such ratios derive the ten (m = 3-13) dimensionless submarkers NPV j,m on the signal channel j,\nIts dynamic range is between 0 and 1.

The value of (2) does not change when p j,m is replaced by its reciprocal 1/p j,m . In case p j,m = 1, the collective randomly activated neurons have no modulation and no meaningful biological signals are transmitted, because the neuronal activities are generated at random. In case 0 < p j,m < 1, the collective neuronal activities are partly coherent and partly random, and some signal contents are transmitted through the collective neuronal activities.\nWhen NPV j,m is larger or smaller than that of the NLc, the related neuronal activities are regarded as being undersynchronous or oversynchronous, respectively.

The larger t-value guarantees a better discrimination between AD and NLc. The contours are limited for the t-values above 1.25. We also obtained similar results with vNAT, and we find the common optimal frequency range for these markers to be from mf 0 = 4.68 (m = 3) to 18.72 (m = 12) Hz for sNAT and from mf 0 = 4.68 (m = 3) to 20.28 (m = 13) Hz for vNAT.

Subjects", "text": "In the present report, we use databases collected in the Musashi research project performed at National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP) Musashi Hospital [8] denoted as M-data and in the Tone epidemiological investigation project [15] denoted as T-data in Table I. 1) Test Data: Probable AD was diagnosed as such according to NINDS-ADRDA criteria and neuroimaging diagnostic procedure (SPECT) [12] . Classification of MCI patients required the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score \u226524 and the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5 with memory performance less than one standard deviation below the normal reference (Wechsler Logical Memory Scale and Paired Associates Learning subtests, IV and VII, \u22649 [13] , and/or \u22645 on the [14] ). These patients underwent SPECT examinations at the initial evaluation stage and were followed for 12-18 months. The MCI patients developing probable or possible AD after 12-18 months are named MCI-AD in the present paper.\n2) Control Data: The EEG data of 402 subjects were collected in the Tone epidemiological investigation project for prevalence of dementia among inhabitants older than 65 years of age in Tone, Ibaraki, Japan [15] . They are used as the control data. After physical examinations and blood sampling, they underwent the following screening tests; MMSE for cognitive screening, CDR for global function assessment, and \"logical memory A\" from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised for memory assessment, and some tests used in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) project [16] . As many as 160 subjects out of 402 subjects were withinNLc (WNLc) and had no memory and cognitive impairments (MMSE \u226524, CDR = 0). In addition to the aforementioned screening scores, 52 NLc subjects showed no signs of abnormality in the MRI examination. We regard these subjects as the top-quality NLc. Twenty out of 402 subjects were diagnosed to be in probable AD and they were used as ADc. When we do not have a large enough number of subjects, one subject is taken out for test and the remaining data are used as controls. This process is repeated, which we call the minus-one method. The minus-one method with the data size n causes a slightly smaller likelihood by a factor of 1/n as compared with the otherwise case because a minus-one subject makes a vacancy in the original group of patients. For n > 20, this error will be negligibly small for the practical clinical use. Fig. 3 shows the sensitivity and specificity curves, namely the discrimination curves for AD, ADc, and MCI-AD from NLc and WNL against the binary likelihood sL x:ADc-NLc , where the best-fitting sigmoid curves are also plotted as continuous sooth lines. We have confirmed that the distribution of the likelihood values of patients diagnosed to be with a given disease such as AD approaches the Gaussian distribution as the data size increases, and hence its cumulative distribution is best-fitted by the sigmoid function. Patients with AD are discriminated from NLc with a false alarm rate of about 25%, and discrimination between MCI-AD patients and NLc subjects shows a smaller false alarm rate of 15%, probably because the patients in this case had effectively double screening by NAT for separating MCI and for ADc (see Section IV). Fig. 4 compares variations of sL x:ADc-NLc , vL x:ADc-NLc , and the MMSE score of an AD patient. The medication with Aricept started four months before the measurements. After the 12th month the likelihoods variations are negatively correlated to the MMSE scores as is expected. This result shows that NAT is also sensitive to the cognitive impairment. clockwise through 45"}, {"section_title": "B. Discrimination", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C.

The prognosis of the patient described in Fig. 4 is followed with arrows in Fig. 5 . Initially the patient is approaching the normal region probably because of the mediation effect, and then the patient is returning back to AD. In general, we will be able to trace a subject in the NL region approaching the AD region, and will be able to catch a good timing to start the proper treatment and monitor its effect.\nWe find that the majority of MCI-AD patients are located in the first quadrant of the new coordinate system. It may be that the neuronal impairments of the MCI-AD patients are related to the impairment of the neuronal exciation rather than to deterioration of their synchronism."}, {"section_title": "E. Visualization of the NAT Image", "text": "A pair of the NAT images in the two representations is necessary to visualize the cerebral neuronal activity. As we already discussed, the positive values of sZ terns and the rCBF reduction patterns measured by SPECT, we understand that the combined neuronal state of hypoactivity and undersynchrony corresponds to the impairment of cerebral neuronal activities. The neuronal hyperactivity in the frontal lobe without remarkable change in the neuronal synchrony may be related to simple enhancement of neuronal activities evoked by some active tasks, which has no remarkable correspondence in the SPECT pattern."}, {"section_title": "IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We viewed the animation picture of the NAT patterns of a normal subject in NLc and a patient in ADc, and renewed our surprise that the NAT pattern of the brain state of an AD patient was making an ameba-like motion more actively than in a normal subject. This fact was previously observed in the development of DIMENSION [8] , which led us to development of the present NAT system. This instability is really natural because the brain activity is controlling our dynamic living state. The animation picture was prepared with segments of 1 s and picture frames were recorded by shifting a step of 0.1 s. Now, it is probable that the unstable brain state causes part of the false judgment in the separation of patients with a brain disease from NLc subjects. Suppose part of the false alarm rate caused by the instability is 20%. If you had the NAT screening test twice, in which you had the same judgments \"you are not with AD\" twice. The false alarm rate coming from the instability of the brain state would be reduced to 4% (=0.2\n2 ). The low false alarm rate of 15% obtained in Fig. 3 for separation of MCI-AD from NLc might be due to the fact that patients in MCI-AD had passed double diagnoses, initially for MCI and second for AD.\nAD is characterized by neuronal loss, atrophy, deposition of the senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. It may be that the main component of senile plaque is amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein and that of neurofibrillary tangles is due to hyperphoshorylated tau protein (p-tau) which results in neuronal death [17] - [20] . Neuronal death may be one of the causes of the abnormalities in the EEG rhythms which will modify the pattern of rCBF and cognitive function [21] , [22] . Moreover, the reduced rCBF and sugar metabolism in the temporal lobes and the parietal lobe are associated with the disease progression [23] . The neuronal loss causes a change in the equipotential pattern or the neuronal activity pattern, but it will not contribute to the instability of the NAT pattern. The NAT may be able to differentiate between the cerebral impairments due to the neuronal death and malfunctions.\nIn our previous study, the impaired neuronal activity causes anomalous power fluctuations of the EEG signals [8] . From these observations we tried to use the sNAT and the vNAT as markers characterizing anomalous neuronal activities.\nThe functional change of the brain can be detected prior to the morphological change. The NAT system approaches the cerebral neuronal impairments from the two directions: one is from abnormality in the power partition over the spectrum of EEG signals, and another is from the anomalous modulation mode of neuronal activities which plays a crucial role in transmission of the biological signals. We speculate that the neuronal hypoactivity is caused by anomalous reduction in the time rate of occurrences of neuronal depolarization, and anomalous low synchrony among collective neurons is attributed to anomalous randomization of the coupling among collective neurons. Then, the neuronal hypoactivity combined with undersynchrony will cause serious impairment of neuronal activities in transmitting biological information. Through the present investigation, we have obtained the evidence to this speculation.\nReliability of NAT depends on the quality of the EEG databases of brain diseases used for the templates of the various brain diseases. We have been collecting high quality EEG databases in collaboration with various medical institutes, and have impressions that the brain state of AD is not as simple as we expect. The patients diagnosed to be with AD are separated into subclusters in the NAT spaces, suggesting a possibility that AD and other brain diseases are decomposed into more elementary categories of brain disorders.\nOne of the advantages of the NAT system is that the NAT examination can be repeated frequently to follow up progresses of the brain state. Moreover, the repeated applications of the NAT examination reduce the false diagnosis coming from the unstable brain state. The type of instability of the brain state may be showing the type of the brain disorders\nThe NAT system is now under test-running preparing for its practical use. According to our present schedule the internet use of the NAT system will be available in September this year prior to its public use, and we are interested in running the international collaboration in compiling the EEG databases for a wider range of the brain disorders together with the genetic information if possible.
