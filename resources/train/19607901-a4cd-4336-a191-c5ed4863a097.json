purpose of this document is to collate the methods used to access, collect, process, and analyze derived data (\"indicators\") used to describe the status and trend of social, economical, ecological, and biological conditions in the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (see fgure, below). These indicators are further synthesized in State of the Ecosystem Reports produced annually by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center for the New England Fisheries Management Council and the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council. The metadata for each indicator (in accordance with the Public Access to Research Results (PARR) directive) and the methods used to construct each indicator are described in the subsequent chapters, with each chapter title corresponding to an indicator or analysis present in State of the Ecosystem Reports. The most recent and usable html version of this document can be found at the NOAA EDAB Github. The PDF version of this document is for archiving only. Indicators included in this document were selected to clearly align with management objectives, which is required for integrated ecosystem assessment (Levin et al. 2009), and has been advised many times in the literature (Degnbol and Jarre 2004; Jennings 2005; Rice and Rochet 2005; Link 2005). A di\u00ffculty with practical implementation of this in ecosystem reporting can be the lack of clearly specifed ecosystem-level management objectives (although some have been suggested (Murawski 2000)). In our case, considerable eort had already been applied to derive both general goals and operational objectives from both US legislation such as the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (MSA) and regional sources (DePiper et al. 2017). These objectives are somewhat general and would need refnement together with managers and stakeholders, however, they serve as a useful starting point to structure ecosystem reporting.\n7\n\n\f8\n\nCONTENTS\n\nFigure 1: Map of Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem from Hare et al. (2016).\n\n\fChapter 1\nData and Code Access\n1.0.1 About\nThe Technical Documentation for the State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reports is a bookdown document; hosted on the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Ecosystems Dynamics and Assessment Branch Github page, and developed in R. Derived data used to populate fgures in this document are queried directly from the ecodata R package or the NEFSC ERDDAP server. ERDDAP queries are made using the R package rerddap.\n1.0.2 Accessing data and build code\nIn this technical documentation, we hope to shine a light on the processing and analytical steps involved to get from source data to fnal product. This means that whenever possible, we have included the code involved in source data extraction, processing, and analyses. We have also attempted to thoroughly describe all methods in place of or in supplement to provided code. Example plotting code for each indicator is presented in sections titled \"Plotting\", and these code chunks can be used to recreate the fgures found in ecosystem reporting documents where each respective indicator was included1.\nSource data for the derived indicators in this document are linked to in the text unless there are privacy concerns involved. In that case, it may be possible to access source data by reaching out to the Point of Contact associated with that data set. Derived data sets make up the majority of the indicators presented in ecosystem reporting documents, and these data sets are available for download through the ecodata R package.\n1.0.3 Building the document\nStart a local build of the SOE bookdown document by frst cloning the project's associated git repository. Next, if you would like to build a past version of the document, use git checkout [version_commit_hash] to revert the project to a past commit of interest, and set build_latest <- FALSE in this code chunk. This will ensure the project builds from a cached data set, and not the most updated versions present on the NEFSC ERDDAP server. Once the tech-doc.Rproj fle is opened in RStudio, run bookdown::serve_book() from the console to build the document.\n1There are multiple R scripts sourced throughout this document in an attempt to keep code concise. These scripts include BasePlot_source.R, GIS_source.R, and get_erddap.R. The scripts BasePlot_source.R and GIS_source.R refer to deprecated code used prior to the 2019 State of the Ecosystem reports. Indicators that were not included in reports after 2018 make use of this syntax, whereas newer indicators typically use ggplot2 for plotting.\n9\n\n\f10\n\nCHAPTER 1. DATA AND CODE ACCESS\n\n1.0.3.1 A note on data structures\nThe majority of the derived time series used in State of the Ecosystem reports are in long format. This approach was taken so that all disparate data sets could be \"bound\" together for ease of use in our base plotting functions.\n\n\fChapter 2\nAggregate Groups\nDescription: Mappings of species into aggregate group categories for dierent analyses Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2018, 2019, 2020), State of the Ecosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2018, 2019, 2020) Indicator category: Synthesis of published information Contributor(s): Geret DePiper, Sarah Gaichas, Sean Hardison, Sean Lucey Data steward: Sean Lucey Sean.Lucey@noaa.gov Point of contact: Sean Lucey Sean.Lucey@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data is available to the public (see Data Sources).\n2.1 Methods\nThe State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reports are delivered to the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) to provide ecosystems context. To better understand that broader ecosystem context, many of the indicators are reported at an aggregate level rather than at a single species level. Species were assigned to an aggregate group following the classifcation scheme of Garrison and Link (2000) and Link et al. (2006). Both works classifed species into feeding guilds based on food habits data collected at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC). In 2017, the SOE used seven specifc feeding guilds (plus an \"other\" category; Table 2.1). These seven were the same guilds used in Garrison and Link (2000), which also distinguished ontogentic shifts in species diets. For the purposes of the SOE, species were only assigned to one category based on the most prevalent size available to commercial fsheries. However, several of those categories were confusing to the management councils, so in 2018 those categories were simplifed to fve (plus \"other\"; Table 2.2) along the lines of Link et al. (2006). In addition to feeding guilds, species managed by the councils have been identifed. This is done to show the breadth of what a given council is responsible for within the broader ecosystem context. In the 2020 report, squids were moved from planktivores to piscivores based on the majority of their diet being either fsh or other squid.\n2.1.1 Data sources\nIn order to match aggregate groups with various data sources, a look-up table was generated which includes species' common names (COMNAME) along with their scientifc names (SCINAME) and several species codes.\n11\n\n\f12\n\nCHAPTER 2.

A third species code provided is the ITISSPP, which refers to species identifers used by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Digits within ITIS codes are hierarchical, with dierent positions in the identifer referring to higher or lower taxonomic levels. More information about the SVDBS, CFDBS, and ITIS species codes are available in the links provided below.\nManagement responsibilities for dierent species are listed under the column \"Fed.managed\" (NEFMC, MAFMC, or JOINT for jointly managed species). More information about these species is available on the FMC websites listed below. Species groupings listed in the \"NEIEA\" column were developed for presentation on the Northeast Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (NE-IEA) website. These groupings are based on EMAX groupings (Link et al. 2006), but were adjusted based on conceptual models developed for the NE-IEA program that highlight focal components in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (i.e. those components with the largest potential for perturbing ecosystem dynamics). NE-IEA groupings were further simplifed to allow for eective communication through the NE-IEA website.\n2.1.1.1 Supplemental information\nSee the following links for more information regarding the NEFSC ESB Bottom Trawl Survey, CFDBS, and ITIS:\n\u00b7 https://www.itis.gov/\n\u00b7 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/22561\n\u00b7 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/22560\n\n\f2.1.

More information about the New Engalnd Fisheries Management Council is available here. More information about the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council is available here.\n\n2.1.2 Data extraction\nSpecies lists are pulled from SVDBS and CFDBS. They are merged using the ITIS code. Classifcations from Garrison and Link (Garrison and Link 2000) and Link et al. (Link et al. 2006) are added manually. The R code used in the extraction process can be found here.\n\n\f14\n\nCHAPTER 2. AGGREGATE GROUPS\n\n\fChapter 3\nAnnual SST Cycles\nDescription: Annual SST Cycles Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2018), State of the Ecosystem Mid-Atlantic (2018) Indicator category: Database pull with analysis Contributor(s): Sean Hardison, Vincent Saba Data steward: Kimberly Bastille, kimberly.bastille@noaa.gov Point of contact: Kimberly Bastille, kimberly.bastille@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data are available here.\n3.1 Methods\n3.1.1 Data sources\nData for annual sea surface tempature (SST) cycles were derived from the NOAA optimum interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) high resolution dataset (NOAA OISST V2 dataset) provided by NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory's Physical Sciences Devision, Boulder, CO. The data extend from 1981 to present, and provide a 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 global grid of SST measurements (Reynolds et al. 2007). Gridded SST data were masked according to the extent of Ecological Production Units (EPU) in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (NE-LME) (See \"EPU_Extended\" shapefles).\n3.1.2 Data extraction\nDaily mean sea surface temperature data for 2017 and for each year during the period of 1981-2012 were downloaded from the NOAA OI SST V2 site to derive the long-term climatological mean for the period. The use of a 30-year climatological reference period is a standard procedure for metereological observing (WMO 2017). These reference periods serve as benchmarks for comparing current or recent observations, and for the development of standard anomaly data sets. The reference period of 1982-2012 was chosen to be consistent with previous versions of the State of the Ecosystem report. R code used in extraction and processing can be found here\n15\n\n\f16\n\nCHAPTER 3. ANNUAL SST CYCLES\n\n3.1.3 Data analysis\nWe calculated the long-term mean and standard deviation of SST over the period of 1982-2012 for each EPU, as well as the daily mean for 2017.\nR code used for analysis and plotting can be found here\n\nFigure 3.1: Long-term mean SSTs for the Mid-Atlantic Bight (A), Georges Bank (B), and Gulf of Maine (C). Orange and cyan shading show where the 2017 daily SST values were above or below the long-term mean respectively; red and dark blue shades indicate days when the 2017 mean exceeded +/- 1 standard deviation from the long-term mean.\n\n\fChapter 4\nAquaculture\nDescription: Aquaculture indicators Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2017, 2018), State of the Ecosystem Mid-Atlantic (2017, 2018, 2019) Indicator category: Synthesis of published information Contributor(s): Sean Hardison, Lisa Calvo, Karl Roscher Data steward: Kimberly Bastille kimberly.bastille@noaa.gov Point of contact: Kimberly Bastille kimberly.bastille@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data are publicly available in referenced reports, and are also available for download here.\n4.1 Methods\nAquaculture data included in the State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report were time series of number of oysters sold in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.\n4.1.1 Data sources\nVirginia oyster harvest data are collected from mail and internet-based surveys of active oyster aquaculture operations on both sides of the Chesapeake Bay, which are then synthesized in an annual report (Hudson 2017). In Maryland, shellfsh aquaculturists are required to report their monthly harvests to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD-DNR). The MD-DNR then aggregates the harvest data for release in the Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council Annual Report (ACC 2017), from which data were collected. Similar to Virginia, New Jersey releases annual reports synthesizing electronic survey results from lease-holding shellfsh growers. Data from New Jersey refects cage reared oysters grown from hatchery seed (Calvo 2017).\n4.1.2 Data extraction\nData were collected directly from state aquaculture reports. Oyster harvest data in MD was reported in bushels which were then converted to individual oysters by an estimate of 300 oysters bushel-1.

The derived Comland data set is available for download here.\n5.1.2 Data extraction\nFor information regarding processing of CFDBS, please see Comland methods. The Comland dataset containing seafood landings data was subsetted to US landings after 1964 where revenue was  0 for each Ecological Production Unit (i.e. Mid-Atlantic Bight, Georges Bank, and Gulf of Maine). Each EPU was run in an individual R script, and the code specifc to Georges Bank is shown [here](.\n5.1.3 Data analysis\nRevenue earned by harvesting resources from a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) at time t is a function of both the quantity landed of each species and the prices paid for landings. Changes in revenue between any two years depends on both prices and quantities in each year, and both may be changing simultaneously. For example, an increase in the harvest of higher priced species, such as scallops can lead to an overall increase in total revenue from an LME between time periods even if quantities landed of other species decline. Although measurement of revenue change is useful, the ability to see what drives revenue change, whether it is changing harvest levels, the mix of species landed, or price changes provides additional valuable information.\n19\n\n\f20\n\nCHAPTER 5. BENNET INDICATOR\n\nTherefore, it is useful to decompose revenue change into two parts, one which is due to changing quantities (or volumes), and a second which is due to changing prices. In an LME, the quantity component will yield useful information about how the species mix of harvests are changing through time.\n\nA Bennet indicator (BI) is used to examine revenue change between 1964 and 2015 for two major LME regions. It is composed of a volume indicator (VI), which measures changes in quantities, and a price indicator (PI) which measures changes in prices. The Bennet (1920) indicator (BI) was frst used to show how a change in social welfare could be decomposed into a sum of a price and quantity change indicator (Cross and F\u00e4re 2009). It is called an indicator because it is based on dierences in value between time periods, rather than ratios, which are referred to as indices. The BI is the indicator equivalent of the more popular Fisher index (Balk 2010), and has been used to examine revenue changes in Swedish pharmacies, productivity change in U.S. railroads (Lim and Lovell 2009), and dividend changes in banking operations (Grifell-Tatj\u00e9 and Lovell 2004). An attractive feature of the BI is that the overall indicator is equal to the sum of its subcomponents (Balk 2010). This allows one to examine what component of overall revenue is responsible for change between time periods. This allows us to examine whether changing quantities or prices of separate species groups are driving revenue change in each EPU between 1964 and 2015.\n\nRevenue in a given year for any species group is the product of quantity landed times price, and the sum of revenue from all groups is total revenue from the LME. In any year, both prices and quantities can change from prior years, leading to total revenue change. At time t, revenue (R) is defned as\n\nJ\nRt = X ptj yjt,\nj=1\n\nwhere pj is the price for species group j, and yj is the quantity landed of species group j. Revenue change between any two time periods, say t + 1 and t, is then Rt+1 - Rt, which can also be expressed as:\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nR = X ptj+1yjt+1 - X pjt yjt.\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nThis change can be decomposed further, yielding a VI and PI. The VI is calculated using the following formula (Georgianna, Lee, and Walden 2017):\n\nVI\n\n=\n\n1 2\n\nJ\nX (\n\nptj+1\n\nyjt+1\n\n-\n\nJ\nX pjt+1yjt\n\nJ\n+ X ptj yjt+1\n\nJ\n- X ptj yjt)\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nThe price indicator (PI) is calculated as follows:\n\nPI\n\n=\n\n1 2\n\nJ\nX (\n\nyjt+1pjt+1\n\nJ\n- X yjt+1pjt\n\n+\n\nJ\nX yjt ptj+1\n\nJ\n- X yjtptj )\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nTotal revenue change between time t and t + 1 is the sum of the VI and PI. Since revenue change is being driven by changes in the individual prices and quantities landed of each species group, changes at the species group level can be examined separately by taking advantage of the additive property of the indicator. For example, if there are fve dierent species groups, the sum of the VI for each group will equal the overall VI, and the sum of the PI for each group will equal the overall PI.\n\n5.1.4 Data processing\nBennet indicator time series were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R code found here.\n\n5.1.5 Plotting\nCode for plotting the bennet indicator can be found here.\n\n\f5.1.

Early measurements were made using surface bucket samples, mechanical bathythermographs and expendable bathythermograph probes, but by 1991 the CTD \u00ad an acronym for conductivity temperature and depth \u00ad became standard equipment on all NEFSC surveys. Near-bottom refers to the deepest observation at each station that falls within 10 m of the reported water depth. Observations encompass the entire continental shelf area extending from Cape Hatteras, NC to Nova Scotia, Canada, inclusive of the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank.\n6.1.2 Data extraction\nWhile all processed hydrographic data are archived in an Oracle database (OCDBS), we work from Matlabformatted fles stored locally.\n6.1.3 Data analysis\nOcean temperature on the Northeast U.S. Shelf varies signifcantly on seasonal timescales. Any attempt to resolve year-to-year changes requires that this seasonal variability be quantifed and removed to avoid bias. This process is complicated by the fact that NEFSC hydrographic surveys conform to a random stratifed sampling design meaning that stations are not repeated at fxed locations year after year so that temperature\n23\n\n\f24\n\nCHAPTER 6. BOTTOM TEMPERATURES\n\nvariability cannot be assessed at fxed station locations. Instead, we consider the variation of the average bottom temperature within four Ecological Production Units (EPUs): Middle Atlantic Bight, Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf. Within each EPU, ocean temperature observations are extracted from the collection of measurements made within 10 m of the bottom on each survey and an area-weighted average temperature is calculated. The result of this calculation is a timeseries of regional average near-bottom temperature having a temporal resolution that matches the survey frequency in the database. Anomalies are subsequently calculated relative to a reference annual cycle, estimated using a multiple linear regression model to ft an annual harmonic (365-day period) to historical regional average temperatures from 1981-2010. The curve ftting technique to formulate the reference annual cycle follows the methodologies outlined by Mountain (1991). The reference period was chosen because it is the standard climatological period adopted by the World Meteorological Organization. The resulting anomaly time series represents the dierence between the time series of regional mean temperatures and corresponding reference temperatures predicted by a reference annual cycle for the same time of year. Finally, a reference annual average temperature (calculated as the average across the reference annual cycle) is added back into the anomaly timeseries to convert temperature anomalies back to ocean bottom temperature.\n\n6.1.4 Data processing\nDerived bottom temperature data were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R code found here.\n\n6.1.5 Plotting\nCode for plotting Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine bottom temperature time series can be found here.\n\n\f6.1.

Derived time series are available for download here.\n7.1 Methods\nDiversity estimates have been developed to understand whether specialization, or alternatively stovepiping, is occurring in fsheries of the Northeastern Large Marine Ecosystem. We use the average eective Shannon indices for species revenue at the permit level, for all permits landing any amount of NEFMC or MAFMC Fishery Management Plan (FMP) species within a year (including both Monkfsh and Spiny Dogfsh). We also use the eective Shannon index of feet revenue diversity and count of active feets to assess the extent to which the distribution of fshing changes across feet segments.\n7.1.1 Data sources\nData for these diversity estimates comes from a variety of sources, including the Commercial Fishery Dealer Database, Vessel Trip Reports, Clam logbooks, vessel characteristics from Permit database, WPU series producer price index. These data are typically not available to the public.\n7.1.2 Data extraction\nThe following describes both the permit-level species and feet diversity data generation. Price data was extracted from the Commercial Fishery Dealer database (CFDERS) and linked to Vessel Trip Reports by a heirarchical matching algorithm that matched date and port of landing at its highest resolution. Code used in these analyses is available upon request.\n27\n\n\f28\n\nCHAPTER 7. CATCH AND FLEET DIVERSITY\n\nOutput data was then matched to vessel characteristics from the VPS VESSEL data set. For the permit-level estimate, species groups are based o of a slightly refned NESPP3 code (Table 7.1), defned in the data as \"myspp\", which is further developed in the script to rectify inconsistencies in the data.\n\nTable 7.1: Species grouping\n\nGroup\nHighly Migratory Species Monkfsh in Mid-Atlantic Waters Atlantic Scallops Shrimp\n\nNESPP3 470 494\n354\n469 487\n493 467 468\n358 481 349 482\n359 355 466 432 353 491 471\n11 12 800\n737 737 736 738\n735 368 372 366 365 365 373\n\nCommon Name ALBACORE ATLANTIC SHARPNOSE SHARK BIGEYE THRESHER SHARK BIGEYE TUNA BLACKTIP SHARK\nBLUE SHARK BLUEFIN TUNA LITTLE TUNNY\nLONGFIN MAKO PORBEAGLE SHARK SAND TIGER SANDBAR SHARK\nSHARK,UNC SHORTFIN MAKO SKIPJACK TUNA SWORDFISH THRESHER SHARK TIGER SHARK YELLOWFIN TUNA GOOSEFISH GOOSEFISH SEA SCALLOP\nMANTIS SHRIMP UNCL MANTIS SHRIMPS NORTHERN SHRIMP SHRIMP,ATLANTIC & GULF,BROWN SHRIMP,UNC (CARIDEA) BARNDOOR SKATE CLEARNOSE SKATE LITTLE SKATE OCELLATE SKATES SKATES SKATES,LITTLE/WINTER MIXED\n\nScientifc Name THUNNUS ALALUNGA RHIZOPRIONODON TERRAENOVAE ALOPIAS SUPERCILIOSUS THUNNUS OBESUS CARCHARHINUS LIMBATUS PRIONACE GLAUCA THUNNUS THYNNUS EUTHYNNUS ALLETTERATUS ISURUS PAUCUS LAMNA NASUS CARCHARIAS TAURUS CARCHARHINUS PLUMBEUS CHONDRICHTHYES ISURUS OXYRINCHUS KATSUWONUS PELAMIS XIPHIAS GLADIUS ALOPIAS VULPINUS GALEOCERDO CUVIER THUNNUS ALBACARES LOPHIUS AMERICANUS LOPHIUS AMERICANUS PLACOPECTEN MAGELLANICUS STOMATOPODA STOMATOPODA PANDALUS BOREALIS PANAEIDAE\nCARIDEA DIPTURUS LAEVIS RAJA EGLANTERIA LEUCORAJA ERINACEA RAJA RAJIDAE LEUCORAJA\n\n\f7.1.

METHODS\n\n31\n\n7.1.3 Data analysis\nThis permit-level species eective Shannon index is calculated as\nN\nX exp(- pijtln(pijt))\ni=1\nfor all j, with pijt representing the proportion of revenue generated by species or species group i for permit j in year t, and is a composite of richness (the number of species landed) and abundance (the revenue generated from each species). The annual arithmetic mean value of the eective Shannon index across permits is used as the indicator of permit-level species diversity.\nIn a similar manner, the feet diversity metric is estimated as\nN\nX exp(- pktln(pkt))\ni=1\nfor all k, where pkt represents the proportion of total revenue generated by feet segment k (gear and length combination) per year t. The indices each run from 1996 to 2017. A count of the number of feets active in every year is also provided to assess whether changes in feet diversity are caused by shifts in abundance (number of feets), or evenness (concentration of revenue). The work is based o of analysis conducted in Thunberg and Correia (2015) and published in Gaichas et al.

The stations have been in place since 2007. The Sting Ray station was deployed in July of 2008 and has been monitoring conditions on and o since then. The data is recorded in situ and sent to a server over a cellular modem. The standard CBIBS instrument is a WETLabs WQM mounted in the buoy well approximately 0.5 meters below the surface. Seabird purchased WETLabs and are now the manufacturer of the instruments. The WQM instruments are calibrated and swapped out on a regular basis. Salinity is stored as a double with the units of PSU.\n8.1.2 Data extraction\nData is directly inserted into a database from the real time system over the cellular network.

Indicator category: Published method; Database pull with analysis Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2019) Contributor(s): Qian Zhang, Rebecca Murphy, Richard Tian, Melinda Forsyth, Emily Trentacoste, Jeni Keisman, and Peter Tango. Data steward: Qian Zhang, qzhang@chesapeakebay.net Point of contact: Qian Zhang, qzhang@chesapeakebay.net Public availability statement: Data are publicly available (see Data Sources below).\n9.1 Methods\nTo protect the aquatic living resources of Chesapeake Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership has developed a guidance framework of ambient water quality criteria with designated uses and assessment procedures for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, and water clarity/submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (USEPA 2003). To achieve consistent assessment over time and between jurisdictions, a multimetric indicator was proposed by the CBP partnership to provide a means for tracking the progress in all 92 management segments of Chesapeake Bay (USEPA 2017). This indicator has been computed for each three-year assessment period since 1985-1987, providing an integrated measure of Chesapeake Bay's water quality condition over the last three decades.\n9.1.1 Data sources\nThe multimetric indicator required monitoring data on dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, chlorophylla concentrations, water clarity, SAV acreage, water temperature, and salinity. SAV acreage has been measured by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in collaboration with the CBP, which is available via http://web.vims.edu/bio/sav/StateSegmentAreaTable.htm. Data for all other parameters were obtained from the CBP Water Quality Database. These data have been routinely reported to the CBP by the Maryland\n35\n\n\f36\n\nCHAPTER 9. CHESAPEAKE BAY WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ATTAINMENT\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Old Dominion University, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and citizen/volunteer monitoring initiatives.\n\n9.1.2 Data analysis\nCriteria attainment assessment\nMonitoring data of DO, chlorophyll-a, and water clarity/SAV were processed and compared with water quality criteria thresholds according to dierent designated uses (DUs). These DUs are migratory spawning and nursery (MSN), open water (OW), deep water (DW), deep channel (DC), and shallow water (SW), which refect the seasonal nature of water column structure and the life history needs of living resources. Station-level DO and chlorophyll-a data were spatially interpolated in three dimensions.\nSalinity and water temperature data were used to compute the vertical density structure of the water column, which was translated into layers of dierent DUs. Criteria attainment was determined by comparing violation rates over a 3-year period to a reference cumulative frequency distribution that represents the extent of allowable violation. This approach was implemented using FORTRAN codes, which are provided as a zipped folder. For water clarity/SAV, the single best year in the 3-year assessment period was compared with the segment-specifc acreage goal, the water clarity goal, or a combination of both. For more details, refer to the Methods section of Zhang et al. (2018).\nIndicator calculation\nThe multimetric indicator quantifes the fraction of segment-DU-criterion combinations that meet all applicable season-specifc thresholds for each 3-year assessment period from 1985-1987 to 2015-2017. For each 3-year assessment period, all applicable segment-DU-criterion combinations were evaluated in a binomial fashion and scored 1 for \"in attainment\" and 0 for \"nonattainment\". The classifed status of each segment-DU-criterion combination was weighted via segments' surface area and summed to obtain the multimetric index score. This weighting scheme was adopted for two reasons: (1) segments vary in size over four orders of magnitude, and (2) surface area of each segment does not change with time or DUs, unlike seasonally variable habitat volume or bottom water area (USEPA 2017). For more details, refer to the Methods section of Zhang et al. (2018).\nThe indicator provides an integrated measure of Chesapeake Bay's water quality condition (Figure 1). In 2015-2017, 42% of all tidal water segment-DU-criterion combinations are estimated to have met or exceeded applicable water quality criteria thresholds, which marks the best 3-year status since 1985-1987. The indicator has a positive and statistically signifcant trend from 1985 to 2017, which shows that Chesapeake Bay is on a positive trajectory toward recovery. This pattern was statistically linked to total nitrogen reduction, indicating responsiveness of attainment status to management actions implemented to reduce nutrients in the system.\nPatterns of attainment of individual DUs are variable (Figure 2). Changes in OW-DO, DC-DO, and water clarity/SAV have shown long-term improvements, which have contributed to overall attainment indicator improvement. By contrast, the MSN-DO attainment experienced a sharp spike in the frst few assessment periods but generally degraded after the 1997-1999, which has implications to the survival, growth, and reproduction of the migratory and resident tidal freshwater fsh during spawning and nursery season in the tidal freshwater to low-salinity habitats. The status and trends of tidal segments' attainment may be used to inform siting decisions of aquaculture operations in Chesapeake Bay.\n\n9.1.3 Data processing\nThe indicator data set was formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R script found here.\n\n\f9.1.

The daily fles were binned at 2 km resolution that are stored in a global, nearly equal-area, integerized sinusoidal grids and use the default L2 ocean color fag masks. The global SST data were also subset to the same East Coast region and remapped to the same sinusoidal grid.\nThe L2 fles contain several ocean color products including the default chlorophyll a; product (CHL-OCI), photosynthetic available radiation (PAR), remote sensing refectance (Rrs()), and several inherent optical property products (IOPs). The CHL-OCI product combines two algorithms, the O'Reilly band ratio (OCx) algorithm (O'Reilly et al. 1998) and the Hu color index (CI) algorithm (Hu, Lee, and Franz 2012). The SeaDAS default CHL-OCI algorithm diverges slightly from Hu, Lee, and Franz (2012) in that the transition between CI and OCx occurs at 0.15 < CI < 0.2 mg m-3 to ensure a smooth transition. The regional chlorophyll a algorithm by Pan et al. (2008) was used to create a second chlorophyll product (CHL-PAN). CHL-PAN is an empirical algorithm derived from in situ sampling within the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (NE-LME) and demonstrated signifcant improvements from the standard NASA operational algorithm in the NES-LME (Pan et al. 2010). A 3rd-order polynomial function (Equation (10.1)) is used to derive [CHL-PAN] from Rrs band ratios (RBR):\n\nlog[CHL-PAN] = A0 + A1X + A2X2 + A3X3,\n\n(10.1)\n\nwhere X = log(Rrs(1)/Rrs(2)) and Ai(i = 0, 1, 2, or 3) are sensor and RBR specifc coe\u00ffcients:\n\u00b7 If SeaWiFS and RBR is Rrs(490)/Rrs(555)(R3/5 ) then: A0 = 0.02534, A1 = -3.033, A2 = 2.096, A3 = -1.607\n\u00b7 If SeaWiFS and RBR is Rrs(490)/Rrs(670)(R3/6 ) then: A0 = 1.351, A1 = -2.427, A2 = 0.9395, A3 = -0.2432\n\u00b7 If MODIS and RBR is Rrs(488)/Rrs(547)(R3/5 ) then: A0 = 0.03664, A1 = -3.451, A2 = 2.276, A3 = -1.096\n\u00b7 If MODIS and RBR is Rrs(488)/Rrs(667)(R3/6 ) then: A0 = 1.351, A1 = -2.427, A2 = 0.9395, A3 = -0.2432\nC3/5 and C3/6 were calculated for each sensor specifc RBR (R3/5 and R3/6 respectively) and then the following criteria were used to determine to derive CHL-PAN:\nIf R3/5 > 0.15 or R6 < 0.0001 then CHL-PAN = C3/5 ;\nOtherwise, CHL-PAN = max(C3/5 , C3/6 ),\nwhere R6 is Rrs(670) (SeaWiFS) or Rrs(667) (Pan et al. 2010).\nThe Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) estimates net primary production (PP) as a function of chlorophyll a, photosynthetically available light and the photosynthetic e\u00ffciency (Behrenfeld and Falkowski 1997). In the VGPM-Eppley version, the original temperature-dependent function to estimate the chlorophyllspecifc photosynthetic e\u00ffciency is replaced with the exponential \"Eppley\" function (equation PP1) as modifed by Morel (1991). The VGPM calculates the daily amount of carbon fxed based on the maximum rate of chlorophyll-specifc carbon fxation in the water column, sea surface daily photosynthetically available radiation, the euphotic depth (the depth where light is 1% of that at the surface), chlorophyll a concentration, and the number of daylight hours (Equation (10.2)).\n\n\f10.1. METHODS\n\n41\n\nPmb ax(SST ) = 4.6  1.065SST -200 Where Pmb ax is the maximum carbon fxation rate and SST is sea surface temperature.\n\n(10.2)\n\nP Peu\n\n=\n\n0.66125\n\n\n\nPmb ax\n\n\n\nI0\n\nI0 + 4.1\n\n\n\nZeu\n\n\n\nCHL\n\n\n\nDL\n\n(10.3)\n\nWhere P Peu is the daily amount of carbon fxed integrated from the surface to the euphotic depth (mgC m-2 day-1), Pmb ax is the maximum carbon fxation rate within the water column (mgC mgChl-1 hr-1), I0 is the daily integrated molar photon fux of sea surface PAR (mol quanta m-2 day-1), Zeu is the euphotic depth (m), CHL is the daily interpolated CHIi-OCI (mg m-3), and DL is the photoperiod (hours) calculated for the day of the year and latitude according to Kirk (1994). The light dependent function (I0/(I0 + 4.1)) describes the relative change in the light saturation fraction of the euphotic zone as a function of surface PAR (I0). Zeu is derived from an estimate of the total chlorophyll concentration within the euphotic layer (CHLeu) based on the Case I models of Morel and Berthon (1989):\n\u00b7 For CHLeu > 10.0 Zeu = 568.2  CHL-eu0.746 \u00b7 For CHLeu  10.0 Zeu = 200.0  CHL-eu0.293 \u00b7 For CHL0  1.0 CHLeu = 38.0  CHL00.425 \u00b7 For CHL0 > 1.0 CHLeu = 40.2  CHL00.507\nWhere CHL0 is the surface chlorophyll concentration.\nPrior to being input into the VGPM-Eppley model, the daily CHL-OCI and AVHRR SST data were temporally interpolated and smoothed (CHL-OCIINT and SSTINT respectively) to increase the data coverage and better match data collected from dierent sensors and dierent times. The daily PAR data are not aected by cloud cover and MUR SST data is a blended/gap free data product so these products were not interpolated.\nDaily data at each pixel location covering the entire date range were extracted to create a pixel time series (Dx,y). (Dx,y) are linearly interpolated based on days in the time series using interpx.pro. Prior to interpolation, the CHL data are log-transformed to account for the log-normal distribution of chlorophyll data (Campbell 1995). Interpolating the entire times series requires a large amount of processing time so the series was processed one year at a time. Each yearly series included 60 days from the previous year and 60 days from the following year to improve the interpolation at the beginning and end of the year. Following interpolation, the data are smoothed with a tri-cube flter (width=7) using IDL's CONVOL program. In order to avoid over interpolating data when there were several days of missing data in the time series, the interpolated data were removed and replaced with blank data if the window of interpolation spanned more than 7 days for CHL or 10 days for SST. After all Dx,y pixels had been processed, the one-dimensional pixel time series were converted back to two-dimensional daily fles.\nStatistics, including the arithmetic mean, geometric mean (for CHL and PP), standard deviation, and coe\u00ffcient of variation were calculated at daily (3 and 8-day running means), weekly, monthly, and annual time steps and for several climatological periods. Annual statistics used the monthly means as inputs to avoid a summer time bias when more data is available due to reduced cloud cover. The daily, weekly, monthly and annual climatological statistics include the entire time series for each specifed period. For example, the climatological January uses the monthly mean from each January in the time series and the climatological annual uses the annual mean from each year. The CHL and PP climatological statistics include data from both SeaWiFS (1997-2007) and MODIS (2008-2017).\nWeekly, monthly and annual anomalies were calculated for each product by taking the dierence between the mean of the input time period (i.e. week, month, year) and the climatological mean for the same period. Because bio-optical data are typically log-normally distributed (Campbell 1995), the CHL and PP data were frst log-transformed prior to taking the dierence and then untransformed, resulting in an anomaly ratio.\n\n\f42\n\nCHAPTER 10. CHLOROPHYLL A AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION\n\nThe ecological production unit (EPU) shapefle that excludes the estuaries was used to spatially extract all data location within an ecoregion from the statistic and anomaly fles. The median values, which are equivalent to the geometric mean, were used for the CHL and PP data. For the extended time series, the 1998-2007 data use the SeaWiFS ocean color products and MODIS-Aqua products were used from 2008 to 2017. Prior to June 2002, AVHRR Pathfnder data are used as the SST source and MUR SST in subsequent years.\n10.1.4 Data processing\nCHL and PPD time series were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R code found here.\n10.1.5 Plotting\nChl a and primary production data were also examined in relation to the long-term means of each series.

Derived indicator outputs are available here.\n12.1 Methods\nFisheries dependent data for the Northeast Shelf extend back several decades. Data from the 1960s on are housed in the Commercial database (CFDBS) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center which contains the commercial fsheries dealer purchase records (weigh-outs) collected by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Statistical Reporting Specialists and state agencies from Maine to Virginia. The data format has changed slightly over the time series with three distinct time frames as noted in Table 12.1 below.\nComlands is an R database pull that consolidates the landings records from 1964 on and attempts to associate them with NAFO statistical areas (Figure 12.1). The script is divided into three sections. The frst pulls domestic landings data from the yearly landings tables and merges them into a single data source. The second section applies an algorithm to associate landings that are not allocated to a statistical area using similar characteristics of the trip to trips with known areas. The fnal section pulls foreign landings from the\n\nTable 12.1: Data formats\n\nTable\nWOLANDS WODETS CFDETS_AA\n\nYears\n1964 - 1981 1982 - 1993 > 1994\n\n47\n\n\f48\n\nCHAPTER 12.

Colors represent the Ecological Production Unit (EPU) with which the statistical area is associated.\nDuring the frst section, the Comlands script pulls the temporal and spatial information as well as vessel and gear characteristics associated with the landings in addition to the weight, value, and utilization code of each species in the landings record. The script includes a toggle to use landed weights as opposed to live weights. For all but shellfsh species, live weights are used for the State of the Ecosystem report. Due to the volume of data contained within each yearly landings table, landings are aggregated by species, utilization code, and area as well as by month, gear, and tonnage class. All weights are then converted from pounds to metric tons. Landings values are also adjusted for infation using the Producer Price Index by Commodity for Processed Foods and Feeds: Unprocessed and Packaged Fish. Infation is based on January of the terminal year of the data pull ensuring that all values are in current dollar prices.\n\n\f12.1. METHODS\n\n49\n\nSeveral species have additional steps after the data is pulled from CFDBS. Skates are typically landed as a species complex. In order to segregate the catch into species, the ratio of individual skate species in the NEFSC bottom trawl survey is used to disaggregate the landings. A similar algorithm is used to separate silver and oshore hake which can be mistaken for one another. Finally, Atlantic herring landings are pulled from a separate database as the most accurate weights are housed by the State of Maine. Comlands pulls from the State database and replaces the less accurate numbers from the federal database.\nThe majority of landings data are associated with a NAFO Statistical Area. For those that are not, Comlands attempts to assign them to an area using similar characteristics of trips where the area is known. To simplify this task, landings data are further aggregated into quarter and half year, small and large vessels, and eight major gear categories (Table 12.2). Landings are then proportioned to areas that meet similar characteristics based on the proportion of landings in each area by that temporal/vessel/gear combination. If a given attribute is unknown, the algorithm attempts to assign it one, once again based on matched characteristics of known trips. Statistical areas are then assigned to their respective Ecological Production Unit (Table 12.3).\n\nTable 12.3: Statistical areas making up each EPU\n\nEPU Gulf of Maine Georges Bank Mid-Atlantic\n\nStat Areas 500, 510, 512, 513, 514, 515 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 551, 552, 561, 562 537, 539, 600, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 621, 622, 625, 626, 631, 632\n\nThe fnal step of Comlands is to pull the foreign landings from the NAFO database. US landings are removed from this extraction so as not to be double counted. NAFO codes and CFDBS codes dier so the script rectifes those codes to ensure that the data is seamlessly merged into the domestic landings. Foreign landings are fagged so that they can be removed if so desired.\n12.1.1 Data sources\nComland is a database query of the NEFSC commercial fshery database (CFDBS). More information about the CFDBS is available here.\n12.1.2 Data extraction\ncomlandr is a package used to extract relevant data from the database.\n12.1.2.1 Data Processing The landings data were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package with this R code.\n12.1.3 Data analysis\nFisheries dependent data from Comlands is used in several indicators for the State of the Ecosystem report; the more complicated analyses are detailed in their own sections. The most straightforward use of this data are the aggregate landings indicators. These are calculated by frst assigning the various species into aggregate groups. Species are also marked by which management body manages them. Landings are then summed by year, EPU, aggregate group, and whether they are managed or not. Both managed and unmanaged totals are added together to get the fnal amount of total landings for that aggregate group within its respective region. Both the total and those landings managed by the management body receiving the report are reported. Proportions of managed landings to total landings are also reported in tabular form.\n\n\f50\n\nCHAPTER 12.

The overall process was to frst identify the components of the model (focal groups, human activities, environmental drivers, and objectives), and then to document criteria for including groups and linkages and what the specifc links were between the components. The prototype conceptual model used to design Northeast US conceptual models for each ecosystem production unit (EPU) was designed by the California Current IEA program. The California Current IEA developed an overview conceptual model for the Northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (NCC), with models for each focal ecosystem component that detailed the ecological, environmental, and human system linkages. Another set of conceptual models outlined habitat linkages. An inital conceptual model for Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine was outlined at the 2015 ICES WGNARS meeting. It specifed four categories: Large scale drivers, focal ecosystem components, human activities, and human well being. Strategic management objectives were included in the conceptual model, which had not been done in the NCC. Focal ecosystem components were defned as aggregate species groups that had associated US management objectives (outlined within WGNARS for IEAs, see DePiper et al. (2017)): groundfsh, forage fsh, fshed invertebrates, living habitat, and protected species. These categories roughly align with Fishery Managment Plans (FMPs) for the New England Fishery Management Council. The\n57\n\n\f58\n\nCHAPTER 14. CONCEPTUAL MODELS\n\nMid-Atlantic conceptual model was developed along similar lines, but the focal groups included demersals, forage fsh, squids, medium pelagics, clams/quahogs, and protected species to better align with the Mid Atlantic Council's FMPs.\n\nAfter the initial draft model was outlined, working groups were formed to develop three submodels following the CCE example: ecological, environmental, and human dimensions. The general approach was to specify what was being included in each group, what relationship was represented by a link between groups, what threshold of the relationship was used to determine whether a relationship was signifcant enough to be included (we did not want to model everything), the direction and uncertainty of the link, and documentation supporting the link between groups. This information was recorded in a spreadsheet. Submodels were then merged together by common components using the \"merge\" function in the (currently unavailable) desktop version of Mental Modeler (http://www.mentalmodeler.org/#home; Gray et al. (2013)). The process was applied to Georges Bank (GB), the Gulf of Maine (GOM), and the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) Ecological Production Units.\n14.1.1 Data sources\n14.1.1.1 Ecological submodels\nPublished food web (EMAX) models for each subregion (J.S. Link et al. 2006; Link et al. 2008), food habits data collected by NEFSC trawl surveys (Smith and Link 2010), and other literature sources (Smith et al. 2015) were consulted. Expert judgement was also used to adjust historical information to current conditions, and to include broad habitat linkages to Focal groups.\n14.1.1.2 Environmental submodels\nPublished literature on the primary environmental drivers (seasonal and interannual) in each EPU was consulted. Sources for Georges Bank included Backus and Bourne (1987) and Townsend et al. (2006). Sources for the Gulf of Maine included Smith (1983), Smith et al. (2001), Mupparapu and Brown (2002), Townsend et al. (2006), Smith et al. (2012), and Mountain (2012).\n\n\f14.1. METHODS\n\n59\n\nSources for the Mid Atlantic Bight included Houghton et al. (1982), Beardsley et al. (1985), Lentz (2003), Mountain (2003), Glenn et al. (2004), Sullivan, Cowen, and Steves (2005), Castelao et al.

Miller, Hare, and Alade (2016), and Lentz (2017).\n\n14.1.1.3 Human dimensions submodels\nFishery catch and bycatch information was drawn from multiple regional datasets, incuding the Greater Atlantic Regional O\u00ffce Vessel Trip Reports & Commercial Fisheries Dealer databases, Northeast Fishery Observer Program & Northeast At-Sea Monitoring databases, Northeast Fishery Science Center Social Sciences Branch cost survey, and the Marine Recreational Informational Program database. Further synthesis of human welfare derived from fsheries was drawn from F\u00e4re, Kirkley, and Walden (2006), Walden et al. (2012), Lee and Thunberg (2013), Lee (2014), and Lee, Steinback, and Wallmo (2017). Bycatch of protected species was taken from Waring et al. (2015), with additional insights from Bisack and Magnusson (2014). The top 3 linkages were drawn for each node. For example, the top 3 recreational species for the Mid-Atlantic were used to draw linkages between the recreational fshery and species focal groups.

A matrix with diet composition for each modeled group is an input to the food web model. A matrix of mortalities caused by each predator and fshery on each modeled group is a direct ouput of a food web model (e.g. Ecopath). Food web model biomasss fows between species, fsheries, and detritus were summarized using algorithms implemented in visual basic by Kerim Aydin, NOAA NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center. Because EMAX model groups were aggregated across species, selected diet compositions for individual species were taken from the NEFSC food habits database using the FEAST program for selected species (example query below). These diet queries were consulted as supplemental information.\nExample FEAST sql script for Cod weighted diet on Georges Bank can be found here. Queries for dierent species are standardized by the FEAST application and would dier only in the svspp code.\n\n14.1.2.2 Environmental submodels\nInformation was synthesized entirely from published sources and expert knowledge; no additional data extraction was completed for the environmental submodels.\n\n14.1.2.3 Human dimensions submodels\nRecreational fsheries data were extracted from the 2010-2014 MRIP datasets. Original data can be found here for each region (New England or Mid-Atlantic as defned by states).\nCommercial fshing data was developed as part of the State of the Ecosystem Report, including revenue and food production estimates, with data extraction metodology discussed in the relevant sections of the technical document. In addition, the Northeast Regional Input/Output Model (Steinback and Thunberg 2006) was used as the basis for the strength of the employment linkages.\n\n14.1.3 Data analysis\n14.1.3.1 Ecological submodels\nAggregated diet and mortality information was examined to determine the type of link, direction of link, and which links between which groups should be inclded in the conceptual models. Two types of ecological links were defned using food web models: prey links and predation/fshing mortality links. Prey links resulted in positve links between the prey group and the focal group, while predation/fshing mortality links resulted in negative links to the focal group to represent energy fows. The intent was to include only the most important linkages between focal groups and with other groups supporting or causing mortality on focal species groups. Therefore, threshold levels of diet and mortality were established (based on those that would select the top 1-3 prey and predators of each focal group): 10% to include a link (or add a linked group) in the model and 20% to include as a strong link. A Primary Production group was included in each model and linked to pelagic habitat to allow environmental eects on habitat to be connected to the ecologial submodel. Uncertainty for the inclusion of each link and for the magnitude of each link was qualitatively assessed and noted in the spreadsheet.\n\n\f14.1. METHODS\n\n61\n\nFour habitat categories (Pelagic, Seafoor and Demersal, Nearshore, and Freshwater and Estuarine) were included in ecological submodels as placeholders to be developed further along with habitat-specifc research. Expert opinion was used to include the strongest links between each habitat type and each Focal group (noting that across species and life stages, members of these aggregate groups likely occupy many if not all of the habitat types). Link direction and strength were not specifed. Environmental drivers were designed to link to habitats, rather than directly to Focal groups, to represent each habitat's important mediation function.\nEMAX model groups were aggregated to focal groups for the Georges Bank (GB), Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) conceptual models according to Table 14.1. \"Linked groups\" directly support or impact the Focal groups as described above.\n\n\f62\n\nTable 14.1: Relationship between food web model groups and conceptual model focal groups.

CONCEPTUAL MODELS\n\n\f14.1. METHODS\n\n63\n\nEcological submodels were constructed and visualized in Mental Modeler (Fig. 14.1). Here, we show only the Gulf of Maine submodels as examples.\n\nFigure 14.1: Gulf of Maine Ecological submodel\n14.1.3.2 Environmental submodels\nEnvironmental submodels were designed to link key oceanographic processes in each ecosystem production unit to the four general habitat categories (Pelagic, Seafoor and Demersal, Nearshore, and Freshwater and Estuarine) with emphasis on the most important physical processes in each ecosystem based on expert knowledge as supported by literature review. The basis of each submodel were environmental variables observable at management-relevant scales as identifed by WGNARS: Surface and Bottom Water Temperature and Salinity, Freshwater Input, and Stratifcation (as well as sea ice timing and cover, which is not relevant to the northeast US shelf). Key drivers changing these observable variables and thus structuring habitat dynamics in each Ecological Production Units were added to the model using expert consensus.\nEnvironmental submodels were initially constructed and visualized in Mental Modeler (Fig. 14.2).\n14.1.3.3 Human dimensions submodels\nThe top 3 species from each mode of recreational fshing (shoreside, private boat, party/charter) were used to assess the potential for missing links between the recreational fshing activity and biological focal components. Given the predominance of Mid-Atlantic groundfsh in recreational fshing o New England (summer founder, bluefsh, striped bass), a Mid-Atlantic groundfsh focal component was added to the Georges Bank EPU model. The magnitude of benefts generated from recreational fshing was scaled to refect expert knowledge of target species, coupled with the MRIP data highlighted above. Scales were held consistent across the focal components within recreational fshing.\nNo additional biological focal components were added to the commercial fshing activity, beyond what was developed in the ecological submodel. Benefts derived from commercial fshing were scaled to be consistent with the State of the Ecosystem revenue estimates, as modulated by expert knowledge and additional data sources. For example,the percentage of landings sold as food was used to map fshing activity to the commercial fshery food production objective, and the Northeast Regional Input/Output Model (Steinback\n\n\f64\n\nCHAPTER 14. CONCEPTUAL MODELS\n\nFigure 14.2: Gulf of Maine Environmental submodel\nand Thunberg 2006) was used to defne the strength of the employment linkages. For proftability, expert knowledge was used to reweight revenue landings, based on ancillary cost data available (Das, Chhandita 2013, 2014). Human activities and objectives for the conceptual sub model are defned in DePiper et al. (2017). As shown in Figure 14.3, human dimensions submodels were also initially constructed and visualized in Mental Modeler.\n14.1.3.4 Merged models\nAll links and groups from each submodel were preserved in the full merged model for each system. Mental modeler was used to merge the submodels. Full models were then re-drawn in Dia (http://dia-installer.de/) with color codes for each model component type for improved readability. Examples for each system are below.\n14.1.3.5 Communication tools\nThe merged models were redrawn for use in communications with the public. These versions lead o the State of the Ecosystem reports for both Fishery Management Councils to provide an overview of linkages between environmental drivers, ecological, and human systems.\n\n\f14.1.

Derived condition data are available here.\n15.1 Methods\nRelative condition (Kn) was introduced by Cren (1951) as a way to remove the infuence of length on condition, and Blackwell, Brown, and Willis (2000) noted that Kn may be useful in detecting prolonged physical stress on a fsh populations. Relative condition is calculated as\nKn = W/W 0, where W is the weight of an individual fsh and W 0 is the predicted length-specifc mean weight for the fsh population in a given region. Here, relative condition was calculated for fnfsh stocks commonly caught on the Northeast Fisheries Science Center's (NEFSC) autumn bottom trawl survey, from 1992-present. Where data allowed, predicted length-weight parameters were calculated for W 0 by species, sex and season over the time period 1992-2012. When sample sizes of individual fsh weights and lengths were too low, parameters were calculated for aggregated spring and fall survey data over the same time period. Fall survey relative condition was calculated by Ecological Production Unit (EPU) for females only, as trends tended to be similar for males and females. The Condition package used for calculations and plotting of fsh condition factor can be found on GitHub.\n15.1.1 Data sources\nIndividual fsh lengths (to the nearest 0.5 cm) and weights (grams) were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys from 1992-present aboard RVs Albatross IV, Delaware II and the Henry B.

Fall survey data were used where sample sizes allowed for growth curve estimation, otherwise data from spring and fall seasons were combined.\nIndividual fsh lengths from the NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey from 1992-2017 were then used to calculate predicted weights using the reference length-weight parameters. Relative condition (Kn) was calculated annually for females by species and EPU by dividing individual fsh weights by the predicted weight.\nThe code found here was used in the analysis of fsh condition.\n\n15.1.4 Plotting\nCode for plotting the fsh condition indicator can be found here.\n\nFigure 15.1: Condition factor for fsh species in the MAB.

More information about source data used to derive EPUs can be found here.\n16.1 Methods\nTo defne ecological production units (EPUs), we assembled a set of physiographic, oceanographic and biotic variables on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, an area of approximately 264,000 km within the 200 m isobath. The physiographic and hydrographic variables selected have been extensively used in previous analyses of oceanic provinces and regions (e.g Ro and Taylor 2000). Primary production estimates have also been widely employed for this purpose in conjunction with physical variables (Longhurst 2007) to defne ecological provinces throughout the world ocean. We did not include information on zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fsh, protected species, or fshing patterns in our analysis. The biomass and production of the higher trophic level groups in this region has been sharply perturbed by fshing and other anthropogenic infuences. Similarly, fshing patterns are aected by regulatory change, market and economic factors and other external infuences. Because these malleable patterns of change are often unconnected with underlying productivity, we excluded factors directly related to fshing practices. The physiographic variables considered in this analysis are listed in Table 16.1. They include bathymetry and surfcial sediments. The physical oceanographic and hydrographic measurements include sea surface temperature, annual temperature span, and temperature gradient water derived from satellite observations for the period 1998 to 2007.\n71\n\n\f72\n\nCHAPTER 16.

Daily sea surface temperature (SST, \u00b0C) measurements at 4 km resolution were derived from nighttime scenes composited from the AVHRR sensor on NOAA's polar-orbiting satellites and from NASA's MODIS TERRA and MODIS AQUA sensors. We extracted information for the annual mean SST, temperature span, and temperature gradients from these sources. The latter metric provides information on frontal zone locations.\nThe biotic measurements included satellite-derived estimates of chlorophyll a (CHLa) mean concentration, annual span, and CHLa gradients and related measures of primary production. Daily merged SeaWiFS/MODISAqua CHLa (CHL, mg m-3) and SeaiWiFS photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, Einsteins m-2 d-1) scenes at 1.25 km resolution were obtained from NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group.\n16.1.2 Data extraction\nNA\n16.1.3 Data analysis\nIn all cases, we standardized the data to common spatial units by taking annual means of each observation type within spatial units of 10' latitude by 10' longitude to account for the disparate spatial and temporal scales at which these observations are taken. There are over 1000 spatial cells in this analysis. Shipboard sampling used to obtain direct hydrographic measurements is constrained by a minimum sampling depth of 27 m specifed on the basis of prescribed safe operating procedures. As a result nearshore waters are not fully represented in our initial specifcations of ecological production units.\nThe size of the spatial units employed further refects a compromise between retaining spatial detail and minimizing the need for spatial interpolation of some data sets. For shipboard data sets characterized by relatively coarse spatial resolution, where necessary, we frst constructed an interpolated map using an inverse distance weighting function before including it in the analysis. Although alternative interpolation schemes\n\n\f16.1. METHODS\n\n73\n\nbased on geostatistical approaches are possible, we considered the inverse distance weighting function to be both tractable and robust for this application.\nWe frst employed a spatial principal components analysis (PCA; e.g. Pielou 1984; Legendre and Legendre 1998) to examine the multivariate structure of the data and to account for any inter-correlations among the variables to be used in subsequent analysis. The variables included in the analysis exhibited generally skewed distributions and we therefore transformed each to natural logarithms prior to analysis.\nThe PCA was performed on the correlation matrix of the transformed observations. We selected the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues of the dispersion matrix with scores greater than 1.0 (the KaiserGuttman criterion; Legendre and Legendre 1998) for all subsequent analysis. These eigenvectors represent orthogonal linear combinations of the original variables used in the analysis.\nWe delineated ecological subunits by applying a disjoint cluster based on Euclidean distances using the Kmeans procedure (Legendre and Legendre 1998) on the principal component scores The use of non-independent variables can strongly infuence the results of classifcation analyses of this type (Pielou 1984), hence the interest in using the PCA results in the cluster.\nThe eigenvectors were represented as standard normal deviates. We used a Pseudo-F Statistic described by Milligan and Cooper (1985) to objectively defne the number of clusters to use in the analysis. The general approach employed is similar to that of Host et al. (1996) for the development of regional ecosystem classifcations for terrestrial systems.\nAfter the analyses were done, we next considered options for interpolation of nearshore boundaries resulting from depth-related constraints on shipboard observations. For this, we relied on information from satellite imagery. For the missing nearshore areas in the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight, the satellite information for chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature indicated a direct extension from adjacent observations. For the Nantucket Shoals region south of Cape Cod, similarities in tidal mixing patterns refected in chlorophyll and temperature observations indicated an a\u00ffnity with Georges Bank and the boundaries were changed accordingly.\nFinally, we next considered consolidation of ecological subareas so that nearshore regions are considered to be special zones nested within the adjacent shelf regions. Similar consideration led to nesting the continental slope regions within adjacent shelf regions in the Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank regions. This led to four major units: Mid-Atlantic Bight, Georges Bank, Western-Central Gulf of Maine (simply \"Gulf of Maine\" in the State of the Ecosystem), and Scotian Shelf-Eastern Gulf of Maine. As the State of the Ecosystem reports are specifc to FMC managed regions, the Scotian Shelf-Eastern Gulf of Maine EPU is not considered in SOE indicator analyses.\n\n16.1.4 Data processing\nShapefles were converted to sf objects for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R code found here.\n\n\f74\n\nCHAPTER 16.

It is a simple 16-point GS index constructed by selecting grid points following the maximum Standard deviation of sea level height anomalies every 1.33\u00b0 longitude between 52\u00b0 and 72\u00b0W and averaging them. The value of 1.33\u00b0 is based on the resolution of satellite dataset from AVISO. We followed the same method, except using the dataset from CMEMS, which has a 0.25\u00b0x0.25\u00b0 resolution. Therefore we select points every 1\u00b0 between 52\u00b0 and 72\u00b0 and average them, and there are 21 points in total.\n77\n\n\f78\n\nCHAPTER 18.

(2019), ocean temperature data from NOAA NODC were sorted by latitude, longitude, and time using a resolution of 1\u00b0of longitude, latitude, and 3 months of time, respectively, with a Gaussian squared weighting from the selected desired point in a window twice the size of the desired resolution. Editing was used to reject duplicate samples and 3 outliers from each selected sample point prior to performing the weighting and averaging; the latter was only carried out when there were at least three data points in the selected interval for each sample point. Typically, 50 or more data values were available. The resulting temperature feld was therefore smoothed. Data along the Gulf Stream north wall at nine data points were used to assemble a spatial/temporal sampling of the temperature at 200m data along the north wall from 75\u00b0W to 55\u00b0W. The leading mode of temperature variability of the Gulf Stream is equivalent to a\n\n\f18.2. 2019 METHODS\n\n79\n\nnorth-south shift of 50\u00ad100 km, which is zonally of one sign and amounts to 50% of the seasonal-interannual variance between 75\u00b0W and 55\u00b0W. The temporal behavior of this mode (PC1) shows the temporal shift of the Gulf Stream path with a dominant approximately 8- to 10-year periodicity over much of the period.\n\n18.2.1 Data Sources\nOcean temperatures at 200 m are available at https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/.\n\n18.2.2 Data analysis\nFor detailed analytical methods, see Joyce et al.

The eDealer data were supplemented with GulfFIN records and vessel logbook catches for which no dealer reports were submitted.\n20.1.2 Data extraction\nData were processed for Fisheries of the United States and then aggregated by regions to avoid confdentiality issues. Data of Atlantic shark, swordfsh, bigeye tuna, albacore tuna, yellowfn tuna and skipjack tuna were initially extracted from our eDealer database. Additional landings of these HMS not in eDealer were found in GulfFIN records. Bluefn tuna landings data from the Bluefn Tuna Dealer reports in SAFIS were also extracted and combined with the eDealer data for other HMS . Procedures of quality assurance were conducted. Duplicate records were removed from the data. This may occur from multiple submissions of reports by the same dealer. It may also occur when two or more dealers report the same landings in \"Packing\" situations. While most vessels immediately sell their catch to the dealer at their port of landing, some vessels sell their catch to a dealer(s) in another location. Transport to\n83\n\n\f84\n\nCHAPTER 20.

This processing activity is done by the dealer at the port of landing and is referred to as \"Packing\". Dierences in federal and state defnitions of who is considered the \"dealer\" of the product, and thus ultimately responsible for submitting the landings report, often results in multiple reports being created for the same landings. These duplicate reports need to be accounted for when summarizing the data to refect accurate landings. Therefore, searches for duplicate reports of the same landing were conducted and eliminated prior to summarizing the data for the Fisheries of the United States.\nRevenue from sales to the aquarium trade were also excluded to avoid extreme values associated with shipping live specimens.\nAll reported landings were converted to live weights using conversion ratios appropriate for the species/species group and reported grade of the product. Shark fns were not reported to live weight as these weights are included in the converted whole weight of the reported shark landing.\nPrice per pound was used to determine the ex-vessel value. For landings with prices per pound reported as \"N/A\", 0, $0.01 or left blank, average prices were calculated for each species and state. Those averages replaced the missing values to determine landings revenue.\nThe extract only includes species with more than $1,000 in landings in the region for that year to avoid issues with data confdentiality. Other species landed include: tiger sharks, porbeagle, bonnethead, blacknose, blue, lemon, silky and smooth hammerhead sharks. However, these are not reported because of low volume and resulting data confdentiality issues.\n20.1.3 Data analysis\nHigh migratory landings include 19 species of tunas, sharks and swordfsh (table @(tab:hms-spp)).\nData were processed and analyzed using SAS and Microsoft Excel pivot tables.

Walsh Data steward: Harvey Walsh, harvey.walsh@noaa.gov Point of contact: Harvey Walsh, harvey.walsh@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data are available to the public here. Derived data for this indicator are available here.\n21.1 Methods\nData from the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Oceans and Climate branch (OCB) public dataset were used to examine changes in diversity of abundance among 45 ichthyoplankton taxa. The 45 taxa were established (Walsh et al. 2015), and include the most abundant taxa from the 1970s to present that represent consistency in the identifcation of larvae.\n21.1.1 Data sources\nMulti-species plankton surveys cover the entire Northeast US shelf from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, four to six times per year. A random-stratifed design based on the NEFSC bottom trawl survey design (Azarovitz 1981) is used to collect samples from 47 strata. The number of strata is lower than the trawl survey as many of the narrow inshore and shelf-break strata are combined in the EcoMon design. The area encompassed by each stratum determined the number of samples in each stratum. Samples were collected both day and night using a 61 cm bongo net. Net tow speed was 1.5 knots and maximum sample depth was 200 m. Double oblique tows were a minimum of 5 mintues in duration, and fshed from the surface to within 5 m of the seabed or to a maximum depth of 200 m. The volume fltered of all collections was measured with mechanical fowmeters mounted across the mouth of each net. Processing of most samples was conducted at the Morski Instytut Rybacki (MIR) in Szczecin, Poland; the remaining samples were processed at the NEFSC or the Atlantic Reference Center, St Andrews, Canada. Larvae were identifed to the lowest possible taxa and enumerated for each sample. Taxon abundance for each station was standardized to number under 10 m-2 sea surface.\n87\n\n\f88\n\nCHAPTER 21.

Time series of stratifed mean biomass were calculated for ME/NH and NEAMAP surveys through the following procedure:\n1. All species catch weights were summed for each tow and for each feeding guild category. 2. The average weight per tow, associated variances and standard deviation for each survey, region,\nstratum, and feeding guild was calculated. 3. Stratifed mean biomass was then calculated as the sum of the weighted averages of the strata, where\nthe weight of a given stratum was the proportion of the survey area accounted for by that stratum.\nStratifed mean biomass was also calculated for the MA Inshore Bottom Trawl Survey. These calculations followed those used to fnd stratifed mean biomass by feeding guild in the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey and are described in greater detail here.

Processed time series can be found here.\n24.1 Methods\nWe presented two indicator time series for reports of algal blooms in the southern portion of Chesapeake Bay between 2007-2017. The frst indicator was observations of algal blooms above 5000 cell ml-1. This threshold was developed by the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) for Microcystis spp. algal blooms based on World Health Organization guidelines (Organization 2003; Health 2011). VDH also uses this same threshold for other algal species blooms in Virginia waters. When cell concentrations are above 5000 cell ml-1, VDH recommends initiation of biweekly water sampling and that relevant local agencies be notifed of the elevated cell concentrations. The second indicator we reported, blooms of Cochlodinium polykrikoides at cell concentrations >300 cell ml-1, was chosen due to reports of high ichthyotoxicity seen at these levels. Tang and Gobler (2009) showed that fsh exposed to cultured C. polykrikoides at densities as low 330 cells ml-1 saw 100% mortality within 1 hour, which if often far less than C. polykrikoides cell concentrations seen in the feld. Algal bloom data were not available for 2015 nor 2010. The algal bloom information presented here are a synthesis of reported events, and has been updated to include data not presented in the 2018 State of the Ecosystem Report.\n24.1.1 Data sources\nSource data were obtained from VDH. Sampling, identifcation, and bloom characterization was completed by the VDH, Phytoplankton Analysis Laboratory at Old Dominion University (ODU), Reece Lab at the\n99\n\n\f100\n\nCHAPTER 24.

Standard detection methods were used to identify the presence of toxins associated with Amnesic Shellfsh Poisoning (ASP), Paralytic Shellfsh Poisoning (PSP), and Diarrhetic Shellfsh Poisoning (DSP) by state and federal laboratories.\n25.1.0.1 Paralytic Shellfsh Poisoning The most common cause of shellfsh bed closures in New England is the presence of paralytic shellfsh toxins (PSTs) produced by the dinofagellate Alexandrium catenella. All New England states except Maine relied on the Association of O\u00ffcial Analytical Chemists (AOAC) approved mouse bioassay method to detect PSTs in shellfsh during the 2007-2016 period reported here (International 2005). In Maine, PST detection methods were updated in May 2014 when the state adopted the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) UPLC-MS/MS protocol (Boundy et al. 2015) in concordance with National Shellfsh Sanitation Program (NSSP) requirements. Prior to this, the primary method used to detect PST in Maine was with the mouse bioassay.\n101\n\n\f102\n\nCHAPTER 25.

In New England, a UV-HPLC method (Quilliam, Xie, and Hardsta 1995), which specifes a HPLC-UV protocol, is used for ASP detection.\n25.1.0.3 Diarrhetic Shellfsh Poisoning Diarrhetic Shellfsh Poisoning (DSP) is rare in New England waters, but the presence of the DSP-associated okadaic acid (OA) in mussels was confrmed in Massachusetts in 2015 (J. Deeds, personal communication, July 7, 2018).

On observed tows, observers must fully document all kept and discarded species encountered. Observers must comply with a Species Verifcation Program (SVP), which requires photo or sample submissions of high priority species at least once per quarter. Photos and samples submitted for verifcation are identifed independently by at least two reviewers. The derived data presented in the Mid-Atlantic State of the Ecosystem report for southern kingfsh include records verifed by the SVP program only. The occurrence of southern kingfsh in SVP records were chosen for inclusion in the report due to the recent increases of the species in SVP observer records since 2010. These data are not a complete list from the New England Fisheries Observer Program (NEFOP). Southern Kingfsh are less common than Northern Kingfsh in observer data and are possibly misidentifed so we have initially included records here only when a specimen record was submitted to and verifed through the SVP (see Data extraction).\n27.1.2 Data extraction\nSQL query for observer data extraction can be found here.\n107\n\n\f108\n\nCHAPTER 27. VERIFIED RECORDS OF SOUTHERN KINGFISH\n\n27.1.3 Data analysis\nTime series were summed by year and plotted, and mapped data for individual records were plotted according to the location where gear was hauled. As coordinate data were not always available for each record, the map does not include all occurrences of southern kingfsh, but was included for spatial context.\n\n27.1.4 Plotting\nCode used to produce the plot below can be found here.\n\nFigure 27.1: Verifed records of Southern Kingfsh occurrence in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\fChapter 28\nHabitat Occupancy Models\nDescription: Habitat Occupancy Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2018), State of the Ecosystem Mid-Atlantic (2018) Indicator category: Database pull with analysis; Extensive analysis; not yet published; Published methods Contributor(s): Kevin Friedland Data steward: Kevin Friedland, kevin.friedland@noaa.gov Point of contact: Kevin Friedland, kevin.friedland@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data are available upon request (see Survdat, CHL/PP, and Data Sources below for more information). Model-derived time series are available here.\n28.1 Methods\nHabitat area with a probability of occupancy greater than 0.5 was modeled for many species throughout the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (NE-LME) using random forest decision tree models.\n28.1.1 Data sources\nModels were parameterized using a suite of static and dynamic predictor variables, with occurrence and catch per unit eort (CPUE) of species from spring and fall Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) bottom trawl surveys (BTS) serving as response variables. Sources of variables used in the analyses are described below.\n28.1.1.1 Station depth The NEFSC BTS data included depth observations made concurrently with trawls at each station. Station depth was a static variable for these analyses.\n28.1.1.2 Ocean temperature and salinity Sea surface and bottom water temperature and salinity measurements were included as dynamic predictor variables in the model, and were collected using Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) instruments. Ocean temperature and salinity measurements had the highest temporal coverage during the spring (February-April) and fall (September-November) months. Station salinity data were available between 1992-2016.\n109\n\n\f110\n\nCHAPTER 28. HABITAT OCCUPANCY MODELS\n\n28.1.1.3 Habitat descriptors\nA variety of benthic habitat descriptors were incorporated as predictor variables in occupancy models (Table 28.1). The majority of these parameters are based on depth (e.g. BPI, VRM, Prcury, rugosity, seabedforms, slp, and slpslp). The vorticity variable is based on current estimates, and the variable soft_sed based on sediment grain size.\n\n\f28.1. METHODS\n\nTable 28.1: Habitat descriptors used in model parameterization.\n\nVariables\nNamera_vrm Prcurv (2 km, 10 km, and 20 km) Rugosity seabedforms Slp (2 km, 10 km, and 20 km)\nSlpslp (2 km, 10 km, and 20 km) soft_sed Vort (fall - fa; spring - sp; summer - su; winter - wi)\n\nNotes\nVector Ruggedness Measure (VRM) measures terrain ruggedness as the variation in three-dimensional orientation of grid cells with Benthic profle curvature at 2km, 10km and 20 km spatial scales was derived from depth data.

HABITAT OCCUPANCY MODELS\n\n28.1.1.4 Zooplankton\nZooplankton data are acquired through the NEFSC Ecosystem Monitoring Program (\"EcoMon\"). For more information regarding the collection process for these data, see Kane (2007), Kane (2011), and Morse et al. (2017). The bio-volume of the 18 most abundant zooplankton taxa were considered as potential predictor variables.\n\n28.1.1.5 Remote sensing data\nBoth chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) from remote sensing sources were incorporated as static predictor variables in the model. During the period of 1997-2016, chlorophyll concentrations were derived from observations made by the Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor (SeaWIFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Visible and Infrared Imaging/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS).\n\n28.1.2 Data processing\n28.1.2.1 Zooplankton\nMissing values in the EcoMon time series were addressed by summing data over fve-year time steps for each seasonal time frame and interpolating a complete feld using ordinary kriging. Missing values necessitated interpolation for spring data in 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1994. The same was true of the fall data for 1989, 1990, and 1992.\n\n28.1.2.2 Remote sensing data\nAn overlapping time series of observations from the four sensors listed above was created using a bio-optical model inversion algorithm (Maritorena et al. 2010). Monthly SST data were derived from MODIS-Terra sensor data (available here).\n\n28.1.2.3 Ocean temperature and salinity\nDate of collection corrections for ocean temperature data were developed using linear regressions for the spring and fall time frames; standardizing to collection dates of April 3 and October 11 for spring and fall. No correction was performed for salinity data. Annual data for ocean temperature and salinity were combined with climatology by season through an optimal interpolation approach. Specifcally, mean bottom temperature or salinity was calculated by year and season on a 0.5\u00b0 grid across the ecosystem, and data from grid cells with >80% temporal coverage were used to calculate a fnal seasonal mean. Annual seasonal means were then used to calculate combined anomalies for seasonal surface and bottom climatologies.\nAn annual feld was then estimated using raw data observations for a year, season, and depth using universal kriging (Hiemstra et al. 2008), with depth included as a covariate (on a standard 0.1\u00b0 grid). This feld was then combined with the climatology anomaly feld and adjusted by the annual mean using the variance feld from kriging as the basis for a weighted mean between the two. The variance feld was divided into quartiles with the lowest quartile assigned a weighting of 4:1 between the annual and climatology values. The optimally interpolated feld at these locations was therefore skewed towards the annual data, refecting their proximity to actual data locations and associated low kriging variance. The highest kriging variance quartile (1:1) refected less information from the annual feld and more from the climatology.\n\n28.1.3 Data analysis\n28.1.3.1 Occupancy models\nPrior to ftting the occupancy models, predictor variables were tested for multi-collinearity and removed if found to be correlated. The fnal model variables were then chosen utilizing a model selection process as\n\n\f28.1. METHODS\n\n113\n\nshown by Murphy, Evans, and Storfer (2010) and implemented with the R package rfUtilities (Evans and Murphy 2018). Occupancy models were then ft as two-factor classifcation models (absence as 0 and presence as 1) using the randomForest R package (Liaw and Wiener 2002).\n28.1.3.2 Selection criteria and variable importance\nThe irr R package (Gamer, Lemon, and Singh 2012) was used to calculate Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Cohen's Kappa for assessing accuracy of occupancy habitat models. Variable importance was assessed by plotting the occurrence of a variable as a root variable versus the mean minimum node depth for the variable (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017), as well as by plotting the Gini index decrease versus accuracy decrease.\n\n28.1.4 Plotting\n\nFigure 28.1: Summer founder spring (A) and fall (B) occupancy habitat area in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem.\n\n\f114\n\nCHAPTER 28.

The amount of potential yield we can expect from a marine ecosystem depends on the amount of production entering at the base of the food web, primarily in the form of phytoplankton; the pathways this energy follows to reach harvested species; the e\u00ffciency of transfer of energy at each step in the food web; and the fraction of this production that is removed by the fsheries. Species such as scallops and clams primarily feed directly on larger phytoplankton species and therefore require only one step in the transfer of energy. The loss of energy at each step can exceed 80-90%. For many fsh species, as many as 2-4 steps may be necessary. Given the trophic level and the e\u00ffciency of energy transfer of the species in the ecosystem the amount phytoplankton production required (PPR) to account for the observed catch can be estimated.\nThe index for Primary Production Required (PPR) was adapted from (Pauly and Christensen 1995).\n\nP P Rt\n\n=\n\nnt\nX\n\n landingst,i 9\n\n\n\n 1 TE\n\nT Li-1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere nt = number of species in time t, landingst,i = landings of species i in time t, T Li is the trophic level of species i, T E = Trophic e\u00ffciency. The PPR estimate assumes a 9:1 ratio for the conversion of wet weight to carbon and a 15% transfer e\u00ffciency per trophic level, (T E = 0.15)\n\nThe index is presented as a percentage of estimated primary production (PP) available over the geographic region of interest, termed an Ecological Production Unit (EPU). The scaled index is estimated by dividing the PPR index in year t by the estimated primary production in time t.\n\n115\n\n\f116\n\nCHAPTER 29. PRIMARY PRODUCTION REQUIRED\n\nscaledP P Rt\n\n=\n\nP P Rt P Pt\n\nThe species selected in each year were determined by their cumulative contribution to total landings. A threshold of at least 80% of the total landings is used.\n\n29.1.1 Data sources\nData for this index come from a variety of sources. The landings data come from the Commercial Fishery Database (CFDBS), species trophic level information come from fshbase and sealifebase, and primary production estimates are derived from satellites. Some of these data are typically not available to the public.\n\n29.1.2 Data extraction\nLandings are extracted from the commercial fsheries database (CFDBS) using the methods described in the chapter Commercial Landings Data.\nTrophic level information for each species is obtained from fshbase and sealifebase using the R package rfshbase (Froese and Pauly 2019) in tandem with the package indexPPR.\nPrimary Production is estimated using the methods described in the chapter Chlorophyll a and Primary Production.\n\n29.1.3 Data analysis\nAnnual (wet weight) landings are calculated for each species for a given EPU. For each year the landings are sorted in descending order by species and the cumulative landings are calculated. The top species that accounted for 80% of total cumulative landings are selected. The trophic level for each of these species are then obtained from fshbase/sealifebase. At this point the PPR index is calculated. The units of the index are gCyear-1 for the EPU. The index is converted to gCm-2year-1 by dividing by the area (in m2) of the EPU.\nTo normalize the index the total Primiary Production for the given EPU is required. This is calculated as described in the chapter Chlorophyll a and Primary Production. The units are also converted to g C m-2 y ear-1 .\nThe index is then normalized by dividing the index in year t by the total primary production in time t.\n\n29.1.4 Plotting\nFour plots are produced for each EPU:\n\u00b7 The normalized PPR index (along with the associated landings). \u00b7 Total primary production \u00b7 Mean trophic level of the species included in the index (weighted by their landings) \u00b7 Species composition of landings\nAll created using the indexPPR\nSee the workedExample vignette in the indexPPR package for plotting code.\nFigures for Mid-Atlantic Bight are presented in this document.

This threshold was then used to calculate a small and large fsh index (numbers below and above the threshold, respectively) each year. Although the length percentile corresponding to age-1 fsh will vary with species, we use the 20th percentile as an approximation. Biomass was calculated using length\u00adweight relationships directly from the survey data. Following Wigley, McBride, and McHugh (2003), the length-weight relationship was modeled as\nln W = ln a + b ln L where W is weight (kg), L is length (cm), and a and b are parameters ft via linear regression.

It was quickly determined that these species were extremely rare in the bottom trawl survey. When a species was present, they were found during the fall survey and not the spring. No trends were apparent in the data. The one species that was commonly present was the blue runner (Caranx crysos). Stations were binned temporally by three categories: Prior to 2001, 2001 - 2010, and since 2010.

The locations of observation blinds within each site were chosen to maximize the number of visible nests, and provisioning observations took place between mid-June and early August annually. Observations of chick diet were made during one or two, three to four hour periods throughout the day, but typically proceed according to nest activity levels (moreso in the morning hours). Observations began with chicks as soon as they hatched, and continue until the chicks fedged or died. Most common tern prey species were identifable to the species level due to distinct size, color and shape. However, when identifcation was not possible or was unclear, prey species were listed as \"unknown\" or \"unknown fsh\". More detailed methods can be found in Hall, Kress, and Gri\u00ffn (2000). Nest productivity Common tern nest productivity, in terms of the number of fedged chicks per nest, was collected annually from fenced enclosures at island nesting sites (known as \"productivity plots\"). Newly hatched chicks within these enclosures were weighed, marked or banded, and observed until fedging, death, or until a 15 day period had passed when chicks were assumed to have fedged. Productivity was also quantifed from observer blinds for nests outside of the productivity plots where chicks were marked for identifcation. More detailed methods for quantifying nest productivity can be found in Hall and Kress (2004)\n135\n\n\f136\n\nCHAPTER 34.

The data extend from 1981 to present, and provide a 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 global grid of SST measurements (Reynolds et al. 2007).\n36.1.2 Data extraction\nIndividual fles containing daily mean SST data for each year during the period of 1981-present were downloaded from the OI SST V5 site. Yearly data provided as layered rasters were masked according to the extent of Northeast US Continental Shelf. Data were split into three month seasons for (Winter = Jan, Feb, Mar; Spring = Apr, May, Jun; Summer = July, August, September; Fall = Oct, Nov, Dec).\n36.1.3 Data analysis\nWe calculated the long-term mean (LTM) for each season-specifc stack of rasters over the period of 1982-2010, and then subtracted the (LTM) from daily mean SST values to fnd the SST anomaly for a given year.

Early measurements were made using water samples collected primarily with Niskin bottles at discreet depths, mechanical bathythermographs and expendable bathythermograph probes, but by 1991 the CTD \u00ad an acronym for conductivity temperature and depth \u00ad became standard equipment on all NEFSC surveys.\n38.1.2 Data extraction\nWhile all processed hydrographic data are archived in an Oracle database (OCDBS), we work from Matlabformatted fles stored locally.\n38.1.3 Data analysis\nTemperature and salinity measurements are examined to assess the composition of the waters entering the Gulf of Maine through the Northeast Channel. The analysis closely follows the methodology described by D. G. Mountain (2012). This method assumes that the waters fowing into the Northeast Channel between 150 and 200 meters depth are composed of slope waters, originating oshore of the continental shelf, and shelf waters, originating on the continental shelf south of Nova Scotia.\n145\n\n\f146\n\nCHAPTER 38. SLOPEWATER PROPORTIONS\n\nFor each survey in the hydrographic archive, ocean temperature and salinity observations sampled in the area just inside the Northeast Channel (bounded by 42.2-42.6\u00b0latitude north and 66-66.8\u00b0longitude west) and between 150 - 200 meters depth are extracted and a volume-weighted average temperature and salinity is calculated. The volume weighting is accomplished by apportioning the area within the Northeast Channel polygon among the stations occupying the region, based on inverse distance squared weighting. The result of this calculation is a timeseries of volume-average temperature and salinity having a temporal resolution that matches the survey frequency in the database.\nThe average temperature and salinity observed at depth in the Northeast Channel is assumed to be the product of mixing between three distinct sources having the following temperature and salinity characteristics: (1) Warm Slope Water (T=10 \u00b0C, S=35), (2) Labrador Slope Water (T=6 \u00b0C, S=34.7) and (3) Scotian Shelf Water (T=2 \u00b0C, S=32). As described by D. G. Mountain (2012), the relative proportion of each source is determined via a rudimentary 3-point mixing algorithm. On a temperature-salinity diagram, lines connecting the T-S coordinates for these three sources form a triangle, the sides of which represent mixing lines between the sources. A water sample that is a mixture of two sources will have a temperature and salinity that falls somewhere along the line connecting the two sources on the temperature-salinity diagram. Observations of temperature and salinity collected within the Northeast Channel would be expected to fall within the triangle if the water sampled is a mixture of the three sources. Simple geometry allows us to calculate the relative proportion of each source in a given measurement. As an example, a line drawn from the T-S point representing shelf water through an observed T-S in the center of the triangle will intersect the opposite side of the triangle (the mixing line connecting the coordinates of the two slope water sources). This intersecting T-S value may then be used to calculate the relative proportions (percentage) of the two slope water sources. Using this method, the percentage of Labrador slope water and Warm slope water are determined for the timeseries of volume-average temperature and salinity.\nIt should be noted that our method assumes that the temperature and salinity properties associated with the source watermasses are constant. In reality, these may vary from year to year, modifed by atmospheric forcing, mixing and/or advective processes. Likewise, other sources are periodically introduced into the Northeast Channel, including intrusions of Gulf Stream water fowing into the Gulf of Maine and modifed shelf water fowing out of the Gulf of Maine along the fank of Georges Bank. These sources are not explicitely considered in the 3-point mixing algorithm and may introduce errors in the proportional estimates. Code used to calculate slopewater proportions can be found here.\n\n38.1.4 Data processing\nSource data were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the R code found here.\n\n38.1.5 Plotting\nCode used to create the fgure below can be found here.\n\n\f38.1.

These fgures characterize the probability of a species occurring in a given area based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Bottom Trawl Survey data. Kernel density estimates (KDEs) of distributions are shown for the period of 1970-1979 (shaded blue) and most recent three years of survey data (shaded red) (e.g. Figure 39.1). Results are typically visualized for spring and fall bottom trawl surveys seperately. Three probability levels (25%, 50%, 75%) are shown for each time period, where the 25% region depicts the core area of the distribution and the 75% region shows the area occupied more broadly by the species. A wide array of KDEs for many ecologically and economically important species on the Northeast US Continental Shelf are available here.\n39.1.1 Data sources\nCurrent and historical species distributions are based on the NEFSC Bottom Trawl Survey data (aka \"Survdat\") and depth strata.

Derived data may be downloaded here.\n40.1 Methods\nThree metrics quantifying spatial-temporal distribution shifts within fsh populations were developed by Friedland et al. (2018), including mean depth, along-shelf distance, and distance to coastline. Along-shelf distance is a metric for quantifying the distribution of a species through time along the axis of the US Northeast Continental Shelf, which extends northeastward from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Values in the derived time series correspond to mean distance in km from the southwest origin of the along-shelf axis at 0 km. The along-shelf axis begins at 76.53\u00b0W 34.60\u00b0N and terminates at 65.71\u00b0W 43.49\u00b0N.

Stomach fullness may be a better measure than absolute stomach weight if combining across species into a feeding guild, to prevent larger animals with heavier stomachs from dominating the index.

Derived data used in SOE reports are available here.\n42.1 Methods\nThe Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) has been conducting standardized bottom trawl surveys in the fall since 1963 and spring since 1968. The surveys follow a stratifed random design. Fish species and several invertebrate species are enumerated on a tow by tow basis (Azarovitz 1981). The data are housed in the NEFSC's survey database (SVDBS) maintained by the Ecosystem Survey Branch. Direct pulls from the database are not advisable as there have been several gear modifcations and vessel changes over the course of the time series (Miller et al. 2010). Survdat was developed as a database query that applies the appropriate calibration factors for a seamless time series since the 1960s. As such, it is the base for many of the other analyses conducted for the State of the Ecosystem report that involve fsheries independent data. The Survdat script can be broken down into two sections. The frst pulls the raw data from SVDBS. While the script is able to pull data from more than just the spring and fall bottom trawl surveys, for the purposes of the State of the Ecosystem reports only the spring and fall data are used. Survdat identifes those research cruises associated with the seasonal bottom trawl surveys and pulls the station and biological data. Station data includes tow identifcation (cruise, station, and stratum), tow location and date, as well as several environmental variables (depth, surface/bottom salinity, and surface/bottom temperature). Stations are fltered for representativness using a station, haul, gear (SHG) code for tows prior to 2009 and a tow, operations, gear, and aquisition (TOGA) code from 2009 onward. The codes that correspond to a representative tow (SHG <= 136 or TOGA <= 1324) are the same used by assessment biologists at the\n155\n\n\f156\n\nCHAPTER 42.

Biological data includes the total biomass and abundance by species, as well as lengths and number at length.\nThe second section of the Survdat script applies the calibration factors. There are four calibrartion factors applied (Table 42.1). Calibration factors are pulled directly from SVDBS. Vessel conversions were made from either the NOAA Ship Delaware II or NOAA Ship Henry Bigelow to the NOAA Ship Albatross IV which was the primary vessel for most of the time series. The Albatross was decommisioned in 2009 and the Bigelow is now the primary vessel for the bottom trawl survey.\nThe output from Survdat is an RData fle that contains all the station and biological data, corrected as noted above, from the NEFSC Spring Bottom Trawl Survey and NEFSC Fall Bottom Trawl Survey. The RData fle is a data.table, a powerful wrapper for the base data.frame (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ data.table/data.table.pdf). There are also a series of tools that have been developed in order to utilize the Survdat data set (https://github.com/slucey/RSurvey).\n42.1.1 Data sources\nSurvdat is a database query of the NEFSC survey database (SVDBS).These data are available to qualifed researchers upon request. More information on the data request process is available under the \"Access Information\" feld here.\n42.1.2 Data extraction\nExtraction methods are described above. The R code found here was used in the survey data extraction process.\n42.1.3 Data analysis\nThe fsheries independent data contained within the Survdat is used in a variety of products; the more complicated analyses are detailed in their own sections. The most straightforward use of this data is for the resource species aggregate biomass indicators. For the purposes of the aggregate biomass indicators, fall and spring survey data are treated separately. Additionally, all length data is dropped and species seperated by sex at the catch level are merged back together.\nSince 2020, survey strata where characterized as being within an Ecological Production Unit based on where at least 50% of the area of the strata was located (Figure 42.1.3. While this does not create a perfect match for the EPU boundaries it allows us to calculate the variance associated with the index as the survey was designed.\n\\begin{fgure}\n\n\f42.1.

Next, the total number of stations within each EPU per year is counted using unique station records. Biomass is summed by species per year per EPU. Those sums are divided by the appropriate station count to get the EPU mean. Finally, the mean biomasses are summed by aggregate groups. These steps are encompassed in the processing\ncode, which also includes steps taken to format the data set for inclusion in the ecodata R package.\n42.1.4 Plotting\nCode used to create the fgure below can be found here\n\nPiscivore Spring\n200 100\n0 1975 1985\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\nPiscivore Fall\n\n2015\n\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\nBenthivore Spring 150 100\n50 0 1975 1985\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\nBenthivore Fall\n\n2015\n\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\nPlanktivore Spring\n100 50 0\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\nPlanktivore Fall\n\n2015\n\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\nBenthos Spring 9 6 3 0\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\nBenthos Fall\n\n2015\n\n1975 1985\n\n1995\n\n2005 2005 2005 2005\n\n2015 2015 2015 2015\n\nFigure 42.1: Spring (left) and fall (right) surveyed biomass in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.

Model outputs for thermal\nhabitat projections are available here.\n43.1 Methods\nThis indicator is based on work reported in Kleisner et al. (2017).\n43.1.1 Data sources\n43.1.1.1 Global Climate Model Projection We used National Oceanographic and Atmosheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA GFDL) CM2.6 simulation consisting of (1) a 1860 pre-industrial control, which brings the climate system into near-equilibrium with 1860 greenhouse gas concentrations, and (2) a transient climate response (2xCO2) simulation where atmospheric CO2 is increased by 1% per year, which results in a doubling of CO2\nafter 70 years. The climate change response from CM2.6 was based on the dierence between these two experimental runs. Refer to Saba et al. (2016) for further details.\n43.1.1.2 Modeling Changes in Suitable Thermal Habitat The NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center, U.S. Northeast Shelf (NES) bottom trawl survey, which has been conducted for almost 50-years in the spring and fall, provides a rich source of data on historical and current marine species distribution, abundance, and habitat, as well as oceanographic conditions (Azarovitz 1981). The survey was implemented to meet several objectives: (1) monitor trends in abundance, biomass,\nand recruitment, (2) monitor the geographic distribution of species, (3) monitor ecosystem changes, (4) monitor changes in life history traits (e.g., trends in growth, longevity, mortality, and maturation, and food\n159\n\n\f160\n\nCHAPTER 43. THERMAL HABITAT PROJECTIONS\n\nhabits), and (5) collect baseline oceanographic and environmental data. These data can be leveraged for exploring future changes in the patterns of abundance and distribution of species in the region.\n\n43.1.2 Data analysis\n43.1.2.1 Global Climate Model Projection\nThe CM2.6 80-year projections can be roughly assigned to a time period by using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which describe four dierent 21st century pathways of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutant emissions, and land use (IPCC\n2014). There are four RCPs, ranging from a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), and one scenario with very high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5). For RCP8.5, the global average temperature at the surface warms by 2C by approximately 2060-2070 relative to the 1986-2005 climatology (see Figure SPM.7a in IPCC, 2013). For CM2.6, the global average temperature warms by 2C by approximately years 60-80 (see Fig. 1 in Winton et al. (2014)). Therefore, the last 20 years\nof the transient climate response simulation roughly corresponds to 2060-2080 of the RCP8.5 scenario.\nHere, the monthly dierences in surface and bottom temperatures (`deltas') for spring (February-April) and fall (September- November) are added to an average annual temperature climatology for spring and fall, respectively, derived from observed surface and bottom temperatures to produce an 80-year time series of\nfuture bottom and surface temperatures in both seasons. The observed temperatures come from the NEFSC spring and fall bottom trawl surveys conducted from 1968 to 2013 and represent approximately 30,000 observations over the time series.\n\n43.1.2.2 Modeling Changes in Suitable Thermal Habitat\nWe modeled individual species thermal habitat across the whole U.S. NES and not by sub-region because we did not want to assume that species would necessarily maintain these assemblages in the future. Indeed, the goal here is to determine future patterns of thermal habitat availability for species on the U.S. NES in more\nbroad terms. We ft one generalizaed additive model (GAM) based on both spring and fall data (i.e., an annual model as opposed to separate spring and fall models) and use it to project potential changes in distribution and magnitude of biomass separately for each season for each species. By creating a single annual model based on temperature data from both spring and fall, we ensure that the full thermal envelope of each species is represented. For example, if a species with a wide thermal tolerance has historically been found in cooler waters in the spring, and in warmer waters in the fall, an annual model will ensure that if there are warmer waters in the spring in the future, that species will have the potential to inhabit those\nareas. Additionally, because the trawl survey data are subject to many zero observations, we use delta-lognormal GAMs (Wood 2011), which model presence-absence separately from logged positive observations. The response variables in each of the GAMs are presence/absence and logged positive biomass\nof each assemblage or individual species, respectively. A binomial link function is used in the presence/absence models and a Gaussian link function is used in the models with logged positive biomass. The predictor variables are surface and bottom temperature and depth (all measured by the survey at each station), ft with penalized regression splines, and survey stratum, which accounts for dierences in regional habitat quality across the survey region. Stratum may be considered to account for additional information\nnot explicitly measured by the survey (e.g., bottom rugosity). Predictions of species abundance are calculated as the product of the predictions from the presence-absence model, the exponentiated predictions\nfrom the logged positive biomass model, and a correction factor to account for the retransformation bias associated with the log transformation (Duan 1983; and see Pinsky et al. 2013).\nWe calculated the suitable thermal habitat both in terms of changes in `suitable thermal abundance', defned as the species density possible given appropriate temperature, depth and bathymetric conditions, and\nchanges in `suitable thermal area', defned as the size of the physical area potentially occupied by a species given appropriate temperature, depth and bathymetric conditions. Suitable thermal abundance is\ndetermined from the predictions from the GAMs (i.e., a prediction of biomass). However, this quantity\n\n\f43.1. METHODS\n\n161\n\nshould not be interpreted directly as a change in future abundance or biomass, but instead as the potential abundance of a species in the future given changes in temperature and holding all else (e.g., fshing eort, species interactions, productivity, etc.) constant. Suitable thermal area is determined as a change in the suitable area that a species distribution occupies in the future and is derived from the area of the kernel density of the distribution. To ensure that the estimates are conservative, we select all points with values greater than one standard deviation above the mean. We then compute the area of these kernels using the\ngArea function from the rgeos package in R (Bivand et al. 2011).\n\n43.1.3 Plotting\n\n46\n\n46\n\n44\n\n42\n\nA\n\nB\n\n44\n\nThermal Habitat\n1\n\n42\n\n0.8\n\n40\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n38\n\n0\n\n40\n\n38\n\n36\n\n36\n\n34\n\n34\n\n-76\n\n-74\n\n-72\n\n-70\n\n-68\n\n-66\n\n-76\n\n-74\n\n-72\n\n-70\n\n-68\n\n-66\n\nFigure 43.1: Current thermal habitat estimate (A), and 20-40 year thermal habitat projection (B) for summer founder on the Northeast Continental Shelf.\nNote: The thermal habitat model output for all species presented in State of the Ecosystem reports is accessible through the NEFSC ERDDAP server.\n\n\f162\n\nCHAPTER 43.

Prior to 2018, time series indicators in State of the Ecosystem reports were presented with trend lines based on a Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trends to test signifcance (p < 0.05) of both long term (full time series) and recent (2007\u00ad2016) trends, although not all time series were considered for\ntrend analysis due to limited series lengths. There was also concern that a Mann-Kendall test would not account for any autocorrelation present in State of the Ecosystem (SOE) indicators.\nIn a simulation study (Hardison et al. 2019), we explored the eect of time series length and autocorrelation strength on statistical power of three trend detection methods: a generalized least squares model selection\napproach, the Mann-Kendall test, and Mann-Kendall test with trend-free pre-whitening. Methods were applied to simulated time series of varying trend and autocorrelation strengths. Overall, when sample size\nwas low (N = 10) there were high rates of false trend detection, and similarly, low rates of true trend detection. Both of these forms of error were further amplifed by autocorrelation in the trend residuals. Based on these fndings, we selected a minimum series length of N = 30 for indicator time series before\nassessing trend. We also chose to use a GLS model selection (GLS-MS) approach to evaluate indicator trends in the 2018 (and future) State of the Ecosystem reports, as this approach performed best overall in the simulation study. GLS-MS also allowed for both linear and quadratic model fts and quantifcation of uncertainty in trend estimates. The model selection procedure for the GLS approach fts four models to each time series and selects the best ftting model using AICc. The models are, 1) linear trend with uncorrelated residuals, 2)\n163\n\n\f164\n\nCHAPTER 44. TREND ANALYSIS\n\nlinear trend with correlated residuals, 3) quadratic trend with uncorrelated residuals, and 4) quadratic trend with correlated residuals. I.e., the models are of the form\n\nYt = 0 + 1Xt + 2Xt2 + t t = ^t-1 + !t\n\nwt  N (0, 2)\nWhere Yt is the observation in time t, Xt is the time index, t is the residual in time t, and !t is a normally distributed random variable. Setting 2 = 0 yields the linear trend model, and ^ = 0 yields the uncorrelated\nresiduals model. The best ft model was tested against the null hypothesis of no trend through a likelihood ratio test (p < 0.05). All models were ft using the R package nlme (Pinheiro et al. 2017) and AICc was calculated using the R package AICcmodavg (Mazerolle 2017).

WIND LEASE AREAS AND HABITAT OCCUPANCY OVERLAP\n\n\fChapter 47\nZooplankton\nDescription: Annual time series of zooplankton abundance Found in: State of the Ecosystem - Gulf of Maine & Georges Bank (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020), State of the\nEcosystem - Mid-Atlantic (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) Indicator category: Database pull with analysis; Synthesis of published information; Extensive analysis,\nnot yet published; Published methods Contributor(s): Ryan Morse, Kevin Friedland Data steward: Harvey Walsh, harvey.walsh@noaa.gov; Mike Jones, michael.jones@noaa.gov Point of contact: Ryan Morse, ryan.morse@noaa.gov; Harvey Walsh, harvey.walsh@noaa.gov; Kevin\nFriedland, kevin.friedland@noaa.gov Public availability statement: Source data are publicly available here. Derived data can be found here.\n47.1 Methods\n47.1.1 Data sources\nZooplankton data are from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program and Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) cruises\ndetailed extensively in Kane (2007), Kane (2011), and Morse et al. (2017).\n47.1.2 Data extraction\nData are from the publicly available zooplankton dataset on the NOAA File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. The excel fle has a list of excluded samples and cruises based on Kane (2007) and Kane (2011). R code used in extraction process.\n# load data URL = \"ftp://ftp.nefsc.noaa.gov/pub/hydro/zooplankton_data/EcoMon_Plankton_Data_v3_0.xlsx\" ZPD = openxlsx::read.xlsx(URL, sheet = \"Data\")\n47.1.3 Data analysis\nAnnual abundance anomalies\n173\n\n\f174\n\nCHAPTER 47. ZOOPLANKTON\n\nData are processed similarly to Kane (2007) and Perretti et al. (2017b), where a mean annual abundance by date is computed by area for each species meeting inclusion metrics set in Morse et al. (2017). This is\naccomplished by binning all samples for a given species to bi-monthly collection dates based on median cruise date and taking the mean, then ftting a spline interpolation between mean bi-monthly abundance to give\nexpected abundance on any given day of the year.\nCode used for zooplankton data analysis can be found here.\nCopepod\nAbundance anomalies (Figure 47.1) are computed from the expected abundance on the day of sample collection. Abundance anomaly time series are constructed for Centropages typicus, Pseudocalanus spp., Calanus fnmarchicus, and total zooplankton biovolume. The small-large copepod size index is computed by averaging the individual abundance anomalies of Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages hamatus, Centropages typicus, and Temora longicornis, and subtracting the abundance anomaly of Calanus fnmarchicus. This index tracks the overall dominance of the small bodied copepods relative to the largest copepod in the\nNortheast U.S. region, Calanus fnmarchicus.\nEuphausiids and Cnidarians\nStratifed abundance of euphausiids and cnidarians were included in the 2020 State of the Ecosystem reports (Figure 47.2). These were calculated as the log of estimated absolute number of individuals.\nSeasonal abundance\nTime series of zooplankton abundance in the spring and fall months have been presented in the 2019 Mid-Atlantic State of the Ecosystem report. Raw abundance data were sourced from the EcoMon cruises referenced above, and ordinary kriging was used to estimate seasonal abundance over the Northeast Shelf. These data were then aggregated further into time series of mean abundance by Ecological Production Unit.\nZooplankton Diversity\nTime series of zooplankton diveristy (eective shannon) (Figure 47.3) was calculated using 42 zooplankton classifcations collected fromt the EcoMon cruises, referenced above.\n\n47.1.4 Data processing\nZooplankton abundances indicators were formatted for inclusion in the ecodata R package using the code at these links, abundance anomaly and seasonal abundance\n\n47.1.5 Plotting\nCode used to create the fgures below can be found linked here, copepod abundance (47.1), Euphausiid and Cnidarian abundance (47.2) and zooplankton diversity (47.3.
