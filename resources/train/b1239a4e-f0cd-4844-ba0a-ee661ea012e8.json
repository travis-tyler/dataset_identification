[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To what extent do early boosts to simpler skills or behaviors support the long-term development of more sophisticated skills or behaviors? Substantial longitudinal associations between academic or socioemotional skills measured early and then later in childhood or adolescence are often taken as support of theories of skill-building processes. We argue that longitudinal correlations, even if adjusted for an extensive set of baseline covariates, constitute an insufficiently \"risky\" test of skill-building theories because they are consistent with alternative theories as well. Using the example of skill-building in mathematics, we consider a set of riskier tests of skill-building processes. We first show that experimental manipulation of early math skills generates much smaller \"effects\" on later math achievement than both bivariate and longitudinal non-experimental models with extensive baseline controls. We then conduct falsification tests that show puzzlingly high cross-domain associations between early math and later literacy achievement. Finally, we show that a skill-building model positing a combination of unmeasured stable factors and skill-building processes is able to reproduce the pattern of experimental impacts on children's mathematics achievement.\nearly childhood; interventions; skill-building; cognitive development; education\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 2 Strong longitudinal correlations are often observed in studies of academic and socioemotional domains of school readiness, across many years. Such longitudinal correlations constitute an important part of the empirical basis for various developmental and educational theories, including skill-building (e.g., Baroody, 1987; Stanovich, 1986; Cunha & Heckman, 2007) , life-course development of psychopathology (e.g., Moffitt, 1993) , and theories that posit reciprocal effects between skills and environments (e.g., Scarr & McCartney, 1983) . Many of these correlations persist after adjusting for a large set of controls, including baseline measures of other academic and socio-emotional skills and capacities, domain-general cognitive abilities, and socioeconomic status (Aunola, Leskinen, Lerkkanen, & Nurmi, 2004; Bailey, Siegler, & Geary, 2014a; Duncan et al., 2007; Geary, Hoard, Nugent, & Bailey, 2013; Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, & Locuniak, 2009; Siegler et al., 2012; Watts, Duncan, Siegler, & Davis-Kean, 2014) .\nResearchers, including authors of this paper (Bailey et al., 2014a; Duncan et al., 2007; Watts et al., 2014) , attribute to these robust correlations varying degrees of causality. For example, the Duncan et al. (2007; p. 1430) study of school readiness states: \"\u2026we implement rigorous analytic methods that attempt to isolate the effects of school-entry academic, attention, and socioemotional skills by controlling for an extensive set of prior child, family, and contextual influences that may be related to children's achievement.\" A cautious, yet superficial, alternative approach adopted by many authors writing about these kinds of correlations is to assert that because only random-assignment designs can prove causation, correlational evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of causality. But many of these same authors then go on to discuss the policy implications of their evidence (Reinhart et al., 2013) , a linkage that requires causal evidence. One cannot have it both ways.\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 3 We argue that longitudinal correlations, even when adjusted for an extensive set of baseline controls, constitute an insufficiently \"risky\" test of skill-building and other popular developmental theories. We borrow from Meehl's (1978 Meehl's ( , 1990 insight that when diverse theories make the same predictions, it is important to conduct \"risky\" tests that have the ability to distinguish among them. A prediction is considered risky if the probability of such a prediction being true, assuming that the theory is false, is low. We argue that the correlational patterns documented in Duncan et al. (2007) do not constitute a risky test of skill-building theories, because they are likely to be found under a number of plausible competing theories, including ones positing that a combination of differentially stable general cognitive abilities, personality, and environmental affordances is responsible for generating the observed within-domain temporal correlations.\nFocusing on the development of children's mathematics achievement, we use experimental evidence, falsification tests, and alternative model structures to show that riskier tests suggest a much smaller role for skill-building processes than commonly believed. We close with some recommendations for future studies.\nWhat are the causal mechanisms through which boosts in early school readiness skills and behaviors promote the development of much later academic and socioemotional skills? Skillbuilding models provide one clear answer: for math and literacy, early academic skills are the foundations upon which later skills are built. In the case of math, counting serves as a basis for children's early addition problem solving (Baroody, 1987) , and addition is often employed as a subroutine of children's multiplication problem solving (Lemaire & Siegler, 1995) . An implication of these models is that the children with the most solid early foundations of math Causal inference in studies of skill development 4 skills will, in the context of K-12 instruction, tend to maintain higher levels of math skills throughout childhood and adolescence.\nIn the development of reading skills, children's ability to match letters to sounds supports their learning to recognize written words, which in turn supports their vocabulary learning, which then supports their reading comprehension. Causal relations among these literacy skills are likely bi-directional with, for example, increases in reading comprehension facilitating more reading, which increases vocabulary (Stanovich, 1986 ).\nThe skill-building model of Cunha and Heckman (2007) is more comprehensive in allowing for these kinds of processes, but also posits a kind of multiplier effect in which early skills and capacities can increase the productivity of subsequent schooling and other investments.\nMoreover, it assumes that the list of \"inputs\" for the production of any particular skill or behavior may include a wide array of past skills and behaviors.\nSubstantial longitudinal correlations within domains of academic achievement and socioemotional behaviors are predicted by these skill-building causal models and are generally found in studies that estimate zero-order and regression-adjusted correlations within many domains of achievement and socioemotional skills across time (e.g., Duncan et al., 2007) . For example, in national data from the 1998-99 Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K; Figure 1 ; measure and sample details in the appendix) the \"math to math,\" \"reading to reading,\"\nand \"anti-social to anti-social\" inter-wave correlations with fall of kindergarten values decay the most across the kindergarten year, but then flatten out to a moderate (about .45 to .65) magnitude by fifth grade. These kinds of patterns have been well documented in longitudinal correlational studies of children's cognitive abilities (Bayley, 1949; Tucker-Drob & Briley, 2014) and in the development of personality (Anusic & Schimmack, 2015). In short, although skill-building theories of development are consistent with an overwhelming body of correlational evidence, so too are competing theories. When it comes to children's academic and social development, an inability to distinguish among such theories hampers the development of both theory and practice. Can riskier tests help us do better?\nWe discuss three promising approaches to estimate the importance of skill-building processes. First, and most important, is an experimental manipulation of children's early skills or behaviors, which provides the riskiest (i.e., most at risk of being refuted) test of theories of children's skill development. Second, we detail how risky falsification tests can be applied more widely to correlational data. And third, we show that longitudinal correlations and experimental impact patterns can be modeled in ways that make more precise (and thus riskier) predictions about the effects of prior skills or behaviors on later skills or behavior. Our empirical evidence Causal inference in studies of skill development 6 on these approaches is taken exclusively from the domain of math achievement. As we argue below, our analysis has implications for a much broader set of developmentally important skills and behaviors.\nExperimental evidence. Randomly assigned boosts in school readiness skills and behaviors provide a very risky test of the theory that early skills are a powerful cause of the learning of new content in a manner that allows students with early skill advantages to maintain this advantage throughout school. If, as Duncan et al. (2007) imply, controls for an extensive set of prior child, family, and contextual influences enable an analyst to use nonexperimental data to compare otherwise similar groups of children who differ only in one particular school-entry skill or behavior, then the multivariate regression approach of Duncan et al. (2007) and others could identify the causal impact of a particular skill or behavior on later school success. We would then expect the patterns of \"impacts\" from these regression models to match those generated by a genuine random-assignment experiment.\nTo investigate whether well controlled correlational models of long-run achievement patterns reliably generate causal estimates, we draw data from the TRIAD (Technologyenhanced, Research-based, Instruction, Assessment, and professional Development) study. This study evaluated the long-run effectiveness of a learning intervention model, called TRIAD, which featured a preschool mathematics curriculum, called Building Blocks, as its key component (see . As explained in the appendix, the TRIAD study randomly assigned 42 schools with state-funded preschool programs in Massachusetts and New York either to a treatment condition in which the Building Blocks curriculum was implemented in preschool classes, or to a control condition in which preschool math was taught as usual.\n1 In treatment schools, the curriculum was administered over the course of the preschool year. Math\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 7 achievement was measured in the fall and spring of the pre-kindergarten year, in the spring of the kindergarten, first, fourth and fifth-grade years, as well as in the fall of the fourth-grade year.\nRandom assignment checks showed that treatment and control groups were balanced (Clements et al., 2011).\nWe first ignored experimental variation in the TRIAD data and used the study's control group to generate cross-time correlations between math achievement in the spring of the prekindergarten year and math achievement measured in all of the study's follow-ups. In contrast to [ Figure 2 here]\nThe \"TRIAD Treatment Impacts\" line in Figure 2 shows that this is not at all the case.\nTreatment and control differences at the end of the pre-K year amounted to .63 SD -a large\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 8 impact. To establish comparability between this .63 SD impact and the 1.0 SD \"impact\" implicit in the regression-adjusted estimate shown in Figure 2 's top line, we rescale this and all other experimental impact estimates by multiplying by 1/.63. 3 Rescaled impact estimates fall to about\n.46 SD within a year, and drop to statistically non-significant .08 SD and -.02 SD values for the two fourth-grade tests. The partial recovery of impacts in fifth-grade (.14 SD) is intriguing, but statistically indistinguishable from zero in this analysis. 4 Overall, the correlation-based estimate of the treatment effect is very close to the observed treatment effect one year after the end of treatment, but then much higher than the observed treatment effects at all subsequent waves.\nTRIAD's ability to shed light on math skill-building processes is a function of the comprehensiveness of its initial impacts. As explained in the appendix, the end-of-Pre-K REMA test showed considerable variation in 4 subdomains of preschool mathematics knowledge:\ncounting, patterning, measurement, and geometry. Bearing in mind that the psychometric Causal inference in studies of skill development 9\nReturning to the patterns of experimental impacts in Figure 1 , it is noteworthy that TRIAD treatment effects do not disappear completely immediately following the conclusion of treatment, which is indeed consistent with the impacts of skill building on children's academic development. However, skill-building processes following the conclusion of the intervention do not appear to sustain a substantial treatment effect much beyond first grade. This pattern of declining treatment effects is consistent with the patterns observed in many randomized controlled trials testing the effects of interventions designed to boost children's early academic skills (Bus & van IJzendoorn, 1999; Puma et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013; for review, see Bailey et al., 2015, and Protzko, 2015) .\nThe divergent lines in Figure 2 pose a profound challenge to the large correlational literature (including our own work) that has relied on longitudinal trajectories based on nonexperimental data to infer developmental processes. It would appear that experimentally induced changes in early skills may have temporary effects on children's subsequent learning, but, in the longer run, and in the context of the elementary schools most of these children attended, children's skills converge to trajectories governed by other processes.\nA falsification test based on cross-domain correlations. Even in the absence of experimental data, it is possible to subject skill-building models to riskier tests using correlational data. Falsification tests provide one example. One set is based on the argument that if within-domain skill building processes were generating the strong pattern of longitudinal correlations shown in Figure 1 , then cross-domain correlational patterns should be much weaker.\nSpecifically, in the case of mathematics and reading, correlations between early and later math achievement scores should be persistently higher than correlations between early math and later reading. Figure 1 shows this is the case for math and anti-social behavior but decidedly not for\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 10 math-to-reading correlations, which are virtually indistinguishable from math-to-math correlations beyond 1 st grade. That school-entry mathematics achievement is a robust predictor of children's long-term reading outcomes was also observed by Duncan and colleagues (2007) in their analysis of six longitudinal datasets (including the ECLS-K).\nSkill-building models of children's academic development have a difficult time explaining why early mathematics achievement would exert a strong causal impact on later reading achievement. To be sure, skills such as language comprehension are common to both mathematics and reading achievement. But other evidence shows that correlations between early math and later reading scores (.26 in meta-analytic estimates in Duncan et al., 2007) are much higher than correlations between early reading and later math (.10).\nConsider the asymptotic rather than complete decline in the within-domain correlations show in Figure 1 and the regression-based correlations in Figure 2 . What kind of skill-building processes would cause the later impacts of early achievement to become constant throughout development? A simple skill-building model could explain the shape of these lines if learning a basic skill earlier than one's peers persistently enabled a child to learn more advanced skills before his or her peers. For example, if learning to count before one's peers resulted in a high probability of learning to add before one's peers, which in turn resulted in a high probability of learning to multiply before one's peers, the correlation between counting skills and multiplication fluency could be high.\nHowever, probabilities of learning later skills conditional on learning an early skill are the product of these interim probabilities. This model is shown with solid lines in Figure 3, where the paths MS1 and MS2 represent the impacts of a previous math skill on the immediately\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 11 following math skill. As long as these probabilities are less than one, we should observe some kind of exponential decay in early-to-late correlations as skills become more advanced.\n[ Figure 3 here]\nThe correlational estimates in Figures 1 and the top line of Figure 2 show a different pattern. They decay a bit over time, which is predicted by the hypothesis that skill building plays a role in the stability of individual differences in children's early academic achievement.\nHowever, they soon show a great deal of stability, especially after the first year of the study, which suggests that other factors or processes are at work."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Substantial longitudinal correlations within domains of academic achievement and socioemotional behaviors are predicted by these skill-building causal models and are generally found in studies that estimate zero-order and regression-adjusted correlations within many domains of achievement and socioemotional skills across time (e.g., Duncan et al., 2007) .

However, they do not constitute a risky test of such theories, because there are several plausible reasons one might expect to see them even if skill-building played a negligible role in cognitive development. We focus on one set of competing theories: those that posit an important role for some combination of foundational and relatively stable psychological characteristics and persistent environmental characteristics such as family functioning or neighborhood poverty. If these influences are not sufficiently well-captured with regression controls or other techniques for reducing omittedvariable bias, then the apparent role of skill-building processes in generating cross-time correlations could be seriously overstated.\nIn short, although skill-building theories of development are consistent with an overwhelming body of correlational evidence, so too are competing theories.

These confidence intervals were derived from standard errors that were adjusted for school-level clustering.

Bearing in mind that the psychometric properties of the overall REMA test, but not its subscales, have been established (Clements, Sarama, & Liu, 2008; Weiland et al., 2012) , we grouped REMA items into each of these subdomains and created four measures defined as the proportion of correct responses on the items included in each category. We then tested the impact of the treatment on each standardized subdomain score. The intervention generated statistically significant impacts on all four subdomains: counting (\u03b2= 0.45, SE=0.06), patterning (\u03b2= 0.36, SE=0.06), geometry (\u03b2= 0.67,"}, {"section_title": "SE=0", "text": ".06), and measurement (\u03b2= 0.20, SE=0.06) . Because the intervention boosted a wide variety of preschool math skills, treated as opposed to control-group children should have had a considerably broad base of math competencies from which to build further math skills.

This theory, illustrated by the dashed line in Figure 3 , is appealing, given that skills acquired early in development clearly provide a basis for children's subsequent academic development. However, given that the most basic skills are quickly mastered by the vast majority of children (Engel, Claessens, Watts, & Farkas, 2016; Paris, 2005) , individual differences in such skills are unlikely to account for robust longitudinal associations between earlier and later academic skills. For example, if almost all fifth graders can count to 10, it is difficult to imagine how children's ability to count to 10 would underlie individual differences in fifth graders' learning, despite the obvious importance of being able to count to 10 for learning mathematics throughout development. It is an open question whether broader foundational proficiencies (as described by the National Research Council, 2001) which are not quickly or easily mastered (e.g., OECD, 2014) could be developed early and result in more persistent effects on children's mathematics achievement."}, {"section_title": "An Alternative Developmental Model", "text": "What might account for the lingering discrepancy between experimental and correlational estimates of the effects of changes in early academic skills on academic skills several years later?\nThe discrepant correlational and experimental patterns shown in Figure Third, owing to the accumulating effects of stable factors on children's achievement across development, the model generates a testable prediction of increasing inter-year stability as children get older (Cole, Martin, & Steiger, 2005) . This pattern is well established in the development of children's general cognitive ability, both at the phenotypic and genetic levels (Bayley, 1949; Tucker-Drob & Briley, 2014) , and in the development of personality (Anusic & Schimmack, 2015) . It is also evident in the ECLS-K dataset, where the correlations between mathematics achievement scores across waves increase, despite growing inter-wave intervals.\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 14\nChildren's mathematics achievement in the spring of kindergarten correlates .77 (SE= .01) with their mathematics achievement one year later in the spring of first grade, which correlates .80 (SE= .01) with their mathematics achievement two years later than that in the spring of third grade, which correlates .89 (SE= .01) with mathematics achievement two years later than that in the spring of fifth grade.\nFourth, the model can be easily adapted into an experimental design, in which the first wave of post-treatment achievement and the stable latent variable are simultaneously regressed on treatment status. In the TRIAD data used above, Watts and colleagues (2016) found a substantial impact of the intervention on children's math skills, but no effect on the latent variable representing stable factors that influence children's achievement across development.\nHowever, this finding warrants replication under conditions in which persistence may be most likely, including for subgroups, treatments, and populations for which skills affected by the intervention are least likely to develop under counterfactual conditions.\nTo be sure, the model depicted in Figure 4 leaves much to be desired because it merely assigns a key role to unmeasured persistent factors but does not identify them. As discussed above, the ideal test of what constitutes a persistent factor, and indeed, of whether such a factor truly exists, is to regress the unmeasured persistent factor on a source of exogenous variation, such as a randomly assigned intervention. In correlational datasets, the unmeasured persistent factor can be regressed on hypothesized sources of persistent variation (Bailey et al., 2014b) , but this analysis is vulnerable to problems associated with all cross-sectional regression analyses, such as omitted-variable bias. Furthermore, the model is only one of many possible explanations for how early and later mathematics achievement are related. We hope other models will be compared to the one we use here, both on the basis of fit to correlational datasets and their predictions about experimentally induced effects across time.\nComparing model with experimental estimates. Assuming no effects of early mathematics interventions on the unmeasured persistent factor (an assumption that deserves continued scrutiny), the key model parameters for estimating the pattern of treatment effects over time are the MS paths in Figure 4 . Table 1 shows estimates of the MS paths from all of the correlational studies of the development of children's math achievement across pre-kindergarten and the elementary school years to which the state-trait model has been applied, to our knowledge. The average 1-year lagged MS paths from the three datasets are all modest, ranging from .29 to .35, depending on whether effect estimates are weighted by their underlying sample sizes. Put another way, the model depicted in Figure 4 predicts that the treatment effect should decay to approximately one-third of its previous magnitude each year.\nHow well do these estimates track patterns observed in the TRIAD experimental study?\nThe bottom half of Table 1 shows estimates of MS paths implied by experimental impacts from three early mathematics interventions that followed children for at least a year following the conclusion of the given intervention included in the bottom half of Table 1 . One-year lagged MS paths can be calculated by dividing experimental impacts at the end of a one-year period by the impacts at the beginning of that period. The average 1-year lagged MS path from the three studies ranged from .39 to .44, depending on how effects were weighted across studies. In other words, MS paths inferred from patterns of experimental impacts across time follow a pattern of decay that is only slightly less steep than that predicted by estimates derived from models based on a persistent latent factor. Patterns of impacts across time predicted by estimated and inferred weighted study average MS paths appear in Figure 5 . These are calculated using the formula MS t ,\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 16 where MS is the estimated (.35) or inferred (.44) weighted study average MS path and t is the number of years since the end of the treatment. They are similar to each other and to the pattern of impacts in the TRIAD study (this is unsurprising for the inferred paths, given that these were based in large part on the TRIAD impact estimates). In fact, the average MS path estimated from the state-trait model falls within the confidence interval of every observed impact in the TRIAD study, while this is true of only 1 out of 5 regression-based estimates.\n[ Figure 5 here]\nThis pattern may generalize well to children's academic achievement outcomes. In a review of experimental estimates from 67 high-quality studies of early childhood education programs, Li and colleagues (under review) reported an average end-of-treatment effect size of .23, with estimates 0-1 years after treatment averaging approximately .10. Impact estimates from subsequent waves were smaller, but their precise values were sensitive to inclusion criteria.\nAs mentioned above in the discussion of Figure 2 , correlational data track experimental impact estimates from TRIAD much more closely at the end of kindergarten than in later grades.\nIn light of the estimates of the MS paths shown in Table 1 , the model depicted in Figure 4 appears to track experimental estimates more closely in later grades than at the end of kindergarten. An obvious possible explanation for the larger 1-year lagged MS paths inferred from experimental estimates is some misspecification or bias in the Figure 4 model. Another possible explanation for the difference is that early mathematics interventions generate transitory impacts on a broader set of children's capacities (e.g., literacy skills or motivation), which independently boost children's later mathematics achievement. Although in the latter case, the state-trait estimates would actually provide more accurate estimates of MS paths than those inferred from experimental impacts, the experimental impacts are more policyrelevant than the state-trait estimates in either case.\nIn summary, a model that allows for persistent unmeasured factors produces estimates consistent with the exponential decay in treatment effects observed in the most relevant set of experimental studies on children's early mathematics achievement, whereas traditional methods fail to do so after the first year or so. Notably, the correlational estimates most in line with experimental data were produced by the state-trait model from the largest sample to which it has been applied, which also spanned the longest time interval. Whether this particular model is the ideal specification (see Cole et al., 2005 , for a discussion), whether intervention effects are likely to be confined to occasion-specific variation, rather than stable environmental and personal factors, and more generally, what comprises variation in these stable environmental and personal factors influencing children's mathematics learning throughout development remain open questions.\nWhat stable factors are missing from our regression models? As noted above, we think that the \"unmeasured persistent factors\" in Figure 4 that influence children's academic and social development are in all likelihood a set of stable environmental and personal factors.\nProbable influences on child achievement throughout development include domain-general cognitive abilities, personality, and environmental affordances. Intelligence and working memory have been strongly implicated as key drivers of children's academic development in correlational studies (Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Geary, Hoard, Nugent, & Bailey, 2012; Sz\u00fccs, Devine, Soltesz, Nobes, & Gabriel, 2014) , so much so that a general factor extracted from various cognitive tests was found to correlate .83 with a general factor extracted from academic achievement tests (Kaufman et al., 2012) . Personality may also play a role, with\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 18 conscientiousness being the strongest Big Five personality correlate of academic achievement (Rimfield, Kovas, Dale, & Plomin, 2016) .\nBoth personality and domain-general cognitive abilities are substantially influenced by differences in both genes and environments (Bouchard & McGue, 2003) . Aside from latent environmental effects inferred from imperfect correlations between identical twins, strong designs have also identified effects of measured environments, such as adoption (van Ijzendoorn, Juffer, & Poelhuis, 2005; Kendler et al., 2015) , maternal nutrition during prenatal development (Almond & Mazumder, 2011) , or a very intensive early childhood education program (Campbell et al., 2001 ), on cognitive abilities many years later."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Design and Analysis in Developmental Research", "text": "We have argued that commonly used approaches to inferring skill-building processes from longitudinal correlation are based on insufficiently \"risky\" tests. In particular, we have shown that longitudinal correlations imply a much stronger skill-building process than does more direct evidence from experimental studies; that the similarity of within-and cross-domain correlations over time constitutes a falsification test that a simple math skill-building model does not pass; and that at least one alternative developmental model, which accounts for unmeasured factors, better reproduces the declining pattern of impacts generated by a large randomassignment evaluation of an intensive math skills intervention.\nAlthough our review has been confined to mathematics learning, we suspect that we would find similar patterns in data on literacy, given the parallel nature of skill-building in those two domains of learning and the similar patterns of within-domain longitudinal correlations shown in Figure 1 . Whether our conclusions about math generalize to other domains of interest in developmental research, such as anti-social behavior or executive functions, is less obvious.\nCausal inference in studies of skill development"}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "The differing heights of patterns of math-to-reading and math-to-antisocial behavior correlational lines shown in Figure 1 suggest that whatever latent factor may underlie math and reading trajectories does not substantially impact anti-social behavior across development. However, an analogous developmental story may apply: Correlations between kindergarten anti-social behavior and anti-social behavior at subsequent waves follow a pattern similar to those for children's academic skills (Figure 1) , suggesting that other factors may generate stability in children's anti-social behavior across time. If these factors are not well measured, the autoregressive effects of anti-social behavior will be exaggerated. Consistent with this possibility, Anusic and Schimmack (2015) observed substantial stability in the inter-wave correlations of personality, affect, self-esteem, and life satisfaction, with the highest stability in personality. 5 It is important to emphasize that the existence of effects of stable environmental and personal factors on children's academic development does not preclude skill-building processes, nor does the existence of empirically stable environmental and personal factors imply that such factors are immutable. One possible reason for fadeout in early mathematics learning interventions such as Building Blocks is that it is unrealistic to expect impact persistence if children who receive highquality interventions remain in low-resource communities, including low-quality schools (Brooks-Gunn, 2003; Duncan & Magnuson, 2013) . In this case, proficiencies developed by interventions are not evanescent, but rather result in enhanced knowledge states that are subsequently left fallow by environments that do little or nothing to build upon these early\nThis fadeout problem has not been lost on intervention designers. For example, Clements and colleagues (2013) included a follow-through condition in the TRIAD study. In this alternative treatment arm, kindergarten and first grade teachers received additional professional\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 20 development designed to help them build upon the gains students made during preschool.\nAlthough the original treatment impacts still faded for this group, they faded more slowly than for the students that only received the preschool treatment without follow-through.\nFollowing a demonstration of mismatched correlational and experimental findings, it is common to call for more randomized controlled trials. We certainly endorse RCTs because they can provide the strongest evidence on skill-building processes, but we recognize that many (including most lab-based experiments) have limited external validity, sometimes target a bundle of constructs that may benefit children but render implications for developmental processes unclear, and rarely track longer-term persistence. We also endorse the pursuit of data from sibling, neighborhood and school fixed effects models and from so-called \"natural experiments\"\nsuch as school policy changes that provide significantly more intensive academic training to a subset of students who can be compared with a very similar group of \"untreated\" students. An example is the \"double dose\" algebra training introduced to low-achieving ninth-graders in the Chicago Public Schools as defined by an eighth-grade math test score cutoff (Cortes and Goodman, 2014) . Natural experiments (including the double-dose program) are not unproblematic (they often face the same problems with external and construct validity), but they can help to adjudicate competing theories of learning.\nShould we give up on the idea of using correlational data analysis to make theoretical or policy-relevant inferences about children's academic development? We are not so pessimistic.\nIndeed, we believe that when exposed to riskier tests and informed by prior experimental work, correlational data analyses can also help triangulate to the most useful theories of children's academic development: theories that can accurately predict when the effects of academic interventions will fade out or persist. One-year MS estimates from intervals with multiple lags are calculated by raising the reported estimate to the power of 1/t, where t is the number of years in the given interval. MS estimates from experimental studies are calculated by dividing a treatment effect by a prior treatment effect, and are corrected using the same exponential transformation when intervals between measurements vary by an amount different from 1 year.

A second treatment condition, which we ignore, assigned students to receive the pre-K Building Blocks curriculum coupled with \"follow-through\" math support to kindergarten and first-grade teachers 2. Full correlation matrices for measures of children's mathematics achievement administered at several waves across development are available in Bailey et al. (2014b) .\n3. This means, for example, that TRIAD's .63 SD impact at the end of pre-kindergarten is shown as 1.0 and its the .29 SD experimental impact at the end of the kindergarten is shown as .29 SD ( = .18 /.63). The scale for the correlations and rescaled impact estimates are shown on the left y-axis, while the non-rescaled estimates appear on the right y-axis.\n4. Using a 2-level random intercept logistic regression model, Clements and colleagues (under review) found a statistically significant treatment impact of the TRIAD intervention at the spring of 5 th grade.\n5. Anusic and Schimmack (2015) reported values of \"1-year stability of the change component\" comparable to the 1-year MS paths reported in this article, Table 1 indicates that interindividual stability across time in children's mathematics achievement more closely resembles the pattern observed for personality than for affect, self-esteem, or life satisfaction.\n6. A closely related measurement issue that deserves attention is the need for more nuanced assessments of children's mathematics knowledge. Measures in extant studies are based on single scores rather than more cognitively-complex and diagnostic assessments (cf. Tatsuoka et al., in press). Thus, children assigned the same score are assumed to have the same knowledge state, such as children who raised their scores via participation in an intervention group matched to controls who achieved that score without the intervention . However, the control children will likely have a far longer, far more extensive, set of experiences that led to the same score; for example, building parallel distributed process networks of broad reach across the brain, which, because they have been reinforced for years, have established retrieval paths that are myriad, strong, and stable. Thus, future measures of the two groups of children may yield different scores even if subsequent experiences are the same. Future measurement studies, including those that investigate measurement invariance across subgroups (Wicherts, 2016) , are warranted to investigate such possibilities.\nCausal inference in studies of skill development Statistics (NCES), began data collection for the ECLS-K, and a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners were drawn from approximately 1000 public and private schools across the country. The children were then followed longitudinally through the end of eighth grade, and data was collected from students, parents, teachers and administrators in kindergarten, first grade, third grade, fifth grade, and eighth grade. For the analyses presented in the current paper, we relied on data collected in the fall and spring of kindergarten, and in the spring of the first, third, and fifth grade years. NCES designed sampling weights for each wave, and for our analyses, we used panel weights designed for longitudinal analyses of child-level data from kindergarten through the end of fifth grade (see Table S2 note). The ECLS-K has been widely used to study K-12 education and child development, and further details regarding the study can be found in the NCES user manual (Tourangeau et al., 2009 ).

The TRIAD study randomly assigned 42 elementary schools serving low-income neighborhoods in either Buffalo, New York or Boston, Massachusetts to one of three conditions: 1) Building Blocks preschool curriculum; 2)\nBuilding Blocks preschool curriculum with follow-through; 3) control (business as usual).\nCausal inference in studies of skill development 2 Schools were randomly-assigned through a blocking procedure, in which schools were grouped into 8 blocks based on similarity of state-achievement test scores, and random assignment then occurred within each blocking group. Schools assigned to either of the Building Blocks treatment conditions implemented the Building Blocks curriculum during preschool, and preschool teachers attended approximately 13 pedagogical development (PD) sessions designed to help them improve the mathematics taught in their classrooms. Control schools kept their pre-existing preschool mathematics programs. The \"Building Blocks with follow-through\" condition included additional PD for kindergarten and first grade teachers in which teachers were encouraged to build upon the mathematics the students learned during preschool.\nThe Building Blocks curriculum was based on developmental and cognitive theory, and the curriculum was designed to help children mathematize their everyday activities. The curriculum was organized into highly-sequenced learning trajectories, in which students developed conceptual understanding, procedural skill, and problem solving competencies in various foundational areas of mathematics (e.g., counting, geometry). The curriculum was also paired with the Building Blocks software, which further helped teachers personalize instruction to each child's unique needs. In total, the curriculum was designed to take approximately 15 to 30 minutes each day. Initial analyses showed that the curriculum was implemented with strong fidelity during preschool (Clements et al., 2011) . For full details regarding the curriculum development and fidelity of implementation, see Clements et al., 2011 .\nTRIAD evaluators drew a random sample of 1375 students from the 42 participating schools, and students' mathematics achievement was measured during preschool, kindergarten, first grade, fourth grade, and fifth grade.

Teachers used a frequency scale to indicate how often a student exhibited a certain behavior (items ranged from \"1\" = \"never\" to \"4\" = \"very often\"). NCES used factor analyses to confirm the items used in the scales, and items for the anti-social behavioral measure focused on whether the child disrupted class or if they acted aggressively toward other students. For the waves of data used here, reliability for the anti-social behavior problem scale ranged from 0.86 to 0.90 (see Rock & Pollack, 2002; Pollack et al., 2005a; 2005b) ."}, {"section_title": "TRIAD mathematics achievement.", "text": "During the fall and spring of preschool, spring of kindergarten, and spring of first grade, mathematics achievement was assessed using the Research-based Early Math Assessment (REMA; Clements, Sarama, & Liu, 2008; Clements, Sarama, & Wolfe, 2011) . The REMA was designed to measure the mathematics understanding of children between the ages of 3 and 8, and it was administered through two one-on-one interviews. The interviews were taped and coded, and students were rated on both their correctness and strategy use. Topics on the exam included counting, measurement, geometry and place value, and the REMA scores were converted to Rasch-IRT scales. The measure was validated across three different samples of young children, and the measure has been shown to have a 0.74 correlation with the Woodcock-Johnson Applied Problems subtest (Clements, Causal inference in studies of skill development 5 Sarama, & Wolfe, 2011) . Further, the measure was found to have strong internal reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.94; Clements, Sarama, & Wolfe, 2011) .\nIn order to assess the degree to which the Building Blocks program impacted various aspects of preschool mathematics achievement, we also created sub-scores of the REMA. We replicated the measures used by Nguyen et al. 2016 . In their study, they coded items of the REMA into various domains of preschool knowledge found across a wide variety of statedefined preschool mathematics standards documents (e.g., Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 2011) and early childhood advisory panels and mathematics teaching organizations (e.g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2002) .\nThe final categories used were Counting and Cardinality, Patterning, Geometry and Measurement and Data. The Counting and Cardinality category included items that asked students to count objects and recognize numbers. Patterning items asked students to extend and duplicate patterns. The Geometry category was comprised of items that asked students to recognize shapes. Finally, the Measurement and Data category included items that asked students to identify the attributes of shapes by using measuring instruments.\nIn the fall and spring of fourth grade, and the spring of fifth grade, mathematics achievement was measured using the TEAM 3-5, a variant of the REMA (Clements, Sarama, Khasanova, & Van Dine, 2012) . The TEAM 3-5 was a paper-and-pencil test that was aligned to the developmental progressions used in the REMA.
