[{"section_title": "", "text": "Igor, the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2010 Atlantic season, was a very large and intense Cape Verde hurricane that struck Bermuda with category 1 intensity. Later it hit Newfoundland and was the most damaging hurricane in recent history for that island."}, {"section_title": "a. Synoptic History", "text": "Igor's origin can be traced back to a tropical wave and accompanying broad area of low pressure that moved off the African coast late on 6 September. The system moved slowly westward for a couple of days while deep convection became more consolidated near the center of the low. By 0600 UTC 8 September, the surface circulation was sufficiently well defined and the deep convection was organized enough to designate the formation of a tropical depression centered about 80 n mi southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. The cyclone quickly strengthened into a tropical storm within 6 h. The \"best track\" chart of Igor's path is given in Fig. 1, with the wind and pressure histories shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The best track positions and intensities are listed in Table 1 1 . After initially becoming a tropical storm, the cyclone failed to strengthen further for a day or so. In fact, the system lost some organization when it interacted with a trailing disturbance that rotated around the northern portion of the broad circulation. Deep convection diminished and became sheared to the west of the center, and the storm weakened back to a tropical depression by 1200 UTC 9 September. Since the tropical cyclone was embedded within the circulation of the monsoon trough over the tropical eastern Atlantic, it moved westward or west-northwestward at a slow pace for a couple of days. Around 1200 UTC 10 September, vertical shear began to relax and Igor regained tropical storm strength. By that time the steering flow became dominated by a building mid-tropospheric ridge over the eastern Atlantic, and Igor moved westward at a forward speed that increased to as much as 22 kt. Possibly due to moderate northerly shear and a relatively stable atmospheric environment, Igor's strengthening was rather unsteady over the next 36 h. The cyclone eventually reached hurricane strength by 0000 UTC 12 September. Shortly thereafter, however, the central convective cloud pattern became quite symmetric, the upper-level outflow increased markedly, and very rapid intensification took place. Igor's maximum winds increased to an estimated 130 kt by 0000 UTC 13 September. Figure 4 is a satellite image of Igor on 13 September depicting the classic appearance of an intense hurricane. Igor slowed its forward speed on 13 September, while maintaining a nearly due westward heading across the tropical Atlantic. After exhibiting some hints of concentric eyewall structure, Igor's maximum winds decreased to 115 kt by 0600 UTC 14 September. However, the hurricane soon re-strengthened to an estimated peak intensity of 135 kt around 0000 UTC 15 September. Igor was now moving west-northwestward in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by a broad deeplayer trough near the northeastern United States. Later on 15 September, there was an eyewall replacement, and the tropical cyclone weakened again to near 115 kt. Igor's final strengthening episode occurred late on 15 September while the new, outer eyewall contracted slightly, and the maximum winds increased to an estimated 125 kt by 0600 UTC 16 September. The hurricane wobbled between a northwest and west-northwest heading as its eye passed a little over 300 n mi northeast of the northernmost Leeward Islands early on 17 September. A persistent deep-layer trough near the northeastern United States maintained a weakness in the subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic, and over the next couple of days Igor gradually turned toward the north as it moved around the periphery of the ridge. Meanwhile, there was a fairly steady weakening of the tropical cyclone, at least partly due to southwesterly shear that became fairly strong by late on 18 September, and the intrusion of drier air into the core. Although it was weakening, Igor expanded in size and tropical-storm-force winds extended some 300 n mi from the center over the northern semicircle. By the time it passed closest to Bermuda (about 35 n mi to the west-northwest) around 0230 UTC 20 September, Igor had weakened to a 65-kt hurricane, and it brought hurricane-force winds to that island. The hurricane turned north-northeastward, then northeastward and accelerated ahead of a trough near the Canadian Maritimes. The cyclone grew even larger in size, with the area of tropical-storm-force winds becoming roughly 750 n mi wide, and the system's forward speed increased to near 40 kt. Igor strengthened to 75 kt, possibly due to baroclinic forcing, as it made landfall near Cape Race Newfoundland around 1500 UTC 21 September. The center of the hurricane straddled the east coast of the Avalon peninsula of Newfoundland from 1500 to 1700 UTC 21 September. Almost immediately after departing Newfoundland, Igor became fully embedded in a frontal zone and became a vigorous extratropical cyclone. The cyclone turned northward and north-northwestward, its center moving over the north Atlantic between Labrador and Greenland on 22 September. The system became absorbed by another large extratropical cyclone by early on 23 September."}, {"section_title": "b. Meteorological Statistics", "text": "Observations in Igor (Figs. 2 and 3) include subjective satellite-based Dvorak technique intensity estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) and the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), and objective Dvorak estimates from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies/University of Wisconsin-Madison (CIMSS). Observations also include flight-level, stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR), and dropwindsonde observations from flights of the 53 rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron of the U. S. Air Force Reserve Command (53WRS). Data and imagery from NOAA polar-orbiting satellites, including the Advanced Microwave Sounder Unit intensity estimates from CIMSS, the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Aqua, the European Space Agency's Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, among others, and radar observations from Bermuda were also useful in constructing the best track of Igor. The peak intensity of Igor was estimated to be 135 kt based on a blend of objective (Advanced Dvorak Technique) and subjective Dvorak technique estimates. Igor is estimated to have been a 40-kt tropical storm while it was located just south of the Cape Verde Islands on the basis of high-resolution ASCAT data. The 53WRS flew six missions into Igor, measuring peak 700 mb flight-level and surface winds of 130 kt and 98 kt, respectively, and a minimum central pressure of 940 mb. All of these measurements occurred near 1600 UTC 16 September on the first aircraft mission into the hurricane, about 40 h after the time of Igor's estimated maximum intensity. Ship and marine platform reports of winds of tropical storm force associated with Igor are given in Table 2, and selected surface observations from land stations and data buoys are given in Table 3. NOAA data buoy 41044, located over the tropical Atlantic, measured a minimum pressure of 940.3 mb while the center of Igor passed about 15 n mi to its north. A maximum 10-min wind of 59 kt was measured at the official site in Bermuda (TXKF) with higher sustained winds reported from sites on the island with wind sensors well above the standard 10 m anemometer elevation. Applying a gust factor of 1.11 to the TXKF sustained wind observation yields an estimated peak 1-min wind of 65 kt (Harper et al. 2009). A rainfall total of 3.19 inches was measured in Bermuda, and a storm surge of 1.75 ft was measured by a NOAA tide gauge at St. George on the north coast of the island. The highest 10-min wind report from an official observing site in Newfoundland was 66 kt at Bonavista which, after applying the 1.11 gust factor, gives an estimated peak 1-min wind of 73 kt. Wind gusts of 84 and 88 kt were measured at Bonavista and Sagona Island respectively. Rainfall totals generally ranged from 4 to 8 inches over eastern Newfoundland with a maximum total of 9.37 inches at St. Lawrence, with the latter total being unprecedented for that site. Figure  5 is a map of the rainfall totals associated with Igor in Newfoundland. Storm surges of 2 to 3 ft were measured around eastern Newfoundland with a maximum surge of 3.5 ft observed in St. John's Harbour."}, {"section_title": "c. Casualty and Damage Statistics", "text": "A woman was swept out to sea, and presumed drowned, by a large wave in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. In St. Croix, a boy drowned while swimming with his father in high surf. Igor produced minimal damage in Bermuda. Downed trees and signs were reported across the island. The main causeway connecting St. David's and St. George's Islands sustained minor damage and was closed to one lane of traffic for several days. The Royal Gazette indicated that there was no loss of life, and damage was estimated at less than $500,000 (U.S.) immediately after the storm. No further updates on the estimate of damage are available. Approximately 28,000 residents in Bermuda lost power during the storm. In Newfoundland, the impacts from Igor were decidedly more severe. Indeed, the Canadian Hurricane Centre described Igor as \"Newfoundland's most damaging hurricane in 75 years\". The high winds toppled many trees, especially in urban areas, and caused some structural damage over the eastern peninsulas. Much of the extensive damage on the island occurred as a result of the heavy rains and associated flooding which washed out roads and several bridges. Eastern Newfoundland was essentially isolated from the rest of the island. On the Bonavista and Burin Peninsulas, road washouts were so serious that several communities were cut off from the main road system connecting those areas to the island. One death was attributed to Igor; in Newfoundland, a man was killed when his driveway washed out and he was swept out to sea. Preliminary assessments placed the damage in Newfoundland at almost $200 million (U.S.)."}, {"section_title": "d. Forecast and Warning Critique", "text": "Igor's formation was not well predicted. The area of disturbed weather that spawned Igor was first noted in the Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) just 24 h prior to tropical cyclone formation, when it was located between the Cape Verde Islands and the coast of Africa, at which time it was given a \"low\" (10 percent) probability of development. The formation probability was raised to \"medium\" (40 percent) in a special TWO issued just 3.5 h prior to genesis. Igor's track was forecast quite well. A verification of NHC official track forecasts for Igor is given in Table 4a. The official forecast track errors were below the mean official errors for the previous 5-yr period at all forecast intervals, and considerably lower than the 5-yr means at 96 and 120 h. It should be noted that the mean climatology-persistence errors for this storm were not significantly lower than average, suggesting (surprisingly) that Igor's track was not particularly easy to forecast. A homogeneous comparison of the official track errors with selected guidance models is given in Table 4b. On average, the official track forecasts were better than the numerical guidance, with the exceptions being the GFSI forecasts at 12 through 72 h, the EMXI at 24 through 120 h, TVCC at 48 h, GUNA at 12, 48 and 72 h, CGUN at 48 h, and AEMI at 48 and 72 h. There was somewhat of a right of track bias to the official forecasts. In particular, the NHC forecasts generally showed Igor turning northward prematurely while it was over the tropical Atlantic. A similar track forecast bias was noted in the GFDL and HWRF model runs during this period. Igor's intensity, on the other hand, was not handled very well by the NHC forecasts (Table 5a). The mean official intensity forecast errors exceeded the 5-yr mean errors at all forecast intervals. The mean climatology-persistence intensity forecast errors were larger than the long-term means, indicating that Igor's intensity was more difficult to forecast than average. There was a predominately negative bias in the official forecasts during the first half of Igor's life and a mainly positive bias thereafter. The former biases were mainly due to an inability to accurately predict the hurricane's rapid strengthening. The latter biases resulted in an overforecast of Igor's strength when it moved near Bermuda, and residents of that island were preparing for the impacts of a much stronger hurricane than they actually received. Another source of error in the NHC intensity forecasts for Igor stemmed from the inability to accurately predict changes in strength associated with the various eyewall replacement episodes. A homogeneous comparison of the official intensity errors with selected guidance models is given in Table 5b. The OCD5 model had lower mean errors than the official forecasts at 12 through 36 h indicating that, on average, the NHC intensity forecasts had no skill at these forecast intervals. The other model guidance that had lower mean intensity forecast errors were HWFI at 24 h, GHMI at 72 through 120 h, DSHP at 72 through 120 h, LGEM at all forecast intervals, ICON at all forecast intervals, IVCN at all forecast intervals, and FSSE at 12 through 72 h.
