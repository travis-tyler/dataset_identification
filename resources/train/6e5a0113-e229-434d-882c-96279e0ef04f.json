We showed that a roughly constant 81% of PhDs in biomedical fields entered postdocs over our sample time frame , and a variety of market, funding and individual characteristics influenced this propensity to take a postdoc. While the average postdoc duration rose from 3.4 to 4.7 years for 1981 to 1994 PhDs, it changed very little for later cohorts. Postdocs increased the likelihood that a biomedical PhD obtained a tenuretrack job doing research 10 years post-PhD, but only one-quarter of former postdocs obtained these jobs among recent graduates. Moreover, nearly half of those who skipped the postdoc were employed in research jobs. Despite the fact that PhDs who had higher academic ability were more likely to enter postdocs, we find that former postdocs were paid significantly less for a substantial period of their early careers than those who skipped the postdoc. Our results are consistent with postdocs being a \"rat race\" where PhDs choose to devote years to the postdoc to signal their ability for a chance of obtaining elusive and dwindling academic positions. The high personal costs of postdocs in time, money, and eventual employment sector suggest that most PhDs would be better off skipping the postdoc. \\bodyThe biomedical research enterprise is in crisis. NIH funding rates are low, the age of obtaining an independent research career is high, and there are too few permanent academic positions for the large numbers of PhDs being produced. Exacerbating this crisis is the peculiar institution of postdoctoral training (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6). The reports, editorials and books that detail the biomedical research enterprise's woes have unanimously called for providing more information to graduate students and postdocs about their limited career prospects. Yet few studies have examined the value of postdoctoral training for subsequent careers in biomedical science. Previous research has determined that increases in supply and demand have fueled the rapid growth in biomedical postdocs (6)(7)(8)(9). The number of new PhDs grew faster in biomedical science than in other STEM fields during the past decades -122% growth from 1980 to 2010 in biomedical PhDs awarded compared with 76% growth in other STEM fields. \uf02a This increase is largely fueled by the increase in supply of potential postdocs as a result of the rise in foreign students and women obtaining biomedical PhDs (2,10). Some have argued that postdocs are more and more necessary because of the increasing complexity and difficulty of scientific research (11)(12)(13) which would increase the supply-the number of PhDs wanting a postdoc. At the same time, increases in research funding resulting from the NIH doubling likely increased the demand for postdocs to work on research grants (2,6). During the past decade, various official bodies have raised concerns about the working conditions, long hours, lack of benefits, and forced geographic mobility faced by postdocs, as well as the postdoc's effects on families (6,8,(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20). Such studies have decried the increasing length of PhD plus postdoctoral training and blamed this for the rising age of principal-\uf02a Calculated from NSF Science and Engineering Indicators (2012,1993). SED figures for our biomedical fields provided by Mark Fiegener of the NSF. investigators between the 1980s and the present. However, while the length of PhD can be easily measured, the total time a person spends in postdocs has been more difficult to measure (as we explain below). While researchers have surveyed postdocs (21)(22)(23), due to data limitations few have examined the impact of the postdoc on later career outcomes. Those studies that did examine career outcomes of postdocs have combined many academic fields (23)(24)(25), making it difficult to determine how the postdoc influences careers in fields like biomedicine -where the postdoc is commonplace -as opposed to fields where postdocs are positions taken by people who cannot find jobs. These studies found that a postdoc is associated with placement in academic careers. They also found that longer duration postdocs are not associated with improved academic placements (23). One study that examined the association between postdocs and biomedical careers had small sample sizes and focused exclusively on the highly selective NRSA research fellowships (26) and may not generalize to all US-trained biomedical PhDs."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "Our research presents evidence on the facts, correlates and trends related to biomedical postdoc incidence and durations since the 1980s and the associated benefits and costs in terms of early career outcomes of employment placement and earnings, based on National Science Foundation (NSF) data. Measurement of postdoc numbers and careers is difficult and coverage varies across NSF surveys (19,27); consequently, we use multiple NSF surveys and variables to measure the incidence of US-trained postdocs. Specifically, we use biennial longitudinal data from the 1981 -2010 waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) and two special SDR Postdoc Supplements matched to the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) administered to all new STEM PhDs. The SDR and SED exclude postdocs with foreign PhDs, a large but difficult-tomeasure proportion of postdocs in the US (Details on data and the methods and construction of the variables, including postdoc incidence and duration, are described in the SI Appendix). In order to identify the postdoc-intensive fields, we used the National Research Council's definition of biomedical fields (18) and limited our sample to those PhD fields where the likelihood of taking a postdoc within 3 years of the doctorate averaged more than 60% (SI Appendix, Table S2). These fields comprise 82% of biomedical PhDs awarded in 2010. We excluded MD/PhDs from our sample (693 individuals) because their careers develop differently. Our sample from the 1981-2010 SDR waves included 10,018 US-trained biomedical PhDs who received degrees in the US from 1980-2007 for whom we can identify postdoc status. Our analysis sample is considerably smaller when we consider subsequent career outcomes. \u2020 Starting in a postdoc. Scientists are considered as starting their career in a postdoc if we observe them in a postdoc any time within the first three years after their PhD. Conversely, they are considered as not starting in a postdoc if they were not observed in a postdoc at any time during the first three years after their PhD. We impose the three-year condition because not all PhDs have obtained their postdoc before they respond to the SED and because the biennial SDR takes one to three years to incorporate new PhDs into the sampling frame. In the SI Appendix ( Figure S1) we show that our preferred measure finds rates similar to rates based on the SED alone, but is more inclusive. When we can observe the sector where the postdoc is employed, 77% are in colleges/universities, consistent with published reports (6). \u2020 While our analysis of starting in a postdoc includes 10,018 people with 1980-2007 PhDs, our analysis of postdoc duration was limited to the smaller subset of 5,872 1980-2002 PhDs for whom we could measure postdoc duration during the first 8 years post-PhD, and our analysis of later career outcomes was limited to the subset of 4,163 1980-2000 PhDs for whom we could measure 10-year post-PhD outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Duration of postdoc.", "text": "We define the duration of the postdoc as the number of years that the person was observed in a postdoc within the first 8 years post-PhD. We limited duration measurement to 8 years because: 1) most individuals had completed their postdoc within this time period (SI Appendix, Figure S2); 2) postdocs longer than 8 years are likely serving very different purposes than postdocs undertaken to attain a tenure-track job or for training; and 3) calculating postdoc duration for a longer time-period past the PhD would limit us from including more recent PhDs. Postdoc duration can include more than one postdoc, and there can be gaps between these postdocs. In the SI Appendix ( Figure S3), we show that the average duration differs little if postdoc duration is calculated over 10 years, and that both of these averages are close to the median duration. Employment sector and salary. Employment sector (academia -tenure-track and nontenure-track; industry; government and nonprofit), research activity (research/non-research) and labor force status (employed, unemployed, out of the labor force) were measured a decade past PhD. Salary was measured biennially and adjusted for inflation.    Appendix Table S3)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Incidence and duration of biomedical", "text": "Similar to previous research, we find that visa status is associated with the decision to take a postdoc (7,25). Temporary residents at the time of the PhD are 7.2 percentage points (ppt.) more likely to take a postdoc (p<.001) than US citizens ceteris paribus. This dovetails with research indicating that visa status may be an important incentive for foreign students wishing to remain in the US to take postdocs (3,31). Even controlling for temporary residency, Asians are more likely to enter a postdoc than whites (p<.001), while other under-represented minorities may be less likely to enter than whites (p=.068). Older graduates are less likely to start in a postdoc, even controlling for family-status variables. Each decade lowers the likelihood of starting in a postdoc by 8.2 ppt. (p<.001). We allow the impact of family to differ for men and women and find no significant gender difference in starting in a postdoc for single females and single males (where single males are the omitted category). However, married women with children and married men with children are each 5-6 ppt. less likely than single men to start in a postdoc (each p<.001). Moreover, married women without children behave like married women with children, perhaps because they anticipate having children. Our model also proxies for scientist quality as PhD students. We assume that higher quality PhDs attended more prestigious universities (i.e. with better NRC rankings of the PhDgranting department), took a shorter time to complete the doctorate, and were more likely to receive scholarships or fellowships and to work as research assistants, while being less likely to support their graduate study by outside employment. We found these high-quality characteristics were associated with an increased likelihood of starting in a postdoc: postdocs were positively selected compared with those who skip the postdoc. Particularly, being from an above-median NRC-ranked PhD institution increased the likelihood of a postdoc by about 1.7 ppt. relative to being from a below-median institution (p=.09). Each additional year in graduate school PhDs approximately ten years after the doctorate. \u2021 Figure 3 shows that the distribution across the five employment sectors ten years post-PhD differed for those who started in a postdoc and for those who did not. Although previous research indicates that many pursue a postdoc in order to obtain tenure-track research jobs (32), just 28.0% of former postdocs are in tenure-track academic, research-related positions. Since those who started in a postdoc differ along many dimensions that are associated with employment sector, we also estimated a multinomial logit model of employment sector, holding constant the same ability, field, PhD year and demographics variables used above (SI Appendix, Table S4, Figure S5). Comparing Figure 3 and Figure S5 indicates that the control variables explained very little of the employment sector differences so that conditional and unconditional probabilities were almost identical. Where do the nearly three-fourths of former postdocs without tenure-track academic research positions work instead? Figure 3 shows that more former postdocs are employed in industry (34.7%) than in tenure-track jobs. About 14% of employed PhDs are in non-tenuretrack research academia, often soft money jobs. Non-postdocs are more likely to be in industry jobs: 43.0% of those who skip the postdoc proceed directly to industry. Conventional wisdom holds that a postdoc is necessary for an academic biomedical career, but we found that 11.9% of those employed in academic, research-related, tenure-track jobs skipped the postdoc. However, 80% of them received their degrees before 1995; of the ones with later degrees, about half had post-PhD research experience in other sectors prior to obtaining a tenure-track job. The handful remaining had gone directly from PhD to the lowest quartile of academic institutions. Dividing jobs by work activity rather than sector, we found that the proportion of former postdocs engaged in research was significantly higher than the proportion of non-postdocs (72.3% compared to 47.8%, p<.001). That said, a postdoc is not required for a research career (even though it may be required to be an NIH PI), since nearly half of those who skipped the postdoc worked in (self-reported) basic or applied research-related jobs. Finally, almost one-third (28%) of former postdocs were not engaged in research (SI Appendix Figure S6). Over time, the probability of obtaining a tenure-track research job has dropped significantly. Figure 4 graphs the 3-year moving average of the percentage of employed biomedical PhDs in each sector 10 years post-PhD (SI Appendix Figures S7A and S7B). We have also examined whether postdoc duration and the prestige of the postdoctoral institution correlate with employment sector 10 years post-PhD (SI Appendix, Figure   S8). Employment in each sector 10 years past PhD does depend on postdoc duration. The probability of obtaining a tenure-track job peaks with 5-6 years of postdoctoral experience, and then drops somewhat for postdocs of longer duration. Postdoc quality also influences employment sector. Thirty-nine percent of postdocs from above-median-ranked institutions hold academic tenure-track research jobs compared with 33% from below-median institutions. Finally, we measured the relationship between postdoc status and unemployment or being out of the labor force (SI Appendix Figure S9). There is no significant difference between former postdocs and non-postdocs in the low likelihood of being unemployed. Those who skipped postdocs were twice as likely to be out of the labor force as former postdocs (6.5% v. 3.5%, p<.001), mostly mothers who probably opted out of postdocs for that reason. The impact of starting in a postdoc on early career salaries. Others have noted that during the postdoc, scientists are poorly paid and work long hours, making their hourly wages extremely low (2,4,33). Clearly, the longer an individual remains in a postdoc, the larger the financial sacrifice. That said, the postdoc, as defined by the NSF and NIH, is a human capital investment in research skills and research independence. As economists, we expect that these human capital investments will yield a positive return in the labor market once postdocs obtain permanent positions. Our results indicate this was not the case. Consistent with postdocs' function as training, our data show that scientists were paid much less during postdocs than if they had gone directly into the workforce. The median annual salary of people who started in postdocs during their first three years after the PhD -when they would be in the postdoc -was $42,557 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars compared with $69,000 among those who entered the workforce directly. To analyze how postdocs affect later salaries, we regressed inflation-adjusted salary on years from PhD conditional on either starting in a postdoc or skipping the postdoc, including controls for ability, demographic characteristics and field and year dummy variables. (SI Appendix Table S5). Figure 5A graphs the salaries predicted by this regression for the first 15 years of the biomedical career post-PhD receipt, first assuming that everyone skips a postdoc and then assuming that everyone starts in a postdoc, with other variables held constant at their means. Controlling for background characteristics, 10-year post-PhD salaries of those who started in a postdoc averaged $9,627 lower than those who skipped the postdoc. Five-year post-PhD salary differences were even larger at $18,280. Although the earnings difference narrows with years past PhD, the estimated predicted salary of non-postdocs remains significantly higher for the first on work-experience, whereas individuals who spend time in a postdoc forgo that sizeable experience premium. This salary gap might be explained by employment sector. In the remaining panels of Figure 5 we look at the predicted average salary profile for those starting in and skipping the postdoc conditional on sector of employment 10 years past the PhD. Figures 5B through 5E show the predicted salary profiles in academic tenure-track research, academic non-track research, industry, and government and other sectors conditional on starting in a postdoc. The same overall pattern emerges, where postdocs earned less than non-postdocs throughout the first 15 years post-PhD in each sector, with their earnings significantly lower for the first 10 years or longer. (As expected, non-tenure track researchers earn significantly less than tenure-track researchers and industry salaries are higher and increase more quickly than non-industry salaries. The government/other is the only sector where the two wage trajectories cross (at 14 years post-PhD). Thus in each sector there is a substantial financial penalty for starting the biomedical career in a postdoc, and these differences accumulate. Over the first 15 years of their career (evaluating control variables at their means, using a discount rate of 3% and including lower salaries during the postdoc), those in tenure-track academic research who started in a postdoc earn a cumulative $149,480 (15%) less than those who skipped the postdoc; in non-tenure-track academic research they earn $150,217 (17%) less; in industry they earn $200,009 (16%) less, and in government/nonprofit they earn $149,774 (15%) less. These average cumulative salary gaps account for approximately 2-3 years of earnings in each of these sectors."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Over our sample time period, a roughly constant 81% of biomedical PhDs started their careers in a postdoc. Although a variety of market, funding and individual factors have small and significant effects on the probability that any individual biomedical PhD will become a postdoc, the average probability has been stable. However, the number of postdocs has increased because the number of biomedical PhDs has increased significantly. While the average postdoc duration crept up from 3.4 to 4.7 years for PhDs from 1980 to 1994, it has changed very little for later cohorts. These findings challenge some of the published assertions about recent trends in postdocs. Our paper contributes to the literature by moving beyond the postdoctoral period to compare the later careers of biomedical PhDs who started in a postdoc and those who did not. The likelihood that a postdoc led to an academic tenure-track job engaged in research ten years post-PhD was on average 28.0% for PhDs who graduated between 1980-2000 and fell to less than one-quarter (24.2%) for the most recent cohorts as the number of new tenure-track jobs available per PhD fell. More former-postdocs were engaged in research ten years post-PhD than those who skipped postdocs, but nearly half of those who skipped the postdoc worked in research-related jobs. We demonstrated that former postdocs continued to earn less than non-postdocs even ten or more years post-PhD. The nearly three-quarters of PhDs who entered a postdoc gave up an estimated 15% or more of their present value of income over the first 15 years of their careers, even controlling for sector. This suggests that postdoctoral education is not an investment in human capital. Instead, our findings indicate that the postdoc is a \"rat race\" where individuals compete for an increasingly limited number of academic tenure-track research jobs by signaling their ability and commitment via long hours in the lab and years spent as underpaid postdocs. One potential explanation for lower early career salaries could be that postdocs have lower average abilities. However, our previous analysis showed that postdocs have higher average abilities. Since higher ability scientists were more likely to pursue postdocs, we may actually be underestimating the financial loss from taking a postdoc. Alternatively, ability may be multidimensional: former postdocs might excel in academic research while the skills of those who skip the postdoc may earn higher non-academic returns. This would lead to our findings that non-postdocs have higher industry salaries. But this would also suggest that former postdocs should get higher salaries in research academia than non-postdocs; the opposite is true. In short, there is no obvious effect of unobserved ability consistent with our findings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "When providing prescriptions for what ails biomedical science, many have called for better information on the impact of the postdoc on biomedical careers. Our research answers this call. Starting in a postdoc improves the probability of working in a tenure-track research job. However, the chances of obtaining that job have dropped considerably over time, and given the glut of PhDs and the scarcity of new positions after the NIH doubling, this trend is likely to worsen. Outside of tenure-track academia, we show that future employers did not (financially) value the training or skills obtained during the postdoc. Instead, former postdocs pay an earnings penalty for more than 10 years of their careers -well past the time of completing the low-paid postdoc. For the nearly three-quarters of former postdocs who ultimately end up without a tenure-track academic job, the time spent in a postdoc not only constitutes a sizeable financial sacrifice but does not yield the desired academic career. Based on these findings, the majority of PhDs would be better off skipping the postdoc entirely. Our findings have implications for science policy. On the one hand, the current system of postdoctoral training benefits the postdocs' supervisors, mentors, their institutions and funding agencies by providing them with highly-educated labor willing to work long hours to produce cutting-edge science at low cost. On the other hand, no counterfactual exists to show whether our current system -where older PI's dominate the research agenda while young researchers are denied opportunities to be creative or productive independent researchers -creates more and better science than a system where more PhDs go directly into the workforce. Meanwhile, the present system entails significant time and foregone-income costs to individuals while not having demonstrable usefulness outside tenure-track academia. Furthermore, the postdoc rat-race may discourage the best and the brightest from pursuing careers in biomedical science because alternatives such as medicine or finance have shorter training periods and better pay. Instead of funding postdoctoral positions, we support the development of alternative staffing models. Staff scientist positions should be encouraged because they provide permanent employment, benefits, and higher salaries (2,6). Universities should consider tenure-track hires of the most highly recommended directly after PhD receipt. Recent moves by the NIH to increase salaries paid to postdocs, thereby making them more expensive as research labor, may in the long-run reduce the demand for postdocs and encourage the development of these alternative staffing models.     . \u00a7 \u00a7 The full sample has more observations than the sum of the sectors because it is not limited to those who were observed 10 years post-PhD. Also, we do not include the academic non-research sector because it only has 356 people (2,007 observations)."}]
