Evidence from both genetic at-risk cohorts and clinically normal older individuals suggests that the pathobiologic process of AD begins years before the diagnosis of clinical dementia. 1 Based on prior experimental evidence indicating that amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposition triggers the neurodegenerative process underlying AD, 2 a number of recent human studies have primarily focused on the relationship between A\u2424, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline to identify clinically normal elderly individuals considered to be in the preclinical stage of dementia. 3 However, amyloid plaques correlate poorly with memory decline 4 and immunotherapy-induced plaque removal may not prevent progressive neurodegeneration, 5 suggesting that other entities may be required for AD-related degeneration.\nRecent studies using transgenic mouse models show that the presence of tau is required for A\u2424 to induce neuronal and synaptic damage. 6 Reductions in tau protect against A\u2424-induced neuronal dysfunction, 7 while the presence of tau potentiates A\u2424-associated synapotoxicity. 8 Recent evidence from our laboratory indicates that in older humans at risk for dementia, A\u2424-associated volume loss occurs only in the presence of phospho-tau (p-tau). 9 Building upon this work, we used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of decreased A\u2424 and increased p-tau 181p , in vivo biomarkers of amyloid-\u2424, 10 and p-tau-associated neurofibrillary pathology 11 to investigate whether A\u2424-associated clinical decline in cognitively normal older individuals occurs only in the presence of p-tau."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We evaluated healthy older control participants (n=107) from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The ADNI is a large multisite collaborative effort launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations as a public-private partnership aimed at testing whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positronemission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychologic assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD. The Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (http://www .adni-info.org) is the result of the work by many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, with subjects recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada.\nEach participant was formally evaluated using eligibility criteria that are described in detail elsewhere (http://www.adni-info .org). The institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved the procedures for this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or surrogates. Experienced clinicians conducted independent semistructured interviews with the participant, and a knowledgeable collateral source that included health history, neurologic examination, and comprehensive neuropsychologic battery.\nWe evaluated participants who were clinically diagnosed at baseline as cognitively and clinically normal. We examined clinical decline (537 longitudinal assessments) using the global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) 12 and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAScog) subscale. 13 We restricted participants to those with baseline CSF data and baseline and follow-up clinical data.\nMethods for CSF acquisition and biomarker measurement using the ADNI cohort have been reported previously.\n14 In brief, CSF was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C at the University of Pennsylvania ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory. Amyloid-\u2424 from peptides 1-42, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and total tau (t-tau) was measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3) immunoassay kit-based reagents.\nUsing recently proposed CSF cutoffs, 14 we classified all participants based on high (\u03fe23 pg/mL, positive) and low (\u03fd23 pg/mL, negative) p-tau 181p levels as well as low (\u03fd192 pg/mL, positive) and high (\u03fe192 pg/mL, negative) A\u2424 1-42 levels (Table) .

Consistent with prior studies, [15] [16] [17] across all participants, we found that positive CSF A\u2424 1-42 status significantly correlated with change in global CDR (\u2424 1 = 0.03; standard error [SE] = 0.01; P = .04), CDR-SB (\u2424 1 = 0.09; SE = 0.05; P \u03fd .05), and ADAS-cog (\u2424 1 = 0.59; SE = 0.23; P = .01). To ensure that our results were not owing to a categorical treatment of variables, we examined CSF A\u2424 1-42 as a continuous variable and found significant associations between decreased CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels and change in global CDR (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.0002; SE = 0.0001; P = .03), CDR-SB (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.0009; SE = 0.0004; P = .04), and ADAS-cog (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.005; SE = 0.002; P = .02).\nWe next investigated whether the presence of CSF p-tau 181p influenced the relationship between CSF A\u2424 and longitudinal clinical decline. We found that positive CSF A\u2424 1-42 status was associated with change in global CDR only among CSF p-tau 181p -positive individuals (\u2424 1 = 0.06; SE = 0.02; P = .01). There was no association between CSF A\u2424 1-42 status and change in global CDR among CSF p-tau 181p -negative individuals (\u2424 1 = \u22120.02; SE = 0.02; P = .35).

Consistent with these results, we found that positive CSF A\u2424 1-42 status was associated with change in ADAS-cog scores only among CSF p-tau 181p -positive individuals (\u2424 1 = 0.94, SE = 0.32, P = .004) (Figure, B) . There was no association between CSF A\u2424 status and change in CDR-SB scores among CSF p-tau 181p -negative individuals (\u2424 1 = 0.41; SE = 0.34; P = .23).\nConsistent with the results obtained from categorizing subjects on the basis of cutoff values, we found that decreased CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels significantly associated with change in global CDR only among CSF p-tau 181p -positive individuals (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.005; SE = 0.0002; P = .02). Similarly, decreased CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels significantly associated with change in ADAS-cog scores (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.007; SE = 0.002; P = .006) and showed a trend toward significant association with change in CDR-SB scores (\u2424-coefficient = \u22120.002; SE = 0.001; P = .06) only among CSF p-tau 181p -positive individuals. Neither CSF p-tau 181p status nor CSF p-tau 181p level significantly associated with clinical decline, irrespective of CSF A\u2424 1-42 status.\nFinally, we examined whether the presence of a nonspecific form of tau-t-tau-affected the relationship between CSF A\u2424 and longitudinal clinical decline. We classified all participants based on high (positive, n = 22) and low (negative, n = 85) t-tau levels using a CSF cutoff value of 93 pg/mL. 14 We found that positive CSF A\u2424 1-42 status did not associate with change in global CDR or CDR-SB either among CSF t-tau-positive or -negative individuals. Positive CSF A\u2424 1-42 status significantly associated with change in ADAS-cog scores among CSF t-taupositive individuals (\u2424-coefficient = 1.43; SE = 0.49; P = .005) and showed a trend toward significance among CSF t-tau-negative individuals (\u2424-coefficient = 0.48; SE = 0.27; P = .07)."}, {"section_title": "COMMENT", "text": "Here, we show that in clinically normal older individuals, A\u2424-associated longitudinal clinical decline occurs only in the presence of elevated p-tau. In the absence of ptau, the effect of A\u2424 on longitudinal clinical decline is not significantly different from zero.\nThese findings provide important insights into the preclinical stage of AD. Consistent with prior studies, [18] [19] [20] [21] our results indicate that in clinically normal older individuals, A\u2424 deposition by itself is not associated with clinical decline; the presence of p-tau represents a critical link between A\u2424 deposition and accelerated clinical decline. Furthermore, our findings point to p-tau as an important marker of AD-associated degeneration. Elevations in CSF t-tau are seen in a number of neurologic disorders characterized by neuronal and axonal death, whereas increased CSF p-tau correlates with increased neurofibrillary pathology and can distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, 22 suggesting that p-tau may represent a more specific marker of the Alzheimer pathologic process than t-tau. When considered together with recent work from our laboratory, 9 these data suggest that the combination of p-tau and A\u2424 likely reflects underlying pathobiology of the preclinical stage of AD.\nRecent experiments using transgenic mice illustrate that the presence of tau potentiates A\u2424-associated neurodegeneration. Postsynaptic A\u2424 toxicity is tau dependent 6, 8 and tau reduction prevents premature mortality and memory deficits in APP23 mice. 7, 8 Our human data are consistent with these experimental findings.\nThis study has limitations. One concern is that CSF biomarkers provide an indirect assessment of amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology and may not fully reflect the biological processes underlying AD. Another concern is that although our findings indicate that CSF A\u2424 in combination with CSF p-tau 181p may better predict clinical decline than CSF A\u2424 in combination with CSF t-tau, prior studies have shown that CSF p-tau and t-tau when combined with CSF A\u2424 are equally predictive of decline. [18] [19] [20] [21] This difference may be related to slight differences in CSF measurement assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay vs Luminex), the nature of the participant population, or other factors. A third limitation is that we primarily focused on CSF biomarkers of the 2 pathologic hallmarks of AD. Additional markers, such as CSF levels of YKL-40 20 or visinin-like protein 1, 21 may also interact with A\u2424 to predict clinical decline in cognitively normal elderly individuals. Finally, the individuals we examined may represent a group of highly selected, generally healthy older adults who are motivated to participate in research studies. As such, these findings need to be further validated on an independent community-based cohort of older individuals that would be more representative of the general older population. From a clinical perspective, these results are consonant with the 3-stage preclinical AD framework recently proposed by the National Institute on AgingAlzheimer Association workgroup 3 and indicate that a biomarker profile consisting of both CSF A\u2424 and CSF p-tau 181p levels may better identify those older individuals who are at an elevated risk for progressing to eventual AD dementia than either biomarker by itself. Given that A\u2424 accumulation is necessary but not sufficient to express the clinical manifestations of AD dementia, 3 early intervention trials should take into account both the CSF p-tau 181p and CSF A\u2424 1-42 status of participants because older individuals with increased CSF p-tau 181p and decreased CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels are likely to have a different rate of clinical progression than individuals with normal CSF p-tau 181p and decreased CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels. These findings also illustrate the need for developing novel therapeutic approaches that specifically target tau. It is feasible that although A\u2424 initiates the degenerative cascade, elevated levels of tau may represent a second phase of the AD pathologic process where neurodegenerative changes occur largely independent of A\u2424. 23 As such, targeting downstream events, such as tau phosphorylation and aggregation, in older individuals with both decreased CSF A\u2424 and increased CSF p-tau 181p levels may be an additionally beneficial treatment strategy.
