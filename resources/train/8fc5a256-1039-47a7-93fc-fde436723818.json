Evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. Refi nements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of AD pathophysiology; modifi cations of the specifi c temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying AD biomarker changes, amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic AD, in which we hypothesise that an incident A\u03b2 pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "We proposed a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers that was intended to be a framework for invivo staging of the disease. The model focused on the fi ve most well established biomarkers of AD, which we propose can be divided into two major categories: measures of brain amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition and measures of neurodegeneration-defi ned as a pro gressive loss of neurons or their processes (axons and dendrites) with a cor responding progressive impairment in neuronal function. Brain A\u03b2 deposition is assessed by measures of CSF A\u03b2 42 1-5 and by PET amyloid imaging.

FDG PET and MRI follow a modality-specifi c topology that is characteristic of AD.\nThe model was initially presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in July, 2009, 17 and published in January, 2010. 18 It was based on evidence available at the time with the assumption that empirical assessment was needed. The purpose of this update is to review evidence addressing our model that has accumulated since its publication and to propose modifi cations to the original model based on these new data."}, {"section_title": "The original model", "text": "Our AD biomarkers model is predicated on the assumption that biomarkers are related to specifi c pathophysiological processes. This is supported by various biomarker-autopsy correlation studies. Low CSF A\u03b2 42 19,20 and uptake of amyloid PET tracers [21] [22] [23] [24] are associated with fi brillar A\u03b2 deposits. Correlation of CSF tau and A\u03b2 42 with neuropathology is diffi cult to disambiguate because, unlike with imaging, region-to-region correlations are not possible. Increases in t-tau 20 and p-tau 20, 25 are associated with neurofi brillary tangle (NFT) burden at autopsy, and in AD, p-tau and t-tau behave very similarly to each other. 2, 26, 27 Atrophy on MRI correlates with neuron loss, 28 , 29 Braak NFT stage, [30] [31] [32] [33] and tau immunostaining burden, 33 and does not correlate well with A\u03b2 load measured by immunohistology. 34 Thus MRI is a measure of tau-related neurodegeneration. Antemortem FDG PET hypo metabolism is also correlated with NFT burden and not with plaque burden at autopsy. 35 Our original AD biomarkers model was intended to incorporate the following principles, on the basis of data available at the time. Firstly, the major AD biomarkers become abnormal in a temporally ordered manner. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] CSF A\u03b2 42 and amyloid PET are dynamic earliest, followed by CSF tau and FDG PET, then structural MRI, followed by clinical symptoms. A\u03b2 biomarkers were denoted as upstream and neurodegenerative biomarkers as downstream. The 2010 model (and our updated model) does not propose that one biomarker changes and then stops, then the next one changes and then stops, and so on. Rather, the model assumes that the maximum rate of change moves sequentially from one biomarker class to the next, and as the disease progresses all biomarkers become progressively more abnormal simultaneously, albeit at rates that change over time in an ordered manner. Secondly, A\u03b2 dysregulation, which leads to plaque formation, is necessary but not suffi cient to produce the clinical AD syndrome. Cognitive decline is only loosely coupled with the rate or magnitude of amyloid PET and CSF A\u03b2 42 , 39, 40 but is closely coupled with the magnitude and rate of change in neurodegenerative biomarkers, [41] [42] [43] not only in typical AD, but also in atypical AD syndromes. 44, 45 Thirdly, rates of change in each biomarker follow a non-linear temporal course, 46 ,47 which we postulated to be sigmoid-shaped with time. The fourth principle was that a subject-specifi c lag in time exists between biomarker evidence of in-situ AD pathophysiology and the emergence of cognitive impairment, which is probably mediated by diff erences in brain resiliency or cognitive reserve. 48 Lastly, the added contributions of other pathophysiologies (eg, vascular disease, Lewy bodies, TDP-43 inclusions) that often cooccur with ageing also contribute substantially to interindividual variations in clinical disease expression."}, {"section_title": "Personal View", "text": "prototypical individual, with the vertical axis representing severity of biomarker abnormality and the horizontal axis representing progression along the AD pathophysiological pathway.\nEmpirical testing of basic features of the model can be approached in two ways-by addressing the order in which diff erent biomarkers become abnormal with disease progression over time, and by addressing the shapes of the biomarker curves as a function of clinical disease severity or time. Here we review studies that empirically address these features of our model.\nbetter modelled as a function of worsening cognition with sigmoid-shaped curves rather than linear fi ts. Sabuncu and colleagues 58 and Schuff and colleagues 59 independently examined brain atrophy rates in participants from the ADNI. Both reported that atrophy rates in some brain regions exhibit early acceleration followed by deceleration, which is consistent with a sigmoid-shaped trajectory; however, rates of change in other areas did not seem to plateau. Both groups noted that atrophy does not aff ect all areas of the brain simultaneously, but perhaps in a sequential manner.\nThe shapes of the trajectories of CSF A\u03b2 42 and t-tau, amyloid and FDG PET imaging, and structural MRI have recently been assessed in 897 individuals from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and the ADNI. 60 In at least one of the several models assessed, baseline-adjusted hippocampal volume, amyloid PET, and FDG PET data showed evidence of reaching a plateau as mini-mental state examination score worsened, which is consistent with a sigmoid-shaped trajectory.\nJack and colleagues 61 modelled the temporal trajectory of A\u03b2 accumulation using serial Pittsburgh compound B PET scans in 260 individuals spanning the cognitive continuum recruited at the Mayo Clinic and reported a sigmoidal relation between amyloid load and time. The same fi nding was reported from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study of ageing using fl utemetamol, an \u00b9\u2078F amyloid PET ligand. 62 Thus a sigmoid-shaped trajectory with respect to time was replicated in studies of two large independent cohorts with diff erent amyloid PET ligands.\nIn summary, evidence from several sources suggests that amyloid biomarkers do follow a sigmoid-shaped trajectory over time and approach a plateau. Some evidence suggests that FDG PET and some MRI atrophy measures follow a sigmoid-shaped trajectory. Some of the evidence cited above implies that in our original model (fi gure 1) the MRI and FDG PET curves should have been constructed with slopes that are not parallel to the amyloid biomarker curve and continue to change substantially through the dementia phase of the disease.\nthe specifi c pathophysiological processes that they measure, the sensitivity of histopathological assays is almost certainly greater than that of in-vivo biomarkers. This Personal View addresses three diff erent potential concepts that should be kept distinct: biomarkers of AD patho physio logy; histopathology that can be measured at aut opsy; and pathophysiological processes that are not yet accurately measurable with either biomarkers or histo path ology-eg, detection of various oligomeric forms of A\u03b2.\nOne of the most important criticisms of our original AD biomarker model was that it did not account for the fact that medial temporal limbic tau pathology is a nearly universal feature of ageing and that tau pathology typically appears in individuals at a younger age than do A\u03b2 plaques. 82 Indeed, since we presented our model, Braak and Del Tredici 83 have published the results of a study using AT8 immunostaining at autopsy of individuals aged younger than 30 years. AT8 is a phosphorylation-specifi c anti-tau monoclonal antibody that recognises pathologically phosphorylated tau at Ser202. AT8-positive pretangles (ie, positively stained perikarya) were reported in a high proportion of young individuals (as young as 6 years old) in select subcortical areas. On the basis of youngest age of appearance, Braak and Del Tredici 83 propose that tau pathology begins in the locus coeruleus. These changes then spread to other brainstem nuclei and to the entorhinal cortex, perhaps by direct cell-to-cell transmission. 84, 85 Braak and Del Tredici 83 therefore propose that subcortical tau deposition is the starting point of the AD pathophysiological cascade, beginning as early as the fi rst decade of life. An alternative point of view, however, posits that since subcortical and medial temporal limbic tauopathy occurs in such a high proportion of clinically asymptomatic individuals, 82 subcortical tau deposition does not represent the beginning of the AD patho physiological cascade, but instead is a variant of ageing that alone might lead to subtle cognitive impairment but not to AD.\nThe amyloid hypothesis 86 assumes serial causal events, with abnormal increases in A\u03b2 causing tau hyperphosphorylation. 87 Small and Duff , 87 however, have suggested that tau hyperphosphorylation and A\u03b2 accumulation might be independent patho physiological processes that share a common upstream cause. Mesulam 88 specifi cally suggested that protracted exposure to upregulation of cellular activity related to neural plasticity could represent the common upstream cause of both tau hyperphosphorylation and A\u03b2 accumulation. Duyckaerts 89 has also suggested that tau and A\u03b2 pathological changes could be independent processes, but with pathogenic synergy.\non the basis of the following fi ndings. The fact that genetically determined A\u03b2 overproduction leads to AD, 92 whereas genetically determined tauopathies do not, 93 does support a causal, instigating role for A\u03b2 and not tau in early-onset AD. A recently discovered coding mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene protects against lateonset AD. 94 Therefore, the case for causality points to A\u03b2 as the disease initiator in early-onset AD, and as either the initiator or an accelerator in sporadic AD in a subjectspecifi c manner. We do not propose that all sporadic cases follow the pattern outlined in fi gure 6. Rather, that at least two pathways to sporadic AD might exist-one as shown in fi gure 5 and the other in fi gure 6.\nthe full dynamic range of biomarker abnormalities cannot be known. This bias has the particularly insidious eff ect of selectively truncating the apparent dynamic range of later-changing relative to earlier-changing biomarkers. Thirdly, long-term within-subject longitudinal data are missing. Most biomarker modelling studies model longterm trends with cross-sectional or short-term follow-up, which leads to conclusions that are dominated by crosssectional trends and marred by the associated biases. Decades-long prospective multimodal observational studies, ideally in representative popu lations, will be necessary to provide defi nitive elucidation of the precise temporal sequence and time-dependent shape (or functional form) of AD biomarker changes. Finally, it will be important to follow up to autopsy as many people as possible whose biomarkers are studied during life."}, {"section_title": "Temporal ordering of biomarker abnormalities", "text": "Buchhave and colleagues 26 followed up 137 individuals for an average of 9\u00b72 years after baseline CSF analysis. All patients had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at baseline and 72 (54%) progressed to AD. The investigators reported that CSF A\u03b2 42 was fully abnor mal 5-10 years or more before dementia diagnosis. By contrast, both CSF t-tau and p-tau became progressively more abnormal as the time to diagnosis of dementia decreased. p-tau and t-tau behaved identically over time (fi gure 2).\nJack and colleagues 50 assessed the temporal ordering of CSF biomarkers and structural MRI in 401 elderly people from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who were either cognitively normal, had mild cognitive impairment, or had AD. Temporal ordering was implied if one biomarker was abnormal more often than another earlier in the course of the disease, in a manner analogous to Braak staging from autopsies of people at diff erent ages. Within each clinical group, CSF A\u03b2 42 was abnormal more often than t-tau or hippocampal volume. CSF t-tau was abnormal more often than hippocampal volume only in cognitively normal people (fi gure 3). 50 Lo and colleagues 51 examined rates of change in CSF A\u03b2 42 , FDG uptake, and hippocampal volume in 819 people from the ADNI. They concluded that the longitudinal biomarker patterns support a sequence in which amyloid deposition is an early event that precedes hypometabolism or hippocampal atrophy.\nForster and colleagues 52 followed up 20 individuals with mild AD with longitudinal FDG PET and amyloid PET. They noted little change in the anatomical extent of amyloid PET over time, whereas FDG PET hypometabolism expanded signifi cantly. They concluded that by the time patients became demented, amyloid deposition was static whereas the expansion of FDG hypometabolism was continuing.\nLandau and colleagues 53 examined associations between amyloid PET, hypometabolism on FDG PET, and retrospective longitudinal cognitive measurements in 426 individuals from the ADNI. They concluded that \"amyloid deposition has an early and subclinical impact on cognition that precedes metabolic changes\", and that hypometabolism becomes more pronounced later in the course of the disease when it is closely linked temporally to overt cognitive symptoms.\nReports from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) 54 and studies of Colombian kindred carriers of a PSEN1 mutation 55 support the idea of a protracted preclinical period during which biomarkers become abnormal sequentially while people remain clinically asymptomatic. Additionally, the DIAN results suggest that CSF A\u03b2 42 might become abnormal before amyloid PET, with CSF A\u03b2 42 initially starting at abnormally high concentrations followed by a progressive decline. 54 DIAN results also suggest that tau becomes abnormal before FDG PET and that FDG PET and MRI become abnormal in close temporal proximity to each other (fi gure 4). 54 In summary, evidence that has accumulated since our model 18 was fi rst published clearly supports the general temporal ordering framework of our model, in which amyloid biomarkers become abnormal fi rst, followed by biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and then clinical symptoms. However, less evidence has been obtained to defi ne the relative temporal ordering of CSF tau, FDG PET, and structural MRI."}, {"section_title": "Shapes of biomarker curves", "text": "In our 2010 model, 18 we proposed that biomarkers curves assume a sigmoidal shape as a function of time.

[63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] Non-AD pathophysiological processes present two closely related challenges to empirical AD biomarker modelling in elderly people: the high prevalence in elderly individuals of two or more co-occurring pathophysiological processes, one of which is AD; and the presence of individuals who have predominantly a non-AD pathophysiological process. One solution to the confounding problem of non-AD pathophysiologies in elderly cohorts 50, 58, 60, 69 is to analyse the subset of participants who test positive for AD biomarkers to screen out people who are not following the AD pathophysiological pathway. That approach will probably require diff erent thresholds for biomarker positivity, lenient thresholds to identify people who have just entered the AD pathway, and more stringent thresholds for clinical use as diagnostics. 70 "}, {"section_title": "Defi nition of the vertical and horizontal axes", "text": "Our model 18 was designed to have quantifi able horizontal and vertical axes (fi gure 1). We constructed the vertical axis on a minimum to maximum scale, so that each biomarker is scaled in relation to its own full dynamic range from values recorded in completely unaff ected individuals to maximally abnormal values (ie, patients with end-stage dementia). We placed progressive clinical disease stage on the horizontal axis (fi gure 1). Although it is certainly true that every person who develops AD exhibits progressive cognitive decline, indexing of individuals on the horizontal axis by clinical disease stage or continuous measures of cognitive impairment has proved to be a fl awed approach for several reasons. Important pathophysiological changes occur in the preclinical phase that might constitute half or more of the total disease duration, and the preclinical stage is when measures of cognitive decline are most imprecise. Moreover, interindividual variation in cognitive reserve obscures the relation between patho physio logical severity and cognitive performance. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Furthermore, common non-AD pathophysiological changes in elderly people modulate the specifi c relation between AD pathophysiology and cognitive impairment in unpredictable ways on an individual basis."}, {"section_title": "Possible solutions to forming the horizontal axis", "text": "The ideal dataset with which to model AD biomarker trajectories would consist of all biomarkers obtained at several sampling points in many representative individuals followed prospectively for decades beginning in middle age. These data will take decades to acquire. In the interim, modelling will have to be done in a piecewise fashion from data from individuals at various stages of the disease. In order of increasing validity, such approaches include purely cross-sectional data, crosssectional imaging with longitudinal clinical follow-up, and short-term (2-5 years) concurrent serial imaging and clinical assessments. All these approaches demand that individual patients' data be placed in an appropriate order along the AD pathophysiological pathway. Some recent examples are discussed below.\nOne approach involves forming the horizontal axis as time in years relative to an anchoring event. Buchhave and colleagues 26 and Knopman and colleagues 77 used an has used the age of onset of dementia in the aff ected parent as the temporal anchor for mutation carriers, thus permitting estimates of the longitudinal behaviour of clinical and biomarker metrics from cross-sectional data. Donohue and colleagues 79 modelled long-term bio marker trends from short-term within-subject data in the ADNI using shape invariant modelling that places time on the horizontal axis. These methods can model subject-specifi c rescaling and shifting of time in datasets with no specifi c common anchoring event such as incident dementia.\nJedynak and colleagues 80 and Mungas and colleagues 81 focused on novel composite horizontal axes that capture the latent trait descriptors of underlying AD pathophysiological processes by combining several biomarkers in a non-linear way; the horizontal axis represents the entire disease range with one horizontal-axis metric that can be thought of as a latent trait. 81 Each biomarker contributes to this single latent trait metric, with greater weighting where it is most dynamic in the disease range. Figure 5 is a revised version of our original 2010 model (fi gure 1) that incorporates new fi ndings and also addresses some of the shortcomings described in the preceding paragraphs. Although our revised model has many similarities with our 2010 model, diff erences do exist. Firstly, the horizontal axis in our revised model is expressed as time, not clinical disease stage. The absolute time in years needed to traverse the disease pathway from left to right and the specifi c age at which a person enters the disease pathway will vary among individuals."}, {"section_title": "Model revision", "text": "A range of possible cognitive outcomes is shown at given positions along the horizontal axis. This refl ects the fact that each individual responds to AD pathophysiological changes uniquely. 73, 74 People with a high risk of cognitive impairment due to AD patho physiological processes have a cognitive impairment curve that is shifted to the left in time. Such high-risk individuals might harbour more genetic risk alleles, have low cognitive reserve, pursue lifestyles that increase the likelihood for cognitive impairment, or have other comorbid brain pathological changes. By contrast, low-risk individuals with a protective genetic profi le, high cognitive reserve, no comorbid brain pathological changes, and low lifestyle risks for dementia can coexist with substantial AD pathophysiology and still maintain normal cognitive function. Thus cognitive impairment in fi gure 5 is shown as a zone with low-risk and high-risk borders.\nThe revised model includes modifi cations of the specifi c ordering of some biomarkers on the basis of reports described above. CSF A\u03b2 42 is now positioned slightly before amyloid PET, which is followed by CSF tau. FDG PET and MRI are drawn coincidentally as the last biomarkers to become abnormal, but those that track most closely with progressive cognitive impairment.\nAll biomarkers are still confi gured as sigmoids, but the shapes of the sigmoid curves are no longer identical. The curves have a progressively steeper slope in the right-hand tail for later-changing biomarkers. Finally, the biomarker curves are drawn closer together in the revised model, indicating less distinct temporal separation."}, {"section_title": "Autopsy evidence that tau pathophysiology can precede A\u03b2 deposition", "text": "Ours is a model of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers in relation to each other and to the progression of clinical symptoms. Although biomarkers do refl ect "}, {"section_title": "Model incorporating tau and A\u03b2 pathology as independent processes", "text": "Two sets of evidence exist that on the surface seem contradictory. First, several independent sources of AD biomarker evidence in elderly people and in young autosomal-dominant mutation carriers suggest that the sequence of events depicted by these biomarkers is A\u03b2 pathophysiology fi rst, then tau-related neurodegeneration. However, autopsy data 83 suggest that ADlike tauopathy precedes A\u03b2 deposition. One way to integrate these apparently confl icting data into a coherent model of disease is a variation on the theme of tauopathy and A\u03b2 pathophysiology arising independently. This integrative model recognises that the earliest evidence of AD pathophysiological changes lies beneath the detection threshold of in-vivo AD biomarkers. In this proposed integrative model (fi gure 6), subcortical tauopathy is the fi rst AD pathophysiological process to arise in many individuals and is detectable only by immunostaining methods. This tauopathy, however, does not by itself lead to AD. A\u03b2 pathophysiology arises later and independently from pre-existing tauopathy. Through unknown mechanisms, A\u03b2 pathophysiological changes quali tatively transform and, as proposed by Price and Morris, 90 accelerate the antecedent subcortical tauopathy leading to neocortical spread of NFTs. 91 Acceleration of the initial slowly developing subcortical tauopathy occurs after A\u03b2 biomarkers become abnormal. FDG PET and MRI biomarker changes then occur, followed last by onset of overt clinical symptoms.\nIn elderly people, the theme of tauopathy and amyloid pathophysiology as independent processes with a common causal factor is consistent with the notion of a general age-related failure to clear misfolded proteins, a failure of normal protective mechanisms to sequester toxic soluble forms of these proteins, or both. However, we propose in fi gure 6 that an independently arising A\u03b2 pathophysiology can accelerate an antecedent tauopathy "}, {"section_title": "Biomarkers that precede A\u03b2 deposition", "text": "Biomarker research is advancing in the search for biomarker abnormalities that temporally precede A\u03b2 biomarkers. Evidence exists that FDG PET hypometabolism in an AD-like pattern occurs in some APOE \u03b54 carriers in middle-aged and young adults. 95, 96 The presumption is that this hypometabolism refl ects an eff ect of APOE \u03b54 on glucose metabolism that temporally precedes amyloid deposition. This presumption must be tempered, however, with more recent data indicating that FDG PET is a laterchanging biomarker than amyloid PET or CSF A\u03b2 42 . [51] [52] [53] [54] Although APOE \u03b54 increases the risk and the amount of A\u03b2 accumulation, and lowers the age at which A\u03b2 deposition appears, 97, 98 APOE \u03b54 has also been linked to mechanisms that are unrelated to amyloid deposition. 99, 100 Studies have been focusing on functional MRI as a method to probe relations between synaptic activity and features of AD. Task-free functional MRI (TF-fMRI) is particularly appealing because measures of functional connectivity and network dynamics are obtained without administering a functional activation task (which needs specialised equipment that is not available at many MRI centres). Both Mesulam 88 and Buckner and colleagues 101 have proposed pathophysiological models that relate the long-term demands of cognitive activity to AD pathophysiological processes 88 and imaging changes, 101 thus providing a mechanistic link between the physiological processes interrogated by TF-fMRI and AD pathophysiology. TF-fMRI disturbances in the tasknegative (ie, default mode) and task-positive functional networks have been described in AD and mild cognitive impairment, [102] [103] [104] [105] in elderly cognitively normal APOE \u03b54 carriers, and in cognitively normal people who are amyloid-positive. [106] [107] [108] Network disturbances have also been des cribed in middle-aged and elderly cognitively normal people who are APOE \u03b54 carriers but who have normal amyloid PET scans, 109 in APOE \u03b54 carriers in young adulthood (in their 20s), 110 and in asymptomatic carriers of autosomal-dominant mutations years before estimated age of dementia onset. 111 Using a functional connectivity optical intrinsic signal imaging technique, Bero and colleagues 112 have shown reduced functional connectivity in young transgenic AD mice in the same topological locations where amyloid deposits appear later in life. These fi ndings suggest that TF-fMRI might show abnormalities before amyloid biomarkers become abnormal, prompting Jagust and Mormino 113 to propose a cause-and-eff ect relation between lifelong synaptic activity and amyloid deposition in multimodal cortical network hubs. Greater synaptic activity generally leads to greater amyloid deposition; however, this relation is modulated by inter individual variation in cognitive reserve and the eff ects of APOE."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and future directions", "text": "The discussion above emphasises the need for discovery of new biomarkers that would allow the testing of hypotheses that can currently be framed only in theoretical terms. This list includes CSF analytes or PET ligands that are sensitive to the AT8 tauopathy described in young people by Braak and Del Tredici 83 and PET ligands that measure NFTs and soluble A\u03b2. 114 Imaging and biofl uid markers of TDP-43 and \u03b1-synuclein, and imaging detection of hippocampal sclerosis and microinfarctions are needed. The absence of reliable plasma biomarkers for any of the above pathophysiological processes is a major hurdle to population screening, but strategies to overcome this limitation might be on the horizon. 115 So-called AD-signature topographical patterns of abnormality have been identifi ed for MRI and FDG PET. 11, [116] [117] [118] However, much biomarker modelling has been done by compressing multivoxel imaging data into one value representing the prototypical AD signature for each imaging modality. Additional research should be devoted to assessment of topographical spread of disease within each imaging modality as a marker of disease stage. 119, 120 In addition to the development of new biomarkers to fi ll in gaps in tracking relevant pathophysiological processes, appropriate cohorts for the assessment of biomarker evolution are needed. Most large longitudinal cohorts that incorporate AD biomarkers have at least three major design limitations. Firstly, middle-aged individuals are inadequately sampled.
