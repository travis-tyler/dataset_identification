While English Proficient students living at or above the poverty threshold had higher 1st-grade mathematics scores than their peers living in poverty (58 vs. 49 points), no measurable difference was observed between the scores of English Language Learners by poverty level.

Mother's education. Among English Proficient students, those whose mothers had a bachelor's degree or higher outscored students whose mothers had less than a high school education (61 vs. 51 points). A similar finding was observed for students whose primary home language was English (67 vs. 47 points).

The majority of language-minority students were Hispanic. Approximately half of all English Language Learners lived in poverty and had a mother with less than a high school education. Overall, language-minority students scored lower on a 1st-grade mathematics assessment than did students whose primary home language was English. English Language Learners generally scored lower than English Proficient students and students whose primary home language was English. This was true for students overall, for Asian and Hispanic students, as well as for students who lived at or above the poverty threshold. Between 1st and 5th grades, there was no measurable difference in gain scores on the mathematics assessment among the three language groups. However, differences within and between the language groups were found by student background characteristics. For example, Asian language-minority students made greater gains than their Hispanic peers. Among students living in poverty and students whose mothers had a high school diploma, English Proficient students made greater gains than English Language Learners and students whose primary home language was English. Finally, among students whose mothers had less than a high school education, language-minority students had larger gain scores than students whose primary home language was English. , and ability to understand and produce language.

In order to measure academic growth, overlapping items were included in at least two rounds of data collection. 2 Mathematics achievement was chosen as the focus of this analysis because the mathematics assessment was conducted in both English and Spanish in first grade, while the reading assessment was conducted only in English. Therefore, the analytic sample from the mathematics assessment was more inclusive of the language-minority population. 3 The poverty status variable is derived from household in-come and the total number of household members. Federal poverty thresholds are used to define households below the poverty level. Students living in households where the income fell below the appropriate threshold (based on Census information from 1999, see http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/thresh99 .html) were classified as living in poverty. 4 The final analytic sample includes 7,130 students. 5 Language-minority students are defined as those who speak a language other than English at home as reported by the parent. The language-minority categories are based on the student's status upon kindergarten entry. 6 Language-minority children were classified as English Proficient or English Language Learners based on their score on the Oral Language Development Scale (OLDS). The OLDS is an English language proficiency screener that measured children's listening comprehension, vocabulary, and ability to understand and produce language. The range of possible scores was 0 to 60, and children who received scores higher than 36 were considered English proficient and received the full English direct assessment. If a child scored 36 or below on the language screener but spoke Spanish, he or she was administered a Spanish form of the mathematics assessment. Analyses indicate that the English and Spanish mathematics assessments function in a similar manner (Rock and Pollack 2002). In other words, there was no advantage or disadvantage to taking the assessment in Spanish. 102.0 56.3 \u2021 Reporting standards not met (too few cases). 1 Language-minority status was determined by parent's report of primary language at home and Oral Language Development Scale (OLDS) results in 1998-99.

The OLDS is an English language proficiency screener that measured children's listening comprehension, vocabulary, and ability to understand and produce language.

However, the score was reestimated to have the potential score range of 0 to 153, the same score range as the 5th grade scale score, allowing comparisons between the two grades.
