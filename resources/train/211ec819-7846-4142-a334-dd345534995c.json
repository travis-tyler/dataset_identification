DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Primary care in communities. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in 2009 who received all their primary care from NPs or PCPs were selected from a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries (N = 64,354). MEASUREMENTS: Propensity score matching within each state was used to compare these two cohorts with regard to rate of eye examinations, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) testing, nephropathy monitoring, specialist consultation, and Medicare costs. The two groups were also compared regarding medication adherence and use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (for individuals with a diagnosis of hypertension), and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). RESULTS: Nurse practitioners and PCPs had similar rates of LDL-C testing (odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-1.09) and nephropathy monitoring (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98-1.03), but NPs had lower rates of eye examinations (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84-0.93) and HbA1C testing (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98). NPs were more likely to have consulted cardiologists (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21-1.37), endocrinologists (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.48-1.82), and nephrologists (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.67-2.17) and more likely to have prescribed PIMs (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.12). There was no statistically significant difference in adjusted Medicare spending between the two groups (P = .56). CONCLUSION: Nurse practitioners were similar to PCPs or slightly lower in their rates of diabetes mellitus guideline-concordant care. NPs used specialist consultations more often but had similar overall costs of care to PCPs. J Am Geriatr Soc 63 :1980-1988, 2015.

A recent meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 38,974 participants of all ages seeking care for all conditions reported that NP care was associated with higher overall survival and lower hospitalization rates for subgroups of participants, with conflicting findings on costs of care. 5 Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (N = 30,247) comparing NP with PCP care found no statistically significant differences in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). 6 Several factors may account for the mixed findings from studies comparing NPs with physicians. Most of the trials had small sample sizes, with 10 of 11 RCTs having fewer than 200 participants per group and a high dropout rate. Only two RCTs were conducted in the United States. Participants and clinicians were clustered in geographically selected healthcare settings, systems, and practices. 6, 7 The generalizability of these findings to adults aged 65 and older in the United States is limited because most of the studies were based on data from predominantly younger subjects and from clinics affiliated with academic hospitals or Veterans Affairs clinics. 8 To address this knowledge gap, the current study of a large, nationally representative cohort of older adults with diabetes mellitus examined the differences in the processes and cost of care provided by NPs and PCPs. It was hypothesized that individuals with diabetes mellitus cared for by NPs would receive care similar to that of those cared for by PCPs but at a lower cost."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Establishment of the Study Cohorts", "text": "First, all Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus in 2009 were identified from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Disease Data Warehouse (CCDW). 9 Next, to select the NP cohort, all Medicare beneficiaries who received all of their primary care from NPs in 2009 were identified by selecting individuals with billing records for two or more outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) services by NPs and no outpatient E&M services from PCPs (general practitioner, family physician, general internist, geriatrician).

The frequency of provider visits and the use of specialist consultations was also evaluated. The Modified Modified Continuity Index (MMCI) was used to measure continuity of care. 15 A higher MMCI indicates better care continuity, which has been shown to be associated with better health outcomes and patient satisfaction in primary care practice. 16 Measures in medication management endorsed by the National Quality Forum were selected. 17 The use of statins was examined for all participants and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for participants with a diagnosis of hypertension. The diabetes mellitus medication possession ratio (MPR), a measure of medication adherence, was also examined. Measures of medication safety examined use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and use of antimicrobials known to have possible adverse interactions with sulfonylureas. [18] [19] [20] The Beers criteria 2003 list of inappropriate medications in older adults was used to define PIMs 18 and the antimicrobials (including fluconazole, sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and levofloxacin) were identified from published studies. 19, 20 Finally, Medicare costs in 2009 were estimated according to the Medicare paid amount in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, Outpatient Standard Analytical Files, and Carrier files, following the payment calculation worksheets provided by the Research Data Assistance Center."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "The nonpooling approach of propensity score analysis was used to assess differences in processes of care between individuals cared for by NPs and PCPs. 21 In these analyses, the likelihood that a participant would be cared for by an NP was calculated from a logistic regression model that incorporated the participant characteristics listed in Participants in the PCP group were matched to those in the NP group based on state-specific propensity scores. A 1:1 matching algorithm, without replacement, was adopted based on the nearest Mahalanobis metric within the calipers of width equal to 0.10 of the standard deviation of the logit of the nonpooling propensity score. 22, 23 Conditional logistic models were used for binary outcomes and general linear mixed models for continuous outcomes. A two-part conditional model that included a logit model in the first part (which estimated the percentage of participants with any Medicare costs) and a log gamma model in the second part (which estimated the average costs in those participants) was used to estimate differences in Medicare costs in 2009 dollars. 24 Overall, 87.0% of participants from the NP group and 26.0% of those from the PCP group in the unmatched study cohort met the criteria for the main analyses. The unmatched study cohort was also analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model and a general linear model to study the average differences between the two groups.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of these individuals stratified according to provider type (NP, PCP). Before nonpooling propensity score matching, participants in the NP group were more likely to be female, younger, and impoverished and to reside in nonurban areas and in states with fewer restrictions on the scope of NP practice. They were less likely to be minorities and had fewer comorbidities, complications of diabetes mellitus, hospitalizations, and provider visits in the previous year than those in the PCP group. After nonpooling propensity score matching, participants in both groups were well balanced regarding age, sex, race, Medicaid eligibility, complications of diabetes mellitus, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, but participants in the NP group had fewer comorbidities, fewer primary care provider visits, and fewer hospitalizations in the previous year. Table 2 shows the processes of care according to provider type. The unadjusted and adjusted results were calculated for each measure in unmatched and matched study cohorts. Participants in the NP group had a similar number of provider visits (9.0 AE 6.5) as those in the PCP group (9.2 AE 6.3) (P = .19) and slightly lower continuity of care (0.72 AE 0.21 vs 0.75 AE 0.20, P < .001) but were more likely to receive specialist consultations for cardiologists (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21-1.37), endocrinologists (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.48-1.82), and nephrologists (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.67-2.17). Table 3 shows diabetes mellitus medication management according to provider type. The unadjusted and adjusted results were determined for each measure in unmatched and matched study cohorts. For the matched analyses, participants in the NP group had slightly lower adherence to diabetes mellitus medication (MPR 73.7 AE 23.0 vs 74.8 AE 22.2, P < .001) and were less likely to be prescribed statins (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89-0.99). Participants in the NP (31.3%) and PCP (30.6%) groups had a high rate of exposure to PIMs, although NP participants were slightly more likely to be prescribed PIMs (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.12). The two groups did not differ significantly in prescribing ACEIs or ARBs for participants with hypertension or in prescribing antimicrobials known to have possible adverse drug interactions with sulfonylureas. Table 4 compares Medicare spending for participants cared for by NPs and PCPs. Spending was also stratified according to type of service (e.g., professional charge, hospitalization). For the matched analysis, the adjusted Medicare spending was similar between participants cared for by NPs and PCPs (P = .56). The costs for primary care professional services and inpatient care were significantly lower for the NP group (P < .001), but the outpatient facility costs were significantly higher (P < .001). The higher outpatient facility costs were from charges for rural hospitals, freestanding clinics, laboratory tests, cardiology tests, and medications."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Other than LDL-C screening, the findings on the rate of older individuals with diabetes mellitus receiving recommended processes of care were close to provider recognition program criteria or the national benchmark for health plan accreditation of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (eye examination, 60%; nephropathy monitoring, 80%; HbA1C test, 94%; LDL-C screening, 93%). 25, 26 Similarly, the rate of adherence to diabetes mellitus medications (MPR) was approximately 75%, which was somewhat below the target of 80% reported by the National Quality Forum 2010 report for individuals with diabetes mellitus aged 18-75. 27 Participants receiving care from NPs were less likely than those receiving care from PCPs to have undergone eye examinations and HbA1c testing but as likely to have a lipid test and nephropathy monitoring. Findings from past studies have been mixed, with some showing NPs having rates of eye examinations and tests equivalent to or higher than those of PCPs, whereas others showed the opposite. [4] [5] [6] [7] 28 One study 7 comparing practices with NPs with physician-only practices found that practices with NPs were more likely to assess HbA1c and lipids. Another study 28 also showed that NPs ordered HbA1c tests and urinalysis more often than physicians. It is not clear whether differences in processes of care between NPs and PCPs affect outcomes such as emergency department and urgent care visits.\nIt was also found that participants cared for by NPs were more likely to have been referred to cardiologists, endocrinologists, and nephrologists than participants cared for by PCPs. The higher use of consulting and outpatient facilities by participants cared for by NPs is consistent with past studies, 1,29 although a randomized trial comparing NP with PCP quality of care showed that individuals who saw NPs and physicians had similar numbers of hospitalizations and outpatient visits for primary care, specialty care, and emergency and urgent care. 30 A study 31 showed that care received in a nurses-led clinic under the supervision of a diabetologist resulted in better diabetes mellitus control outcomes. The more-frequent specialist consultations associated with NP care may reflect a process necessary, in this provider group, to access the expertise and skills of physicians. Higher proportions of participants cared for by NPs experienced renal failure and pulmonary circulation disease. The frequent specialist consultations suggest that NPs recognize limitations in their training when caring for medially complex individuals with multiple comorbidities. It is important that state regulations allow and encourage NPs to make referrals to specialist consultants independently. This is consistent with the Institute of Medicine recommendation on liberalizing state laws regulating the practice of NPs in the 2010 report The Future of Nursing. Conditional logistic regression was adjusted for clustering within states of residential areas, comorbidity, provider visits, and hospitalization in prior year. Only comorbidity measures that were significantly different between two groups after matching were adjusted."}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "d\nThe corresponding results were produced in participants with hypertension.\ne Use of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) was based on the Beers criteria, which include medications and drug-disease combination with a high risk-benefit ratio for older adults.\nf These analyses were performed only with participants receiving sulfonylureas."}, {"section_title": "JAGS OCTOBER 2015-VOL. 63, NO. 10 DIABETES MELLITUS CARE BY NPS VS PCPS", "text": "The rate of use of PIMs was close to that in a previous study. 33 Some of these medications prolong hypoglycemia in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Other medications on the Beers list could be used for common comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus, such as depression and hypertension. Safe alternatives for these medications exist. Individuals with diabetes mellitus are at high risk of falls, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal autonomic dysfunction, and other diabetes mellitus-related complications. Many of the Beers PIMs increase the risks of these complications in elderly adults. 34 The current study showed a slightly higher rate of use of PIMs in participants cared for by NPs. Although the difference was small, the effect on individuals receiving these medications could be severe. An analysis of prescription data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey database of individuals seen by NPs, physician assistants, and physicians showed that NPs had the highest mean number of prescriptions written per primary care visit for individuals in rural areas. 35 The involvement of specialists can increase the risk of polypharmacy and potential adverse drug events.\nThe findings of similar cost of care between individuals cared for by NPs and PCPs are consistent with past studies. 8, 36, 37 A Cochrane meta-analysis showed that participants receiving care from NPs had longer clinic visits and higher frequency of return visits, with no difference in cost. 8 The longer consultation time and greater number of clinic visits associated with NP care may be necessary for older adults with diabetes mellitus, given that this group requires time to coordinate care and visits with various consultants (e.g., podiatry and ophthalmology); carefully monitor complications and comorbidities; manage complex drug regimens; and address social, psychological, and functional concerns.\nThe study has several limitations. First, NPs may deliver care to healthier, less medically complex individuals than PCPs, but comparing results from unmatched analyses shows that nonpooling propensity score matching reduced the differences between the two groups on several measurements for disease and medication management. Selection bias may explain the lower rate of eye examinations, HbA1c tests, and statin prescriptions in the NP group, although if NPs care for less medically complex individuals needing simpler medication regimens, the bias may be in the direction of underestimating the use of PIMs. Second, to reduce heterogeneity in the study population between NPs and PCPs, only individuals taking diabetes mellitus medication were included, not those controlled using diet alone. Third, the cost estimation did not include costs associated with home health care, durable equipment, or medication. Fourth, because there was no access to laboratory data, it was not possible to assess the degree to which diabetes mellitus was adequately controlled in the two groups completely. Fifth, only the pattern of care for which claims are generated was examined. Other care patterns, such as foot care or dietary advice, which is generally included in routine care, cannot be assessed. Sixth, the cross-sectional study design limited the ability to examine temporal patterns of the study variables. Further longitudinal study will help to characterize the differences in care delivery between NPs and PCPs and the effect of these differences on outcomes. Last, many participants receiving care from NPs also received care from PCPs, 13 but this group was excluded from the analyses. Their results may be different. It also could not be distinguished whether NPs practiced in exclusive NP clinics (e.g., rural health clinics or retail clinics) or collaborative practices.\nIn conclusion, overall delivery of diabetes mellitus care was similar for NPs and PCPs. Both groups had high rates of prescribing of PIMs and medications with potential interactions. These rates underscore the need to design and implement more-effective medical and advanced nursing education programs to improve the appropriateness and safety of prescribing by primary care providers of older adults living with diabetes mellitus. Future studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, the reasons for frequent use of specialist consultation, and the necessity of outpatient facility charges. This information will help further clarify the differences in processes and cost of care between the two groups. "}]
