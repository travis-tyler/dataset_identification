Although often ignored in modeling studies, land management itself may form significant feedbacks. Because crops are harvested earlier under drier conditions, regional air temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, for example, affect harvest timing, particularly of rain-fed crops. This removal of vegetation alters the land surface characteristics and may, in turn, affect regional climate.

Impacts occur from local to global scales and include loss of biodiversity, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, erosion, disruption of the fire regime, and climate change [Vitousek, 1994; Ostlie, 1997] .\nThe Great Plains of the United States have experienced extensive land cover modification. Due to rich soil and favorable climate, vast tracts have been converted from prairie to managed agriculture. Historically, the prairie in this region extended over 2.6 million km 2 , from Canada to Mexico and the foothills of the Rockies to Indiana [Ostlie, 1997] . The extent of land-surface modification increases from west to east. Between 82\nand 99% of the tallgrass prairie, predominately found in the eastern section of the Great Plains, has been converted [Samson and Knopf, 1994] . Using Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiospectometry (AVHRR) 1-km satellite data, Loveland and Hutcheson [1995] estimate that 25% and 90% of historical short-and tallgrass prairie, respectively, were under cultivation by 1990.\nVegetation influences climate through land surface properties, e.g., albedo, surface roughness, rooting depth, leaf area index, and canopy resistance [Pielke and Avissar, 1990 ] over a range of spatial and temporal scales [Pielke, 1993; Pielke et al., 1998 ]. These land-surface characteristics vary by land-cover type. Thus anthropogenic modification of vegetation alters these characteristics and consequently climate. The specific effect of conversion to cropland depends on the crop type and its properties in comparison with those of the land cover type that it replaces. In addition, human modification affects landscape heterogeneity, which observational and modeling studies have shown may induce or modify mesoscale circulations [Segal et al., 1998 ].\nThroughout sections of the Great Plains, the dominant agricultural crop is winter wheat, which is planted in early fall and harvested in June or July. This pattern contrasts sharply with the seasonal cycle of prairie grasses, which are most active from June to September. We expect that the change from prairie to winter wheat alters the magnitude and seasonal timing of energy, momentum, water, and carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and ecosystem. McPherson et al. [2004] showed a striking discontinuity in visual greenness between the winter wheat region in Oklahoma and the surrounding vegetation and argued that these changes impact maximum daily near-surface air temperature and dewpoint. Using data from automated Mesonet sites throughout Oklahoma, they detected a summer warming and winter cooling in the winter wheat region relative to the surrounding area. In a study combining modeled and observational data of July conditions in Oklahoma, Weaver and Avissar [2001] demonstrated that landscape heterogeneity, such as that associated with intermixed winter wheat and other crops, was sufficient to induce vertical velocities of 1-2 m s -1 . Their simulated vertical velocity patterns coincided with satellite observations of cloud formation, implying that these enhanced vertical velocities were sufficient to induce convective cloud formation.\nModeling sensitivity experiments provide a means to evaluate the effect of landsurface characteristics on regional and global climate. In traditional force-response sensitivity experiments, the value of one variable of the model environment is altered and results are compared to a control scenario, providing an indication of the forcing potential of a single land-surface characteristic on climate. As reviewed by Pielke et al. [1998] and Garratt [1993] , these sensitivity studies indicate that land-surface characteristics can affect regional and global climate. The single factor analysis, however, cannot resolve the more realistic case of multiple factors changing simultaneously, which often occurs with land cover modification.\nClimate and land-cover modifications result in simultaneous changes in many system state variables, and thus evaluating the net positive or negative feedback requires an integrated analysis. Over the past ten years, coupled atmosphere and land surface models have been developed, allowing a quantitative exploration of these interactions.\nThe effect of land cover change on the climate of the United States has been studied by comparing current, historical, and in some cases, future land cover scenarios [Bonan, 1997; Bonan, 1999; Bounoua et al., 2002; Copeland et al., 1996; DeFries et al., 2002; Pan et al., 1999] . These studies reported regional and seasonal differences in response to land cover change. Bounoua et al. [2002] demonstrated that conversion from forest to cropland produced a cooling in temperate latitudes and a warming in the tropics. DeFries et al. [2002] projected that future land cover conversion will be concentrated in the tropics and subtropics, and conversion will warm these regions. Studies centered on the United States have found that historical land cover change, particularly the conversion of forest to cropland, has produced a cooling in the central and eastern United States and a warming in the western United States [Bonan, 1997; Bonan, 1999; Pan et al., 1999] . Bonan [1997; 1999] showed that modeled response was greatest during the summer months and diminished in fall when crops have been harvested and trees have lost their leaves. Pan et al. [1999] further demonstrated that the land surface-climate system response was not sensitive to climate regime (i.e., normal, flood, or drought conditions)\nfor any climate parameters considered (i.e., latent and sensible heat fluxes and surface air temperature) except precipitation.\nWithin a particular land cover type, land management may also affect land surface-climate interactions. Regional modeling studies are required to address land management because the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural practices cannot be captured at the scale of GCM grid cells. In a regional modeling study, Segal et al. [1998] found that irrigation resulted in an increase in precipitation in non-irrigated areas, but did not produce any new rainfall areas. Similarly, Chase et al. [1999] 3. Methods"}, {"section_title": "Coupling LSM1 to MM5 and Model Testing", "text": "We have integrated the land-surface model LSM1 [Bonan, 1996] into the meteorological model MM5 [Grell et al., 1995] to simulate the coupled interactions of water, energy, and CO 2 exchanges between plants and the atmosphere. LSM1 has several advantages over the most sophisticated land-surface model (OSULSM [Chen and Dudhia, 2001a; Chen and Dudhia, 2001b] ) currently implemented in the publicly available version of MM5. The OSULSM uses a Penman potential evaporation approach, a relatively simple canopy resistance model, and has no ability to simulate changing plant leaf area.\nIn contrast, LSM1 is a \"big-leaf\" [Dickinson et al., 1986; Sellers et al., 1996] [Bonan et al., 1995; Bonan et al., 1997; Riley et al., 2003] ) and accurately predicts carbon, latent heat, and sensible heat fluxes under a variety of conditions. LSM1 requires as input above-canopy air temperature, wind speed, CO 2 concentration, vapor pressure, downward diffuse and direct shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, and precipitation or irrigation amount. These variables are available in the interface between the atmosphere and current land-surface submodels in MM5, with the exception of the partitioning of incoming solar radiation between direct and diffuse and visible and near-infrared components. We applied the CCM2 version of the atmospheric radiation code currently in MM5 to produce these radiation inputs. In the interface between the land surface and atmospheric models we converted vegetation and soil types from the USGS vegetation classes as used in MM5 to those used in LSM1.\nWe tested the coupled MM5-LSM1 model by comparing simulation results to data collected during the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project\nField Experiment (FIFE) campaign [Betts and Ball, 1998 ] and to simulations using the OSULSM. These comparisons are similar to those made by Chen and Dudhia [2001b] for the OSULSM. The FIFE experiments were conducted over a 15\u00d715 km area of the Konza prairie in Kansas during 1987 Kansas during -1989 . In the comparisons we applied the 30-minute spatial averages over the study area for three months each in 1987, 1988, and 1989 . We present results for sensible, latent, and ground heat fluxes and 2 m air and surface skin temperature predictions."}, {"section_title": "MM5/LSM1 Simulations", "text": "We used the standard initialization procedure for MM5, which applies first-guess and boundary condition fields interpolated from NCEP reanalysis data to the outer computational grid. Simulations were performed with a coarse grid of 100\u00d7100 km horizontal resolution (54\u00d768 grid points) spanning the 48 contiguous states and one-way nesting to 10\u00d710 km horizontal resolution (41\u00d741 grid points) for the approximate 3\u00b0\u00d73\u00b0\narea of the ARM-SGP region. The fine grid was centered over the FIFE area for testing and centered over the ARM-SGP region for the June and July harvest simulations. In the vertical direction we used 18 \u03c3-layers between the 100 mb level and earth's surface. The following physics packages were used in the simulations: Grell convective scheme, simple ice microphysics, MRF PBL scheme, and the CCM2 radiation package.\nBecause this study used one-way nesting between the 100 and 10 km horizontal resolutions, changes resulting from harvest in the ARM-SGP 10 km grid area were not communicated back to the surrounding continental area. Although Lu et al. [2001] discussed the importance of two-way nesting in climate models, we feel that one-way nesting was appropriate in our study. Because changes associated with harvest are concentrated within the harvested region with little effect on the surrounding area, it is unlikely that harvest would have significantly altered climate outside of the ARM-SGP.\nThus, one-way nesting would have little effect on all climate variables considered in this study, with the exception of precipitation, which we discuss in more detail in section 4.2."}, {"section_title": "Harvest Simulation", "text": "For the harvest simulations, the 10\u00d710 km resolution model grid was centered over the ARM-SGP. Two scenarios were run over the study period, which extended from June 1 to July 31, 1987. In the first scenario, referred to as Early Harvest, all winter wheat in the domain was harvested on June 4, 1987 (Julian Day 155). In the second scenario, referred to as Late Harvest, all winter wheat in the domain was harvested on\nJuly 5, 1987 (Julian Day 185). These dates represent the extremes of winter wheat harvest in Oklahoma [USDA, 1997b] . Winter wheat is widespread in the region, accounting for 20% of the land area in the ARM-SGP region. Post-harvest residue is burned, left on the soil, or plowed into the soil. For annual crops, such as wheat, residue is typically plowed into the soil (Caddel, personal communication). Thus we simulated harvest by setting the land cover type to bare soil in winter wheat grid cells. We did not consider the impact of remnant stems on albedo or water retention capacity of the soil.\nLand cover at the 10\u00d710 km resolution model grid was assigned based on the USGS 1-km AVHRR data obtained from satellite images taken between April 1992 and March 1993. We divided the area that the USGS designated as agricultural land into two categories: winter wheat and other crops, based on data from the 1997 Census of Agriculture [USDA, 1997a] . In some counties, the USGS data did not record the presence of crops even though the census data indicated that these counties had substantial crop coverage. The scaling of surface characterization data from the 1 to 10 km scale caused this discrepancy by assigning the most prevalent land surface type among the one hundred 1\u00d71 km grid cells to the 10\u00d710 km grid cell. Thus, specificity of land cover characterization was lost when scaling up to the 10 km scale. To address this problem, we "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Coupled Model Testing", "text": "To evaluate the coupling between MM5 and LSM1 we performed comparisons with data from FIFE and to simulations using the OSULSM for three months each in Generally, the LSM1 predictions of surface energy fluxes are as or more accurate than those of the OSULSM land-surface model.\nFor both models surface skin temperature and 2 m air temperatures were under predicted, by up to 4\u00b0C, in the first two weeks after model spin-up (Figure 4 ). In the final two weeks of June both land-surface models relatively accurately predicted peak surface skin and 2 m air temperatures. Comparisons of this kind between land-surface models coupled to regional-scale meteorological models can be problematic. For example, errors in simulation of atmospheric processes (e.g., vapor transport, cloud parameterization, radiation dynamics, or PBL dynamics) will propagate to the land-surface model and may distinctly impact the energy exchange predictions of each land-surface model. A second limitation to this test is that the FIFE dataset is calculated as a spatial average over 225 km 2 assembled from data from a limited number of stations (22 in 1987, 10 in 1988, and 14 in 1989) . Thus the dataset may not accurately capture the spatial heterogeneity in fluxes present in the area at all times. Still, the FIFE study provides a high-quality dataset to evaluate distributed land-surface models. Comparisons such as those performed here over several seasons and years with varying climate give some confidence that the coupled model can accurately simulate the energy partitioning mechanisms important for land-use change analyses."}, {"section_title": "Harvest Simulations", "text": "We report results as the difference between the Early and Late Harvest scenarios. There was no significant change in soil moisture in the \u03b8 10-20 in the winter wheat region or at any depth in the non-winter wheat region.\nIn the Early Harvest scenario, vegetation removal eliminated soil surface shading, removed roots that access deeper water, and eliminated transpiration. As a result, all latent heat flux in the harvested region was due to soil evaporation. Because latent heat flux increased during Phase 1, soil evaporation increases were greater than decreases in transpiration. Thus, by shading the soil, vegetation hindered total evapotranspiration during the first few days after harvest. We calculated the reduction in soil water in each soil layer as a percentage of the integrated latent heat flux over the first three days in the winter wheat region. Soil water losses in the 0-10 cm layer as a percentage of integrated latent heat flux were substantially larger in the Early Harvest scenario than in the Late\nHarvest scenario (55% versus 33%). Thus, harvest shifted the source of evaporated water to the surface soil, resulting in a relatively drier surface layer and a wetter deep layer.\nThe diurnal 2 m air temperature range declined in the winter wheat region, as the midday temperature decreased by 0.9\u00b0C and nighttime temperature increased by 0.3\u00b0C.\nBy contrast, the diurnal temperature range of the soil in the winter wheat region increased slightly, with greater cooling at night (1.1\u00b0C) than during midday (0.3\u00b0C) (Figure 8 ).\nThere was no significant change in the non-winter wheat region. Although albedo declined as a result of harvest, the change in latent heat flux was substantial enough to cause a net cooling in midday soil and 2 m air temperatures. The nighttime response of the soil and air temperatures was likely a result of vegetation removal, which allowed heat to escape from the soil at night, effectively warming the air and cooling the soil.\nIn Phase 2, large differences in all ecosystem stocks and fluxes were evident between the two scenarios. In the winter wheat region, midday latent heat flux declined by 173 W m -2 (-45%), and sensible heat flux increased by 124 W m -2 (121%) relative to the Late Harvest scenario. The decline in latent heat flux was due to a lack of soil moisture. In the non-winter wheat region, midday latent heat flux increased by 9 W m "}, {"section_title": "Edge Effect and Spatial Variation", "text": "There was considerable spatial heterogeneity in net ecosystem latent and sensible heat fluxes, soil moisture and temperature, and 2 m air temperature in the response to harvest. As an example, consider differences in midday sensible heat flux on Julian Day 163, eight days after the June harvest. As shown in Figure 11 , little or no change occurred in half of the domain, but the winter wheat region experienced a very large average increase of 250 W m -2 in midday sensible heat flux. Changes in the center of the winter wheat region, with sensible heat flux reaching a peak difference of 475 W m -2 , were greater than on the edges.\nAlthough changes were largest within the winter wheat region, there was an edge effect, in which the impact of the harvest was felt in areas adjacent to the harvested, winter wheat region. In the example shown in Figure 11 , increases in sensible heat flux in the winter wheat area resulted in the advection of warmer, drier air to the surrounding non-winter wheat area. The warm, dry air resulted in increases in latent heat fluxes in the surrounding non-winter wheat area. In the adjacent area, midday sensible heat flux declined by up to 50 W m -2 and latent heat flux increased. This effect was more pronounced to the East of the harvested region, which was downwind on this particular day. The surrounding non-harvested region, extending up to 60 km from the harvested region, absorbed the majority of the changes resulting from harvest that were communicated to the atmosphere. Within the harvested area itself, there was also a gradient in impacts, between the center and edge of the harvested region, such that the largest differences are found in the center of the harvested area. This gradient is established because of the ameliorating impacts of the surrounding non-harvest area on the edges inside the harvested area."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Harvest dramatically alters energy, momentum, and water fluxes between the surface and atmosphere. These effects are comparable in magnitude to those predicted for land cover conversion by previous studies. We found a 1.3\u00b0C warming in midday air temperature during the first two weeks following harvest. In a ten-year climate simulation, Bonan [1999] found that conversion from forest to crop resulted in a decline in midday temperature of 0.6-1\u00b0C and 1-3\u00b0C in the East and Midwest, respectively. In a similar study, Bounoua et al. [2002] reported a 0.7-1.1\u00b0C decline in temperate regions due to land cover conversion. Our findings suggest that realistic harvest scenarios should be an integral part of climate model studies.\nThere were qualitative changes in the sign of the response to harvest over time.\nTransitions between the four temporal phases following harvest resulted from changes in water availability and subsequent effects on energy partitioning. Harvest initially caused an increase in latent heat flux and subsequent cooling of soil temperature. As soil temperature declined, sensible heat flux and air temperature also declined. These effects were reversed after three days, as soil moisture declined (Phase 2). Because the Early\nHarvest soil was drier during this period, latent heat flux was suppressed leading to warmer soil and a subsequent increase in sensible heat flux and air temperature. As precipitation increased, the difference in soil moisture declined (Phase 3). During Phase 3, sufficient soil moisture was available to drive increases in latent heat flux and reduce the difference in soil temperature between scenarios. Harvest thus caused large shifts in energy partitioning, which led to changes in soil moisture and air and soil temperatures.\nChanges in soil moisture in turn caused further changes in energy partitioning. After precipitation occurred in both scenarios, albeit in different amounts, the differences between scenarios declined.\nIf the early harvest had occurred during a wet period, a much simpler response pattern would have emerged. Phase 2 was a result of a lack of soil moisture and subsequent suppression of latent heat flux. If water was available in abundance, we would likely have seen elevated latent heat fluxes in the Early Harvest scenario throughout the simulation, as seen in Phases 1 and 3 but not Phase 2.\nThese results suggest that harvest should be examined under different climatic regimes, particularly during prolonged dry periods. The variability in system response through time also highlights the importance of running longer simulations. If we had only examined a two-week simulation, we would not have observed the qualitative shifts in energy partitioning or the re-equilibration of the system after the second harvest.\nAlthough the model predicted that harvest has little long-term impact on the system, harvest likely causes secondary effects not explored here. The substantial drying of the 0-10 cm soil layer during Phase 1 and changes in soil moisture and air and soil temperatures throughout the simulations influence microbial processes, decomposition, and trace-gas fluxes. These processes also influence the isotopic composition of evaporated water and CO 2 [Riley et al., 2002] . In addition, a dry soil surface may promote aeolian erosion and thereby impact air quality."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings improve the understanding of the impacts of temporally coherent harvesting and subsequent soil and atmospheric conditions within and outside of the harvested area. We note that changes identified in this study are analogous to changes that may occur as crops shift to an earlier growing season in response to global warming.\nWe observed that an early harvest, which is prompted by hot, dry conditions, could substantially exacerbate these conditions within the harvested area. Farmers adjacent to the harvested area can also be adversely impacted. Collective decisionmaking and land management techniques, such as mulching or leaving stubble on the soil, may mitigate the adverse impacts observed here. Agricultural decision-making is dependent upon a number of factors, including expected returns on investments, labor and machinery availability, current market conditions, and uncertainty estimates. Thus, while we have shown that an early harvest exacerbates hot, dry conditions, it is important to realize that the decision of harvest timing is constrained.\nWe have shown that land management has an impact on climate comparable to that reported for land use and land cover change. To the extent that management is influenced by short-term climatic or weather conditions, these practices form important feedbacks with regional climate. Each vertical jump in cumulative precipitation represents a rain event. Note that there was an initial dry period, followed by a wet period. "}]
