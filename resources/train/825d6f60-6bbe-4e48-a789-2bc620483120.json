Based on prostate volume measurements conducted with at least two serial MRI scans in 278 men from a community in the USA, Loeb et al. [3] found that 172 (61.9%) of the men had prostate growth, four men (1.4%) had a stable prostate size, and 102 men (36.7%) had a decrease in prostate size during a median follow-up of 4.3 years. In a longitudinal study assessing changes in prostate volume in 67 Japanese men with at least two serial TRUS measurements, prostate volume was found to have increased in 46 men (70%), to have remained stable in 10 men (15%) and to have decreased in 11 men (15%).\nAge-related increases in prostate volume are considered to be attributable to age-related development of BPH, which causes obstructive urinary symptoms. Based on autopsy studies, the incidence of histological evidence of BPH increases from 8% of men aged 30-39 years to >70% of men aged >70 years [4] . As described by McNeal [5] and Freiha et al. [6] , BPH is pathologically characterized by hyperplasia of the transition zone (TZ).\nAs a morphometric predictor of the severity of BPH, the presumed circle area ratio (PCAR; the ratio of the area of the maximum horizontal section of the prostate to the area of a presumed circle whose circumference is equal to the circumference of the maximum horizontal section) has been shown to be correlated with LUTS (especially obstructive symptoms) and with markers of urodynamic obstruction, representing intraprostatic pressure [7] [8] [9] . PCAR can be used to evaluate how closely the shape of the horizontal prostate section approaches a circle. The greater the intraprostatic pressure resulting from an enlarged TZ, the rounder the shape of the prostate becomes. Similarly, the TZ index (the ratio between the TZ volume and prostate volume) is another morphometric variable that is significantly correlated with the severity of BPH, predicting LUTS and urodynamic parameters [10] .\nBy contrast, the natural history of the peripheral zone (PZ) has been more frequently discussed in terms of the development of cancer, as more aggressive prostate cancers are likely to originate from the PZ [11] ; however, possible age-related changes in PZ morphology and volume with special reference to age-related enlargement of the TZ have not been elucidated thus far. In the present study, we sought to evaluate whether MRI can facilitate the morphometric analysis of prostate zonal anatomy, with special reference to the morphology of the PZ in relation to age-related prostatic enlargement in patients from the USA and Japan."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Between January 2011 and December 2012, after obtaining institutional review board approval, we retrospectively analysed a total of 307 consecutive men who underwent MRI and IPSS assessment prior to prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA levels.

The present study showed that there was no agerelated increase in PZ volume in the men from either Japan or the USA. This suggests that PZ volume is stable during aging and no differences were found between the US and the Japanese subgroups in this regard; however, PZ thickness, a novel concept introduced in the present study, was found to have a significant negative correlation with PCAR as well as with IPSS and obstructive symptoms. Because PCAR, which might represent obstructive pressure or intraprostatic pressure, significantly increased with TZ volume, we interpreted these results as indicating that the greater the increase in TZ volume, the higher the intraprostatic pressure might be and the thinner the PZ becomes, with a stable PZ volume of~20 mL. IPSS and obstructive symptoms were found to have the closest relationship with PCAR attributable to an enlarged TZ, which was associated with a thinner PZ. MRI analysis of the prostate zonal anatomy enhanced our understanding of age-related changes in morphology, not only for the TZ but also for the PZ in association with LUTS.\nThe PCAR has been recognized as one of the most important predictors of the severity of prostatic obstruction and LUTS, while the correlation between overall prostatic volume and the development of LUTS is modest [7] [8] [9] . The rationale of the PCAR theory suggests that, as the TZ grows, it exerts pressure on the surrounding surgical capsule, including the PZ, as well as the prostate capsule. When the surgical capsule reaches a point at which it cannot be stretched further, the prostatic shape approximates a circle. The present findings suggest that as the TZ grows, the PZ becomes thinner as a part of the stretched surgical capsule.\nMorphometric analyses of prostate volume have been performed with volume measurements conducted using TRUS or MRI; however, the available longitudinal serial monitoring data on the natural history of the morphological zonal anatomy are very limited, and such data are also limited to short follow-up periods, such as median periods of 2.7 years [13] , 2.3 years [2] or 4.3 years [3] . Two later studies conducted as part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging [2, 3] used two or more T2-weighted serial MRI scans to evaluate prostate volume in 278 men. These serial longitudinal monitoring studies of the entire prostate volume showed that, although BPH commonly results in an increased prostate volume as a result of aging, a considerable proportion of aging men have a stable or decreased prostate volume [2, 3, 13] . Although Loeb et al. [3] did not evaluate the longitudinal changes according to the zonal volume of the prostate, Williams et al. [2] reported the longitudinal changes in PZ volume, TZ volume and prostate volume in a limited cohort of 64 men in the Baltimore longitudinal study. Interestingly, in that study with its small sample size and median follow-up period of 2.3 years, regression analysis showed a weak relationship between age and each individual's zonal volume, where the square of the correlation coefficient was 0.05 (P < 0.01) for the whole gland, 0.05 (P < 0.01) for the TZ and 0.03 (P < 0.04) for the PZ. Even though a significant increase in the PZ was found in this small cohort, the change in PZ volume was only 5.5 mL when considering the difference in the maximum PZ volume between men aged <45 years (PZ volume, 20.9 AE 2.0 mL, n = 9) and men aged 56-65 years (PZ volume, 26.4 AE 1.8 mL, n = 15). Further studies will be necessary to monitor the longitudinal changes in the zonal volume over a longer study period to reach a conclusion regarding the natural history of an individual's zonal prostatic volume.\nAge-related changes in prostate and TZ volumes were evaluated based on TRUS measurements in 535 Japanese men with LUTS in a study by Gupta et al. [14] . Calculations based on the obtained data on the prostate volume and TZ volume showed little age-related change in PZ volume, with values of Table 2 Relationship between urinary symptoms and morphometric parameters. 16.1 mL being found for men aged 50-59 years (n = 89), 18.3 mL for men aged 60-69 years (n = 89), 18.9 mL for men aged 70-79 years (n = 185), and 16.2 mL for men aged 80-89 years (n = 27). In contrast, there were obvious agerelated changes in the whole prostate volume (range 17-33 mL) and TZ volume (range 5.6-14.6 mL) in the same population aged 50-89 years [14] .\nIn a recent study, Turkbey et al. [15] reported the age-related changes in prostate zonal volumes measured in 503 patients in one-time assessments using MRI, before any treatment for prostate cancer [15] . They also found no correlation between age and PZ volume (P = 0.173), and changes in the whole prostate volume and TZ volume were inversely correlated with IPSS. These findings were duplicated in the present study, not only in the US subgroup, but also in the Japanese cohort, as PZ was found to be similar in volume to that originally observed at a younger age, with a volume of 20 mL.\nThe thickness of the PZ is introduced in the present study as a new metric intended to represent additional morphological characteristics or changes in the PZ attributable to aging or prostate hypertrophy. PZ thickness was found to have a significant negative correlation with PCAR (r = \u00c00.357, P< 0.001) as well as TZ volume (r = \u00c00.451, P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the greater the increase in intraprostatic pressure (represented by the higher PCAR) attributable to greater growth of TZ volume, the thinner the PZ becomes. When evaluating axial MRI scans, we often recognize a very thin PZ accompanied by an enlarged TZ. We therefore wondered whether a decrease in PZ volume could accompany increased prostate hypertrophy, and we hypothesized that PZ thickness may only be compressed, resulting in its becoming thinner without a change in PZ volume. The present findings support this hypothesis. The PZ was compressed, showing a significant decrease in thickness as a result of the age-related increase in TZ volume, causing possible increased intraprostatic pressure, which was probably indicated by an increased PCAR. No age-related change, however, was found in PZ volume and there was no difference between the US and Japanese cohorts, with both having a PZ volume of~20 mL. This is a key finding and implies that there is no age-related change in the PZ volume in contrast to the age-related increase in TZ volume. The present study suggests that the important age-related change in prostate volume is attributable only to enlargement of TZ volume (not PZ volume). Interestingly, with such age-related enlargement of the TZ, the morphological change in the prostate can be characterized by the compressed PZ, which becomes thinner but extends wider, maintaining a stable PZ volume of~20 mL.\nMorphometric analyses of prostate volume have been discussed in relation to LUTS, as shown in the present study; however, it is important to recognize that the lack of age-related increase in PZ volume (with a stable PZ volume of~20 mL) may have an impact on prostate biopsy strategy. Because PZ volume is stable, the total core numbers for the sum of the series of repeat biopsies from the PZ could be saturated by limited numbers, such as a total of two or three sets of 12 cores of PZ biopsies, which would correspond to 24 or 36 cores in total. Recent advances in the technology of TRUS-guided biopsy to document the location for future reference has an impact on this [16, 17] . If we document the biopsy trajectories of the initial set of 12-core biopsies for future reference at the time of repeat biopsy [18] , it will allow intentional saturated sampling from the initially non-sampled parts of the PZ to cover the entire PZ (theoretically, 20 cores sampled from a PZ with a volume of 20 mL corresponds to 1 core per <1 mL of the PZ).\nThe present study has some limitations. First, we did not monitor the longitudinal changes in the zonal volume in our study cohort, although our findings implied that the PZ showed no age-related increase in the distribution analysis between PZ volume vs age. As such, the individual natural history of the PZ remains unknown. Second, the patients in our cohort represented a highly selected population, consisting of men with clinical indications for prostate biopsy; therefore, the study cohort may not represent the general population. Third, there were differences in age, prostate volumes and TZ volumes in the two subgroups of the study cohort (US and Japanese); however, interestingly, there were no differences in PZ volume found in the comparison between the US and Japanese subgroups, even with the significant differences in age, prostate volume and TZ volume. Although direct physical measurements of zonal anatomy from prostatectomy specimens would represent one of the most accurate techniques, the examination of agerelated, longitudinally monitored changes in the morphometric zonal prostate anatomy using high-resolution MRI would also be promising.\nIn conclusion, MRI can be used in the morphometric analysis of prostate zonal anatomy. The PZ was found to have no agerelated increase in volume in either US or Japanese men aged 40-80 years, but is substantially compressed as a result of an enlarged TZ. The greater the increase in TZ volume, the higher the obstructive pressure or possible intraprostatic pressure and the thinner the PZ becomes. LUTS, including obstructive and irritative symptoms, were significantly associated with an increased PCAR as well as with a thinner PZ in the analysis of the morphometric variables of prostate zonal anatomy. A stable PZ volume of~20 mL independently of age and race may have an impact on the longitudinal sampling strategy for prostate biopsy."}, {"section_title": "Conflict of Interest", "text": "None declared.\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors BJU International \u00a9 2017 BJU International 503"}]
