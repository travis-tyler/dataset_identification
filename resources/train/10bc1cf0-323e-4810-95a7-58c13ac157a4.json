It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs memory, cognitive function, thinking, behavior and language [4, 5] . It has been reported that 35.6 million people worldwide are suffering from dementia and this number will increase to 65.7 million by 2030 [6, 7] . There is still no cure for the disease but early detection of AD is a prerequisite for early treatment [8] .\nThe neuroimaging is an approach increasingly used for accurate clinical diagnosis of AD [9, 10] . There are two main categories of neuroimaging: structural neuroimaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and functional neuroimaging (e.g. positron emission tomography (PET)) [10] . Although the brain atrophy measured using MRI in patient at prodromal stage of the AD (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) is similar to those in normal elderly people, PET has the ability to display very mild symptoms such as amyloid plaques and impaired glucose metabolism, which are signed with AD [11, 12] . Therefore, extracting the features from brain regions using PET neuroimaging can provide useful hallmarks for discriminant normal control (NC) from AD (or MCI). Brain glucose metabolism and amyloid plaques are measured by 18F-fluorodeoxy (FDG) and 11C Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) tracers with PET scans, respectively [10, 13] . Nevertheless, PET neuroimaging provides specific information about subjects with and without AD. In this paper, multitracer PiB and FDG-PET neuroimaging that has been acquired at the same time are combined. These can provide valuable information, including amyloid plaque and glucose metabolism. The problem of classification in case of multiple feature space obtained from different sources is combinations of individual classifiers or combination of feature spaces [14] . The aim of combination of feature spaces is to obtain highly accurate classifiers by combining individual feature space. As the most common way, all features derived from different data sources, i.e. modalities, are concatenated into a larger feature space. Other ways for combination feature spaces can be grouped into two basic categories: 1) ad hoc methods [15] , and kernel combination methods [16, 17] . MRI, FDG-PET and also CSF modalities were combined based on multi-kernel combination for both AD and MCI classifications [18] . The proposed method was operated within support vector machine (SVM) learning classifier. However, in this paper an approach for combing feature spaces derived from FDG and PIB-PET modalities has been proposed and compared with multi-kernel SVM method used in [18] ."}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS", "text": "Data used in this research were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database ( http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). In this study, 57 subjects, including 18 AD patients, 20 MCI patients, and 19 normal controls (NC) were collected from the ADNI public database (LONI, University of California, http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data). All patients and healthy subjects (subjects were manually found between all ADNI databases) had [11C] PIB-PET and [18F] FDG-PET imaging.

The demographic characteristics of the subjects used in this study have been summarized in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1. Preprocessing", "text": "All PET images have been preprocessed with SPM8 [19] (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and was performed in MATLAB 7.10.0 (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA). Preprocessing was performed in the following steps: \u00b7 Normalization This step includes registration and normalization into a standardized coordinate system. The goal of normalization is to register images from different participants into a rough template image.\nNormalization was performed to ensure that the voxels in different images refer to the same anatomical positions in the brain [20] .\nEach individual subject's FDG-PET was automatically spatially normalized to the PET Montreal Neurological Imaging (MNI) template (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca) through 12-parameters affine model [21] using the SPM8 software with the default settings. PiB-PET images were also normalized to the template generated by averaging all normal control images. After the normalization step, the dimensions of the obtained images were re-sampled to a voxel spacing of 2 mm3 and size 91\u00d7109\u00d791 voxels. \u00b7 Smoothing Smoothing is used to reduce the high frequency noise and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the hemodynamic effect. Smoothing was performed using a Gaussian kernel with full-width of half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm."}, {"section_title": "2. Features", "text": "In this study, features were obtained by voxel grouping using a labeled atlas. Atlas-based approach used for PET images is similar to method used in [18] . After pre-processing, the subject's brain image was automatically parcellated into 48 pre-defined regions of interest (ROI The aim of PCA is to reduce the dimension of the data. PCA is used to omit redundant data for feature selection and feature extraction. Since PCA works in linear domain, it is used in linear applications, such as, signal processing, image processing, system and control theory and communication. PCA depends on eigenvector method designed to model linear variations in large dimensional data. PCA performs dimension reduction by projecting the original n-dimensional data to k-dimensional (k<<n) linear subspace [23] ."}, {"section_title": "4. Support Vector Machine", "text": "Support Vector Machine (SVM) creates an optimal hyper plane using binary labeled training data by maximizing the margin between two classes [24] . Once the model has been trained, the measures of the diagnostic accuracy can be carried out with the test set. A detailed description of SVM algorithms can be found in [25] [26] [27] . The idea behind SVMs is to map the input patterns into a highdimensional feature space through a suitable kernel function. The mapping is done in order to make the classification problem simpler in the high-dimensional feature space [28] . In this paper, the SVM classifier was implemented using libsvm toolbox available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm in MATLAB 7.10.0 (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA). The reason of wide application of SVM in AD domain is that SVM often performs more efficiently than other classifiers [2, 29, 30] ."}, {"section_title": "4. Proposed Method", "text": "The proposed approach in this research involves two major steps: training step; learning the useful information, and testing step. Firstly, some subjects were used for training step. Training was achieved by means of the leave-one-out method, a technique that iteratively holds out one subject for test [31] . After the optimum parameters were obtained with the remaining subjects, in the test step, each new subject that was left out was assigned to its appropriate class.\nIn order to combine information derived from different images there are several ways in machine learning research. The most common way is to combine all features derived from different modalities into a longer feature vector [32] . Additionally, several researchers [18, 33, 34] provide an alternative way by using a kernel combination to integrate different modalities for AD study. More detailed description for multi-kernel approach used in SVM can be found in [18] . In order to evaluate the proposed method, two methods proposed in [32] and [18] were implemented and compared with proposed method.\nIn this paper, a new approach for combination of the feature spaces derived from different neuroimaging scans, is proposed. First, the principal features are selected from two tracer image scans using PCA. Combining features that have been chosen in first step can achieve premier features, e.g. ROIs, of two tracers. In order to combine the features chosen from individual PET tracer image, there are two different methods, union and intersection.\nIntersection method selects the repeated features selected in two of the PET tracer image by PCA. On the other hand, the results of union combination method are based on all features that have been selected by each of the two PET tracer images. Therefore, features extracted from each individual tracer image are combined and evaluated agaist the classification accuracy in discriminate NC and AD (or MCI). It is based on premier features selected by intersection combination method."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "In order to compare the performance of FDG-PET and PiB-PET images in AD, we perform experiments (1) using only each individual modality, FDG-PET and PiB-PET modalities, (2) combining features using multi-kernel and concatenation methods, and finally (3), using the proposed method. For posterior analysis, all subjects were arranged into two different groups, and the performance of our classification methods is tested in identification:\n\u00b7 NC vs. AD: NC subjects from AD patients, \u00b7 NC vs. MCI: NC subjects from MCI patients. The classification results are summarized in Tables 2  and 3 . As discussed in Section 3, all experiments were carried out by the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The classification results are described in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values, the most widely statistics used in diagnostic test. For analysis of PET tracers each image modality of each subject was first parcellated into 48 ROIs using the Harvard-Oxford atlas. Afterward, all 48 ROIs were used in order to create the feature set by averaging the intensity value of voxels in each ROI. Using single-modality, FDG-PET reached highest accuracy rates. FDG-PET distinguished NC from AD (MCI) patients with 88.89% (75%), 89.74% (78.95) and 89.19% (76.92) for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. In order to compare multi-kernel SVM method and concatenation method for combining features obtained from different PET tracers, we implemented these two methods. Table  2 shows the performance of these two combination methods. In all groups, combining features using multikernel method reached highest accuracy rates. For NC vs. AD, the multi-kernel SVM and concatenation SVM methods reached the accuracy of 83.78% and 88.24%, respectively. For NC vs. MCI, multi-kernel method also reached higher accuracy (87.5%) than those based on the concatenation (76.92%). The results of this study show that the multi-kernel method achieved higher performance than concatenation methods in discriminanting between NC and AD (or MCI). The experimental results obtained in this research shows that considering the multi-kernel method is more accurate than concatenation method in combining different modalities. Moreover, multi-kernel method has advantages over combining different modalities [18] : 1) it provides a unified way to combine heterogeneous data when a different type of data cannot be directly concatenated, and 2) it offers more flexibility by using different weights on biomarkers of different modalities.\nMultimodal imaging in AD has been previously studied by several researches [18, 24, 25] . As the most recent work, ( [18] ) evaluated MRI, FDG-PET and also CSF, and combination of these modalities based on multi-kernel combination for both AD classification and MCI classification. In this paper, we used a more significant feature selection/extraction method using PCA and combined features extracted from FDG-PET and PiB-PET image scans. Preliminary experimental results of individual modality as shown in proposed method for combination of FDG-PET and PIB-PET achieved higher accuracies compared to the approach reported in [18] (see Table 3 ). Performance rate reported in [18] for discriminanating between NC and MCI was 76.4% and our accuracy value is 82.05%."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this research, we combined different neuroimaging modalities, FDG-PET and PiB-PET, in the same group of AD (and MCI) patients and normal controls. As individual neuroimaging technologies do not provide optimal information for the analysis pathology in AD, combining neuroimaging modalities could provide higher recognition rate in AD. Therefore, we evaluated individual PET images, and also combination of multitracer PET neuroimaging in AD. In order to evaluate the combinations of tracers with PET, we compared proposed method with concatenation and multi-kernel methods. This paper compares FDG-PET and PIB-PET modalities in order to discriminate NC from AD (or MCI). We proposed a novel method for combining these tracers with PET neuroimaging scan and we compared concatenation and multi-kernel methods."}]
