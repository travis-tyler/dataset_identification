[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective To examine parents' perceptions of stigma regarding mental health services for their child, consider stigma in the context of novel service delivery settings (e.g., telehealth, primary care, and schools), and evaluate stigma with other factors known to influence service access. Methods 347 caregivers of children with psychosocial concerns completed surveys regarding their perceptions of stigma, service delivery settings, and barriers to care. Results Parents endorsed low levels of stigma around services. Greater perceived stigma was related to less willingness to seek services in a mental/behavioral health center or schools but not in other settings, even when other barriers were considered. Having a younger child and a history of prior services was associated with greater willingness to seek services. Conclusions Stigma does appear to present as a barrier, but only for some parents. Providing mental health services to young children and their parents in some nontraditional settings may increase access."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Access to effective mental health treatments is limited in rural areas, where barriers include provider shortages (Wagenfeld, 2003) , financial concerns such as inadequate insurance coverage problems with travel and transportation (Fox, Merwin, & Blank, 1995) , and beliefs about the appropriateness of mental health treatment including the stigma surrounding it (Jameson & Blank, 2007; Mukolo, Heflinger, & Wallston, 2010) . Of these, stigma around mental illness and serviceseeking is often cited as a top barrier for those in rural communities owing to their characterization as having strong social support networks, conservative values, and a general lack of privacy (e.g., word travels fast, everybody knows everybody; Bray, Enright, & Easling, 2004) .\nThe only empirical studies examining rural individuals' perceptions of stigma surrounding mental health services have focused on adults. One study showed that residents in rural Appalachia cited stigma as a barrier to treatment more often (28%) than those in a comparison sample outside the region (22%; Appalachian Regional Commission and NORC, August, 2008) . In another study, Hoyt, Conger, Valde, & Weihs (1997) found that adults in rural areas perceived more stigma around mental health services than their urban counterparts (e.g., anticipated embarrassment if the community were to find out). Importantly, greater perceived stigma was associated with less willingness to seek services."}, {"section_title": "Stigma as a Barrier for Rural Children's Services", "text": "Recently, more attention has been focused on perceptions of stigma around children's mental illness and mental health services (see Mukolo et al., 2010 for a review). The National Stigma Study-Children (NSS-C) was the first large-scale survey of adults' beliefs about child mental health concerns. In sum, studies from the NSS-C demonstrated that the public holds stigmatizing views about children with behavioral problems and those who are seeking treatment (Pescosolido, Fettes, Martin, Monahan, & McLeod, 2007) . The NSS-C did not, however, directly assess perceptions of stigma held by parents with ongoing concerns about their own children's behavior. This is important because these parents may be making choices about seeking mental health services. Moreover, the study did not explicitly evaluate a rural sample.\nThus, at least three gaps are evident (Mukolo et al., 2010) . First, prior work has focused on the stigma surrounding mental health concerns in children (e.g., depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), but not on the perceived stigma about seeking services, particularly psychosocial treatments with a psychologist, counselor, or therapist. We argue that perceived stigma about the services themselves may represent beliefs more proximal to the decision to seek services, with implications for developing service delivery mechanisms in rural areas. Second, prior work did not specifically target parents of children with mental health concerns. For these individuals, stigma around service-seeking may be more currently and personally relevant, directly and practically impacting actual decisions about getting help. Finally, prior work has not focused on stigma among rural parents. As described above, widespread claims that rural residents are particularly stymied by stigma are supported by only a few studies using adult samples. This study was the first to address these gaps.\nAs researchers have focused on the dissemination of empirically supported treatments, they have begun to consider factors such as stigma that influence community-level service delivery. One strategy for combating the effects of stigma on access to mental health services is to use service delivery settings that may not be associated with the stigma of mental illness. For example, integrating mental health services into primary care may have the advantage of increasing confidentiality in rural areas; with this change in location, those seeking treatment do not have to worry about members of the community noticing their motor vehicle parked outside the mental health center. Other emerging settings for providing mental health services include telemental health (e.g., mental health services delivered by two-way videoconferencing) and schoolbased mental health (e.g., specialty mental health services available in the school). A review of the literature supporting telepsychiatry showed a growing body of empirical support, with 63 studies published in the 30 years between 1970 and 2000, but another 68 published within the subsequent 3 years (Monnier, Knapp, & Frueh, 2003) . Likewise, a growing body of literature supports the integration of mental health services into the schools (e.g., Rones & Hoagwood, 2000) . It is unknown, however, to what extent these settings might be perceived as stigmatizing in the context of accessing mental health services."}, {"section_title": "Individual and Family Factors Influencing Access", "text": "Although stigma may be a leading barrier to care among rural individuals, many factors influence an individual's decision to access mental health services. Thus, the extent to which perceived stigma functions as a barrier is best assessed using a comprehensive conceptual model. This study draws on the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, 1995) , integrating three categories of established factors influencing service utilization and outcomes at the individual and family level (Lunn et al., 2011) . First, predisposing characteristics are those linked to the likelihood of using services, determined by previous research or theory. Second, need characteristics reflect the reasons for the service and have been described as the most powerful predictor of service use. Finally, enabling characteristics are those that either support or pose barriers to service use. Stigma, an enabling characteristic and the focus of this study, has been shown to be a powerful deterrent to service use, as discussed above."}, {"section_title": "Present Study", "text": "The present study addressed three aims. The first was to examine rural parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their children. We assessed stigma using a new, empirically validated measure that taps parents' perceptions of the public stigma around seeking mental health services for their children (Williams & Polaha, 2014) , and is based on prior conceptualizations of public stigma (e.g., Corrigan, 2004) . Second, we aimed to examine the associations between perceived stigma and parents' willingness to seek mental health services for their children in traditional versus nontraditional mental health service settings (e.g., integrated primary care, school health, and videoconferencing). We hypothesized that rural parents who viewed mental health services as stigmatizing would be less willing to seek services in traditional (i.e., mental/behavioral health center, private practice) than nontraditional service settings. Third, we aimed to examine the relative contribution of stigma as a barrier to seeking care from various service delivery settings in the context of predisposing, need, and enabling characteristics known to influence service seeking at the individual/family level."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were 347 parents (biological, step, adoptive, or foster) of children aged 4-16 years whose ratings of their child's behavior were in the borderline to significant range on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC; Jellinek, Murphy, & Burns, 1986) . We included borderline scores in an attempt to capture participants with a broader range of prior mental health service experiences as well as more variable ongoing concerns and attitudes about pursuing treatment. The participants were mostly mothers of the targeted child (79.8% vs. 7.8% fathers, 12.4% \"other\" such as grandparent), White (94.2% vs. 2.9% Hispanic, 0.6% Black, 0.6% Asian, and 1.6% other race), and had at least a high school education (88.7% mothers, 74.1% fathers).

A two-part procedure was employed. First, research assistants approached parents attending a visit with their child at one of eight primary care clinics in rural Appalachia (i.e., southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee) and provided a brief overview of the study along with a letter of consent (waived written consent) and a screening measure. The screening consisted of a demographics questionnaire and the PSC (Jellinek et al., 1986) . This procedure was conducted daily for 4-8 weeks at each site. The number of weeks at each site varied in an effort to recruit an equal number of participants from small-and large-sized practices. In total, 2,672 parents completed screeners. Of these, 727 (27.2%) were identified for the second part of the study because their child scored in the borderline to significant range on the PSC (total score ! 20).\nSecond, we contacted eligible parents by telephone to describe the full study. Those interested were mailed a survey packet to return by mail, which included another letter of consent. Of the 727 parents initially identified through screening, 156 were unreachable by telephone, 113 declined to participate, 105 agreed to participate but did not return the packet, and 6 had more than four items missing on the PSC, yielding an overall response rate of 47.7%. There were some significant differences between the parents who completed the full study (N \u00bc 347) versus those who were unreachable, declined, or did not return the measures. Full study participants had slightly younger children than nonparticipants (M \u00bc 9.13 years vs. M \u00bc 9.73 years, t(723) \u00bc 2.33, p < .05), higher scores on the PSC (M \u00bc 28.87 vs. M \u00bc 27.56, t(708) \u00bc\u00c02.23, p < .05), and previously talked with more professionals about their child's behavior problems (M \u00bc 3.04 vs. M \u00bc 2.72, t(725) \u00bc 3.17, p < .05).

In addition, a child's previous use of mental health services has been shown to increase the likelihood of future service use (e.g., Jones, Heflinger & Saunders, 2007) and, thus, was included as a predisposing characteristic. Need characteristics reflect the reason for service use; we assessed the child's psychosocial functioning via the PSC (Jellinek et al., 1986) and \"caregiver strain,\" which refers to the negative and emotional impact on families caring for a relative with special needs and is a powerful predictor of serviceseeking (Brannan, Heflinger, & Bickman, 1997) .

In the present study, a \"borderline\" score of !20 was used to attempt to capture a more variable sample.

Caregivers are asked to use a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) to report how much of a problem each occurrence was in the past 6 months owing to the child's behavior.

Table II depicts results of the two steps (Models 1 and 2). Because the only difference between the two steps was the addition of public stigma, and the findings for the remaining variables were similar at both steps, we present the results for predisposing, need, and enabling factors from the first step only. As shown in Model 2, after accounting for predisposing, need, and other enabling factors, perceived public stigma was uniquely predictive of less willingness to seek services in school (accounting for 1.4% of the variance) and a mental/behavioral health center (accounting for 2.0% of the variance).\nAlthough not a study aim, Table II also depicts the independent contribution of predisposing, need, and other enabling characteristics on parents' willingness to seek services for their children.

Finally, the need characteristic of PSC score was uniquely associated with greater willingness to seek services from the child's school."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study was the first to examine perceptions of stigma around mental health services among rural parents with ongoing psychosocial concerns about their children. In addressing our first study aim, we were surprised to find that parents reported relatively low levels of public stigma associated with seeking services for their children. This finding is inconsistent with prior research with adults (Hoyt et al., 1997) as well as the working theory that rural individuals view mental health services as stigmatizing (e.g., Bray et al., 2004; Jameson & Blank, 2007) . There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, there are so few well-designed studies documenting the presence of stigmatizing beliefs around services that it may be that the phenomenon has never been true-or, at least, is not true for parents. Research focused on parents' uptake of child mental health services has provided descriptions of help-seeking patterns and experiences (e.g., Reid et al., 2011) , but has not explored the underlying meaning and attributions parents experience in this process; for example, parents may see help-seeking as evidence of \"good parenting,\" outweighing any negative effects of perceived stigma. Second, one of the best-designed studies in this area (Hoyt et al., 1997) was published almost 20 years ago. Since then, there have been numerous campaigns focused on decreasing stigma around mental illness (e.g., \"Stomping out Stigma\"; Heeney & Watters, 2009 ), which may have had an impact on decreasing stigma population-wide.\nAlternatively, it may be that more sophisticated methods are needed to accurately capture nuanced attitudes around mental health services. Consistent with qualitative studies of adults (Scattolon, 2003) , the first author's observations in rural primary care have revealed anecdotal evidence that stigmatizing attitudes are prevalent, especially regarding specific providers or centers. Future studies should incorporate cultural and contextual variables (such as the names of specific services available in that area) and use mixed methods strategies to better capture localized attitudes around services. It is noteworthy that those with lower levels of psychosocial concerns and less prior service history were less likely to participate in this study. This study limitation underscores the need for new strategies to engage those who may shy away from questions about mental health, possibly owing to stigma itself.\nOur second aim was to examine the relationship between perceived stigma and parents' willingness to seek services in traditional versus nontraditional settings. Six potential settings were presented to parents: two were conceptualized as traditional (mental/behavioral health center and private practice) and four as nontraditional (school, primary care, church, and telehealth). Overall, parents endorsed a high level of willingness to be seen by a psychologist, counselor, or therapist in all of these settings except telehealth. We hypothesized that, in the absence of other factors related to service-seeking, parents reporting higher levels of perceived stigma would be less willing to seek services in traditional settings. Consistent with this hypothesis and one prior study (Hoyt et al., 1997) , results showed that the more stigma parents perceived, the less willing they were to seek services for their children across all settings.\nIn contrast, recent research with other populations (e.g., college students and rural Australian adults) concluded that perceived stigma had little to no effect on adults' seeking of mental health services (Golberstein et al., 2009; Komiti, Judd, & Jackson, 2006) . Owens and colleagues (2002) reported that only 2.5% of urban parents in their study identified stigma as a barrier to seeking mental health treatment for their children in need of services. Our study may provide additional evidence that perceived stigma among rural parents is associated with service-seeking in ways that differentiate this population from others. However, inconsistent methods and measures across studies prevent a definitive conclusion on this point, highlighting the need for future research to replicate findings with rigorous designs and methods.\nOur third aim examined the relative contribution of stigma as a barrier in the context of predisposing, need, and enabling characteristics known to influence service seeking at the individual/family level (Lunn et al., 2011) . Results showed that, after accounting for these additional characteristics, parents' perceived stigma remained significantly related to less willingness to seek services at a mental/behavioral health center and at their child's school. At the same time, perceived stigma was not associated with willingness to seek services in a private practice, primary care, church, or by telehealth. These findings were consistent with our hypothesis, except that we conceptualized private practice as a traditional mental health setting, and willingness to seek services from a private practice did not appear to be related to stigma after other factors were considered. It may be that rural parents are unfamiliar with this setting (i.e., there are not many private practices in rural areas) and/or the word \"private\" influences how stigmatizing (i.e., less available to the public) that setting would be.\nWe conceptualized the school as a \"nontraditional\" setting in this study and were interested to find that, as with traditional mental/behavioral health centers, parents who perceived mental health service seeking as stigmatizing were less willing to seek services at their child's school, controlling for other predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics. This finding was not surprising, given the very public nature of school settings where concerns about being \"labeled\" may be greater, perhaps especially in rural areas. These results have particular salience when considered alongside our finding that the older the children were, the less willing parents were to seek services for them at school. These data are consistent with current literature showing that, while parents are satisfied with school-based mental health (Lazicki, Vernberg, Roberts, & Benson, 2008) , adolescents report stigma to be a significant barrier to accessing these services (e.g., Bowers, Manion, Papadopoulos, & Gauvreau, 2013) . Others have reported that parents who pursue mental health treatment for their adolescents describe them as embarrassed about getting help and as seeing it as a sign of weakness (Moskos, Olson, Halbern, & Gray, 2007) . It certainly stands to reason that as children get older, their own perceptions of stigma would impact parents' willingness to seek services. Future research should evaluate the way in which parent and adolescent attitudes interact to impact care seeking, with particular consideration of the school setting.\nOne unanticipated study finding was that prior treatment by a psychologist, counselor, or therapist was related to increased willingness to accept services across all potential service settings, except for church and telehealth. In addition, parents with younger children endorsed greater willingness to seek services. One interpretation of these results is that developing services in novel settings where there is broad \"reach\" to younger children may fuel attendance to more traditional service delivery settings over time. This underscores the idea that a \"portfolio\" of intervention types and settings are necessary for the greatest impact when disseminating treatments (Kazdin & Blase, 2011) . The availability of easy-access, brief, or more palatable \"low dose\" options such as those demonstrated in the primary care behavioral health model (Strosahl, 1998) may increase future commitment to more comprehensive treatment in a wider range of settings. Future research should evaluate how accessing brief treatments in one setting might influence willingness to access services in another setting, especially community mental health."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "One weakness of this study was the use of surveys that included generalized questions about stigma and willingness to seek services. That is, the wording of the questions may have lacked enough specificity to be meaningful. As discussed above, empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests results may have been different if the questions engaged real-world contexts (i.e., names of actual agencies or organizations in a given community), rather than using general terms for service settings. For example, the study's findings regarding parents' low willingness to access services by telehealth are not consistent with studies showing parents are highly satisfied with telehealth (Jacob, Larson, & Craighead, 2012) . Still, if parents respond to these generic descriptions of mental/behavioral health centers, schools, or telehealth unfavorably, it suggests that attention should be paid to how services in these settings can best be presented, marketed, and developed.\nOther limitations to this study include our recruitment strategy that (1) identified only parents attending a primary care clinic (i.e., not all rural parents), (2) underrepresented fathers, and (3) resulted in a moderate return rate as discussed above. In addition, our survey strategy limited our results to reported willingness rather than actual service use and may have lacked some internal validity in that demand characteristics influenced participants' responses. Finally, we lacked family income and health insurance data, a major predisposing characteristic known to influence serviceseeking (Cook et al., 2004) . Future research should consider these limitations.\nA number of potential participants declined to participate or did not return their survey packets. It may be that those participants also perceived more stigma around seeking mental health services for their children and could explain the modest overall level of stigma found in the study. However, as reported above, those who were full participants of the study reported more behavior problems among their children than those who declined. Thus, those who declined to participate may have seen the study as less relevant for them. Further, although the overall level of stigma may be limited by the specific sample, we still found that even modest levels of stigma were linked with less willingness to seek mental health services for children."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study addresses key gaps in the literature by assessing the effects of perceived public stigma on the willingness of rural parents to seek mental health services for their at-risk children from a variety of traditional and nontraditional services settings. Our findings suggest that, in general, stigma may be less of a factor in rural parents' treatment-seeking decisions than previously suggested, especially in the context of other important predisposing, enabling, and need factors. However, parents who perceive stigma around getting mental health services for their child also report decreased willingness to seek services from mental/behavioral health and schools. Additional research is needed to evaluate how stigma may be more nuanced based on contextual factors (e.g., stigma around a specific community service) and how researchers can study this phenomenon among those who shy away from stigmatizing activities such as mental health services and the research about them. Finally, future studies should use methods from emerging dissemination and implementation research to discover how stigma impacts choices in the context of specific interventions and programming.\nAdvancement of Translational Science (8KL2TR000116-03, C.R.S.) through the University of Kentucky CTSA (UL1RR033173).\nConflicts of interest: None declared."}]
