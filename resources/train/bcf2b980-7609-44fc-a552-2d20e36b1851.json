For example, income tax rates and tax provisions affect not only farm households' after-tax income but also their economic decisions, including decisions about labor force participation and labor allocation (hours worked), personal investment and the timing of income realization, housing, and even about family formation. 1 The tax code also includes special provisions that allow farms to allocate income and net losses across years to help smooth tax liabilities from characteristically volatile farm business earnings; and, farm capital investment is subject to accelerated cost recovery provisions that effectively lower the cost of capital. 2 This report provides an overview of major income tax provisions of the 2017 Federal tax code reform that impact farm households and farms. The report examines the major elements of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and estimates how they may affect the tax liability of family farm households. 3 We focus on the individual income tax provisions because the vast majority of family farms are organized as business entities that do not pay taxes themselves but, rather, pass the income/loss to the owners, where it is taxed at the individual level. We develop an individual tax model to estimate farm operation and farm household tax measures, using a nationally representative sample of farms from USDA's 2016 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). We simulate the effects of the TCJA on farm household tax liability as if the TCJA had been the prevailing tax law that year. The model uses farm household-level data and is restricted to family farms, defined as any farms where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator. While the tax model is rich in the number of income tax provisions covered (including earned income tax credit, itemized deductions, and others), it does not model behavioral changes by farmers in response to the TCJA. For example, our model does not estimate the number of farmers that could switch from livestock to crops (or vice versa) or change their equipment purchases as a response to changes by the TCJA. The individual tax model is used to estimate farm households' Federal income tax liabilities in the aggregate and also by farm size and commodity specialization. We report farm household adjusted gross income (AGI), taxable income, and the effective average income tax rate. We also show how the TCJA will differentially affect farms by size (as measured by gross cash farm income before expenses, or GCFI) and by commodity specialization. We estimate Federal estate taxes using the estate tax exclusion from the prior law and contrast them with the results using the new TCJA exclusion amounts. We develop an actuarial model that uses household data from ARMS 2016 and data from the Social Security Administration; the Farm Credit System; the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) June Area Survey; and the Internal Revenue Service.

Then, we present the characteristics of farm household income to narrow the discussion to provisions of the tax code that could have the greatest impact on farm households. Before proceeding, we define the terms \"farm business\" and \"farm household\" as used throughout this report.

Farms that are sole proprietorships, partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations are passthrough entities, meaning any profit or loss from them is passed to the owner/partner/shareholder, and tax is paid at the individual level on their personal income tax returns. Farms may choose to organize as Subchapter C corporations (about 1.5 percent of family farms in 2016), and such corporations are liable for corporate income taxes; any dividends paid to their shareholders may be subject to individual income taxes as well. 4 The ARMS data show that passthrough entities are the predominant form of legal organization for U.S. family farms. In 2016, over 98 percent of family farms were organized as passthrough entities, and 91 percent of production on family farms came from passthrough entities ( fig. 1). Across the years, the data reveal a slight positive trend in the percentage of family farms organized as passthrough entities. In particular, the share of farms organized as partnerships has increased from 4 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2016. Subchapter S corporations also show an upward trend but not as significant as that of partnerships. The share of farms organized as C corporations has been mostly flat through this period. 4 In addition to the previously mentioned business forms, farms may choose to form a hybrid-type business structure known as a Limited Liability Company (LLC). LLCs are registered by individual States and regulated by State statutes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) definition of an LLC is: \"An entity created by state statute. Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members, the IRS will treat an LLC either as a corporation, partnership, or as part of the owner's tax return (a disregarded entity). Specifically, a domestic LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. An LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner for income tax purposes (but as a separate entity for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes), unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation.\"   "}, {"section_title": "Family Farm Household Income Characteristics", "text": "Family farm households receive income from both farming and off-farm activities. For most, offfarm income accounts for a large share of the household's total income. For 2016, average farm household total income was an estimated $117,918, with off-farm sources accounting for 80 percent (table 1). Table 1 also provides income figures by farm size, a classification based on thresholds of gross cash farm income before expenses (GCFI). From table 1, we can readily see that farm size is positively associated with the share and the level of household income from farming. In many cases, farms have losses, and they can be used to offset off-farm income for income tax purposes. For 2016, average income from farming was $24,731. This income figure is relatively low because a significant percentage of farms report negative income from farming or have low farm sales, which brings the average down. In fact, since 1980, family farm sole proprietors as a group have reported negative aggregate farm profits for tax purposes. Over the last decade, both the share of farmers reporting losses and the amount of losses reported have increased. In 2015, based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, two out of every three farm sole proprietors reported a farm loss. For those who reported a loss, the average loss was $21,502, for a total of $27.5 billion. Not all farm losses are strictly the result of low earnings.

In 2016, about 36 percent of all farm households reported net capital gains, either from the sale of farm assets or nonfarm assets or both.

We provide a discussion of changes made by the TCJA (as well as some important tax provisions unchanged by the TCJA) and contrast them with the previous law. We provide economic context specific to the farm sector to illustrate the potential impact on farm households and businesses. Appendix A provides a succinct side-by-side comparison of the major provisions in the previous law and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since over 98 percent of U.S. farms are passthrough entities, we focus on tax reforms affecting the Federal individual income taxes and not those strictly affecting corporate income taxes. 6 The Federal individual income tax is a progressive tax imposed on net income, with allowances for the cost of earning the income (business expenses, including depreciation) as well as other special exceptions. 7 Because taxes on farm income are paid at the individual level, changes to the individual income tax system could result in farm households experiencing significant changes to their aftertax income. Individuals with passthrough farm income (or loss) report their farm income (or loss) on IRS Form 1040's Schedule F, as illustrated by figure 2. 8 Schedule F provides an accounting of the farm's gross income, its usual expenses-feed, seed, fertilizer, and chemicals, for example-as well as other items that may be deducted from gross income, such as expensing of physical capital investments. The net income (or loss) from the farm is combined on the taxpayer's Form 1040 with income from other sources (off-farm, self-employment, unearned income, salaries and wages, etc.), and together they form the farm household's total income for tax purposes.

We estimate that just over 46 percent of all farm households would have had a 199A deduction if the TCJA had been in effect then, and the total amount of this deduction from taxable income would have been $9.6 billion. The ability of a farmer to use section 199A is limited by several factors. The amount of QBI must be positive; if QBI is negative, the loss may be carried back or forward to another year, depending on the individual tax situation. The deduction may also be limited by wages paid to farm labor that is directly hired (excluding contract labor). The limit begins for married taxpayers with taxable income exceeding $315,000 ($157,500 for single filers), and the deduction is reduced by the amount that QBI exceeds the allowable wages used in the calculation. 12"}, {"section_title": "Capital Cost Recovery for Businesses", "text": "Investment in depreciable capital assets is treated differently than other business expenses in the calculation of net taxable income. Depreciable capital assets are assets that have a finite useful life of more than 1 year. Examples of these types of assets are machinery, equipment, farm buildings, and cattle used for dairy. Note that farm land is not a depreciable asset as it does not have a finite useful life. Since depreciable capital has a multiyear life span, businesses are allowed to deduct from their yearly taxable income only a portion of the cost of the investment. This deduction is known as depreciation. The timeframe over which the investment is deducted is determined by the type of asset and the depreciation schedule of the tax code. 13 The TCJA modifies two sections of the tax code that, when used in conjunction, allow most businesses to fully deduct the cost of the depreciable capital investment in the year of purchase. Section 179 allows businesses to deduct depreciable capital costs in the year of the purchase up to a limit amount, rather than spreading the costs out over the useful life of the asset. In 2017, the limit amount was $510,000, and the TCJA raises it to $1 million. Businesses with investments above the section 179 limit are allowed to take an additional first-year depreciation deduction (\"bonus depreciation\") in the year of purchase on a set percentage of their investment amount above the section 179 limit. Section 168(k) contains the bonus depreciation percentages. The previous law allowed a 50-percent bonus depreciation, while the TCJA expands this limit to 100 percent for 2018 through 2022. Thereafter, it is reduced by 20 percentage points every year until it is fully eliminated in 2027. The new law also expands the definition of capital assets that qualify for bonus depreciation to include used assets, whereas under prior law, bonus depreciation was available only to newly manufactured capital assets. Since businesses are now allowed to take 100 percent of the difference between their investment and the section 179 limit, the TCJA effectively allows for a full deduction during the year of the investment. "}, {"section_title": "Section 179 expensing deduction limits and bonus depreciation rates", "text": "Note: The expensing limit applies to each taxpayer, not the business entity. In the case of a partnership, for example, each partner is subject to the $1 million limit in 2018. While the full expensing of capital assets in the year of purchase brought about by the TCJA may appear to have a substantial impact on the farming sector, it will likely have little practical effect on the majority of farms because most make investments in depreciable capital assets that are below the previous maximum thresholds of section 179. In 2009-16, less than 1 percent of farms made such investments above the section 179 limit ( fig. 4). The average annual investment in depreciable capital assets increased steadily from nearly $7,747 in 2009 to a peak of $21,401 in 2014. In 2016, average annual investment declined to approximately $14,283.  Capital investment patterns vary considerably across farm sizes, with large and very large farms benefiting the most from the capital cost recovery changes. For 2016, 24 percent of very large farms and 3.5 percent of large farms made investments above the previous law's section 179 threshold (table 3). Under the TCJA, the share of farms with investments above the section 179 limit drops to 10.5 percent for very large farms and 0.8 percent for large farms. In contrast, 0.53 percent of midsized farms and 0.04 percent of small farms had investments above the previous law's section 179 limits. The TCJA reduces these percentages to 0.1 percent of midsized farms and 0 percent of small farms. The economic literature has numerous studies exploring the effects of investment recovery tax provisions on business investment decisions, but very few papers specifically look at the agricultural sector. Hadrich et al. (2013) use North Dakota Farm and Ranch Business Association data over 1993-2011 and find that increasing the section 179 limits has a small positive effect on farms' machinery investment. More recently, Williamson and Stutzman (2016), using ARMS data over 1996-2012, show that for every $1,000 increase in section 179 expensing amount, farms made an incremental capital investment of between $320 and $1,110. That paper also shows that increasing the percentage allowance of bonus depreciation (section 168(k)), for the most part, did not have a statistically significant effect on farm capital investment. This result is due to the majority of farms making investments below the section 179 deduction limit. Therefore, there were no capital costs left over to expense under the bonus depreciation provision."}, {"section_title": "Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction", "text": "The TCJA did not modify the self-employed health insurance deduction, a provision we estimate to be used by about one in five family farm households. The self-employed health insurance deduction was created in 1988 to give small business owners, including farmers, tax benefits similar to those of employees who receive employer-deductible health insurance. Since 2003, farmers and other self-employed taxpayers have been allowed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of providing health insurance for themselves and their families as long as they are not eligible for any employersponsored plan. The self-employed health insurance deduction is limited to the amount of the taxpayer's income from self-employment, thereby eliminating the deduction for farmers with net farm losses. Over 50 percent of farm households obtain their insurance through off-farm employment of the operator or spouse, which helps account for the low number of farmers claiming the deduction. Many other farmers are over age 65 and are covered by Medicare or other Government programs (Jones et al., 2009). In 2016, we estimate that farmers meeting the self-employed health deduction eligibility criteria had an average health insurance premium cost of $7,633, for a total of $3.6 billion in health insurance premiums. Nearly one out of every two operators of midsized and large-scale farms are eligible to claim the self-employed health insurance deduction. Households of small farms, on the other hand, are less likely to be eligible to claim the deduction, primarily because greater proportions of these households receive health insurance from a nonfarm job or do not qualify for the deduction due to reporting a farm loss."}, {"section_title": "Business Interest Expense Deduction", "text": "Debt is used in agriculture to finance capital purchases such as machinery, equipment, and breeding livestock, as well as land. Debt is also used to finance short-term operations (operating loans), paying for such things as seed, feed, and chemicals. The sector reported paying $8.7 billion in total interest (excluding interest paid on the operator's dwelling) on $226 billion of debt, based on 2016 ARMS estimates. Under the TCJA generally, the business interest deduction is now limited to business interest income plus 30 percent of adjusted taxable income with two exceptions: (1) businesses with less than $25 million of gross receipts are exempt from the 30-percent adjusted taxable income limitation; and (2) farms are not subject to the $25 million limit as long as they use the Alternative Depreciation System to depreciate farming business property with a recovery period of 10 years or more. 14 The number of farms affected by the exemption limit is likely minimal because very large farms-$5 million or more in gross cash receipts-account for 0.3 percent of family farms. Under previous law, interest paid on debt that was used to finance the purchase of business property or to finance business activity was generally fully deductible by businesses as an expense. Among all family farms in 2016, one-third incurred business interest expenses, but the incidence of this expense varies by farm size. Around 80 percent of midsized and larger farms reported interest expense, while only 24 percent of small farms reported interest expense. Overall, larger farms carry more debt and thus have greater interest expenses than smaller farms. Small farms reported an average interest expense of $6,809, while midsized farms had $21,286.

"}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Capital Gains Taxation", "text": "A capital gain (loss) occurs when the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset-such as stocks, bonds, buildings, machinery, or land-are greater (smaller) than the asset's original value. A capital gain is considered long term when the capital asset is held for more than a year; capital gains from the sale of assets held for less than 1 year are short-term gains. For example, a farmer sells stocks for a total of $1,000. The farmer originally purchased those stocks 2 years ago at a price of $900 (the original cost). Hence, the farmer would have a long-term capital gain of $100. The TCJA retains the previous law's taxation of capital gains, with short-term capital gains taxed at the same rates as other sources of income and long-term capital gains taxed at lower rates. For many taxpayers, the capital gains tax rate is 15 percent for long-term capital gains. However, there are exceptions. Taxpayers in the 10-percent or 12-percent bracket have no tax liability from their long-term capital gains. Taxpayers in the top bracket (37 percent) face a 20-percent tax rate on their long-term capital gains. A gain from qualified small business stock held more than 5 years is taxed at a 28-percent rate but only on half of the gain, resulting in an effective 14-percent tax rate. The TCJA also retains the Net Investment Income Tax, which is a surtax of 3.8 percent on capital gains for high-income taxpayers. 16 Reduced capital gains rates are especially significant for farmers because farmers realize a greater share of their income from capital gains than the average taxpayer. Farmers may have capital gains or losses from sales or exchanges involving capital assets (whether part of the business or not) that are not subject to depreciation-land for example-as well as from sales or exchanges of depreciable business property. 17 Under current tax law, some or all of the proceeds from the sale or exchange of depreciable business property may be treated as a capital gain and taxed at the lower capital gains rate (or in the case of a loss, treated as an ordinary loss)."}, {"section_title": "Deductions for Household and Child Tax Credit", "text": "The TCJA doubles the standard deduction amount and eliminates the personal exemption. 18 Single filers can claim a $12,000 standard deduction, up from $6,300 in the previous law, while married filers are allowed to claim a standard deduction of $24,000, up from $12,000. Previous law also included the personal exemption, which allowed the tax filer an exemption of $4,050 per filer and dependents. The TCJA also eliminates a number of miscellaneous itemized deductions, and, importantly, those that are retained have been modified and/or capped to a new binding dollar limit. 19 The eliminated miscellaneous itemized deductions include certain unreimbursed employee expenses, expenses incurred to collect taxable income that must be included in gross income, and expenses paid to manage, conserve, or maintain property held to produce income. The mortgage interest deduction now applies to mortgage indebtedness up to $750,000, down from the $1 million limit under the previous law. After 2025, the limit returns to $1 million. State, local, and property taxes (SALT) were fully deductible under the previous law but are now capped by the TCJA. Under the new law, taxpayers may deduct a combination of State, local, and property taxes up to a maximum of $10,000. 20 Medical expenses above 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) can be itemized under the TCJA through the end of 2018, after which the limit is scheduled to return to 10 percent. For the charitable donations deduction, the percentage limit for cash donations by an individual taxpayer is increased from 50 percent to 60 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base. 21 The phaseout of itemized deduction amounts for high-income taxpayers is repealed under the TCJA. Previously, married taxpayers with AGI greater than $311,300 ($259,400 for single taxpayers) would have had their itemized deduction amount reduced by an amount that increases with the difference between AGI and the phaseout income threshold. The TCJA also includes a Child Tax Credit of $2,000, although it is phased out beginning with AGI over $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married persons filing jointly. The refundable portion, or the amount that a taxpayer might receive as a payment in excess of his or her tax liability, is capped at $1,400. To qualify for a Child Tax Credit refund, the taxpayer must have earned income of at least $2,500. The Child Tax Credit under previous law was $1,000 per qualifying child, and the phaseout began for married (single) taxpayers with AGI above $110,000 ($75,000).

The AMT may apply to some taxpayers with high incomes and significant deduction amounts. Under the AMT rules, individuals may have to recalculate their taxes in such a way that many of the tax benefits that help to offset tax liability are forgone. In some cases, these tax benefits are added back into the farmer's adjusted gross income, thus increasing it and creating a new measure of taxable income known as alternative minimum taxable income. The individual is responsible for the AMT only if the tentative minimum tax (the amount figured under the AMT rules) is greater than the regular tax computed under the standard method-that is, the AMT represents the additional tax owed over the regular income tax. 22 The previous tax law's AMT tax rates of 26 percent and 28 percent remain unchanged under the TCJA. Among all family farms, the average AMT owed was $222. We estimate that under the TCJA, 3.1 percent of farm households would owe AMT tax based on 2016 data, for an average amount of $7,270, conditional on owing AMT, which is in addition to any regular income tax owed. Under previous law, 3.8 percent of farm households owed AMT, and the average amount was $7,289, conditional on owing the tax."}, {"section_title": "Income Averaging", "text": "Farmers have been eligible for income averaging since 1998, and the TCJA retains this provision. Under the income averaging provision, a farmer can elect to shift a specified amount of farm income, including gains on the sale of farm assets other than land, to the preceding 3 years and pay taxes at the rate applicable to each year. Income that is shifted back is spread equally among the 3 years. If the marginal tax rate was lower during one or more of the preceding years, a farmer may pay less tax than he or she would without the option of income averaging. The provision, however, does not allow income from previous years to be brought forward. Furthermore, although the provision is designed to reduce the effect of farm income variability, as long as some farm income is available to be shifted, the source of income variability does not need to be farm income for income averaging to be beneficial. 23 The reduced tax rates of the TCJA, combined with other changes such as the deduction for business income, will likely mean fewer farmers will use this provision in 2018 and beyond. In 2004, an estimated 50,800 farmers-or about 5 percent of farms-reduced their tax liability on average by $4,434 with income averaging (Peirce and Jezek, 2009). The reduced liability totaled $225.3 million and amounted to a 23-percent reduction in Federal income taxes for those taking advantage of the provision compared with the amount that they would have owed without income averaging. More than a third of the total tax reduction for the tax year was realized by farmers with adjusted gross income over $1 million. These farmers reduced their liability by an average of $264,000, for a total of $82.6 million. Variability of farm household income generally exceeds that of all U.S. households, and under a progressive tax rate system, taxpayers whose annual income fluctuates widely may pay higher total taxes over a multiyear period than other taxpayers with similar yet more stable income. The variability of farm households' income is attributed to fluctuations in farm output (due to weather and pests, for example), commodity prices, and farm business cycles. A 2017 USDA, ERS study indicates that for midsized and large family farms-those responsible for about 80 percent of the value of U.S. agricultural output-the median change in total income between years was about eight times larger than for nonfarm households (Key et al., 2017). The study used USDA's ERS/NASS ARMS data for 1996 through 2013 and found that farm income (including Government payments) accounted for 79.6 percent of the total income variation for the farm households studied, while 10.5 percent of the variation was from off-farm wage income and 9.9 percent of income variation was from other off-farm income."}, {"section_title": "The Federal Estate Tax", "text": "The Federal estate tax has applied to the transfer of property at death since 1916 as part of a unified system of transfer taxes. While the tax has been amended many times, the estate tax, as well as the gift tax (imposed upon transfers prior to a person's death) and the generation-skipping transfer tax, has never directly affected a large percentage of taxpayers; the IRS estimates that between 1934 and 2008, only 1.8 percent of adult deaths, on average, generated a taxable estate valued above the exclusion amount. 24 The TCJA keeps the estate tax framework but doubles the exclusion amount to $11.18 million per individual. 25 Only the estate of a decedent who, at death, owns assets in excess of the estate tax exclusion amount must file a Federal estate tax return. However, only those returns that have a taxable estate above the exclusion amount-after deductions for expenses, debts, and bequests to a surviving spouse or charity-are subject to tax at a graduated rate, up to a current maximum of 40 percent. The exclusion amount for estates has increased significantly since 2000 (see fig. 5), resulting in a decrease in the number of farm estates that must file an estate tax return as well as the number of estates with any tax liability. Unsurprisingly, there was a steep decline across all of these measures after the start of the Great Recession. However, the number of estate tax returns and estates with tax liability in the postrecession time remained well below their peak level in 2007-08 ( fig. 6). This was largely driven by an increase in the exclusion from $2 million in 2008 to $5 million in 2011. On the other hand, the estimated total tax liability owed by farm estates returned to prerecession levels even as the exclusion increased and the maximum marginal tax rate went down, primarily due to the growth in farm real estate values. The exclusion amounts and estate tax rates affect all estates, not just farm estates. But over the years, a number of targeted provisions have been enacted to reduce the burden of the estate tax on farms and small business owners. These include a special provision that allows farm real estate to be valued at farm-use value rather than its fair-market value and a provision that allows for installment payments (available to all estates). 26 Farmers and other landowners may also donate an easement or other restriction on development and exclude the value of the donated easement from the estate, providing additional estate tax savings. The TCJA continues previous law by allowing the basis in the property acquired from a decedent to be stepped-up to the value of the asset at the date of death. This \"step-up in basis\" rule essentially eliminates any tax liability for the appreciation of the property that occurred prior to the property owner's death. The rule is significant since much of the appreciation in the value of assets in the estate has never been taxed-either as income or capital gains-and thus will escape taxation completely. 27 Heirs only pay capital gains tax on any increase in the value of the assets after they inherited the property. 24 IRS Historical Table 17. 25 Applies to decedents dying or gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. 26 Farm-use value refers to the value of real property (land) at its agricultural value rather than, for example, its value for another purpose, such as commercial development."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimated Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Farms and Farm Households, ERR-252", "text": "USDA, Economic Research Service  Estimated family farm estates that are required to file a return and number with a tax liability (top panel).

The dataset consists of 17,929 observations, which, when weighted, represent 2,027,269 family farms. Simulation results are presented for the individual income tax and the estate tax. For individual income tax provisions, we model the differences in taxes paid under the TCJA versus previous law with respect to the following provisions: 2. Eliminated domestic production activities deduction (section 199) 3. Deduction for qualified business income (section 199A). The simulation results are summarized through the effective tax rate, which measures actual tax burden, and the effective marginal tax rate, which measures the effective tax on the last dollar. The effective tax rate is simply the ratio between taxes paid and total income and is a more accurate representation of the tax burden faced by taxpayers than using their tax bracket rate. The effective marginal tax rate is a measure commonly sought by economists as it calculates the net tax on the last dollar of income earned, often referred to as the marginal dollar. Economic decisions such as investing or hours worked are made based on the tax rate on the marginal dollar earned; hence, the effective marginal tax rate is a more useful measure for capturing the tax code's incentives (or disincentives) than the overall tax burden. The section concludes with simulation results for the Federal estate tax. The simulations are from an actuarial model that uses data from several sources as well as ARMS 2016 (see appendix C for model documentation). ARMS provides the demographic and financial information for farm households, and data from the Social Security Administration, the NASS June Area Survey, and the Farm Credit System are used to determine mortality rates, cash rents, and interest rates, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Effective Income Tax Rates", "text": "We estimate that family farm households in 2016 would have faced an average effective income tax rate of 13.9 percent, after tax credits, under the TCJA (table 5)-a 3.3-percentage point decline, excluding self-employment taxes. 29 Households of midsized farms are estimated to experience the greatest decline in average effective rates, 5.8 percentage points. Households of small family farms would experience a decrease of 3.0 percentage points, and households of large and very large farms would experience a reduction of 3.4 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively. 30 To the extent that larger family farms experience a decline in average effective tax rates, it is primarily the result of two changes made by the TCJA. First, the majority of the income of large family farm households is subject to the maximum marginal tax rate. Not only is this rate reduced under the TCJA, but the income level triggering the top rate is increased, which means less income is subject to the top rate. 31 Larger farms also receive a greater percentage of their total household income from farming (85 percent or more), and under the TCJA, up to 20 percent of passthrough income from farming is deducted from taxable income. However, very large farm households are expected to benefit least because they have adjusted gross incomes well above the income limitations stipulated in section 199A (table 1, appendix A); therefore, many of these households are limited in their ability to deduct 20 percent of passthrough income. On the other hand, midsized and large farm households also derive a significant portion of their total household income from the farm business, but their adjusted gross incomes are below the income limitation of section 199A. 29 To calculate the average effective tax rate, we use the ratio of the sum of total tax liability to the sum of total income. We use this measure because it allows us to deal with peculiar tax situations created by the tax system, and it is generally accepted practice in the tax field. This measure of effective tax rates is consistent with the measures used by the Internal Revenue Service and Joint Committee on Taxation and has advantages over the alternative measure of taking the average of the individual effective rates. Outliers have a greater degree of effect in the average of ratios, an issue of special concern for us as multiple observations could have zero taxable income, which results in an infinite tax rate, either positive or negative depending on the sign of the tax liability. Furthermore, we also report statistics for income tax rates inclusive of self-employment taxes, which are assessed at the business level; hence, it could be possible for a person with zero taxable income to have positive self-employment tax liability, which would result in an infinite effective tax rate."}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Estimated Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Farms and Farm Households, ERR-252 USDA, Economic Research Service While larger farms benefit from the reduced rates and expanded income tax brackets, small and midsized farms would also experience a reduction in their effective income tax rate relative to previous law due to the expansion of the standard deduction. The TCJA almost doubles the standard deduction, consequently reducing the effective Federal income tax rate for small and midsized farms by between 3 and 5 percentage points. We estimate the aggregate standard deductions taken by small and midsized farms would increase under the TCJA to over $43 billion, based on 2016 ARMS data, compared to an estimated $23 billion in total standard deductions claimed under previous tax law by the same group of farm households. 32 While large farms and small farms benefit from different aspects of the tax law changes, midsized farms are able to take advantage of all these benefits. Like the large farm households, midsized farm households benefit from the 199A deduction and also from the reduction in marginal tax rates. Midsized farms also benefit from the increase in the standard deduction, just like the small farm households. The combination of benefits explains why midsized farmers experience the greatest decline in average effective tax rates. Overall, under the TCJA, all commodity production specializations experience a decline in their average effective tax rate, declining by 3.3 percentage points on average, but the size of the change varies across specialization. Producers of high-value crops-fruits, nuts, vegetables, and nursery operators-and producers of major row crops experience a tax rate decline of 4.0 percentage points (table 6). Producers of beef cattle, representing the greatest number of farms of any specialty, experience the smallest decline (2.6 percentage points), and this result is driven by beef cattle producers being concentrated on small farms (see table 7 for summary of income and tax components by commodity specialization). Under the TCJA, dairy producers experience the largest decline in the average effective rate (4.3 percentage points).  Note: All figures are averages in dollars except number of farms. Specialization is determined by the commodity accounting for at least 51 percent of the farm's value of production. If no commodity alone accounts for at least 51 percent, then the specialization is classified as \"other crops or livestock.\" 1 Total household income is the sum of farm business income, off-farm earned income, and off-farm unearned income. 2 Farm capital gains are included in farm business income. 3 Off-farm capital gains are included in off-farm unearned income.

Generally under a progressive tax system, individuals' effective income tax rate will be lower than their effective marginal tax rate. To illustrate, consider a single taxpayer with $100,000 in income, thus falling in the 24-percent tax rate bracket, with a final tax liability of $10,000. The effective average tax rate for this person is 10 percent; however, his or her effective marginal tax rate is 24 percent as any extra dollar in income he/she receives would have been taxed at this rate. This example is very simplistic to serve illustrative purposes; our computations of the EMTR account for tax credits and deductions, including those with income phaseouts. Table 8 presents effective marginal tax rates by farm size. The effective marginal rates are calculated using income from salary and wages, capital, and self-employment (including farm income as well as other business income). If the TCJA had been law in 2016, the estimated average effective marginal tax rate among all farms would have been 13.6 percent. Larger farms would have faced a higher average effective marginal tax rate-between 27.6 percent and 31.9 percent-than small and midsized farms. Recall from table 4 that married couples filing jointly who have taxable income above $600,000 ($500,000 for single filers) are taxed under TCJA at a statutory marginal rate of 37 percent (and the taxpayers may also be assessed a net investment income surtax of 3.8 percent on capital income). 33 Table 8 Average effective marginal tax rates by family farm size 1 , 2016 Large farm households had an estimated effective marginal tax rate of 34.6 percent under previous law and experience the greatest declines. Under the TCJA, we expect households of large farms to see their average effective marginal tax rate decline by an estimated 7.0 percentage points, on average, while the rate for households of midsized farms falls by 5.8 percentage points. Average effective marginal tax rates for farm households by commodity specialization are presented in table 9. The average effective marginal rates under TCJA range from 11.5 percent for dairy to 17.3 percent for hog producers. The average rates declined from previous law by between 0.9 (dairy) and 4.1 (major row crops, including grains, oilseeds, tobacco, and cotton) percentage points. Average effective marginal tax rates by farm commodity specialization , 2016  7). After accounting for adjustments to the taxable value of the estate, including deductions for expenses and debts and exemptions for bequests to a surviving spouse or charity, only 0.11 percent of these estates are projected to owe tax. Across all estates that owe tax, the aggregate liability is estimated at $104 million. Exposure to the estate tax was greater under previous law than under the TCJA. Under previous Federal estate tax law, the estate of a decedent who, at death, owns assets in excess of the estate tax exclusion amount ($5.45 million in 2016) would file a Federal estate tax return, and a portion of these would pay estate tax. Using the same actuarial model and 2016 ARMS data but previous law provisions, we estimate that 2.05 percent of all farm estates were required to file an estate tax return and only 0.86 percent of farm estates would have had an estate tax liability. 34 Aggregate liability under previous law is estimated at $496 million."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The vast majority of U.S. family farms are organized as passthrough entities that are not subject to income tax themselves. Rather, the owners of the entities are taxed at the individual level on their share of farm income. Income received from agricultural production activities, and in some cases lease payments from rented land and farm program payments, is passed through from the farm to the individual farmers, partners, or shareholders of S corporations. Using USDA, NASS/ERS Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data and the individual income tax provisions for passthrough entities and corporate dividends, we simulate the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on farm households' tax liabilities and effective and marginal tax rates. The TCJA eliminates several itemized deductions and modifies credits for children and dependents, and it restructures tax brackets and lowers statutory marginal rates. The TCJA effectively lowers the maximum statutory marginal tax rate on farm income for farms organized as passthroughs to 29.6 percent by providing a deduction equal to as much as 20 percent of qualified business income. Using data from 2016, we estimate that family farm households would have faced an average effective income tax rate of 13.9 percent under the TCJA versus 17.2 percent under previous law after factoring in tax credits (Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, and Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit) but excluding self-employment taxes. The reduction in effective income tax rates from the TCJA varies across farm sizes with midsized farms estimated to benefit most, with a 5.8-percentage-point decline in their average effective tax rate. The average household of a small farm experiences an estimated decrease of 3.0 percentage points in its average effective income tax rate, with large and very large farm households experiencing a reduction of 3.4 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively. In addition to restructuring the individual income tax code, the TCJA doubles the exclusion amount of the Federal estate tax. Based on an actuarial model that uses ARMS data, we estimate that the estate tax affects a small number of farm estates overall in terms of required filing or tax liability. Limits deduction to no more than business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income for the taxpayer (no carryforward).
