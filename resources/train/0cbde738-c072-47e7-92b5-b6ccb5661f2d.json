The white regions in the image show where the earlier passage of strong shock fronts heated the gas in this turbulent flow. Blue regions have the weakest vorticity, and as the vorticity increases in strength, the color goes through red to yellow and finally to white. The dynamic visualization was created at the Laboratory for Computational Science & Engineering (LCSE), a facility within the University of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center where innovative hardware and system software solutions to problems in computational science and engineering can be tested and applied. Work in the LCSE has been supported by a series of National Science Foundation equipment grants (the most recent is CNS 07-08822).

Indicators\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators (SEI) ) is first and foremost a volume of record comprising the major high-quality quantitative data on the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. SEI is factual and policy neutral. It does not offer policy options, and it does not make policy recommendations. SEI employs a variety of presentation styles-- tables, figures, narrative text, bulleted text, Web-based links, highlights, introductions, conclusions, reference lists--to make the data accessible to readers with different information needs and different information-processing preferences.\nThe data are \"indicators.\" Indicators are quantitative representations that might reasonably be thought to provide summary information bearing on the scope, quality, and vitality of the science and engineering enterprise. The indicators reported in SEI are intended to contribute to an understanding of the current environment and to inform the development of future policies. SEI does not model the dynamics of the science and engineering enterprise, and it avoids strong claims about the significance of the indicators it reports. SEI is used by readers who hold a variety of views about which indicators are most significant for different purposes.\nSEI is prepared by the National Science Foundation's Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) under the guidance of the National Science Board (Board). It is subject to extensive review by outside experts, interested federal agencies, Board members, and NSF internal reviewers for accuracy, coverage, and balance.\nSEI includes more information about measurement than many readers unaccustomed to analyzing social and economic data may find easy to absorb. This information is included because readers need a good understanding of what the reported measures mean and how the data were collected in order to use the data appropriately. SEI's data analyses, however, are relatively accessible. The data can be examined in various ways, and SEI generally emphasizes neutral, factual description and avoids unconventional or controversial analysis. As a result, SEI almost exclusively uses simple statistical tools that should be familiar and accessible to a college bound high school graduate. Readers comfortable with numbers and percentages and equipped with a general conceptual understanding of terms such as \"statistical significance\" and \"margin of error\" will readily understand the statistical material in SEI. A statistical appendix aids readers' interpretation of the material presented.\nSEI's Different Parts\nSEI includes seven chapters that follow a generally consistent pattern; an eighth chapter, on state indicators, presented in a unique format; and an overview that precedes these eight chapters. The chapter titles are\n\n Elementary and Secondary Education\n Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n Science and Engineering Labor Force\n Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n Academic Research and Development\n Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n State Indicators\nAn appendix volume, available online at http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/indicators/, contains detailed data tables keyed to each of the eight chapters. SEI includes a list of abbreviations/acronyms and an index.\nA National Science Board policy statement companion piece, authored by the Board, draws upon the data in SEI and offers recommendations on issues of concern for national science and engineering research or education policy, in keeping with the Board's statutory responsibility to bring attention to such issues. In addition, the Board publishes the Digest of Key Science and Engineering Indicators, a condensed version of SEI comprising a small selection of important indicators. The digest serves two purposes: (1) to draw attention to important trends and data points from across the chapters of SEI and (2) to introduce readers to the data resources available in the main volume of SEI 2010 and associated products.\nThe Seven Core Chapters\nEach chapter consists of contents and lists of sidebars, text tables, and figures; highlights; introduction (chapter overview and chapter organization); a narrative synthesis of data and related contextual information; conclusion; notes; glossary; and references.\nHighlights. The highlights provide an outline of major dimensions of a chapter topic. Each highlight starts with a statement that summarizes a key point made in the chapter. Bulleted points supporting the key point follow.\nIntroduction. The chapter overview provides a brief explanation of the importance of the topic. It situates the topic in the context of major concepts, terms, and developments relevant to the data reported. The introduction includes a brief narrative account of the logical flow of topics within the chapter.\nNarrative. The chapter narrative is a descriptive synthesis that brings together significant findings. It is also a balanced presentation of contextual information that is useful for\n\nxii \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n xiii\n\ninterpreting the findings. As a descriptive synthesis, the narrative aims (1) to enable the reader to assimilate a large amount of information by putting it in an order that facilitates comprehension and retention and (2) to order the material so that major points readily come to the reader's attention. As a balanced presentation, the narrative aims to include appropriate caveats and context information such that (3) a nonexpert reader will understand what uses of the data may or may not be appropriate, and (4) an expert reader will be satisfied that the presentation reflects a good understanding of the policy and fact context in which the data are interpreted by users with a range of science policy views.\nFigures. Figures provide visually compelling representations of major findings discussed in the text. Figures also enable readers to test narrative interpretations offered in the text by examining the data themselves.\nText Tables. Text tables help to illustrate and to support points made in the text.\nSidebars. Sidebars discuss interesting recent developments in the field, more speculative information than is presented in the regular chapter text, or other special topics. Sidebars can also present definitions or highlight crosscutting themes.\nAppendix Tables. Appendix tables, available online (http:// www.nsf.gov/statistics/indicators/), provide the most complete presentation of quantitative data, without contextual information or interpretive aids. According to past surveys of SEI users, even experienced expert readers find it helpful to consult the chapter text in conjunction with the appendix tables.\nConclusion. The conclusion summarizes important findings. It offers a perspective on important trends but stops short of definitive pronouncements about either likely futures or policy implications. Conclusions tend to avoid factual syntheses that suggest distinctive or controversial viewpoints.\nGlossary. The glossary defines terms used in the chapter.\nReferences. SEI includes references to data sources cited in the text, stressing national or internationally comparable data. SEI does not attempt to review the analytic literature on a topic or summarize the social science or policy perspectives that might be brought to bear on it. References to that literature are included where they help to explain the basis for statements in the text.\nThe State Indicators Chapter\nThis chapter consists of data that can be used by people involved in state-level policy making, including journalists and interested citizens, to assess trends in S&T-related activities in their states. Indicators are drawn from a range of\n\nvariables, most of which are part of the subject matter of the seven core chapters. The text explains the meaning of each indicator and provides important caveats about how to interpret it. Approximately three to five bullets highlight significant findings. Data for the indicators are graphically displayed in United States maps that color code states into quartiles and in state-by-state tables. A small number of appendix tables for this chapter can be found online.\nNo interpretive narrative synthesizes overall patterns and trends. SEI includes state-level indicators to call attention to state performance in S&T and to foster consideration of state-level activities in this area.\nThe Overview\nThe overview is a selective synthesis that brings together patterns and trends that unite data in several of the substantive chapters. The overview helps readers to synthesize the findings in SEI as a whole and draws connections among separately prepared chapters that deal with related topics. It is intended to serve readers with varying levels of expertise. Because the overview relies heavily on figures, it is well adapted for use in developing presentations, and presentation graphics for the figures in the overview are available on the Web. Like the core chapters, the overview strives for a descriptive synthesis and a balanced tone, and it does not take or suggest policy positions.\nPresentation\nSEI is released in printed and electronic formats. The printed volume provides the full content except for the appendix tables. The complete content of SEI is posted online at http://www. nsf.gov/statistics/indicators/ in html format and PDF, with text tables, appendix tables, and source data for each figure available in spreadsheet (MS Excel) format. In addition, selected figures are also available in presentation-style format as MS PowerPoint and JPEG files.\nThe printed version of SEI includes a CD-ROM in PDF format and a packaged set of information cards. The CD-ROM contains the complete content of SEI and, as with the online version, appendix tables in spreadsheet format. The full set of presentation slides is also included. The pocket-sized information cards highlight key patterns and trends. Each card presents a selection of figures with captions stating the major point that the figure is meant to illustrate.\n\n\f\fOverview\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................................

It is not intended to be comprehensive; the reader will find more extensive data in the body of each chapter. Major findings on particular topics appear in the Highlights sections that precede chapters 1\u00ad7.\nThe indicators included in Science and Engineering Indicators 2010 derive from a variety of national, international, public, and private sources and may not be strictly comparable in a statistical sense. As noted in the text, some data are weak, and the metrics and models relating them to each other and to economic and social outcomes invite further development. Thus, the emphasis is on broad trends; individual data points and findings should be interpreted with care.\nThe overview focuses on the trend in the United States and many other parts of the world toward the development of more knowledge-intensive economies, in which research, its commercial exploitation, and other intellectual work play a growing role. Industry and government play key roles in these changes.\nThe overview examines how these S&T patterns and trends affect the position of the United States, using broadly comparable data wherever possible for the United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, China, and selected other Asian economies (the Asia-9: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam).\nThe overview sketches an analytical framework for, and a broad outline of, the main S&T themes, which it then examines through the lens of various indicators such as global R&D expenditures and human resources, including researchers. It describes research outputs and their use in the form of article citations and patents. It then turns to the growth and structural shifts in international high-technology markets, trade, and relative trade positions.\nThe data available as of this writing do not, for the most part, cover the ongoing changes that shook the global economy beginning in 2008. The data therefore cannot accurately portray their consequences for the world's S&T enterprise. Thus, the trends discussed here may already be changing in unexpected ways. Nevertheless, major patterns and trends that have developed over the past decade or more affect, and are shaped by, the range of S&T endeavors, from basic research to production and trade of high-technology goods and knowledge-intensive services. They are the starting points from which to mark any future changes.\nA Bird's Eye View of the World's Changing S&T Picture\nSince the 1990s, a global wave of market liberalization has produced an interconnected world economy that has brought unprecedented levels of activity and growth, along\n\nwith structural changes whose consequences are not yet fully understood. Governments in many parts of the developing world have come to view science and technology (S&T) as integral to economic growth and development, and they have set out to build more knowledge-intensive economies in which research, its commercial exploitation, and intellectual work would play a growing role.\nTo that end, they have taken steps to open their markets to trade and foreign investment, develop or recast their S&T infrastructures, stimulate industrial R&D, expand their higher education systems, and build indigenous R&D capabilities. This has brought a great expansion of the world's S&T activities and their shift toward developing Asia, where most of the rapid growth has occurred. Governments there have implemented a host of policies to boost S&T capabilities as a means to ensuring their economies' competitive edge.\nIn most broad aspects of S&T activities, the United States continues to maintain a position of leadership but has experienced a gradual erosion of its position in many specific areas. Two contributing developments are the rapid increase in a broad range of Asian S&T capabilities outside of Japan and the fruition of EU efforts to boost its relative competitiveness in R&D, innovation, and high technology.\nAsia's rapid ascent as a major world S&T center-- beyond Japan--is driven by developments in China and several other Asian economies (Asia-9).1 All are seeking to boost access to and the quality of higher education and to develop world-class research and S&T infrastructures. The Asia-9 form a loosely structured supplier zone for China's high-technology manufacturing export industries that increasingly appears to include Japan. Japan, long a preeminent world S&T nation, is holding its own in research and some high-value S&T activities but is losing ground to the Asia-9 in overall high technology manufacturing and trade. India's high gross domestic product (GDP) growth contrasts with a fledgling overall S&T performance.\nThe EU largely holds its own in the face of these worldwide S&T shifts. Its innovation-focused policy initiatives have been supported by the creation of a shared currency and the elimination of internal trade and migration barriers. Much of the EU's high-technology trade is with other EU members. EU research performance is strong and marked by pronounced EU-supported, intra-EU collaboration. The EU is also focused on boosting the quality and international standing of its universities.\nOther countries share this heightened focus on S&T as a means of economic growth. Brazil and South Africa show high S&T growth rates, but from low bases. Among the more developed nations, Russia's S&T establishment continues to struggle in both relative and absolute terms, whereas Israel, Canada, and Switzerland are examples of mature, high-performing S&T establishments.\nMultinational companies (MNCs) operating in this changing environment are seeking access to developing markets, whose governments provide incentives. Modern communications and management tools support the development of\n\n\fO-4 \n\nOverview\n\nglobally oriented corporations that draw on far-flung, specialized global supplier networks. In turn, host governments are attaching conditions to market access and operations that, along with technology spillovers, produce new and greater indigenous S&T capabilities. Western- and Japanbased MNCs are increasingly joined in world S&T markets by newcomers headquartered in developing nations.\nGlobal Expansion of Research and Development Expenditures\nIn a telling development, the world's R&D expenditures have been on an 11-year doubling path, growing faster than total global economic output.2 This indicator of commitment to innovation went from an estimated $525 billion in 1996 to approximately $1.1 trillion in 2007 (figure O-1). The specific data point for each year shown in figure O-1 is an imprecise estimate, but the steady and large upward trend illustrates the rapidly growing global focus on innovation.3\nThe United States remained by far the single largest R&D-performing country. Its R&D expenditure of $369 billion in 2007 exceeded the Asian region's total of $338 billion and the EU's (EU-27) $263 billion4 (figure O-2). The U.S. 2007 total broadly matched the combined R&D expenditures of the next four largest countries: Japan, China, Germany, and France.\nIf R&D expenditures are long-term investments in innovation, how much of a nation's economic activity should be devoted to them? A U.S. goal in the 1950s was to achieve an R&D investment of 1% of GDP by 1957. More recently, many governments set their sights at 3% of GDP in pursuit\n\n-PN\\YL 6 ,Z[PTH[LK 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ ^VYSK^PKL! \nDollars (billions)\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n       \n\n:6<9*,:! 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ   HUK WYL]PV\\Z `LHYZ\" <UP[LK 5H[PVUZ ,K\\JH[PVUHS :JPLU[PMPJ HUK *\\S[\\YHS 6YNHUPaH [PVU <5,:*6 0UZ[P[\\[L MVY :[H[PZ[PJZ O[[W!Z[H[Z\\PZ\\ULZJVVYN \\ULZJV[HISL]PL^LYKVJ\\TLU[HZW_&9LWVY[0K$\n-F3HUN\\HNL$ LUN\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL 6 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ MVY <UP[LK :[H[LZ ,< HUK (ZPH!  \u00b6\nDollars (billions)\n\n\n\n\n <UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n ,<\n (ZPH\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n       \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,!

In the United States, industry funds about 67% of all R&D. For the EU, it is 55%, but with considerable range (e.g., nearly 70% for Germany and 45% for the United Kingdom). In China, Singapore, and Taiwan, industry funding ranges from 60% upward. Nevertheless, government planners monitor the R&D/GDP ratio as an indicator of innovative capacity, even as few countries reach the 3% mark.\nOver the past decade, many Asian developing economies have exhibited increased R&D/GDP ratios; conversely, those in the United States and the EU have broadly held steady. Japan's R&D expenditures amounted to 3.4% of GDP in 2007; South Korea's increased steeply after the 1990s and reached 3.5% in 2007.\nChina's R&D/GDP ratio more than doubled, from 0.6% in 1996 to 1.5% in 2007, a period during which China's GDP grew at 12% annually--an enormous, sustained increase. The gap in China's R&D/GDP ratio relative to those of developed economies suggests that China's R&D volume can continue to grow rapidly (figure O-3).\nDecade-long R&D growth rates of mature S&T countries differ dramatically from those of developing economies. Growth of R&D expenditures in the United States, the EU,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n O-5\n\n-PN\\YL 6 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ HZ ZOHYL VM LJVUVTPJ V\\[W\\[ VM ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nPercent of GDP\n\n\n1HWHU \n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n\n,<\n\n *OPUH\n\n    \n\n       \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\" .+7 $ NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[ 56;,! ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ :6<9*,! 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ   HUK WYL]PV\\Z `LHYZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nand Japan averaged about 5%\u00ad6% annually, not adjusted for inflation. Asian growth ranged from about 9% to 10% for India, South Korea, and Taiwan to more than 20% for China. Asian R&D growth reflects rising private spending by domestic and foreign firms, as well as increased public R&D spending designed to support strategic policies that aim to raise economic competitiveness through the development of knowledge-based economies (figure O-4).\n\nThe relatively greater R&D growth rates in Asia (excluding Japan) resulted in decreases in the percentages of world R&D expenditures for the mature S&T establishments-- United States, the EU, and Japan--that were substantial, especially in view of the short period and large expenditures involved. The North America region's (United States, Canada, and Mexico) share of estimated world R&D activity decreased from 40% to 35%; the EU's share declined from 31% to 28%. The Asia/Pacific region's share increased from 24% to 31% even with Japan's comparatively low growth, and the share of the rest of the world increased from 5% to 6%--still a modest level but a very large relative gain that indicates the broadly shared belief in the importance of R&D for economic development (figure O-5).\nOverseas R&D by Multinational Companies\nThe shift toward greater R&D expenditures in Asia is also reflected in R&D flows between MNCs and their overseas affiliates in which they hold majority ownership (figure O-6).\nOverseas R&D expenditures by U.S.-based MNCs ($28.5 billion in 2006) shifted toward emerging Asian markets whose combined share, excluding Japan, increased from 5% to 14% from 1995 to 2006. This change was driven by U.S. affiliates in China, South Korea, and Singapore. In 1995, about 90% of all overseas R&D by U.S.-headquartered MNCs took place in developed European economies, in Canada, and in Japan; by 2006, the combined percentage of these economies had declined to 80%.\nIn the United States, affiliates of foreign-headquartered MNCs spent $34.3 billion on R&D in 2006.

In recent decades, the increasing number of new S&E degrees, including degrees in natural sciences and engineering, awarded in developing countries has diminished the advantage that mature countries had held in advanced education.6\nWorldwide, the number of persons with a tertiary education continues to grow.7 Estimates for 1980 and 2000, the latest available year, show an increase of about 120 million individuals, from 73 million to 194 million (figure O-7). The completion of tertiary education expanded most rapidly in developing Asian economies, where the combined shares of China, India, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand increased from 14% to 25% of the world's total. The number of individuals with advanced education in these Asian countries in 2000, 49 million, nearly matched the 2000 U.S. total; in 1980, these countries had accounted for less than half.\n\nFigure O-6 R&D performed by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies in United States, by investing region, and performed by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational companies, by host region: 2006\n(Billions of current U.S. dollars)\n\n$1.6 $2.5\n\n$25.8\n\n$5.6 $18.6\n\n$0.2\n\n$0.8\n\n$4.6 $1.3 $0.04\n$0.9\n\n$0.07\n\nNOTE: Preliminary estimates.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States (annual series); and Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (annual series).

In the developing world, the number of first university NS&E degrees, broadly comparable to a U.S. baccalaureate, is rising, led by large increases in China, from about 239,000 in 1998 to 807,000 in 2006. New NS&E degrees earned by Japanese and South Korean students combined in 2006 (about 235,000) approximated the number earned by U.S. students in that year, even though the U.S. population was considerably larger (300 million vs. 175 million) (figure O-8).\nThe expansion of NS&E degrees extends beyond first university degrees to degrees certifying completed advanced study.

The number awarded in South Korea nearly tripled over the same period, reaching approximately 3,500. China's domestic NS&E doctorate awards have increased more than tenfold over the period, to about 21,000 in 2006, nearing the number of NS&E doctorates awarded in the United States (figure O-9).\nMost of the post-2002 increase in U.S. NS&E doctorate production reflects degrees awarded to temporary and permanent visa holders, who in 2007 earned about 11,600 of 22,500 U.S. NS&E doctorates.8 Foreign nationals have earned more than half of U.S. NS&E doctorates since 2006. Half of these students are from East Asia, mostly from China (31%), India (14%), and South Korea (7%).\nFor engineering, the numbers are more concentrated. Since 1999, the share of U.S. engineering doctorates earned by temporary and permanent visa holders has risen from 51% to 68% in 2007. Nearly three-quarters of foreign national recipients of engineering doctorates were from East Asia or India.\nMany of these individuals, especially those on temporary visas, will leave the United States after earning their doctorates, but if past trends continue, a large proportion will stay.

China's researchers more than doubled in number, from just over half\n\na million to more than 1.4 million, boosting its world share from 13% to 25% over the period (figure O-10).\nTrends in researcher growth rates vary greatly by country/ region. The United States and the EU had moderate annual growth of about 3% between 1995 and 2006. Japan's rate was below 1%. Growth in the Asian region outside Japan ranged from 7% to 11%. China, the biggest country, averaged nearly 9% growth, including a brief but sharp break in 1998\u00ad99 that reflected the rapid conversion of state-owned to privately owned enterprises as a result of the central government's policy change. Russia's researcher growth rate, which is now flat, declined over the period (figure O-11).\nThe contribution of multinational corporations to researcher growth in the overseas markets in which they operate is unknown. Data on overseas R&D employment of U.S.-based MNCs and their majority-owned affiliates are available only every 5 years. The latest data available show that their overseas R&D employment increased from 102,000 in 1994 to 138,000 in 2004. Over the same period, U.S. R&D employment of these MNCs increased from 625,000 to about 716,000. As a result, the overseas share of R&D employment increased from 14% to 16% (figure O-12).

Research publications reflect contributions to knowledge, patents indicate useful inventions, and citations on patent applications to the scientific and technical literature indicate the linkage between research and practical application.\nThe number of research articles published in a set of international, peer-reviewed journals has grown from about 460,000 in 1988 to an estimated 760,000 in 2008.11 The geographical distribution of the authors provides yet another indication of the size of a country's or region's research enterprise and its ability to produce research results that can pass peer review.\nResearchers in the EU and the United States have long dominated world article production, but their combined world share of published articles decreased steadily from 69% in 1995 to 59% in 2008 as Asia's output increased. In little more than a decade, Asia's world article share expanded from 14% to 23%. The increase principally reflected China's output volume, which expanded by about 14% annually over the period. In 2008, China produced about 8% of world article output, up from 1% in 1988. By 2007, China's publication volume exceeded Japan's, moving it into 2nd place behind the United States--a distant 2nd place, but up from 14th place in 1995. In contrast, India's output of scientific and technical articles stagnated through the late 1990s before beginning to increase, and India's ranking hardly moved, changing from 12th place in 1995 to 11th place in 2008 (figure O-13).\nThe distribution of a country's research publications across different fields broadly reflects its research priorities. In 2007, more than half of the articles published by U.S. researchers reported on work in the biomedical and other life sciences, whereas scientists in Asia and some major European countries published a preponderance of articles in the physical sciences12 and engineering (figure O-14). Priority shifts not evident in figure O-14 include China's growing focus on chemistry R&D (related articles increased as a share of China's S&E articles from 13% in 1988 to 24% in 2008) and declining share of other physical sciences articles (from 39% to 28%) as well as South Korea's shift toward greater output in biological and medical sciences (from a combined 17% to 38%). These changes in research portfolios reflect government policy choices: China is building up its chemicals industry; South Korea is trying to develop a reputation in health sciences.\nWorldwide, the number of engineering research articles increased substantially faster over the past 20 years than total S&E article production, particularly in Asia, where the growth rate (7.8%) in engineering article output exceeded that of total S&E article output (6.1%). Growth in the United States and Japan averaged less than 2%; in the EU, about 4.4%. China's engineering article output grew by close to 16% annually, and the Asia-8 economies expanded their combined output by 10% a year.\n\n\fO-10 \n\nOverview\n\n-PN\\YL 6 :\n, QV\\YUHS HY[PJSLZ WYVK\\JLK I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZ JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nThousands \n,<\n <UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n9LZ[ VM ^VYSK \n(ZPH 1HWHU\n\n\n(ZPH\n\n*OPUH\n\n                 \n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! :LL NSVZZHY` MVY JV\\U[YPLZ PUJS\\KLK PU (ZPH HUK (ZPH ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ (Y[PJSLZ JSHZZPMPLK I` `LHY VM W\\ISPJH[PVU HUK HZZPNULK [V YLNPVUJV\\U[Y` VU IHZPZ VM H\\[OVYZ\u00bb PUZ[P[\\[PVUHS HKKYLZZLZ -VY HY[PJSLZ ^P[O JVSSHIVYH[PUN PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ MYVT T\\S[PWSL JV\\U[YPLZ LJVUVTPLZ LHJO JV\\U[Y`LJVUVT` YLJLP]LZ MYHJ[PVUHS JYLKP[ VU IHZPZ VM WYVWVY[PVU VM P[Z WHY[PJPWH[PUN PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ *V\\U[Z MVY  HYL PUJVTWSL[L\n:6<9*,:! ;OVTZVU 9L\\[LYZ :JPLUJL *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ HUK :VJPHS :JPLUJLZ *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ O[[W![OVTZVUYL\\[LYZJVTWYVK\\J[ZF ZLY]PJLZZJPLUJL\" ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK;4\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nConsequently, the production of engineering research articles has shifted away from established S&T nations. In 1988, the U.S. share of engineering articles was 36%; by 2008, it was 20%. Japan's share declined from 12% to 7% during the same period. Only the EU managed to maintain its share at 28%. Asia's share, excluding Japan, increased from 7% to 30%, with China producing nearly half (14%) of these articles by 2008 (figure O-15).\nThis strong and rapidly growing preponderance of engineering articles produced in developing Asian economies (figure O-16) is consistent with the region's emphasis on developing high-technology manufacturing capabilities. The Asia-10 region produced more engineering articles than the United States starting in 1999 and overtook the EU in 2003. In 2005, China overtook Japan in engineering article output and moved from ninth place in 1988 to second place. India's relative strength in engineering allowed it to move from seventh place to fifth place in the past 10 years.\n\n-PN\\YL 6 -PLSK ZOHYLZ VM YLZLHYJO HY[PJSLZ MVY ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZLJVUVTPLZ! \n\n5H[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n4LKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHSILOH]PVYHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n*OPUH 0UKPH :PUNHWVYL 1HWHU :V\\[O 2VYLH ;HP^HU\n\n7VSHUK -YHUJL\n:WHPU .LYTHU`\n0[HS` <UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n5L[OLYSHUKZ\n\n9\\ZZPH 4L_PJV\n)YHaPS :^P[aLYSHUK\n0ZYHLS :V\\[O (MYPJH\n;\\YRL` *HUHKH (\\Z[YHSPH\n         7LYJLU[\n\n \n\n56;,! 5H[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KL HZ[YVUVT` JOLTPZ[Y` WO`ZPJZ NLVZJPLUJLZ TH[OLTH[PJZ HUK JVTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n:6<9*,:! ;OVTZVU 9L\\[LYZ :JPLUJL *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ HUK :VJPHS :JPLUJLZ *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ O[[W![OVTZVUYL\\[LYZJVTWYVK\\J[ZF ZLY]PJLZZJPLUJL\" ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nExpanding International Research Collaborations\nCollaborative research is becoming the norm, as indicated by the increasing coauthorship of journal articles.

Unlike the index values for established scientific nations, Asia's index values were substantially higher than expected.\nIn 2008, U.S. research collaborations were especially strong with Canada and Mexico in North America (1.18 and 1.03), with Israel (1.25), and with South Korea and Taiwan in Asia (1.23). U.S. collaborations with China, Japan, and India were above the U.S. average.\nEU policies to increase intra-European research integration appear to be having their desired effect, as intra-EU collaboration index values increased substantially over the period, most of them above unity.\nIntraregional collaborations are prevalent in Asia, where they have developed even without the integrating framework provided by the EU.

The Asia-9's share increased from 3% to 10% over the period, mostly on the strength of South Korea and Taiwan. China's share remained in the 1% range in all major technology areas. Indigenous inventive activity, a focus of government policy, appears elusive, at least as indicated by patents filed in a major Western market (figure O-22).\nPatents on inventions for which protection is sought in the United States, the EU, and Japan require substantial resources for obtaining and maintaining them. This suggests that their owners consider them to be valuable. These patents are herein treated as an indicator of the distribution of highvalue patenting around the world.\nJust over 30% of high-value patents had U.S. inventors in 2006, down somewhat from 34% in 1997.16 The EU's share declined somewhat more, to 29% in 2006, followed closely by Japan. The Asia-9's increasing share largely reflects patents with Korean inventors. As with U.S. patents, Chinese inventors appeared on only 1% of these high-value patents (figure O-23).\n\n-PN\\YL 6 :OHYL VM <: WH[LU[ NYHU[Z MVY ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZ JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nPercent \n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n\n\n\n1HWHU  ,<\n\n (ZPH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*OPUH  \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! :LL NSVZZHY` MVY JV\\U[YPLZ PUJS\\KLK PU (ZPH  *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ\n:6<9*,! <: 7H[LU[ HUK ;YHKLTHYR 6MMPJL 5\\TILY VM <[PSP[` 7H[LU[ (WWSPJH[PVUZ -PSLK PU [OL <UP[LK :[H[LZ I` *V\\U[Y` VM 6YPNPU *HSLUKHY @LHYZ   [V 7YLZLU[ O[[W!^^^\\ZW[VNV]^LIVMMPJLZ HJPKVVLPW[HMHWWSF`YO[T\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nFast-Rising Global Output of Knowledge- and\nTechnology-Intensive Firms\nGovernments in many parts of the world are acting on the conviction that knowledge- and technology-intensive economies create well-paying jobs, contribute high-value output, and ensure economic competitiveness. In response to changing opportunities, knowledge-intensive (KI) services industries and high-technology (HT) manufacturing industries have grown more rapidly than other segments of economic activity17 (figure O-24).\nIn 2007, these knowledge- and technology-intensive (KTI) industries combined contributed just under $16 trillion to global economic output--about 30% of world GDP (figure O-25).\nInitially these industries were the province of developed nations, but they have grown rapidly in developing markets. The global value-added volume for the largest aggregate-- commercial knowledge-intensive services--increased from $4.5 trillion in 1995 to $9.5 trillion in 2007 (figure O-26).\nThe United States, with $3.3 trillion in 2007, produced the largest value-added output of these industries, which include business services, financial services, and communications.\n-PN\\YL 6 :OHYL VM OPNO]HS\\L WH[LU[Z MVY ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZ JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nPercent \n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n,< \n1HWHU\n\n\n\n\n(ZPH\n   \n\n*OPUH       \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! /PNO]HS\\L WH[LU[Z HYL YLNPZ[LYLK PU [OYLL THYRL[Z!

World shares in these industries fluctuated for the United States and the EU, but by 2007 had settled near their 1995 levels. Increased production by China and the Asia-9 expanded their value-added output of commercial KI services, but at about half a trillion dollars each, their world market shares remained just below 5%. Flat output growth in Japan caused its market share to decline by more than half, to 8%.\nThe same pattern is evident in the individual KI service sectors: fluctuations in the U.S. and EU shares, steep declines for Japan's shares, and modest to rapid growth from low bases for China and the Asia-9, leading to modest increases in their world shares.\nRelative to these KI trends, high-technology manufacturing shows a much stronger world position for the developing Asian economies and much steeper decline for Japan. The Asia-9 output was about 10% of the value-added world total over the 1995\u00ad2007 period, while China's share increased from 3% to 14%. Japan's share dropped from 27% to 11%. The U.S. and EU shares both showed modest upward movement.\nThe five HT industries are, in decreasing order of the $1.2 trillion 2007 global value-added total: communications and semiconductors ($445 billion), pharmaceuticals ($319 billion), scientific instruments ($189 billion), aerospace ($153\n\n\fO-16 \n\nOverview\n\nbillion), and computers and office machinery ($114 billion). The aggregate distribution by country/economy is shown in figure O-27.\nThe United States ranked first with 31% of the total, followed by the EU's 25% share. The United States was the world leader in communications and semiconductors (29%), pharmaceuticals (32%), and aerospace (52%), and ranked behind the EU in scientific instruments (19% vs. 44%).\nHowever, in computers, the United States (25%), the EU (15%), and Japan (5%) all ranked well behind China (39%). This category saw a particularly rapid shift in relative world value-added positions (figure O-28).\nThese data obscure a larger dynamic, discussed briefly below: the development of a high-technology assembly zone in the Asia region, arrayed largely around China. It is likely that part of China's rapid growth of value-added in computer manufacturing reflects the large-scale movement of Taiwanese manufacturing facilities to, and subsequent export of computer products from, China. Nevertheless, these data highlight the growing concentration of the world's computer and office machinery manufacturing in Asia.\n-PN\\YL 6 =HS\\L HKKLK VM OPNO[LJOUVSVN` THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN PUK\\Z[YPLZ I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`!  \u00b6\nCurrent dollars (billions) \n\n <UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n (ZPH\n\n1HWHU\n\n,< *OPUH\n\n   \n\n   \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! 0UK\\Z[YPLZ KLMPULK I` 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ :LL NSVZZHY` MVY KLMPUP[PVUZ VM OPNO[LJOUVSVN` THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN HUK (ZPH  *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ\n:6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK 0UK\\Z[Y` :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nBooming Global High-Technology Exports Rearranging World Trade Patterns\nThe total export volume of high-technology products increased faster than gross production and pushed exports close to 60% of production in 2007, up from 37% in 1995 (figure O-29). This increase reflects the broadened international base of high-technology manufacturing, the expansion of multinational firms' overseas production, and a shift in the nature of production to increasingly specialized and geographically dispersed suppliers. The global economic slowdown is mirrored in the greater decline of exports than production and the downturn in the 2008 export share.\nThe global expansion of high-technology trade has made China the largest single high-technology exporter and has changed the relative positions of the developed and developing countries. China's share of world high-technology exports increased from 6% in 1995 to 20% in 2008, while the Asia-9 maintained a 26%\u00ad29% share (figure O-30).

The shift in output of high-technology goods toward developing Asian economies has been accompanied by the growth of intraregional supplier relationships that provide intermediate goods, many for further assembly and eventual export. Chinese high-technology exports to the United States increased from $28 billion in 2000 to $112 billion 8 years later, when the U.S. recession dampened the pace of increase. Chinese exports to the EU increased at a slightly faster pace over the period (figures O-32 and O-33).\nBig Shifts in World Trade Positions in High-Technology Products\nIn the high-technology goods trade, the United States had small trade surpluses during the mid- to late 1990s; these turned into a widening deficit after 1998 that has fluctuated at about $80 billion since 200519 (figure O-34). The U.S. trade deficit in ICT goods--communications and semiconductors and computers--is larger than that. It reached a record $126 billion in 2007 before contracting marginally to $119 billion in 2008, reflecting recession-induced lowered imports.\n\n-PN\\YL 6 :LSLJ[LK (ZPHU JV\\U[YPLZ\u00bbLJVUVTPLZ\u00bb ZOHYL VM OPNO[LJOUVSVN` L_WVY[Z [V <UP[LK :[H[LZ,< HUK *OPUH!  \u00b6\nPercent\n -YVT ;HP^HU [V <UP[LK :[H[LZ,<\n -YVT 1HWHU [V <UP[LK :[H[LZ,<\n\n-YVT :V\\[O 2VYLH [V <UP[LK :[H[LZ,< \n\n\n-YVT ;HP^HU [V *OPUH \n\n -YVT :V\\[O 2VYLH [V *OPUH\n\n-YVT 1HWHU [V *OPUH\n\n               \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< L_JS\\KLZ *`WY\\Z ,Z[VUPH 3H[]PH 3P[O\\HUPH 3\\_LTIV\\YN 4HS[H HUK :SV]LUPH\n:6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK ;YHKL :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL 6 *OPUH\u00bbZ OPNO[LJOUVSVN` L_WVY[Z [V ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZJV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nDollars (billions) \n ,<\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ \n\n(ZPH \n\n1HWHU \n               \n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU 56;,:! :LL NSVZZHY` MVY JV\\U[YPLZ PUJS\\KLK PU (ZPH  ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ :6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK ;YHKL :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \nICT goods have been the major driver behind the overall U.S. high-technology trade deficit. The broad shift in the location of production of these goods to Asia coincided with growing U.S. demand, which in turn stimulated growing imports. Pharmaceuticals contributed a further $21 billion to the 2008 deficit. Aerospace and scientific instruments were in surplus, at $50 billion and $9 billion, respectively.\nThe EU had a relatively stable 1995\u00ad2008 trade deficit for all high-technology classes combined, smaller than that of the United States. However, its ICT deficit was almost identical to that of the U.S., reflecting the same dynamic of rising domestic demand and relocated production. The EU's aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and scientific instruments trade balances were in surplus.\nChina and the Asia-9 had substantial 2008 high-technology trade surpluses of $129 billion and $221 billion, respectively. Both showed strong increases after 2002. Japan had a surplus that fluctuated at about $50 billion for most of the period, despite its loss of market share in the production of high-technology industries.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL 6 ;YHKL IHSHUJL PU OPNO[LJOUVSVN` NVVKZ MVY ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZJV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\nDollars (billions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ,<\n\u00b6\n\n(ZPH 1HWHU\n*OPUH\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\u00b6 \n\n      \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:! :LL NSVZZHY` MVY JV\\U[YPLZ PUJS\\KLK PU (ZPH  *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< L_JS\\KLZ *`WY\\Z ,Z[VUPH 3H[]PH 3P[O\\HUPH 3\\_LTIV\\YN 4HS[H HUK :SV]LUPH\n:6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK ;YHKL :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n O-19\nContinued Surpluses From U.S. Trade in Knowledge-Intensive Services and Intangible Assets\nUnlike U.S. trade in high-technology products, U.S. trade in commercial knowledge-intensive services--business, financial, and communications services--has produced a consistent and growing surplus (figure O-35). The trade balance widened from $21 billion in 1997 to nearly $50 billion in 2007, as exports grew faster than imports. Likewise, U.S. trade in intangible assets--payments for the use of others' property rights in the production of goods, trademarks, use of computer software, books, records, franchise fees, and the like--exhibited a similar trend of growing surpluses, which reached nearly $60 billion in 2007.\nConclusion\nScience and technology are no longer the province of developed nations; they have, in a sense, become \"democratized.\" Governments of many countries have firmly built S&T aspects into their development policies as they vie to make their economies more knowledge- and technologyintensive and, thereby, ensure their competitiveness in a globalizing world. These policies include long-term investments in higher education to develop human talent, infrastructure development, support for research and development, attraction of foreign direct investment and technologically advanced multinational firms, and the eventual development of indigenous high-technology capabilities.\n\n-PN\\YL 6 <: PTWVY[Z L_WVY[Z HUK [YHKL IHSHUJL PU JVTTLYJPHS RUV^SLKNLPU[LUZP]L ZLY]PJLZ! \n\n0TWVY[L_WVY[Z IPSSPVUZ IHYZ\n\n\n\n,_WVY[Z\n\n0TWVY[Z\n\n\u00b6\n)HSHUJL IPSSPVUZ SPUL \n\n \n\n )HSHUJL \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK ;YHKL :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fO-20 \n\nOverview\n\nThe resulting developments open the way for widespread international collaboration.20 The broad trend in this direction is clearly reflected in the rapid growth of international coauthorships of research articles in the world's leading journals.\nThe developments also carry with them competitive elements. The quest for international talent, once largely limited to major Western nations, is now pursued by many, and \"brain drain\" has evolved into cross-national flows of highly trained specialists. In S&T, nations are eager to establish specialty niches and develop indigenous world-class capacity.\nThe globalization of the world economy has brought unprecedented levels of growth to many countries, demonstrating that benefits can accrue to all. But the structural changes that are part and parcel of rapid growth bring with them painful dislocations, amplified by the uncertainties and potential changes fostered by the world-wide recession. How these are resolved will inevitably affect the health and development of nations' S&T systems and their place in the world.\nNotes\n1. The Asia-9 includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n2. The World Bank estimates global gross national income to have increased about 80% over the period (current PPP dollars).\n3. These estimates rely on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics; they are not precise measures. Reported data are converted to dollar totals using purchasing power parities (PPPs), the local costs of a market basket of goods and services; the accuracy of this standard economic conversion may degrade in the case of developing economies. In addition, estimation of some missing data and variable reporting mean that there is uncertainty about any specific point estimate. The reader's focus is directed to the overall trend, which reflects an internally consistent estimate over time.\n4. The latest updated 2007 U.S. R&D estimate is $398 billion; see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08318/tables/ tab1.xls. The overview uses the most recent OECD number to allow more direct comparison with other countries' values.\n5.

Tertiary education by international convention is broadly comparable to at least a U.S. technical school or associate's degree.\n8. Both figures exclude those with unknown citizenship (1,600 in 2007) and those with degrees in medical/other life\n\nsciences. Engineering figures exclude about 630 with unknown citizenship.\n9. Michael Finn, Stay rates of foreign doctorate recipients from U.S. universities, (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, forthcoming).\n10. Both estimates are based on data from a limited number of countries reporting their data, on a full-time equivalent basis, to the OECD.\n11. The database used is Thomson Scientific, Science and Social Science Citation Indexes; IpIQ, Inc.; and NSF tabulations.\n12. The physical sciences are physics; chemistry; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and astronomy.\n13. The index numerator is the percent of country A's international collaborations with country B; the denominator is B's percentage of the world's international collaborations. See appendix table 5-41.\n14. Citation indicators are subject to a number of distortions: self-citation, citation of failed theories, hypotheses, and approaches; citation of domestic vs. foreign articles; language and cultural barriers; etc. However, when aggregated over many articles, citation indicators carry information about the relative use of articles in subsequent work.\n15. In these data, USPTO patents are assigned to the location of the first-named inventor.\n16. The geographic distribution is based on location of inventor. Multiple-inventor patents are credited fractionally to geographic location.\n17. These industry groups are defined by the OECD and form the basis for databases of economic activity that over a large number of the world's economies. Knowledgeintensive services industries include the commercially tradable business, financial, and communications services, and education and health services, which are considered more nearly location-bound and closer to government functions. High-technology manufacturing industries include aircraft and spacecraft; pharmaceuticals; office, accounting, and computing machinery; radio, television, and communication equipment; and medical, precision, and optical instruments.\n18. Internal EU trade was subtracted from both the world and EU totals, because the unified EU market structure makes trade among its member states akin to trade among U.S. states.\n19. U.S. trade in advanced technology products shows a similar deficit path. These products, defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, include computer software, advanced materials, aerospace, biotechnology, electronics, flexible manufacturing, information/communications technology, life sciences, nuclear technology, optoelectronics, and weapons. However, data categorized in this fashion are unavailable for most other countries and differ from other trade data discussed earlier that are based on OECD definitions.\n20.

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nHighlights\n\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nInitial disparities in mathematics skills found in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1999 (ECLS\u00adK), tended to grow as these students progressed through grade 8.\n Kindergarten test scores, along with many demographic characteristics, were strong predictors of students' skills in 2007, after 9 years of schooling. Gaps generally grew through about grade 3 and thereafter remained stable, with some narrowing marginally.\n Science understanding was tested in grades 3, 5, and 8; gaps between more and less advantaged groups stayed about the same over these grades.\nScores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics test increased among younger students through 2008, continuing a steadily rising pattern since 1990.\n From 1990 to 2007, fourth graders gained 27 points and eighth graders gained 19 points (on a scale of 0\u00ad500 for both grades).\n These increases in performance were shared by boys and girls; white, black, and Hispanic students; and students from lower- and higher-income families.\n The score gaps in 1990 among racial/ethnic groups remained in 2007, but one gap shrank: black fourth graders gained enough points to narrow the gap with whites. Between 2000 and 2007, score differences decreased for six groups: between black and white students in both grades, Hispanic and white students in both grades, and low-income and higher-income students in both grades.\n The two younger age groups (9- and 13-year-olds) participating in NAEP Long-Term Trend tests in 2008 had higher average mathematics scores than their 1973 peers had, but performance among 17-year-olds was flat.\n Relatively large score increases among 9-year-olds occurred during the 1980s and early 2000s, while 13-yearolds had steadier (but less steep) gains over the 35 years. In each age group, black students narrowed the gaps with whites first observed in 1973.\nOn one recent international assessment, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS:2007), the scores of U.S. fourth and eighth graders were higher than in 1995 in mathematics but not in science.\n TIMSS exams closely follow the curriculums commonly taught in participating countries. U.S. students' 2007 average mathematics score was higher than their 1995 average score. The U.S. standing among selected comparison\n\ncountries also rose slightly, placing the United States near the median of selected nations in both grades.\n Scores at the 90th percentile provide information about high-achieving students (those who scored higher than 90% of all test takers). In both fourth and eighth grades, the U.S. 90th percentile scores in mathematics were also near the median of selected countries on this measure.\n Science results were mixed: the average 2007 science scores of U.S. fourth and eighth graders had not changed measurably from the 1995 average scores. However, the U.S. position among selected countries declined in fourth grade (two more nations outscored the United States and four fewer had lower scores in 2007) and increased slightly in eighth grade (where two fewer scored above and two more scored below the United States).\nOn another international test, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA:2006), U.S. 15-yearolds scored below most selected nations in 2006, and the U.S. standing among selected nations dropped below its 2000 rank in both mathematics and science. The U.S. PISA results in both subjects contrasted sharply with the U.S. TIMSS results, particularly in mathematics.\n PISA aims to test students' ability to apply what they have learned (e.g., explain answers in mathematical or scientific terms, use logical reasoning, synthesize information). Among 19 nations with data available for both years, the United States scored below 7 nations in mathematics in 2000 and below 15 nations in 2006.\n In 2006, the average mathematics score of U.S. students was lower than scores in 18 comparison nations (out of 24), and higher than those in 4 other countries--3 of them developing economies. The U.S. 90th percentile score in mathematics was similarly low relative to scores in other nations.\n Between 2000 and 2006, the number of countries scoring higher than the United States on the PISA science assessment rose from 6 to 12.\nTeachers of Mathematics and Science\nMost fifth and eighth grade students in public schools were taught mathematics and science by teachers with basic credentials such as a bachelor's degree and teaching certificate (but not necessarily in mathematics and science). Most students were also taught by teachers with more than 3 years of teaching experience.\n Virtually all fifth and eighth grade students in public schools were taught mathematics and science by teachers who had attained at least a bachelor's degree, and about half of them were taught these two subjects by teachers with a master's or higher degree. More than\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-5\n\n80% of students had teachers with a regular or advanced teaching certificate.\n Forty percent of fifth grade students in 2004 were taught mathematics and science by teachers with either a degree or certificate in their teaching field (i.e., in-field teachers). In contrast, 54% of fifth graders had teachers of mathematics and science with general education preparation. When these students reached eighth grade in 2007, 80% of them were taught mathematics and science by in-field teachers, and the percentage of students taught mathematics and science by teachers with general education preparation fell to 9%\u00ad10%.\n Eighty-two percent or more of fifth and eighth grade students in public schools had teachers with more than 3 years of teaching experience.\nAccess to better-qualified teachers of mathematics and science was not equally distributed among students.\n In 2004, black and Hispanic fifth grade students were less likely than white students to be taught mathematics by teachers with a master's or advanced degree (39% and 42% vs. 51%, respectively), a regular or advanced teaching certificate (86% and 85% vs. 92%), and more than 3 years of experience teaching grade 5 (48% and 58% vs. 68%).\n Also among fifth graders, a third of those in the lowest achievement quartile in grade 3 were taught mathematics by a teacher with a degree or certificate in math. In contrast, 42% of fifth graders in the top achievement quartile in grade 3 had such teachers.\n In 2007, eighth grade students whose mothers had not earned a high school diploma were less likely than those whose mothers had a bachelor's or higher degree to be taught science by teachers who had a master's or advanced degree (46% vs. 57%), a regular or advanced teaching certificate (79% vs. 87%), a degree or certificate in science (84% vs. 93%), and more than 3 years of experience teaching science (69% vs. 83%).\n Eighth grade students from families with low incomes were less likely than those from higher-income families to be taught science by teachers with a regular or advanced teaching certificate (79% vs. 86%), a degree or certificate in science (84% vs. 89%), and more than 3 years of experience in teaching science (69% vs. 79%).\n About 92% of eighth graders with high achievement in fifth grade were taught mathematics by a teacher with a degree or certificate in mathematics, compared with 77% of those with low fifth grade achievement.\nTeacher participation in professional development in mathematics and science at the elementary level was not as common as that at the middle and high school levels.\n While teacher participation in professional development during a school year was almost universal at public\n\nmiddle and high schools, in 2004, 47% of public school fifth grade students were taught science by teachers who reported no staff development in science, and 27% of students were taught mathematics by teachers who reported no staff development in mathematics.\n On average, teacher participants spent about 14 hours on staff development in mathematics and science during the entire school year.\n Roughly 40% of fifth grade students had teacher participants rating this activity as very useful.\nOver the past decade, teachers' pay increased little after adjusting for inflation. Teacher salaries continue to lag behind salaries in comparable professions, and the gaps have widened in recent years.\n In 2006\u00ad07, the average salary for all K\u00ad12 teachers was about $51,000. After adjusting for inflation, teacher salaries grew by 2.8% between 1996-97 and 2006-07.\n In 2006, full-time public school teachers earned 86% as much in weekly wages as did those in six occupations requiring comparable education and job skills: accountants, reporters, registered nurses, computer programmers, members of the clergy, and personnel officers. Between 1996 and 2006, the gap in weekly wages between fulltime teachers and those in these comparable occupations widened from $7 to $153 (in constant dollars).\nMost public school mathematics and science teachers had favorable perceptions of their working conditions. However, these positive perceptions were less widely held among teachers of disadvantaged and low-achieving students.\n A majority of public school teachers who taught mathematics and science to fifth and eighth grade students expressed positive views of their principal's leadership, their school's mission and spirit, the efforts of teachers to learn new ideas, the relationships among colleagues, and parental support. Relatively few of them reported student learning and behavioral problems.\n These positive perceptions, however, were less widely held among teachers of black and Hispanic students, lowachieving students, and students from low-income and less-educated families.\nInstructional Technology in Education\nAccess to the Internet in U.S. schools is nearly universal.\n In 2005, 94% of classrooms in U.S. public schools had computers with Internet access, and the ratio of students to instructional computers was 4:1.\nMost states have implemented standards for students' understanding of computer technology and teachers' use of technology for instruction.\n\n\f1-6 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\n All 50 states currently include computer technology in their curriculum standards as a subject in which students should receive instruction, and 46 include technology in their teaching standards.\nAn increasing number of students have access to and are enrolling in distance education opportunities, particularly online courses.\n Twenty-five states sponsored virtual schools as of 2007, and 57% of secondary schools nationwide provided some online learning opportunities to their students in 2005. Most state-led programs are at the high school level.\n During the 2004-05 school year, there were 506,950 student enrollments in online courses nationwide, up from 317,070 students in 2002-03, but little is known about course taking or achievement in science and math in particular.\nTransition to Higher Education\nMost Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries outperform the United States in terms of secondary school completion.\n In 2006, the United States ranked 17th among 23 OECD countries with data available on the rate of student secondary school completion.\nOn-time high school graduation rates have remained steady in the United States, and large gaps between racial/ethnic groups persist.\n The nationwide on-time graduation rate was 73% in 2006, and the on-time graduation rate for white students was approximately 20 percentage points higher than the rate for black and Hispanic students.\n\nStudent test taking in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics and science subjects has increased rapidly since 1990.\n The number of test takers increased in virtually all AP mathematics and science subjects in 2008. In some subjects, the number of test takers increased fivefold or more, although participants remain a small proportion of the high school population. Fifteen percent of the class of 2008 earned a score of 3 or higher on at least one AP test during high school.\n The number of students passing an AP exam is also increasing. Almost 250,000 students passed a mathematics AP exam in 2008, compared with just over 50,000 in 1990, and more than 200,000 passed a science AP exam in 2008, compared with fewer than 50,000 in 1990.\nAmong high school graduates in 2004, earning credits for advanced science and mathematics courses was linked to higher rates of postsecondary enrollment at 4-year colleges and lower rates of postsecondary remediation, confirming the results of earlier studies.\n Among students with two or more advanced mathematics or science credits, 88% and 90%, respectively, enrolled in a 4-year college within 2 years of high school graduation, compared with only 22% and 12% of students with no advanced credits.\n More than 40% of students whose highest mathematics course was less advanced than algebra II reported taking remedial mathematics at the postsecondary level, compared with 17% of students who had taken calculus.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-7\n\nIntroduction\nThis chapter describes both inputs and outcomes related to K\u00ad12 mathematics and science education in the United States. The first section focuses on student achievement, including student achievement growth over time and achievement gaps among groups of students. The second section focuses on a key determinant of student learning: teachers' qualifications and working conditions. It examines fifth and eighth grade teachers' education, licensure, and working conditions. New data permit analysis of how the characteristics of students and their teachers are related, providing greater context for understanding students' achievement. This section also presents data on teacher salaries and recent research comparing teacher salaries with the salaries of other workers.\nThe third section describes student access to instructional technology, including data on student access to the Internet and eighth graders' use of computers in mathematics and science classes. The section also reports on student participation in distance education, a subject new to this volume.\nThe fourth and final section describes students' transitions from secondary to postsecondary education--the subject of chapter 2 in this volume. The section begins with an update on high school graduation rates and a comparison of U.S. high school graduation rates with those in other countries. It next presents data on student participation in Advanced Placement (AP) examinations and addresses information on high school graduates' immediate enrollment\n\nin postsecondary education. New to this section are data on the relationship between students' high school coursetaking and achievement in mathematics and science and enrollment and remediation in postsecondary education.\nTable 1-1 presents an overview of the topics discussed in this chapter and the indicators used to illuminate and flesh out the concepts. Whenever a difference or change over time is cited in this chapter, it is statistically significant at the 0.05 probability level.1\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nOne of the central goals of educators and legislators is increasing overall student achievement, with a special focus on increasing learning by low performers. Concern also centers on advancing U.S. performance in relation to that of other countries, especially in mathematics, science, and technical fields. The most commonly used tools for measuring changes in achievement are standardized assessments. (The terms achievement and performance are used interchangeably in this section when discussing scores on these tests.)\nThis section is divided into two parts. The first examines trends in mathematics and science achievement among public and private school students in the United States, using two kinds of national data. Longitudinal data follow the same group of students over several years, allowing observers to track how individual students learn over time.

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\ncases, longitudinal test data may also be linked to teaching practices and other factors thought to influence achievement. New test data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998\u00ad99 (ECLS-K), collected in 2007, allow study of performance changes among a kindergarten cohort through eighth grade and of changes over time in initial achievement gaps among groups of students.\nCross-sectional data, in contrast to longitudinal data, provide information on particular groups' performance measured at different points in time. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data presented in the first section, for example, examine performance of fourth and eighth graders who were sampled in various years between 1990 and 2007. These data indicate whether and how achievement is changing over time for comparable groups of students.\nThe second part of this section compares student achievement in the United States with that in other countries. The latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS:2007) allows comparisons of U.S. fourth and eighth graders with their counterparts in other countries. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA:2006) provides test score data for 15-year-olds in the same subjects. These international assessments are both cross-sectional studies.\nStudents' Performance on National Assessments\nMathematics and Science Performance as Students Progress Through Elementary and Middle Grades\nECLS-K has followed a group of students who first entered kindergarten in fall 1998 over 9 school years. (The mathematics and science education of students who are homeschooled is not addressed in this chapter; see sidebar \"Homeschooling in the United States.\") The study concluded in spring 2007, when most students were in eighth grade.2 The sample used in this analysis included roughly 8,000 students. ECLS-K is unusual among major national and international data collections not only in its focus on the earlier years of schooling but also because it allows researchers to examine students' performance in light of variables likely to influence learning. Cognitive tests measured students' mathematics knowledge in kindergarten and grades 1, 3, 5, and 8 and tracked their science understanding in grades 3, 5, and 8. The study also collected demographic and family information from a parent and surveyed teachers and schools for information about school environments, teacher qualifications, and classroom practices.\nGains in Mathematics Test Scores and Gap Changes. Students begin kindergarten with differing levels of mathematics skills, and researchers have suggested several factors that may be related to these initial gaps. A body of research has focused in particular on initial gaps between white and black children. The early home environment, including how\n\nwell parents prepare children for school (e.g., time spent reading to them) plays a role (Magnuson, Rosenbaum, and Waldfogel 2008; Jencks and Phillips 1998). Other reasons posited include income and education differences among parents (Magnuson, Rosenbaum, and Waldfogel 2008; Campbell et al. 2008), school segregation (Vigdor and Ludwig 2008), access to effective and well-trained teachers (Corcoran and Evans 2008), ability to listen and concentrate, and children's fine motor skills, which need to reach a certain level of development for young children to learn to write and draw (Grissmer and Eiseman 2008).\nStudents' mathematics achievement was measured on a single scale ranging from 0 to 174 throughout the study, allowing the tracking of achievement growth and comparisons between groups as children progressed through elementary and middle grades. The 1998\u00ad99 kindergarten cohort started school with an average mathematics score of 26 and gained 113 points by the spring of eighth grade, to 139 (table 1-2).\nFor most characteristics, gaps widened during the early years of school (when the overall score changes were greater) and then stabilized or even narrowed slightly starting at grade 3 or 5, when the rate of overall growth also declined. Students' relative achievement when starting school had an influence on growth and eventual grade 8 scores, shown by the trajectories of those scoring in the lowest, middle two, and highest quartiles in kindergarten (figure 1-1). These varying growth patterns were in turn related to demographic characteristics. For example, the gap between kindergartners\nHomeschooling in the United States\nIn spring 2007, an estimated 1.5 million students ages 5\u00ad17 were homeschooled in the United States, accounting for about 3% of the K-12 student population at that time (Bielick 2008). Trends from 1999 to 2007 show a 74% increase in the number of homeschooled students over this 8-year period. Homeschooled students in these estimates are defined as those who are schooled at home for at least part of their education and whose enrollment in public or private school does not exceed 25 hours per week.\nThe decentralized nature of the homeschooled population limits researchers' ability to collect nationally representative data on these students' achievement and other outcomes. A growing number of families choose to homeschool their children, and many states are drafting and implementing regulations for homeschooling (Belfield 2004; Lines 2003; Lips and Feinberg 2008). Thus far, however, no national data allow researchers to examine homeschooled students' involvement with mathematics and science courses or to compare their achievement with that of students who attend public or private schools (Lips and Feinberg 2008).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-9\n\nTable 1-2 Average mathematics scores of students followed from kindergarten through grade 8, by student characteristics: Fall 1998\u00adspring 2007\n\nStudent characteristic\n\n>\u00ca\u00a3n] -\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4] -\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00d3] -\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{]\n\n`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\n\ngrade 1\n\ngrade 3\n\ngrade 5\n\n-\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7] grade 8\n\nAll students...................................................................\n\n26\n\n62\n\n99\n\n123\n\n139\n\nKindergarten mathematics score\n\n\u00dci\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci ......................................................\n\n17\n\n46\n\n78\n\n101\n\n120\n\n``i\u00ca\u00cc\u00dc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci\u00c3 ..............................................\n\n25\n\n61\n\n98\n\n123\n\n140\n\n}i\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci .....................................................\n\n38\n\n79\n\n123\n\n144\n\n157\n\n,>Vi\u00c9i\u00ccV\u00cc\u00de\n\nWhite .....................................................................\n\n29\n\n66\n\n106\n\n129\n\n145\n\n>V .....................................................................\n\n22\n\n52\n\n84\n\n105\n\n123\n\n\u00c3\u00ab>V ................................................................\n\n22\n\n56\n\n92\n\n118\n\n135\n\nAsian .....................................................................\n\n30\n\n65\n\n105\n\n133\n\n148\n\n\u00cci\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00cai`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca\u00ca\u00a3n\n\nLess than high school ...........................................\n\n20\n\n51\n\n82\n\n106\n\n123\n\n}\u00ca\u00c3V\u00ca`\u00ab> .............................................\n\n24\n\n58\n\n93\n\n116\n\n133\n\nSome college ........................................................\n\n26\n\n63\n\n101\n\n125\n\n142\n\n>Vi\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca}i\u00c0\u00ca`i}\u00c0ii ..................................\n\n32\n\n72\n\n114\n\n138\n\n154\n\n\"/\n-\\\u00ca>\u00cci>\u00ccV\u00c3\u00ca>\u00c3\u00c3i\u00c3\u00c3i\u00cc\u00ca\u00c3V>i\u00ca\u00c0>}i`\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00e4\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00a3\u00c7{\u00ca>V\u00c0\u00c3\u00c3\u00ca>\u00ca}\u00c0>`i\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca\u00c3\u00abV\u00cc\u00de]\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc\u00d5`i\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de\u00cav\u00dc\u00d5\u00ab\u00c3\u00ca \u00c0ivi\u00c0\u00c0i`\u00ca\u00cc\u00caL\u00de\u00ca`>\u00ca>`\u00cai\u00dd\u00abiV\u00cci`\u00ca}\u00c0>`i]\u00cai\u00b0}\u00b0]\u00cav\u00c0\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca}\u00c0>`i\u00c0\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00ca>\u00c3\u00c3i\u00c3\u00c3i\u00cc\u00b0\u00ca/\u00cc>\u00ca\u00c0\u00dc\u00caV\u00d5`i\u00c3\u00ca\u00cci\u00c0\u00ca\u00c0>Vi\u00c9i\u00ccV\u00cc\u00de]\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00c3\u00dc\u00ca\u00c3i\u00ab>\u00c0>\u00cci\u00de\u00b0\u00ca\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de]\u00ca`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\u00ca\n>\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00a3nq\u00ca\n-\u00ae]\u00cav>\u00ca\u00a3n\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4]\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00d3]\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{]\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-ii\u00ca>\u00ab\u00abi`\u00dd\u00ca\u00cc>Li\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nwhose mothers had no high school diploma versus a bachelor's or advanced degree was 12 points (20 versus 32) (figure 1-1; table 1-2). This initial gap in kindergarten grew to 32 points in third grade and then remained at about that level. In grade 8, children whose mothers had not finished high school reached a score of 123, roughly equivalent to the score in grade 5 of those whose mothers had some college.\nIn another example, white children scored 29 on the test given in the fall of their kindergarten year and Asians scored 30, compared with 22 for both black and Hispanic children. The gaps between white and black students and Hispanic and Asian students reached a certain point and then stabilized after grade 3.\nGaps based on a few characteristics narrowed a little in later grades: English proficiency in kindergarten, primary language spoken at home, and the white\u00adHispanic gap. See appendix table 1-2 for score gains by various grade ranges.\nProficiency in Different Skill Areas. The ECLS-K test data also indicate whether students were proficient in nine mathematics skill areas. (The skills are arranged in a hierarchy such that proficiency in a given area presumes proficiency in the areas below it. See sidebar \"Mathematics Skills Areas Assessed\" for definitions.) By eighth grade, nearly all students were proficient in ordinality and sequence, addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division (appendix table 1-3). Large majorities of eighth graders were also proficient in place value and rate and measurement (89% and 66%, respectively), which they had studied for several years. Only 37% of eighth graders overall were proficient in working with fractions, however, a skill area that the National\n\nMathematics Advisory Panel (2008) argues is essential for understanding even a first algebra course. Many states and districts are debating (and some now require) that all eighth graders take algebra (Loveless 2008).\nSubstantial differences among groups appeared in the three highest skill areas--rate and measurement, fractions, and area and volume--and differences grew as the difficulty level increased. For example, 63% of students whose mothers had a bachelor's degree were proficient in fractions, compared with 16% of students whose mothers had not completed high school (figure 1-2). The same pattern was found for proficiency in rate and measurement and area and volume.\nDifferences by initial math skills in kindergarten were also considerable for the highest skill area in which students had reached proficiency by eighth grade (table 1-3; appendix table 1-4). Kindergarten low achievers were far more likely than others to demonstrate no more than low-level skills. For example, 21% of low achievers' highest skill was multiplication and division, versus 0% for high achievers. Also, 39% percent of low achievers did not progress beyond proficiency with place value, compared with 7% of high achievers.\nSome early low achievers in kindergarten did reach proficiency in high skill areas, however: 24% achieved proficiency with rate and measurement, 7% with fractions, and 2% with area and volume, the highest skill area assessed. Thus, although most initial low-scoring students progressed relatively slowly, some managed to overcome obstacles they had at school entry.\nHigh mathematics scores in kindergarten were also strong predictors of proficiency with higher-level mathematical concepts in eighth grade. By grade 8, 37% of those who\n\n\f1-10 \n\nChapter 1.

ECLSK science assessments were given in grades 3, 5, and 8 and, as with mathematics, were measured on a single scale, in this case from 0 to 111. The average science score in grade 3 was 51 points, increasing to 83 by grade 8. In general, growth patterns were similar to those found with mathematics over these higher grades: few changes in gap size, and those changes that did occur were minimal (appendix table 1-5). Exceptions included some racial/ethnic differences. White students had the highest science scores in third and fifth grades, at 56 and 70, respectively, but by eighth grade Asians had closed that gap, with both groups scoring 88\u00ad89.\n\nMathematics Skills Areas Assessed\nECLS-K measures student proficiency at nine specific mathematics skill levels. These skill levels, which were identified based on frameworks from other national assessments and advice from a panel of education experts, represent a progression of mathematics skills and knowledge. Levels 6, 7, and 8 were first assessed in third grade, and level 9 was first assessed in fifth grade. By the fifth grade, levels 1 through 4 were not assessed. Each level is labeled by the most sophisticated skill in the set (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006; West, Denton, and Reaney L 2000):\n Level 1, Number and shape: Recognize single-digit numbers and shapes.\n Level 2, Relative size: Count beyond 10, recognize the sequence in basic patterns, and compare the relative size and dimensional relationship of objects.\n Level 3, Ordinality and sequence: Recognize twodigit numbers, identify the next number in a sequence, identify the ordinal position of an object, and solve simple word problems.\n Level 4, Add and subtract: Solve simple addition and subtraction items and identify relationships of numbers in sequence.\n Level 5, Multiply and divide: Perform basic multiplication and division and recognize more complex number patterns.\n Level 6, Place value: Demonstrate understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place.\n Level 7, Rate and measurement: Use knowledge of measurement and rate to solve word problems.\n Level 8, Fractions: Solve problems using fractions.\n Level 9, Area and volume: Solve problems using area and volume.\nEnglish language learners (assessed in kindergarten) demonstrated another exception: they were 20 points behind English-proficient students on the third grade science assessment but only 15 points behind in eighth grade.\nTrends in Mathematics and Science Performance in Grades 4 and 8 Through 2007\nNAEP includes two assessment programs. The national (or main) NAEP assesses national samples of 4th and 8th grade students at regular intervals and 12th grade students occasionally. These assessments are updated periodically to reflect contemporary standards of what students should know and be able to do in various subjects, including science and mathematics. Student achievement measured by NAEP is documented in an ongoing series of reports, The Nation's\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-11\n\nReport Card, that first began in 1969. A second testing program, the NAEP Long-Term Trend (LTT), is based on nationally representative samples of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. The mathematics content framework for NAEP LTT has remained the same since it was first given in 1973, permitting analyses of trends over more than three decades.\nThis section briefly summarizes NAEP science trends-- reported in detail in Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 (NSB 2008) and then focuses on the new mathematics score data for fourth and eighth graders in 2007 and on trends in these scores from 1990 to 2007. New data are neither available for 12th grade mathematics nor for science in any grade.3 The NAEP LTT scores in mathematics are also updated through 2008, for three age groups.\nNAEP rates students' performance in two ways: average scale scores and the percentage reaching various achievement\n\nlevels. Scale scores place students along a continuous scale based on their overall performance on the assessment. A single mathematics scale of 0 to 500 points covers both grades 4 and 8. See sidebar \"Development and Content of NAEP Mathematics Assessments\" for further information on the assessments' content and design. The NAEP website has a searchable database of released NAEP test items (http:// nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/itmrls).\nScience Performance. No new NAEP science data are available for any grade; a science assessment was conducted in early 2009 and data will be available in early 2010, too late for inclusion in this volume. As reported in Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 (NSB 2008), average NAEP science scores increased for 4th graders, held steady for 8th graders, and declined for 12th graders between\n\n-PN\\YL  ,PNO[O NYHKLYZ WYVMPJPLU[ PU ]HYPV\\Z TH[OLTH[PJZ ZRPSS HYLHZ I` TV[OLY\u00bbZ LK\\JH[PVU! :WYPUN \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n0UJYLHZPUN KPMMPJ\\S[`\n\n\n\n4V[OLY\u00bbZ LK\\JH[PVU PU  \n\n)HJOLSVY\u00bbZ VY OPNOLY KLNYLL\n\n:VTL JVSSLNL\n\n/PNO ZJOVVS KPWSVTH\n\n\n\n3LZZ [OHU OPNO ZJOVVS\n\n\n\n\n\n 4\\S[PWSPJH[PVU KP]PZPVU\n\n7SHJL ]HS\\L\n\n9H[L TLHZ\\YLTLU[\n\n-YHJ[PVUZ\n\n(YLH ]VS\\TL\n\n56;,! :RPSS HYLHZ HYL OPLYHYJOPJHS HUK Z[Y\\J[\\YLK ZV WYVMPJPLUJ` PU NP]LU HYLH HZZ\\TLZ WYVMPJPLUJ` PU HSS SV^LY HYLHZ :6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ ,HYS` *OPSKOVVK 3VUNP[\\KPUHS :[\\K` 2PUKLYNHY[LU *SHZZ VM  \u00b6  ZWYPUN \" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nTable 1-3 Highest mathematics skill area in which fall 1998 kindergarteners demonstrated proficiency in grade 8, by student characteristics: Spring 2007 *i\u00c0Vi\u00cc\u00ca`\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0L\u00d5\u00cc\u00ae\n\nStudent characteristic\n\n\"\u00c0`>\u00cc\u00de]\u00ca ``\u00cc]\u00ca \u00d5\u00cc\u00abV>\u00cc]\u00ca\n\n,>\u00cci]\u00ca\n\n\u00c3i\u00b5\u00d5iVi subtraction `\u00db\u00c3 *>Vi\u00ca\u00db>\u00d5i measurement \u00c0>V\u00cc\u00c3 \u00c0i>]\u00ca\u00db\u00d5i\n\nAll students........................................\n\n1\n\nKindergarten mathematics score\n\n\u00dci\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci ...........................\n\n2\n\n``i\u00ca\u00cc\u00dc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci\u00c3 ...................\n\n0\n\n}i\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci ..........................\n\n0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n5\n\n21\n\n1\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n24\n\n30\n\n39\n\n24\n\n26\n\n37\n\n7\n\n23\n\n20\n\n15\n\n7\n\n2\n\n21\n\n10\n\n33\n\n37\n\n\"/\n-\\\u00ca*i\u00c0Vi\u00cc>}i\u00c3\u00ca>\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca>``\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00a3\u00e4\u00e4\u00af\u00caLiV>\u00d5\u00c3i\u00cav\u00ca\u00c0\u00d5`}\u00b0\u00ca/\u00dc\u00ca\u00dci\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00c3\u00ca>\u00c0i>\u00c3\u00ca\u00cc\u00cci`\u00b0\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de]\u00ca`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\u00ca\n>\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00a3n\u00ca\n-\u00ae]\u00cav>\u00ca\u00a3n\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-ii\u00ca>\u00ab\u00abi`\u00dd\u00ca\u00cc>Li\u00ca\u00a3{\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\f1-12 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nDevelopment and Content of NAEP Mathematics Assessments\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessments use frameworks developed by educators, policymakers, assessment and curriculum experts, and skilled practitioners (e.g., mathematicians) in a consensus-oriented process. Frameworks define what students should know at a given grade level and provide a blueprint for the assessment (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007). Once developed, the frameworks are reviewed and approved by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). NAGB then defines three performance levels for each grade. The basic level indicates partial mastery of material appropriate for the grade level, proficient indicates solid academic performance, and advanced indicates superior performance. (Students in the basic category have scores at or above the minimum score for basic but lower than the minimum for proficient.) For more detailed definitions of the NAEP proficiency levels, see Science and Engineering Indicators 2006, pp. 1-13 and 1-14 (NSB 2006).\nAlthough experts have approved the NAEP tests as measuring achievement with sufficient accuracy (for example, see Daro et al. 2007), some have disagreed about whether the NAEP proficiency levels are appropriately defined. The National Mathematics Advisory Panel concluded in its 2008 study, \"On the basis of international performance data, there are indications that the NAEP cut scores for the two highest performance categories [the proficient and advanced levels] are set too high\" (NMP 2008). An earlier study commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the process used to set these levels was \"fundamentally flawed\" (Pellegrino, Jones, and Mitchell 1999). NAGB acknowledges the controversy surrounding the proficiency levels (Bourque and Byrd 2000) and warns data users to interpret findings related to these levels with caution (NCES 2006b). Some of the disagreement may stem from different understandings of the word proficient, as well as differing expectations about what students should be able to do at particular grade levels. (Mandated statewide achievement tests reflect a range of these expectations; see sidebar \"NAEP Contrasted With State Achievement Tests\" for more information.)\n\nNAEP Contrasted With State Achievement Tests\nProvisions in the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act require states to test students annually in mathematics, science, and English in grades 3\u00ad8 and once in high school. These test results, in particular the percentage of students reaching the proficient level, must be reported to the U.S. Department of Education, and schools must show adequate gains every year toward the goal of 100% of students reaching proficient. However, states are free to create their own tests and set the minimum score for proficient wherever they want. The incentives of these accountability systems may push policymakers to use easy tests, set the minimum proficient score low, or both (Cronin et al. 2007; Peterson and Hess 2008; Loveless 2006). The requirement for steady improvement encourages making the tests easier to pass over time, thus boosting apparent achievement. State standards vary widely in difficulty, content coverage, and the minimum scores set for reaching proficient. This variation has prevented making valid comparisons of student achievement across states using state test scores.\nTo address this problem, a recent study converted the proficient cutoff scores that states set for their own fourth and eighth grade mathematics tests to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scale (NCES 2007b). For example, for a state that rated 75% of its students proficient on the state's test, researchers assigned that state's \"NAEP-equivalent score\" as the NAEP score at the 75th percentile on NAEP's test for the same subject and grade level. After converting score data from all available states to this NAEP metric, the study found that, in most states, students who reached the proficient level on state tests had reached NAEP's basic level, and many states' average scores were below basic. In addition, the range of states' proficiency standards was 55 NAEP score points at grade 4 and 81 at grade 8. To put those ranges in context, they are roughly two to three times the difference between black and white students' scores on recent NAEP mathematics assessments.\nTo document progress in achievement for NCLB, a federal regulation issued in late 2008 (Title I--Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged, Final Rule (73 Fed. Reg. 64435 [2008]) adds another requirement: states must report their students' NAEP test scores along with state test results for the same grade and subject. These data will provide information for observers interested in state-by-state comparisons as well as the overall range of achievement across states.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n1996 and 2005 (NCES 2006a). Rising scores among lowerperforming and average fourth graders were the primary drivers of the increase. The proportion of students reaching the proficient level for their grade in science held steady at grades 4 and 8, and declined a bit at grade 12. Proficiency rates were lower among 12th graders than among students in the lower grades.\nMathematics Performance of Fourth and Eighth Graders. The upward achievement trends that occurred through 2005 on the NAEP fourth and eighth grade mathematics tests continued with the 2007 tests. Between 1990 and 2007, the average mathematics score for fourth graders rose from 213 to 240, and for eighth graders from 263 to 281 (appendix table 1-6).\nAt both grade levels, students' scores increased in each of the five content areas tested (number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and algebra and functions) (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007). Performance also improved across the achievement distribution in both grades, with scores at five selected percentiles of the score distribution (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th) all increasing consistently over these years (figure 1-3; appendix table 1-6). The scores of low-achieving fourth graders rose faster than the scores of others, reducing the gaps with high achievers (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007).\nAchievement trends for nearly all demographic groups reflected the same upward movement (table 1-4). In grades 4 and 8, both boys and girls increased their scores between 1990 and 2007. Students in both grades increased their scores between 2000 and 2007, regardless of whether they were eligible for the subsidized lunch program, an indicator of poverty.\nThe scores of fourth graders in each racial/ethnic group with 1990\u00ad2007 data available rose consistently over those 17 years. Black fourth graders had the largest score increase, at 34 points (figure 1-4; appendix table 1-6). Similarly, white, black, and Hispanic eighth graders scored consistently higher in mathematics. Asians/Pacific Islanders' performance remained level after 2005, and American Indians/ Alaska Natives showed no change between 2000 (the first year with data available) and 2007.\nNAEP 2009 results, released as this volume was going to press, show that the upward trend in fourth grade mathematics scores has halted, that mathematics scores of eighth graders have continued to improve, and that score gaps among racial/ethnic groups are unchanged (NCES 2009a).\nGaps in Mathematics Performance. In most years, boys had marginally higher mathematics scores than girls, and these gaps remained about equal over the 17-year period (appendix table 1-6) (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007). Among fourth graders, boys performed better than girls in four of the five mathematics content areas in 2007; girls scored higher only in geometry/spatial sense. Among eighth graders, boys\n\n 1-13\n\n-PN\\YL  5(,7 TH[OLTH[PJZ ZJVYLZ VM Z[\\KLU[Z PU NYHKLZ  HUK  H[ ]HYPV\\Z WLYJLU[PSLZ!  \u00b6\n\n:JVYL \n \n\n\n.YHKL \n[O WLYJLU[PSL [O WLYJLU[PSL [O WLYJLU[PSL [O WLYJLU[PSL [O WLYJLU[PSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n.YHKL  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n   \n\n5(,7 $ 5H[PVUHS (ZZLZZTLU[ VM ,K\\JH[PVUHS 7YVNYLZZ\n56;,:! :JVYLZ VU H \u00b6 ZJHSL HJYVZZ NYHKLZ  HUK  (JJVTTVKH[PVUZ MVY KPZHIPSP[PLZ VY SPTP[LK ,UNSPZO WYVMPJPLUJ` WLYTP[[LK VUS` PU [OL   HUK SH[LY HZZLZZTLU[Z\n:6<9*,! 3LL 1 .YPNN >: +PVU .: ;OL 5H[PVU\u00bbZ 9LWVY[ *HYK! 4H[OLTH[PJZ  5*,:    :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f1-14 \n\nChapter 1.

In geometry/spatial sense, boys and girls did not differ in performance.\nMost gaps among racial/ethnic groups that existed in 1990 remained in 2007, but some have narrowed, especially in recent years. The average score gap between white and black fourth graders decreased from 32 to 26 scale points between 1990 and 2007. Among eighth graders, the gap increased from 1990 to 2000 but then decreased from 2000 to 2007. Similarly, the gaps between white and Hispanic students in both grades narrowed from 2000 to 2007.\nScore gaps related to family income, as indicated by student eligibility for subsidized lunches, also shrank between 1996 (the first year available) and 2007, as well as between 2000 and 2007 for fourth graders. For eighth graders, the gap between low-income and other students was about the same in 1996 and 2007, with some fluctuations in between. It showed a decrease from 2000 to 2007.\nAchievement is also measured in a different way from the scale scores discussed above: the percentages of students scoring at or above the basic and proficient levels and\n\nreaching the advanced proficiency level set by the NAEP governing board. Students also improved steadily from 1990 to 2007 on this measure (figure 1-5; appendix table 1-7), with one exception: fourth graders in 2007 showed no change from 2005 in the percentage reaching the advanced level (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007).\nLong-Term Trends in Mathematics Performance. The NAEP Long-Term Trend assessment program has tested students ages 9, 13, and 17 in mathematics for more than three decades. LTT assessments differ from the main NAEP assessment, whose frameworks and tests are revised over time to follow changes in common curriculum at targeted grade levels, in that the LTT assessment for each grade level has tested the same knowledge and skills over time.4\nSince this testing program began, 9- and 13-year-olds raised their scores, while 17-year-olds' scores were essentially flat, with no difference between the first test score (304) in 1973 and the most recent (306) in 2008 (appendix table 1-8) (Rampey, Dion, and Donahue 2009). Among 9-year-olds, the average score increased 24 points, to 243 in 2008; among 13-year-olds, scores increased 15 points, to 281. The periods of achievement growth differed as well,\n\nTable 1-4 Changes in NAEP mathematics scores of students in grades 4 and 8, by student characteristics and other measures: 1990\u00ad2007 and 2000\u00ad07\n\nStudent characteristic\nAll students................................................................................... -i\u00dd Male ....................................................................................... i>i ................................................................................... ,>Vi\u00c9i\u00ccV\u00cc\u00de White ..................................................................................... >V ..................................................................................... \u00c3\u00ab>V ................................................................................ \u00c3>\u00c9*>VvV\u00ca\u00c3>`i\u00c0a ........................................................... i\u00c0V>\u00ca`>\u00c9>\u00c3>\u00ca >\u00cc\u00dbia ............................................ \u00c0ii\u00c9\u00c0i`\u00d5Vi`\u00ab\u00c0Vi\u00ca\u00d5Vb Eligible ...................................................................................

The gap between blacks and whites for 9-year-olds narrowed from 35 points in 1973 to 26 in 2008. For 13-year-olds, the gap decreased substantially, from 46 to 28 points. For both of the younger age groups, this narrowing occurred mainly through 1986; after that, both racial groups increased their scores at roughly similar rates. Among 17-year-olds, the 1973 gap between blacks and whites of 40 points decreased to 26 points in 2008, with the smallest gap appearing in 1990.\nHispanic students at all three ages gained more points over time than did whites on the mathematics assessments, particularly 13- and 17-year-olds. The score gaps with their white peers thus appeared to decrease, but none of those changes was significant, in part due to relatively small Hispanic sample sizes in some years.\nParents' educational attainment, a measure of socioeconomic status, was collected from 13- and 17-year-olds. At all levels of parental education, 13-year-olds' achievement increased over the 35 years, while 17-year-olds' performance improved only among students whose parents had not finished high school.\n\nFigure 1-5 :[\\KLU[Z TLL[PUN ]HYPV\\Z 5(,7 WYVMPJPLUJ` SL]LSZ PU TH[OLTH[PJZ NYHKLZ  HUK !  \u00b6\nPercent\n40\n\n35 Grade 4 proficient\n30\nGrade 8 proficient 25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n5\n0 1990 1992\n\nGrade 8 advanced\n\nGrade 4 advanced\n\n1996\n\n2000\n\n2003 2005 2007\n\nNOTE: Proficient includes advanced.

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nStudents' Performance on International Assessments of Mathematics and Science\nTwo recent assessments place U.S. student achievement in mathematics and science in an international context: the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Program for International Student Assessment. TIMSS and PISA differ in several fundamental ways; see sidebar \"Differences Between TIMSS and PISA Assessments.\" Reports on TIMSS and PISA test results typically compare U.S. performance with that of all participating countries or with that of all members of the Group of Eight (G-8) or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Gonzales et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009; Gonzales et al. 2004; Baldi et al. 2007). The differences in the characteristics of countries that participate in these two studies, however, confound comparisons between the United States' relative standing on the two assessments.\nThis section compares U.S. performance to that of a subset of nations that either have advanced economies that compete globally in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or have developing economies with rapidly growing capabilities in these areas.\n\nMost of the selected countries were included because of their current capabilities in science and technology. A few Asian countries that are seeking to develop such capacity were also included to highlight student performance in these highly dynamic countries. (This geographic focus is maintained where possible in the international sections of other chapters.) Not all of the 28 selected nations participated in each assessment, so the number available for comparison with the United States differs by test. Scores for all participating nations are shown in appendix tables.\nResults from the two assessments are contradictory: U.S. average scores on TIMSS tend to place the United States around the middle of the group of selected nations, and in mathematics, the United States improved over time. In contrast, U.S. scores on PISA were generally near the bottom of the group, and the U.S. standing relative to other nations declined in both mathematics and science. Some of these performance differences may be explained by the differences in the tests and which countries participate (see sidebars \"Differences Between TIMSS and PISA Assessments\" and \"Sample Items From TIMSS and PISA Assessments\").\n\nDifferences Between TIMSS and PISA Assessments\n\nSeveral primary differences in the design and purpose of these two assessments likely contribute to the differing U.S. results: age of students tested, test content, and participating nations.\nFirst, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) tests the mathematics and science achievement of students in grades 4 and 8, regardless of their age. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) assesses the performance of secondary school students by sampling 15-year-olds, who are nearing the age when compulsory schooling ends in many countries. The divergent international results shown here are consistent with differences by age in the main National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results: U.S. 12th graders have generally shown flat or even declining achievement over time, whereas younger students, particularly 4th graders, have demonstrated steadily rising scores (NSB 2008). Similar patterns from the NAEP Long-Term Trend assessment are described in \"Long-Term Trends in Mathematics Performance.\"\nA second difference between TIMSS and PISA is how closely they adhere to the mathematics and science curriculums used for instruction in various countries. TIMSS focuses on application of familiar skills and knowledge emphasized often in classrooms. (Content experts and teachers from various countries select elements of curriculums common to most participating nations.) The PISA tests, in contrast, emphasize students' abilities to apply skills and information learned in school (or from life\n\nexperiences) to solve problems or make decisions they may face at work or other circumstances. PISA test questions tend to deemphasize factual recall and demand more complex reasoning and problem-solving skills than those in TIMSS (Neidorf et al. 2006; Loveless 2009), requiring students to apply logic, synthesize information, and communicate solutions clearly. Curriculums and teaching methods may vary in their emphasis on these skills. (See sidebar \"Sample Items From TIMSS and PISA Assessments\" for examples of science test questions included on the two assessments.)\nA third main difference between the two assessments is the number of participating countries and their levels of economic development. Countries participating in TIMSS form a large and diverse group: some highly industrialized nations and many developing ones, the latter of which have been growing in number over time. In contrast, nearly all countries that participated in PISA were members of OECD and thus are economically advanced nations. The international comparisons here were limited to nations that are current or likely potential competitors with the United States in scientific and technical fields, however. This restriction increased the overlap between nations taking both tests and excluded nearly all developing nations from these analyses. Restricting to this group of selected nations prevents the increasing number of developing countries from artificially inflating the United States' standing relative to other nations over time, particularly in TIMSS.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-17\n\nSample Items from TIMSS and PISA Assessments\n\nSample Science Items from Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Tests (for Eighth Graders)\n1) Food and oxygen are produced during photosynthesis in green plants.

The statues are made of a type of rock called marble. Marble is composed of calcium carbonate. In 1980, the original statues were transferred inside the museum of the Acropolis and were replaced by replicas. The original statues were being eaten away by acid rain.\n\n1b) The effect of acid rain on marble can be modeled by placing chips of marble in vinegar overnight. Vinegar and acid rain have about the same acidity level. When a marble chip is placed in vinegar, bubbles of gas form. The mass of the dry marble chip can be found before and after the experiment. A marble chip has a mass of 2.0 grams before being immersed in vinegar overnight. The chip is removed and dried the next day.\nWhat will the mass of the dried marble chip be? A. Less than 2.0 grams B. Exactly 2.0 grams C. Between 2.0 and 2.4 grams D. More than 2.4 grams Correct answer: A Difficulty level: 460\n1c) Students who did this experiment also placed marble chips in pure (distilled) water overnight. Explain why the students included this step in their experiment.\nCorrect Answer: For full credit, students needed to explain that the acid in vinegar dissolves some of the marble just like acid in acid rain does, and that distilled water does not dissolve marble because it's much less acidic (the water test is a control).\nDifficulty level: 717 for full-credit answers, 513 for partial credit\nAdditional sample questions: http://www.pisa.oecd. org/dataoecd/13/33/38709385.pdf (for science) and http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/10/38709418.pdf (for mathematics).\nSources: Gonzales et al. 2008; OECD 2007.\n\n\f1-18 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nMathematics Performance of U.S. Fourth and Eighth Graders on TIMSS\nThe fourth grade TIMSS mathematics exam covers three content areas: number, geometric shapes and measures, and data display. The eighth grade assessment addresses four content domains: number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance.\nPerformance Trends. Over the 12 years since the first TIMSS mathematics assessments in 1995, U.S. fourth and eighth graders raised their scores and international ranking (Gonzales et al. 2008). The fourth grade average of 529 in 2007 was 11 points higher than in 1995. For eighth graders, the U.S. average of 508 in 2007 reflected a 16-point rise over 1995's score (figure 1-6).

Students from eight of the selected nations outscored U.S. eighth graders in 1995, compared with four in 2007.\nPerformance on the 2007 TIMSS Mathematics Tests. The fourth grade tests focused on three content domains: number, geometric shapes and measures, and data display (about half the assessment emphasized the number domain, including introductory algebra). For eighth grade, the four content domains were number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance. The cognitive domains addressed in TIMSS are the same for both grades--knowing, applying, and reasoning.\nU.S. fourth graders' average score on the 2007 TIMSS mathematics assessment (529) was just below the combined average for 14 selected nations (534) (table 1-5). (Results for all participating nations are available in appendix table 1-9.) When those 14 jurisdictions are compared with the United States, 6 scored higher, 6 scored lower, and 2 did not differ, placing the United States near the middle of the distribution. The top scorers--Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Japan--each had average scores above 550.\n\nThe U.S. eighth grade average mathematics score of 508 was also below the combined average (514) for 16 selected nations and below 5 nations' individual averages (table 1-5). The United States scored higher than 7 nations, putting it just above the middle among these 16 nations. The average score of students in Chinese Taipei (the leader) was 90 points higher than U.S. eighth graders' average.\nAlthough U.S. students as a whole did not lead the world in TIMSS mathematics, two U.S. states that participated individually (Massachusetts and Minnesota) provide examples of high performance (see sidebar \"Two States' Performance on TIMSS: 2007\"). Scores at the 90th percentile present another way to examine high-achieving students (those who scored higher than 90% of all test takers). In mathematics, the 90th percentile score for U.S. fourth graders was 625, lower than that of six other nations (table 1-6). U.S. fourth graders scored higher than six nations on this measure, and so were at the middle. Similarly, the 90th percentile score for U.S. eighth graders was 607, lower than the corresponding scores for six countries but higher than that of six others. For eighth graders, the 90th percentile score gap with top scorers Chinese Taipei and the Republic of Korea was more than 100 scale points.\n\nTable 1-5 Average TIMSS mathematics scores of students in

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nTwo States' Performance on TIMSS: 2007\n\nMassachusetts and Minnesota participated in a special benchmarking study included in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007, along with three Canadian provinces, the city of Dubai, and one region of Spain. Results for these entities were compared with those for all participating nations. These two states, particularly Massachusetts, are among the higher-scoring states on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), and thus provide some insight into how some of the best students in the United States compare with their competitors in other nations.\nIn mathematics, Massachusetts fourth graders scored 572, far above the scale average of 500, and in third place after only two jurisdictions, Hong Kong and Singapore (Mullis et al. 2008). Massachusetts' average score was equivalent to scores in Chinese Taipei and Japan. Minnesota scored slightly lower (554), below only four Asian leaders\n\nand on par with Kazakhstan, England, and the Russian Federation. At grade 8, both U.S. states (at 547 and 532, respectively) scored below the five leading Asian nations but above all other participants, including European nations.\nIn fourth grade science, Massachusetts ranked second with its score of 571, after only Singapore (Martin et al. 2008). Minnesota also performed well (551), bested only by Massachusetts and Singapore and scoring on par with eight jurisdictions (including the United States overall) but above all the rest. Massachusetts eighth graders' science score (556) was similar to the four leading Asian economies' scores (Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Republic of Korea) and higher than scores from all other participants. At grade 8, Minnesota (at 539) was outscored by the four top Asian countries but performed similarly to a group that included Hong Kong and several high-scoring European nations.\n\nTable 1-6 TIMSS

In contrast to the mathematics trends, which showed improvement in both grades, the average scores of U.S. students on the TIMSS science assessment have remained flat since 1995. Fourth graders have lost ground internationally, whereas eighth graders slightly improved their position relative to other nations (Gonzales et al. 2008). At fourth grade, the United States outperformed six of seven selected nations in 1995 but only two of them in 2007. In addition, the single comparison nation that did better than the United States in 1995 (Japan) was joined by Singapore and Hong Kong in 2007.\nThe trend in U.S. standing of eighth graders was slightly upward: nations scoring higher than the United States on the science assessment dropped from eight in 1995 to six in 2007. In addition, the United States had not outperformed any of the 10 other nations in 1995 but outscored 2 of them in 2007 (Sweden and Norway).\n\nPerformance on the 2007 TIMSS Science Tests. The fourth grade science tests focused on three content areas: life, physical, and earth sciences; and on three main skills: knowing, applying, and reasoning. At eighth grade, content areas expanded to four: biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences. The cognitive domains underlying test development were the same for both grades: knowing, applying, and reasoning. The fourth grade tests emphasize knowing more than the eighth grade tests, while reasoning is a greater focus in eighth grade.\nOn the 2007 TIMSS science test for fourth graders, four of the comparison nations scored higher and six scored lower than the United States, putting the United States just above the middle of the group (table 1-7). (Results for all participating nations are presented in appendix table 1-10.) The four economies that outperformed the United States in fourth grade science also had the highest scores on most TIMSS tests: Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, and Japan. U.S. eighth graders' average science score of 520 was lower than that of eight nations, higher than that of six, and\n\nTable 1-7 Average TIMSS science scores of students in grades 4 and 8 in selected

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nequivalent to the remaining two--in other words, slightly below the middle (table 1-7).\nThe U.S. 90th percentile score for fourth graders was 643, ranking lower than in 2 other nations and higher than in 8, or above the midpoint for these 15 nations (Gonzales et al. 2008). The difference between Singapore (whose fourth graders led all countries) and the United States at the 90th percentile was 58 points. In eighth grade, U.S. students at the 90th percentile in science scored roughly in the middle of the group--lower than in six other nations and higher than in five. See sidebar \"Linking NAEP and TIMSS Results.\"\nMathematics Performance of U.S. 15-Year-Olds: PISA\nPerformance Trends. In contrast to the TIMSS results, U.S. 15-year-olds' performance consistently dropped on the PISA tests of mathematical and scientific literacy in relation to student performance in other nations. The U.S. mathematics average of 474 in 2006 is 19 points lower than in 2000, when the first PISA exams were given, but changes in the tests mean that the scores cannot be directly compared (OECD 2001; Baldi et al. 2007). While the United States scored below 7 nations in 2000, it scored below 15 nations in 2006 (of 19 nations with data available for both years).\nLinking NAEP and TIMSS Results\nTo compare the performance of other countries' students with the achievement standards set for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a series of studies has used various statistical methods to project the results of one assessment into the scale of the other (Beaton and Gonzales 1993; Johnson and Siegendorf 1998; Johnson et al. 2005; Pashley and Phillips 1993). In the most recent of these studies (Phillips 2007), scores from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) eighth grade mathematics and science assessments in 1999 and 2003 were translated into the 2000 NAEP eighth grade performance levels using data from a sample of students who participated in both the 1999 TIMSS and 2000 NAEP assessments.\nNAEP results have long demonstrated that a minority of U.S. students reaches the proficient level of performance as defined in NAEP. The linked TIMSS data for both years were not only consistent with this finding in both mathematics and science, but showed that few countries' students met the standard for achievement set by NAEP's proficient criterion. In math, six countries had an average score that met this criterion in 1999, and five countries did so in 2003. In science, two countries' average scores fell within the proficient level in each year.\n\nPerformance on the 2006 PISA Mathematics Test. PISA assesses 15-year-old students in all OECD nations and a range of other nations every 3 years on literacy in mathematics, science, and reading. The mathematics test covers four content areas: space and shape, change and relationships, quantity, and uncertainty. A main mathematics skill tested is problem solving (explored in greatest depth in 2003, when math was PISA's main focus). Sj\u00f8berg (2007) and Goldstein (2004) discuss PISA's content, including challenges and critiques.\nOn the most recent PISA tests, the U.S. score was 474, below 18 of the selected nations' scores (table 1-8). Students in the United States demonstrated higher mathematical literacy than students in only four other countries (Italy, Thailand, Indonesia, and Brazil).\nThe U.S. score at the 90th percentile in mathematics was 593, lower than that in 18 other nations that participated in the PISA exam and higher than in another 3 nations (Thailand, Indonesia, and Brazil) (Baldi et al. 2007). None of the OECD member nations had a lower 90th percentile score than the United States.\nScience Performance of U.S. 15-Year-Olds: PISA\nPerformance Trends. The U.S. rank among selected nations declined on the PISA scientific literacy test, as on the mathematics assessment. In 2000, the United States scored below 6 other selected nations (out of 19 participating in both years), but in 2006, that number doubled to 12 (figure 1-8).6\nPerformance on the 2006 PISA Science Test. To measure scientific literacy, PISA includes three skill areas: identifying and understanding scientific issues, explaining phenomena scientifically, and using scientific evidence. Students were tested on their grasp of essential scientific concepts and theories in four content areas: physical systems, living systems, earth and space systems, and technology systems. Test items probed whether students understood how scientists obtain evidence (scientific means of inquiry) and how scientists use data. The test scores range from 1 to 1,000, and the mean for the 2006 science test was set at 500. The score scale is divided into six distinct proficiency levels that measure competence in science concepts and reasoning; each proficiency level encompasses roughly 75 points (OECD 2007). To put score differences in context, the average gain from one grade to the next was 38 points, or roughly half a full proficiency level. (This one-grade gain was measured using data from nations with sufficient numbers of 15-year-olds in two consecutive grades.)\nThe science literacy performance of U.S. 15-year-olds in 2006 placed the United States below 15 of 24 other nations and above 4, far below the midpoint (table 1-8; all participating nations' results are available in appendix table 1-11). The U.S. score of 489 fell behind Finland's (the leading nation) by 74 points.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-23\n\nTable 1-8 Average PISA mathematics and science literacy scores

in scientific literacy was 628, below the corresponding score in 10 of the 24 nations with data, but above it in 9, putting U.S. top-scoring students just below the middle of the 90th percentile science score distribution for these selected nations. Thus, U.S. high achievers in science placed in a better position relative to other countries than did U.S. students on average.\nTeachers of Mathematics and Science\nAmong the many factors that influence student learning, teacher quality is believed to be one of the most crucial. Studies have found that various aspects of teachers and teaching make a significant difference in student performance (Boyd et al. 2008; Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2007;\n\nCroninger et al. 2003; Darling-Hammond et al. 2005; Goe 2008; Guarino et al. 2006; Hanushek et al. 2005; Harris and Sass 2007; Nye, Konstantopoulos, and Hedges 2004; Wayne and Youngs 2003; Xue and Meisels 2004). To ensure that all classrooms are led by teachers who are effective in promoting student learning, the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 mandates that schools and districts hire only \"highly qualified\" teachers, defining \"highly qualified\" in terms of state certification (excluding emergency, provisional, or temporary licenses),7 a minimum of a bachelor's degree, and demonstrated subject area competence.8\nThis section examines indicators of teacher preparedness, experience, professional development, salaries, and working conditions.

When the cohort was in grades 5 and 8 (in 2004 and 2007, respectively), ECLS-K collected data from their teachers in each of the core academic subjects (i.e., reading/language arts, mathematics, and science), allowing researchers to distinguish teachers who taught mathematics and science from all other teachers.10 Because the teacher information in ECLS-K was linked to the sampled students, the data enable analysis of whether students from different backgrounds and with different levels of prior achievement had equal access to high-quality and experienced teachers in their fifth and eighth grade mathematics and science classrooms. When possible, comparable data from the 2008 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators are either cited or included as complementary information about teachers of mathematics and science at the middle school and high school levels.\n\nTeacher Quality\nResearchers have often relied on indicators such as test scores (e.g., Praxis; see Gitomer 2007), education credentials, professional certifications, and teaching experience as proxies for teacher quality (Darling-Hammond 2000; Wayne and Youngs 2003). These indicators are relatively easy to measure and can be readily used to screen prospective candidates. They also align with the requirements for highly qualified teachers specified in NCLB. The following analysis examines the quality of mathematics and science teachers by focusing on the educational attainment, certification status, subject area preparation, and years of teaching experience of those who taught mathematics and science in public schools to fifth graders in 2004 and eighth graders in 2007.\nTeacher quality is not limited to the characteristics examined here, however; it may include other important elements that are difficult or costly to measure, such as teachers' abilities to motivate students, manage the classroom, maximize instruction time, and diagnose and overcome students' learning difficulties. Current research on \"teacher quality\" is designed to yield measurable characteristics of teachers that are associated with student learning (Angrist and Guryan 2008; Boyd et al. 2008; Hill, Rowan, and Ball 2005; Goe 2008). This work is beginning and is expected to yield measures of teacher quality more directly related to student achievement than are the indicators examined here.\nFormal Preparation Teachers acquire a significant amount of subject knowl-\nedge and teaching skills through formal education and certification. Thus, teachers' level of educational attainment and type of professional certification provide some indication of how well teachers are prepared for their work.11 Data on teachers' highest degree and certification status (regardless of the field in which the degree/certification was held) indicate that virtually all of them had at least a bachelor's degree. Nearly half also had a master's or higher degree, and a majority held a regular or advanced teaching certificate (NSB 2008).\nSimilar patterns are observed when the analysis focuses on how many students are taught mathematics and science by teachers with various levels of educational attainment and types of certification. For example, almost all public school fifth grade students in 2004 and eighth grade students in 2007 were taught mathematics and science by teachers who had attained a bachelor's or higher degree (regardless of the field in which the degree was earned), and about half of them were taught these two subjects by teachers with a master's or higher degree (appendix table 1-12). Furthermore, the majority of fifth and eighth grade students (90% and 84%, respectively) had teachers of mathematics and science with a regular or advanced teaching certificate (regardless of the field in which the certification was awarded).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-25\n\nSubject Area Preparation Adequate subject matter knowledge and skills are critical\nfor teachers to teach their subjects well (The Education Trust 2008; Goe 2008; Ingersoll 2003). NCLB mandates that all students be taught by teachers who not only are fully certified and possess at least a bachelor's degree, but also demonstrate competence in subject knowledge and teaching. In its 2007 policy recommendations regarding STEM education, the National Science Board (NSB) emphasized that STEM teachers should receive adequate STEM content knowledge that is aligned with what they are expected to teach (NSB 2007). Similarly, a report from the National Research Council of the National Academies (2007) advocated that teacher preparation and professional development programs focus on boosting teachers' knowledge of science, how students learn the subject, and methods and technologies that aid science learning for all. However, neither NCLB nor these reports' policy recommendations provide specific guidance or criteria regarding \"adequate\" preparation to teach mathematics and science at various grade levels.\nWhile most states require those who teach mathematics and science at the high school level to have a degree or certification in their subject area, state laws and regulations regarding preparation of middle school teachers (eighth grade teachers fall in this group) vary, with some states allowing general education preparation and others requiring subject area preparation. As for elementary school teachers, who typically teach multiple subjects, most state policies consider teachers with a degree or certification in general elementary education to be \"qualified\" to teach elementary school mathematics and science (and other subjects), although some question whether elementary school teachers with general education preparation have sufficiently rigorous preparation for teaching mathematics and science (Greenberg and Walsh 2008).\nRecent research efforts have focused on matching teachers' formal preparation (as indicated by degree major and certification field) with their teaching field to determine whether teachers have subject-specific preparation for the fields they teach (McGrath, Holt, and Seastrom 2005; Morton et al. 2008). Following this line of research, four levels of teachers' formal preparation for teaching mathematics and science at fifth and eighth grade levels were distinguished. In order of decreasing rigor of preparation, they are as follows:\n In-field: Teachers who taught mathematics and had a degree and/or certificate in mathematics or mathematics education. Teachers who taught science and had a degree major and/or certificate in science or science education.\n Related-field: Teachers who taught mathematics and had a degree and/or certificate in a field related to their teaching field (such as science, science education, computer sciences). This category is omitted for teachers of science in ECLS-K because these teachers were not asked about their degrees or certificates in specific science fields such as physics, chemistry, or biology.\n\n General education: Teachers who taught mathematics or science and had a degree and/or certificate in general elementary or secondary education. Such teachers usually undergo some pedagogical training in mathematics and science.\n Other: Teachers who taught mathematics or science but did not have a degree or certificate in their teaching field, a related field, or general elementary or secondary education.\nIn-field teaching in mathematics and science was less prevalent at lower grade levels than at higher grade levels. For example, in 2004, about 40% of fifth grade students in public schools were taught mathematics and science by infield teachers (table 1-9; appendix table 1-13). Most students at this level (54%) had teachers with general education preparation. When students reached eighth grade in 2007, more than 80% of them had in-field teachers in their mathematics and science classes, and 9\u00ad10% were taught mathematics and science by teachers with general education preparation.\nSimilar patterns were also revealed using the teacher data from the 2003\u00ad04 and 2007\u00ad08 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).12 In 2003, 53% of teachers of mathematics and 67% of teachers of science in public middle schools were teaching in field (table 1-10).13 Partly reflecting the impact of NCLB on teacher qualifications, in-field mathematics teachers in public middle school increased to 64% in 2007, representing a significant 11 percentage point increase from 2003. Seventy percent of teachers of science in public middle schools were teaching in field in 2007, but this does not represent a significant increase from the 67% in 2003. In both years, between 27% and 38% of middle school teachers were teaching mathematics and science with general education preparation.\nMoving up to the high school level, in-field teaching became more common. For example, in-field teaching in 2007 ranged from 82% of teachers of physical sciences and 88% of teachers of mathematics to 93% of teachers of biology/ life sciences. The share of teachers with general education preparation declined to 3% or lower. Similar percentage ranges also were found among public high school mathematics and science teachers in 2003.\nTeaching Experience Experienced teachers are, generally, more effective\nthan novices in helping students learn (Boyd et al. 2006; Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2007; Hanushek et al. 2005; Harris and Sass 2008; Rice 2003; Rockoff 2004; Rowan, Correnti, and Miller 2002; Wayne and Youngs 2003). Overall, teachers with more than 3 years of teaching experience make up a large majority of the mathematics and science teaching force in public schools (NSB 2008; NCES 2007a). Likewise, between 82% and 88% of public school fifth and eighth grade students in 2004 and 2007 were taught mathematics and science by teachers with more than 3 years of teaching experience (appendix table 1-14). The majority of these students had teachers with 3 or more years of experience in the specific grade level or subject\n\n\f1-26 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nmatter in question: 63%-65% of fifth grade students were taught mathematics and science by teachers with more than 3 years of experience in teaching fifth grade classes, and 76%-78% of eighth grade students had science and mathematics teachers who had taught their respective subject for more than 3 years.\nDifferences in Student Access to Qualified Teachers in Science and Mathematics\nAccess to better-qualified teachers was not equally distributed among students. In general, black and Hispanic students, students from less-educated and low-income families, and students with low levels of prior achievement had less access to teachers who were highly educated, fully certified, and had more experience and better preparation in the\n\nsubject field than their counterparts (appendix tables 1-12, 1-13, and 1-14). For example, fifth grade black and Hispanic students were less likely than their white peers to be taught mathematics by teachers with a master's or advanced degree (39% and 42% vs. 51%, respectively), a regular or advanced teaching certificate (86% and 85% vs. 92%), and more than 3 years of experience in teaching the fifth grade (48% and 58% vs. 68%) (table 1-11). Students living in low-income families were less likely than their peers from higher-income families to be taught mathematics by teachers with a master's or advanced degree (35% vs. 50%, respectively). Also among fifth graders, a third of those in the lowest achievement quartile in grade 3 were taught mathematics by in-field teachers. In contrast, 41% of fifth graders in the top achievement quartile in grade 3 had such teachers.\n\nTable 1-9 Public school students in grades 5 and 8 taught mathematics and science by teachers with various levels of subject area preparation: 2004 and 2007 *i\u00c0Vi\u00cc\u00ca`\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0L\u00d5\u00cc\u00ae\n\n\u00c0>`i\u00c9vi`\n\n\u00cai\u00dbi\u00c3\n\n\u00cavi`\n\n,i>\u00cci`\u00cavi` General education\n\nOther\n\n\u00c0>`i\u00cax\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{\u00ae\n\nMathematics ..................................................\n\n100\n\n38\n\n4\n\n54\n\n4\n\nScience ..........................................................\n\n100\n\n43\n\nna\n\n54\n\n3\n\n\u00c0>`i\u00can\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00ae\n\nMathematics ..................................................\n\n100\n\n85\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\nScience ..........................................................\n\n100\n\n88\n\nna\n\n9\n\n3\n\nna = not applicable\n\n\"/\n\\\u00ca*i\u00c0Vi\u00cc>}i\u00c3\u00ca>\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca>``\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00a3\u00e4\u00e4\u00af\u00caLiV>\u00d5\u00c3i\u00cav\u00ca\u00c0\u00d5`}\u00b0\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de]\u00ca`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\u00ca\n>\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00a3nq]\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{]\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca -ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-ii\u00ca>\u00ab\u00abi`\u00dd\u00ca\u00cc>Li\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3\u00ce\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 1-10 Public middle and high school teachers of mathematics and science with various levels of subject area preparation: 2003 and 2007 *i\u00c0Vi\u00cc\u00ca`\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0L\u00d5\u00cc\u00ae\n\n-V\u00cai\u00dbi\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00cci>V}\u00cawi`\n\n\u00cai\u00dbi\u00c3\n\n\u00cawi`\n\n2003 Related General\nwi` education Other\n\n\u00cawi`\n\n2007 Related General\nwi` education Other\n\nMiddle school\n\nMathematics ...................................... 100\n\n53\n\n4\n\n38\n\n5\n\n64\n\n2\n\n31\n\n3\n\nScience .............................................. 100\n\n67\n\nna\n\n29\n\n4\n\n70\n\nna\n\n27\n\n3\n\n}\u00ca\u00c3V\n\nMathematics ...................................... 100\n\n87\n\n2\n\n3\n\n7\n\n88\n\n1\n\n3\n\n7\n\n}\u00de\u00c9vi\u00ca\u00c3ViVi\u00c3 .......................... 100\n\n92\n\n4\n\n1\n\n3\n\n93\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n*\u00de\u00c3V>\u00ca\u00c3ViVi\u00c3 .............................. 100\n\n78\n\n20\n\n1\n\n1\n\n82\n\n15\n\n1\n\n2\n\nna = not applicable\n\n\"/\n\\\u00ca*i\u00c0Vi\u00cc>}i\u00c3\u00ca>\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca>``\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00a3\u00e4\u00e4\u00af\u00caLiV>\u00d5\u00c3i\u00cav\u00ca\u00c0\u00d5`}\u00b0\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca-V\u00c3\u00ca>`\u00ca-\u00cc>vv}\u00ca-\u00d5\u00c0\u00dbi\u00de]\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00ceq\u00e4{\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7q\u00e4n\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca -ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\u00c3\u00abiV>\u00ca\u00cc>L\u00d5>\u00cc\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-27\n\nIn eighth grade, students whose mothers had not earned a high school diploma were less likely than those whose mothers had a bachelor's or higher degree to be taught science by teachers who had a master's or advanced degree (46% vs. 57%, respectively), a regular or advanced teaching certificate (79% vs. 87%), an in-field degree or certificate (84% vs. 93%), and more than 3 years of experience in teaching science (69% vs. 83%) (appendix tables 1-12, 1-13, and 1-14). Differences existed when looking at family income as well: eighth grade students from families with incomes below the poverty threshold were less likely than those from higher-income families to be taught science by teachers with a regular or advanced teaching certificate (79% vs. 86%, respectively), an in-field degree or certificate (84% vs. 89%), and more than 3 years of experience in teaching science (69% vs. 79%). In addition, 92% of students with high achievement in fifth grade were taught mathematics by infield teachers, compared with 76% of those with low fifthgrade achievement who had such teachers.\nProfessional Development\nTeachers rely on professional development to update their knowledge, sharpen their skills, and acquire new teaching techniques, all of which may enhance the quality of teaching and learning (Richardson and Placier 2001; Davis, Petish,\n\nand Smithey 2006). During the past decade, researchers have put significant effort into identifying features of high-quality professional development programs (Banilower et al. 2006; CCSSO 2008; Clewell et al. 2004; Desimone et al. 2002; Garet et al. 2001; Hawley and Valli 2001; Harris and Sass 2007; Heck, Rosenberg, and Crawford 2006; Penuel et al. 2007; Porter et al. 2000). They have come to general agreement that professional development is most effective if it\n Focuses on subject content\n Provides an intensive and sustained approach\n Is presented in a format of teacher network, study group, mentoring, and coaching as opposed to a traditional workshop or conference\n Is connected or related to teachers' daily work\n Emphasizes a team approach and collaboration\n Provides opportunities for active learning\nWhen professional development is conducted in these ways, teachers are more likely to change their instructional practice, gain greater subject-matter knowledge, and improve their teaching (see, for example, the sidebar \"Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement Program\"). Consequently, there is increased potential for the professional development to have an effect on student achievement (Correnti 2007; DarlingHammond and Youngs 2002; Wenglinsky 2002).\n\nTable 1-11 Public school students in grade 5 who were taught mathematics by teachers with various qualifications, by student characteristics: 2004 *i\u00c0Vi\u00cc\u00ae\n\nStudent characteristic\n\n>\u00c3\u00cci\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca higher degree\n\n\fi}\u00c0ii\u00ca\u00c0\u00caVi\u00c0\u00ccvV>\u00cci\u00ca\n\n,i}\u00d5>\u00c0\u00c9>`\u00db>Vi`\u00ca in mathematics More than 3 years\n\nVi\u00c0\u00ccvV>\u00cci\n\n\u00cavi`\u00ae\n\nin teaching grade 5\n\nAll students.............................................................\n\n47\n\n90\n\n38\n\n63\n\n,>Vi\u00c9i\u00ccV\u00cc\u00de\u00ca\n\n7\u00cci]\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab>V ........................................\n\n51\n\n92\n\n39\n\n68\n\n>V]\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab>V ........................................\n\n39\n\n86\n\n33\n\n48\n\n\u00c3\u00ab>V ..........................................................\n\n42\n\n85\n\n39\n\n58\n\n\u00cci\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00cai`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca\n\nLess than high school .....................................\n\n34\n\n86\n\n37\n\n61\n\n>Vi\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca}i\u00c0\u00ca`i}\u00c0ii ............................\n\n56\n\n91\n\n34\n\n69\n\n>\u00de\u00ca\u00ab\u00dbi\u00c0\u00cc\u00de\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cc\u00d5\u00c3a\n\ni\u00dc\u00ca\u00ab\u00dbi\u00c0\u00cc\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0i\u00c3` .................................\n\n35\n\n88\n\n37\n\n59\n\nL\u00dbi\u00ca\u00ab\u00dbi\u00c0\u00cc\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0i\u00c3` .................................\n\n50\n\n90\n\n39\n\n65\n\nVi\u00dbii\u00cc\u00ca\u00ca}\u00c0>`i\u00ca\u00ceb\n\n\u00dc ..................................................................\n\n38\n\n84\n\n33\n\n60\n\n} .................................................................\n\n50\n\n92\n\n41\n\n71\n\nai`i\u00c0>\u00ca\u00ab\u00dbi\u00c0\u00cc\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0i\u00c3`\u00c3\u00ca`ivi\u00ca\u00d5\u00c3i`\u00c3\u00caLi\u00dc\u00ca\u00ab\u00dbi\u00c0\u00cc\u00de\u00cai\u00dbi\u00caL>\u00c3i`\u00ca\u00ca\u00d5\u00c3i`\u00caVi\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00d5Li\u00c0\u00cav\u00ca\u00d5\u00c3i`\u00caiLi\u00c0\u00c3\u00b0 b\n\u00ab\u00c3\u00cci\u00cav\u00ca\u00c0i>`}]\u00ca>\u00cci>\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00c3ViVi\u00ca>Vi\u00dbii\u00cc\u00ca\u00cci\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca\u00c3V\u00c0i\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca\u00dc\u00cai\u00dbi\u00caV\u00d5`i\u00c3\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc\u00d5`i\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00caL\u00cc\u00cc\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci\u00cav\u00ca>Vi\u00dbii\u00cc\u00ca`\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0L\u00d5\u00cc\u00c6\u00ca }\u00cai\u00dbi\u00caV\u00d5`i\u00c3\u00ca\u00cc\u00ab\u00ca\u00b5\u00d5>\u00c0\u00cci\u00b0\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de]\u00ca`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\u00ca\n>\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00a3nq\u00ca\n-\u00ae]\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-ii\u00ca>\u00ab\u00abi`\u00dd\u00ca\u00cc>Li\u00c3\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3\u00d3]\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3\u00ce]\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3{\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\f1-28 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nEvidence from the most recent national teacher survey in 2003-04 indicates that almost all mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools participated in some form of professional development activities during the school year (NSB 2008). However, the programs these teachers attended consisted mostly of short-term workshops, conferences, and training sessions. In general, teachers had less exposure to professional development with features identified by research as effective in bringing about positive changes in teaching practices.\nData from ECLS indicate that in 2004, the percentage of fifth graders whose teachers of mathematics and science reported that they had participated in staff development related to their subject content or pedagogy during the past school year was 73% and 53%, respectively (table 1-12). On average, teacher participants spent about 14 hours on subjectfocused staff development during the entire school year. Furthermore, among students whose teachers participated in this staff development, about 40% had teachers rating this activity as very useful.\nThe 2007 TIMSS provides further evidence regarding the extent to which elementary school teachers participate in professional development in mathematics and science\n\n(Miller et al. 2009). In 2007, the percentage of fourth graders whose teachers participated in professional development on various aspects of mathematics during the previous 2 years ranged from 47% for assessment and 50% for pedagogy/instruction to 60% for mathematics content (figure 1-9). Participation in professional development relating to science was even lower among teachers of fourth graders: 24%\u00ad42% of students had teachers who participated in professional development on science content (42%), pedagogy/instruction (29%), and assessment (24%).\nTeachers' Salaries\nAdequate pay is important to attracting and retaining teachers (Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006). Thus, policymakers often propose increasing teacher salaries to lower attrition and improve the quality of the teaching pool, arguing that if teachers could earn higher pay both when entering the profession and over time, stronger candidates would be drawn to teaching and more effective teachers might be retained (Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005; Loeb and Reininger 2004; Stronge, Gareis, and Little 2006).\n\nLocal Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement Program\n\nLocal Systemic Change (LSC) Through Teacher Enhancement is a teacher professional development program that aims to improve K\u00ad12 instruction in science, mathematics, and technology. LSC embraces many characteristics of effective professional development--it requires all mathematics and science teachers from schools or districts to participate in a minimum of 130 hours of professional development over the course of the project, provides ongoing support during the school year, adopts a range of formats, emphasizes subject content and pedagogy, offers active learning opportunities, and promotes efforts to build a supportive environment for change.\n\nA decade's worth of data indicate that LSC has had a positive impact in many areas, including teachers' attitudes toward reform-oriented teaching, perceptions of their pedagogical preparedness, and adoption of reformoriented teaching practices in the classroom; the quality of instruction delivered to students; and student achievement, attitudes, and coursetaking patterns in mathematics and science (Banilower et al. 2006; Heck, Rosenberg, and Crawford 2006; Shimkus and Banilower 2004). Moreover, the program's impact increased as teachers accrued more professional development hours (although there appeared to be a limited increase in impact beyond 80 hours).\n\nTable 1-12 Public school students in grade 5 who were taught mathematics and science by teachers who had participated in staff development relating to their subject content or pedagogy during the past school year: 2004 *i\u00c0Vi\u00cc\u00ae\n\nSubject\n\n*>\u00c0\u00ccV\u00ab>\u00cci`\u00ca\u00af\u00ae\n\n/\u00d5}\u00cc\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>vv\u00ca`i\u00dbi\u00abi\u00cc\u00ca\n\n\u00dbi\u00c0>}i\u00ca\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3\u00ca\u00c3\u00abi\u00cc\n\n\u00dc>\u00c3\u00ca\u00dbi\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\u00d5\u00c3iv\u00d5\u00ca\u00af\u00ae\n\nMathematics ..........................................................\n\n73\n\nScience ..................................................................\n\n53\n\n14\n\n41\n\n14\n\n42\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\n>\u00c0\u00de\u00ca\n``\u00ca}\u00cc\u00d5`>\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`\u00de]\u00ca`i\u00c0}>\u00c0\u00cci\u00ca\n>\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00a3nq]\u00ca\u00c3\u00ab\u00c0}\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{\u00c6\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca -ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc]\u00ca\f\u00db\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca,i\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0Vi\u00c3\u00ca-\u00cc>\u00cc\u00c3\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00ca\u00c3\u00abiV>\u00ca\u00cc>L\u00d5>\u00cc\u00c3\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-29\n\nAccording to the latest annual teacher salary survey conducted by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT),14 the average salary for all public K\u00ad12 teachers in 2006\u00ad07 was about $51,000 (AFT 2008). After adjustment for inflation, teacher salaries grew by 2.8% from 1996\u00ad97 to 2006\u00ad07. During this 10-year period, 18 states experienced declines in inflation-adjusted teacher salaries.\nUsing data from the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Allegretto, Corcoran, and Mishel (2008) compared the weekly wages15 of full-time public\n\n-PN\\YL  :[\\KLU[Z PU NYHKL  ^OVZL [LHJOLYZ WHY[PJPWH[LK PU ]HYPV\\Z WYVMLZZPVUHS KL]LSVWTLU[ HJ[P]P[PLZ PU TH[OLTH[PJZ HUK ZJPLUJL PU [OL WHZ[  `LHYZ! \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n4H[OLTH[PJZ\n\n:JPLUJL\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n*VU[LU[\n\n7LKHNVN`PUZ[Y\\J[PVU (ZZLZZTLU[\n\n:6<9*,! 4PSSLY +* :LU ( 4HSSL` 3) )\\YUZ :+ *VTWHYH[P]L 0UKPJH[VYZ VM ,K\\JH[PVU PU [OL <UP[LK :[H[LZ HUK 6[OLY . *V\\U[YPLZ!   5*,:     MPN\\YLZ  HUK  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nschool teachers with those of people working in occupations requiring comparable education and skills, such as accountants, reporters, registered nurses, and computer programmers.16 Their analyses showed that in 2006, full-time public school teachers earned 86% as much in weekly wages as did those in this set of comparable occupations. Furthermore, between 1996 and 2006, the gap in weekly wages between full-time teachers and those in comparable occupations widened from $7 to $153, in constant dollars (figure 1-10). A similar conclusion has been drawn about mathematics and science teachers--that is, their pay fell behind that of many professions with comparable educational backgrounds, and the gap widened substantially in recent years (NSB 2008).\nWorking Conditions\nPoor working conditions can cause stress and dissatisfaction and may lead teachers to leave the teaching profession altogether (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004; Hanushek and Rivkin 2007; Ingersoll 2001; Johnson, Berg, and Donaldson 2005). The working conditions that matter most to teachers include administrative leadership at their school, working relationships among colleagues, level of parental support, teaching loads, and student discipline problems (Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006).\nMost public middle and high school teachers have positive perceptions about their school conditions (NSB 2008). Such positive perceptions are also widely held among fifth and eighth grade students' teachers. In 2004, for example, for a large majority of fifth grade students (94%), the teachers who taught them mathematics and science felt accepted and respected by their school colleagues (appendix table 1-15).\n\n-PN\\YL  >LLRS` ^HNLZ VM M\\SS[PTL W\\ISPJ ZJOVVS [LHJOLYZ HUK JVTWHYHISL ^VYRLYZ! \n*VUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n \n\n>LLRS` ^HNLZ MVY ^VYRLYZ ^P[O JVTWHYHISL ZRPSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>LLRS` ^HNLZ MVY [LHJOLYZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! +H[H VU ^LLRS` ^HNLZ KYH^U MYVT *\\YYLU[ 7VW\\SH[PVU :\\Y]L` VM )\\YLH\\ VM 3HIVY :[H[PZ[PJZ )3: (Z WHY[ VM 5H[PVUHS *VTWLUZH[PVU :\\Y]L` )3: JVSSLJ[Z ZWLJPMPJ VJJ\\WH[PVUHS ZRPSS PUMVYTH[PVU HUK YH[LZ LHJO VJJ\\WH[PVU VU SL]LS VM ZRPSSZ YLX\\PYLK HJYVZZ  KPMMLYLU[ KPTLUZPVUZ LN RUV^SLKNL JVTWSL_P[` (TVUN  VJJ\\WH[PVUZ PKLU[PMPLK HZ OH]PUN JVTWHYHISL ZRPSS YH[PUNZ HZ [LHJOPUN ZP_ TVZ[ JVTTVU VJJ\\WH[PVUZ HJJV\\U[HU[Z YLWVY[LYZ YLNPZ[LYLK U\\YZLZ JVTW\\[LY WYVNYHTTLYZ JSLYN` HUK WLYZVUULS VMMPJLYZ \\ZLK [V MVYT JH[LNVY` VM JVTWHYHISL ^VYRLYZ PU Z[\\K` VM (SSLNYL[[V *VYJVYHU HUK 4PZOLS \n:6<9*,!

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nLarge majorities of these students had teachers who believed that teachers in their schools were continually learning and seeking new ideas (86%);17 that staff members had school spirit (81%) and agreed about the central mission of the school (75%); that school administrators knew the direction of the school and communicated it to staff (81%) and were supportive and encouraging (80%); and that parents were supportive of school staff (70%). Furthermore, relatively few students' teachers reported various learning and behavioral problems among students (12%-21%). Reports from eighth grade teachers were similar (appendix table 1-16), although eighth grade teachers were more likely than fifth grade teachers to report such problems as student misbehavior interfering with teaching (30% vs. 21%, respectively) and many children not being capable of learning (19% vs. 14%).\nPositive perceptions of school conditions were less widely held among teachers of minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and low-achieving students. For example, fifth grade students whose mothers had less than a high school education were less likely than students whose mothers had a bachelor's or higher degree to have teachers who described parents in their school as \"supportive\" (61% vs. 82%, respectively) (figure 1-11). About 74% of fifth grade students from low-income families, compared with 81% of students from more financially advantaged families, had teachers reporting supportive school administrators. Compared with 17% of\n\nfifth grade white students, 33% of black students had teachers whose teaching was interrupted by child misbehavior. In addition, compared with 8% of high-achieving students, 18% of low-achieving students were taught mathematics and science by teachers who reported that many of their students were not capable of learning the materials they taught.\nInstructional Technology in Education\nNational organizations have endorsed, and federal and state policies have encouraged, the incorporation of technology into education. In the context of elementary/secondary education, technology is commonly understood to include a range of computer applications such as word processing, presentation software, spreadsheets, databases, Internet search capability, distance education, virtual schools, interactions with simulations and models, and collaboration over local and global networks (Dynarski et al. 2007). The Enhancing Education Through Technology Act of 2001, a component of the No Child Left Behind Act, emphasized developing technology infrastructure within schools, integrating technology into curriculums, and training teachers in its use. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Education released a National Education Technology Plan, touting the transformative potential of technology in teaching and learning and outlining steps to incorporate technology into schools (Office of Educational\n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ ZJOVVS Z[\\KLU[Z PU NYHKL  ^OVZL [LHJOLYZ VM TH[OLTH[PJZ HUK ZJPLUJL HNYLLK VY Z[YVUNS` HNYLLK ^P[O ZLSLJ[LK Z[H[LTLU[Z HIV\\[ [OLPY ZJOVVSZ I` Z[\\KLU[ JOHYHJ[LYPZ[PJZ! \n7LYJLU[\n\n\n7HYLU[Z HYL Z\\WWVY[P]L VM ZJOVVS Z[HMM\n\n(KTPUPZ[YH[PVU\u00bbZ ILOH]PVY [V^HYK [OL Z[HMM PZ Z\\WWVY[P]L HUK LUJV\\YHNPUN\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#/:\n\n)(\n\n4V[OLY\u00bbZ LK\\JH[PVU\n\n)LSV^\n\n(IV]L\n\n-HTPS` WV]LY[` [OYLZOVSKH\n\n*OPSK TPZILOH]PVY PU[LYMLYLZ ^P[O T` [LHJOPUN\n\n\n\n)SHJR\n\n>OP[L\n\n9HJLL[OUPJP[`\n\n4HU` VM [OL JOPSKYLU 0 [LHJO HYL UV[ JHWHISL VM SLHYUPUN\n[OL TH[LYPHS 0 [LHJO\n\n\n\n\n\n3V^\n\n/PNO\n\n(JOPL]LTLU[ PU NYHKL I\n\n:[\\KLU[ JOHYHJ[LYPZ[PJ\n\n#/: $ SLZZ [OHU OPNO ZJOVVS\" )( $ IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ KLNYLL VY OPNOLY\nH -LKLYHS WV]LY[` [OYLZOVSKZ KLMPUL OV\\ZLOVSKZ ILSV^ WV]LY[` SL]LS IHZLK VU OV\\ZLOVSK PUJVTL HUK U\\TILY VM OV\\ZLOVSK TLTILYZ I *VTWVZP[L VM YLHKPUN TH[OLTH[PJZ HUK ZJPLUJL HJOPL]LTLU[ [LZ[ ZJVYLZ 3V^ SL]LS PUJS\\KLZ Z[\\KLU[Z PU IV[[VT X\\HY[PSL VM HJOPL]LTLU[ KPZ[YPI\\[PVU HUK OPNO SL]LS PUJS\\KLZ [VW X\\HY[PSL\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ ,HYS` *OPSKOVVK 3VUNP[\\KPUHS :[\\K` 2PUKLYNHY[LU *SHZZ VM  \u00b6 ,*3:2 ZWYPUN \" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-31\n\nTechnology 2004). More recently, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included $650 million for additional grants through the Ed-Tech state program, which supports various state and local projects related to the use of technology in education.\nThe applications of technology in education are vast, but this section focuses specifically on instructional technology--that is, technology products and tools designed to assist teaching and learning in elementary and secondary schools. (Technology use can be a competency itself, as well as a tool toward other knowledge acquisition. For a discussion of\n\ntechnology literacy among students and teachers, see sidebar \"Student and Teacher Technology Literacy.\") It begins by discussing recent research on the effectiveness of technology as an instructional tool. In the context of this research, it then presents data on eighth graders' use of instructional technology in school, updates national estimates of access to computers and the Internet, and examines the prevalence of distance education, an instructional application of technology that can potentially increase students' access to subject matter and qualified instructors.\n\nStudent and Teacher Technology Literacy\n\nNational and international organizations endorse technology as both a tool for instruction in various academic subjects and an important area in which K\u00ad12 students should achieve some competency. The National Governors Association (NGA) recently argued that the prevalence of technology in most professions requires all students to have a strong foundation in using technology--along with other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) competencies--to compete in a 21st century economy (NGA 2007). Several organizations, including the International Technology Education Association (ITEA), have developed technology standards outlining what students should know about various types of technologies, the concepts behind them, and their significance to society (ITEA 2007). The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has developed technology standards for teachers and students that have been widely adopted by states and districts interested in integrating technology into their educational\n\ngoals (ISTE 2007; Trotter 2009). Beginning in 2012, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) will pilot a computer-based evaluation of students' understanding of all technologies, including their information technology literacy (Kerr 2008).\nState policies also reflect a growing emphasis on K\u00ad12 students' learning about technology and the use of technology in education (table 1-A; appendix table 1-18). In the 2008\u00ad09 school year, 46 states included technology in their teaching standards, and 21 states required teachers to complete technology coursework or to pass a test on technology use for initial teacher certification (Editorial Projects in Education Research Center 2009a). Ten states required technology-related professional development for teachers or testing for recertification. Curriculum standards in all 50 states included technology as a subject in which students should be educated, and 13 tested students on those technology standards, up from just 5 the previous year.\n\nTable 1-A State standards and policies regarding K\u00ad12 teaching with and learning about technology, by academic year: 2004\u00ad09  \u00d5Li\u00c0\u00cav\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00c3\u00ae\n\n-\u00cc>`>\u00c0`\u00c9\u00abV\u00de\n\n\n>}i]\u00ca \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00ceq\u00e4{ \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{q\u00e4x \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4xq\u00e4\u00c8 \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c8q\u00e4\u00c7 \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7q\u00e4n \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4nq\u00e4 \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{q\u00e4\n\n-\u00cc>`>\u00c0`\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc\u00d5`i\u00cc\u00c3\u00cainclude technology ..................\n\n45\n\n48\n\n48\n\n48\n\n48\n\n50\n\n+5\n\nStudents tested on technology .....................................\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n13\n\n+10\n\n-\u00cc>`>\u00c0`\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci>Vi\u00c0\u00c3\u00caV\u00d5`i\u00ca\u00cciV}\u00de ..................\n\n38\n\n40\n\n40\n\n45\n\n44\n\n46\n\n+8\n\n,i\u00b5\u00d5\u00c0ii\u00cc\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00cc\u00cc>\u00ca\u00cci>V}\u00caVi\u00c3i\u00caV\u00d5`i\u00ca\n\n\u00cciV}\u00de\u00caV\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3i\u00dc\u00c0\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci\u00c3\u00cc ...................................\n\n22\n\n20\n\n21\n\n19\n\n19\n\n21\n\n-1\n\n/iV}\u00de\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0>}\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci\u00c3\u00cc}]\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca\u00ab>\u00c0\u00ccV\u00ab>\u00cc\u00ca\u00ca\n\n\u00cciV}\u00de\u00c0i>\u00cci`\u00ca\u00ab\u00c0vi\u00c3\u00c3>\u00ca`i\u00dbi\u00abi\u00cc\u00ca\n\n\u00c0i\u00b5\u00d5\u00c0i`\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00c0iVi\u00c0\u00ccvV>\u00cc...........................................\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-\"1,\n\n-\\\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca\u00ba \u00c0i>}\u00ca\u00dc>\u00de\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca/\u00c0>`\u00cc\\\u00ca\n\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca\n\u00dd\u00ab>`\u00c3\u00ca\"\u00ab\u00ab\u00c0\u00cc\u00d5\u00cci\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca,>\u00c3}\u00ca Vi\u00dbii\u00cc]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00ca\u00d3n\u00d3\u00c8\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00ae\u00c6\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca\u00ba-/\n\\\u00ca/i\u00ca*\u00d5\u00c3\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00ab\u00c0\u00dbi\u00ca -ViVi]\u00ca/iV}\u00de]\u00ca\n}ii\u00c0}]\u00ca>`\u00ca>\u00cci>\u00ccV\u00c3]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4n\u00ca\u00d3\u00c7\u00ce\u00e4\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4n\u00ae\u00c6\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca \ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca\u00ba\u00ca\f}\u00cc>\u00ca\fiV>`i]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00ca\u00d3\u00c8\u00ce\u00e4\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00ae\u00c6\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca\u00ba/i\u00cav\u00c0>\u00cc\u00ca \n`}i\\\u00ca1\u00c3}\u00ca\f>\u00cc>\u00ca\u00cc\u00caVVii\u00c0>\u00cci\u00caVi\u00dbii\u00cc]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c8\u00ca\u00d3x\u00cex\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c8\u00ae\u00c6\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca \u00ba\niV\u00cc\u00c0V\u00ca/\u00c0>\u00c3vi\u00c0\\\u00ca\u00db}\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\f>\u00c0\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca i\u00dc\u00ca\f\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4x\u00ca\u00d3{\u00cex\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4x\u00ae\u00c6\u00ca\n`\u00cc\u00c0>\u00ca*\u00c0iV\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca \n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca,i\u00c3i>\u00c0V\u00ca\ni\u00cci\u00c0]\u00ca\u00baL>\u00ca\u00c3\\\u00cai\u00c3\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca7\u00c0`]\u00bb\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca7ii\\\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00d5\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{\u00ca\u00d3\u00ce\u00cex\u00ae\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4{\u00ae\u00b0\u00ca >\u00c3i`\u00ca\u00ca>\u00d5>\u00ca\u00c3\u00d5\u00c0\u00dbi\u00de\u00c3\u00ca v\u00caViv\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00ca\u00cciV}\u00de\u00cavvV>\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-ii\u00ca>\u00ab\u00abi`\u00dd\u00ca\u00cc>Li\u00ca\u00a3\u00a3n\u00b0\u00ca\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\f1-32 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nTechnology as an Instructional Tool\nThe Internet offers students access to more, and more recent, information than individual schools can provide, but it is only one potential application of instructional technology to enhance educational outcomes. Computer applications, either alone or in concert with traditional instruction, may improve achievement by tailoring lessons and skill practice to individual students' needs or by offering students additional opportunities to interact with information. Additionally, computerized assessment may provide more precise and efficient feedback on student learning, allowing teachers to adapt instruction to student needs (Tucker 2009).\nResearch on whether and how these tools improve student achievement, however, continues to yield mixed results. Some computer applications appear to enhance students' achievement on standardized tests, while others do not (NSB 2006).\nAn NCLB study of the effectiveness of instructional technology failed to find any statistically significant effects of several specific instructional technologies on student achievement (Dynarski et al. 2007). Researchers tested three grade 6 math products in 28 schools and three algebra products in 23 schools. Teachers in selected schools volunteered to participate and were randomly assigned to use or not use the educational software; researchers compared students' test results and other outcomes. No effects on sixth grade mathematics or algebra achievement were observed. During the second year of the evaluation, two sixth grade math products and two algebra products were tested, and again researchers observed no significant effects on student achievement (Campuzano et al. 2009). No science products were tested.\nIn contrast, a meta-analysis that used statistical procedures to aggregate the results of 42 studies published in peer-reviewed journals found that incorporating instructional technology into teaching and learning had a small, positive effect on achievement when compared with instruction without technology (Waxman, Lin, and Michko 2003). However, the studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted prior to 2003, some based on projects from the early 1990s. Given the fast pace of change in instructional technology, the results may be less relevant than more recent studies. Small-scale recent studies of specific instructional technology applications suggest that educational computer programs and videogames may promote student engagement and learning when they make use of proven pedagogical techniques (Steinkuehler and Duncan 2008; Ketelhut 2007; Nelson 2007; Barab et al. 2007; Neulight et al. 2007). In its final report, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (2008) recommended that several types of high-quality computer-assisted instruction be considered potentially useful educational tools and that further research be conducted.\n\nComputer Use in Eighth Grade Mathematics and Science\nAccording to their teachers, eighth grade students use computers in science classes substantially more often than in their mathematics classes. More than 70% of students used computers in science at least once per month, compared with less than 40% in mathematics, according to the 2007 followup of the ECLS-K cohort (appendix table 1-17). Use of computers varies with student characteristics, but not consistently. Students with the highest mathematics assessment scores were more likely to use computers in science class but less likely to use them in mathematics class. Conversely, black students were significantly more likely to \"never or hardly ever\" use computers in science class, compared with their white and Asian peers, and more likely to use computers \"almost every day\" in mathematics class.\nUntil research yields some consensus on the optimal uses of computer-based technology for various subjects, grade levels, and types of students, its contributions to patterns of achievement will remain unclear.\nInternet Access\nAccess to the Internet is nearly universal among public elementary and secondary schools in the United States. In 2005, 100% of public schools had Internet access, and 97% of these schools used broadband connections to access the Internet (Wells and Lewis 2006). Access was nearly universal not only for schools, but also for classrooms and students: 94% of classrooms in public schools had computers with Internet access, and the ratio of students to instructional computers was 4:1.18 Moreover, change has been swift: 35% of schools and 3% of classrooms had Internet access in 1994 (figure 1-12), and the student-to-computer ratio was 12:1 in 1998 (Wells and Lewis 2006).\n\n-PN\\YL\u00b0 Schools and classrooms with Internet access, 1994\u00ad2005\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n:JOVVSZ\u00b0^P[O\u00b0\n\n\n\n0U[LYUL[\n\nHJJLZZ\n\n\n*SHZZYVVTZ\u00b0^P[O\u00b00U[LYUL[\u00b0HJJLZZ \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56;,! +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY \n:6<9*,!\u00b0>LSSZ\u00b01\u00b03L^PZ\u00b03\u00b00U[LYUL[\u00b0(JJLZZ\u00b0PU\u00b0<:\u00b07\\ISPJ\u00b0:JOVVSZ HUK\u00b0*SHZZYVVTZ!\u00b0 \u00b6\u00b05*,:\u00b0\u00b00UZ[P[\\[L\u00b0VM\u00b0,K\\JH[PVU :JPLUJLZ\u00b0<:\u00b0+LWHY[TLU[\u00b0VM\u00b0,K\\JH[PVU\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-33\n\nFurthermore, equity in Internet access appears to have been achieved. Since the beginning of the century, public schools' access to the Internet has not varied with minority enrollment or student poverty, and by 2005, neither did classrooms' Internet access (Wells and Lewis 2006).\nDistance Education\nTechnology may provide students with access to courses they would otherwise be unable to take by facilitating distance education: instruction in which the teacher and students are in different locations. Distance education may include videoconferencing and televised or audiotaped courses, but Internet courses are the most widespread and fastest-growing mode of delivery (Zandberg and Lewis 2008). While distance courses preclude some experiential learning (e.g., laboratory experiments), well-designed electronic alternatives (e.g., remotely operated laboratories [Nickerson et al. 2007])--may be able to fill that gap. Thus far, several meta-analyses have found no significant difference between the student learning that occurs in online versus regular classroom instruction (Cavanaugh 2001; Bernard et al. 2004; Cavanaugh et al. 2004), suggesting that distance education courses may provide students with access to additional courses without compromising the quality of instruction.\nGoals of Distance Education NCLB describes distance education as an innovative tool\nto promote access to rigorous academic courses, particularly for students in isolated geographic regions (NCLB Title II, Part D), and the National Education Technology Plan lists distance learning as one of seven major action steps designed to improve student achievement through technology. District administrators cited \"offering courses not otherwise available at the school\" as the most important reason to provide online learning opportunities (Picciano and Seaman 2007). Schools and districts also provide distance learning options to ease crowding in schools, increase course access for physically disabled students, allow students to retake courses for graduation, expand student access to AP and college-level courses, and tutor students for high-stakes graduation exams (Education Technology Cooperative 2007; Zandberg and Lewis 2008).\nDistance education provides one strategy for managing shortages of mathematics and science teachers, particularly in rural or inner-city areas where attracting and retaining them are chronically difficult (Picciano and Seaman 2007). For example, Louisiana has implemented a Web-based algebra course targeted at schools with uncertified mathematics teachers. The course provides students with access to a certified instructor and offers teachers professional development opportunities (Watson, Germin, and Ryan 2008).\nAccess and Participation in Distance Education The availability of distance education, most commonly\nprovided by postsecondary institutions, independent vendors, states, and school districts (Picciano and Seaman\n\n2007), has grown substantially over this decade. In 2005, 57% of secondary schools nationwide provided opportunities for online distance learning to their students (Wells and Lewis 2006). In 2008, students in 44 states had access to full-time or supplemental online learning opportunities, and 34 states sponsored programs and initiatives. While stateled programs primarily serve secondary students, opportunities for students in grades K\u00ad8 are increasingly common (Watson, Germin, and Ryan 2008). Beyond its accessibility, however, it is difficult to draw conclusions about nationwide distance education because programs and policies vary so widely. For example, two states--Michigan and Alabama-- now require students to participate in online learning to graduate from high school, while six states do not have online opportunities that are accessible to every student (Watson, Germin, and Ryan 2008). Policies regarding tuition and partnerships with private schools and home-school organizations also vary (Watson, Germin, and Ryan 2008; Education Technology Cooperative 2008).\nParticipation in distance education has increased dramatically. Primary and secondary school enrollment in distance education across all subjects grew from 317,070 students in 2002-03 to 506,950 students in 2004-05, an increase of 60% (Zandberg and Lewis 2008).19 In addition, a nationwide survey of school district administrators indicated that approximately 700,000 public school students, about two-thirds of whom were in grades 9-12, were enrolled in courses that involved a substantial proportion of online learning during the 2005-06 school year (Picciano and Seaman 2007). Postsecondary institutions were the leading providers of distance education to secondary students in 2005 (Zandberg and Lewis 2008), and 12% of 2- and 4-year postsecondary institutions reported offering courses, primarily academic high school courses, to elementary and secondary students in 2006\u00ad07 (Parsad and Lewis 2008).\nDespite these recent reports, national indicators pointing to elementary and secondary science and mathematics education are unavailable. No national data exist on distance course taking in math, science, or any particular subject area. Likewise, data that identify elementary and secondary students among postsecondary distance education enrollments are also as yet unavailable.\nVirtual Schools State-sponsored virtual schools are growing sources for\ndistance education. In 1997, five states had virtual school programs, which use technology to offer individual courses or supplements to courses taught in traditional schools (Tucker 2007). As of 2008, 29 states had established virtual school programs (Editorial Projects in Education Research Center 2009a). All the members of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) sponsor virtual schools, and their annual surveys indicate that enrollment in these schools has been increasing steadily (Education Technology Cooperative 2008).\n\n\f1-34 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nAlthough there are no nationwide data on distance education course offerings or participation in STEM subjects, the Education Technology Cooperative at SREB tracks this information for its member states' virtual schools (table 1-13). In the absence of more comprehensive data, it provides an indicator of distance education in math and science specifically. These virtual schools provide students with advanced courses: 10 of the 14 virtual schools offer several AP courses in math or science. Virtual schools offer courses at a range of levels, however, including regular and honors levels, and offer various electives such as business-focused math, computer science, and specialized sciences (e.g., oceanography). In a few states, the virtual school plays a role in remediation as well. For example, Alabama offers online remediation for the math and science components of the high school graduation exam; more than 1,000 students are enrolled in each of those courses, compared with an average of about 200 students in the other math and science courses offered.\nTransition to Higher Education\nOne role of high school education in the United States is to prepare students for further education. This section presents indicators of how well prepared high school graduates are, especially in math and science, to engage in postsecondary education.\nAlthough calculating accurate high school graduation rates has been a perennial challenge, existing data indicate that less than three-quarters of students graduate from high school in\n\n4 years. On the other hand, a small but growing number of students earn college credit during high school by passing AP tests. For those students who complete high school, this section presents indicators of their movement into postsecondary education. It begins with data on the association of students' high school mathematics and science coursetaking and achievement with their postsecondary enrollment and remediation; then it examines long-term trend data on students' immediate enrollment in postsecondary education and presents current data in the context of international rates. Together, these indicators describe high school students' preparation for and transition into postsecondary education.\nHigh School Completion\nIn 2006, the national on-time high school graduation rate--the percentage of entering ninth graders who graduated 4 years later--was 73% (Stillwell and Hoffman 2008). About three-quarters of students have completed high school on time since 2003. Differences in on-time graduation rates between students in various racial/ethnic groups remain large: the graduation rate for white students was approximately 20 percentage points higher than the rates for black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native students in 2006 (figure 1-13). The Asian/Pacific Islander rate was higher than that of all other groups.20\nSome students who fail to graduate from high school on time eventually earn a high school diploma or alternative award such as a General Educational Development (GED)\n\nTable 1-13 Science and mathematics courses offered at state-sponsored virtual schools, by state: 2008\n\nMathematics and science courses\n\nState\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\n*a\n\nStudents enrolledb\n\nAlabama ................................................................................. 11\n\n9\n\n4\n\nx]\u00c7\u00ce\u00e4\u00ca\n\n\u00c0>\u00c3>\u00c3 .................................................................................\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0\n\n537\n\n\u00c0`>..................................................................................... 17\n\n17\n\n2\n\n\u00cex]\u00d3{\u00ce\n\nGeorgia ................................................................................... 20\n\n12\n\n6\n\n\u00d3]\u00d3\u00c7\u00c8\u00ca\n\ni\u00cc\u00d5V\u00de ................................................................................\n\n8\n\n11\n\n8\n\n256\n\nLouisiana ................................................................................\n\n8\n\n8\n\n2\n\n\u00a3]\u00a3nx\u00ca\n\nMaryland................................................................................. 15\n\n9\n\n8\n\n297\n\nMississippi.............................................................................. 11\n\n11\n\n8\n\n\u00a3]\u00c7x\u00c8\u00ca\n\nNorth Carolina ........................................................................\n\n7\n\n10\n\n5\n\n\u00a3]\u00c8\u00d3\u00a3\u00ca\n\n\">> ...............................................................................\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0\n\n466\n\nSouth Carolina........................................................................\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u00a3]\u00d3n\u00c7\u00ca\n\nTennessee ...............................................................................\n\n7\n\n6\n\n0\n\n871\n\nVirginia ....................................................................................\n\n4\n\n7\n\n7\n\n417\n\nWest Virginia ........................................................................... 30\n\n21\n\n7\n\n145\n\n*\u00car\u00ca`\u00db>Vi`\u00ca*>Vii\u00cc\n\na*\u00caV\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3i\u00c3\u00ca>\u00c3\u00caV\u00d5\u00cci`\u00ca\u00ca>\u00cci>\u00ccV\u00c3\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00c3ViVi\u00caV\u00d5\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca bV\u00d5`i\u00c3\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc\u00d5`i\u00cc\u00c3\u00cai\u00c0i`\u00ca\u00ca>\u00ca>\u00cci>\u00ccV\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca\u00c3ViVi\u00caV\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3i\u00c3\u00b0\u00ca-\u00cc\u00d5`i\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca>\u00de\u00caLi\u00ca`\u00d5Li\u00caV\u00d5\u00cci`\u00cav\u00ca\u00cci\u00de\u00ca>\u00c0i\u00cai\u00c0i`\u00ca\u00ca\u00c0i\u00ca\u00cc>\u00cai\u00caV\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3i\u00b0\n\n-\"1,\n\n\\\u00ca-\u00abiV>\u00ca>>\u00de\u00c3\u00c3\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca >\u00cc>\u00ca-ViVi\u00ca\u00d5`>\u00cc\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc>\u00ca/iV}\u00de\u00ca\n\u00abi\u00c0>\u00cc\u00dbi\u00ca>\u00cc\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca-\u00d5\u00cci\u00c0\u00ca,i}>\u00ca\n`\u00d5V>\u00cc\u00ca >\u00c0`]\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00b0\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-35\n\ncredential. In 2006, 88% of 18- through 24-year-olds who were not enrolled in high school, institutionalized, or incarcerated had earned a high school diploma or other credential, continuing a rising trend that began in 1980 (Laird et al. 2008).21\nGraduation Rate Standards NCLB requires states to set both standards for graduation\nrates and annual improvement targets for schools or groups not meeting the standard, but the act provides no minimum for either measure, and states' targets for this measure vary considerably. (See sidebar \"Measuring High School Graduation Rates.\") Nearly half the states (23) and the District of Columbia set graduation rate goals for the class of 2007 at or below 75%, and more than half of states defined their improvement targets as \"any progress,\" or even none, as long as their rates did not decline. Thirty-six states had annual improvement targets of 0.1% or less in 2008, or less than one additional graduate per year for an average-sized high school (Alliance for Excellent Education 2008).\nSince 2002, states have reported graduation rates disaggregated by racial/ethnic group, family income, disability status, and English-language proficiency. Until 2008, however, the determination of whether schools and districts have made adequate yearly progress under NCLB rested only on overall graduation rates. Regulations issued in 2008 require that, beginning in 2011-12, schools and districts must meet graduation rate goals for all subgroups to achieve adequate yearly progress.22\n\n-PN\\YL  6U[PTL NYHK\\H[PVU YH[LZ VM <: W\\ISPJ OPNO ZJOVVS Z[\\KLU[Z I` YHJLL[OUPJP[`! \n\n(SS Z[\\KLU[Z\n\n>OP[L UVU/PZWHUPJ\n)SHJR UVU/PZWHUPJ\n\n/PZWHUPJ\n\n(ZPHU7HJPMPJ 0ZSHUKLY\n\n(TLYPJHU 0UKPHU (SHZRH 5H[P]L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n56;,! 6U[PTL OPNO ZJOVVS NYHK\\H[PVU YH[L PZ WLYJLU[HNL VM LU[LYPUN UPU[O NYHKLYZ ^OV NYHK\\H[LK  `LHYZ SH[LY\n:6<9*,! :[PSS^LSS 9 /VMMTHU 3 7\\ISPJ :JOVVS .YHK\\H[LZ HUK +YVWV\\[Z -YVT [OL *VTTVU *VYL VM +H[H! :JOVVS @LHY \u00b6  0UZ[P[\\[L VM ,K\\JH[PVU :JPLUJLZ <: +LWHY[TLU[ VM ,K\\JH[PVU \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nGraduation Rates in the United States and in Other OECD Nations\nDifficulties in establishing precise U.S. graduation rates notwithstanding, broad comparison can be made of the United States and other OECD member countries. Among the 23 OECD countries for which graduation data were available, the United States ranked 17th in secondary school graduation rates in 2006 (OECD 2008) (figure 1-14).\nParticipation and Performance in the Advanced Placement Program\nA relatively small but increasing number of secondary students take AP courses, which are designed to be equivalent to some college courses. Students who complete an AP course may take the test offered in that subject, and those who earn a passing score can earn college credits. Growth\nMeasuring High School Graduation Rates\nHistorically, state education agencies have used different methods for estimating graduation rates, rendering state-by-state comparisons problematic. Experts disagree on the best method to calculate these rates, but there is wide consensus that the current calculations are badly flawed (Greene 2002; Swanson and Chapman 2003; NGA 2005).\nTo facilitate comparability, the National Governors Association (NGA) endorsed an adjusted cohort method in 2005, and all 50 governors agreed to work toward implementing that method (NGA 2005). Using this method, the high school graduation rate is calculated by dividing the number of graduates in a given year by the number of students who entered ninth grade 4 years earlier, adjusting the denominator for migration into and out of the state over those 4 years.\nStates require substantial time and funding to develop data collection, storage, and analysis procedures before they can use this method. In 2008, 16 states were calculating graduation rates using the cohort method (NGA 2008). Another 29 states planned to implement data procedures to enable such reporting by 2012. The remaining 5 states either lacked necessary data capacity or had no plans in mid-2008 to calculate rates according to this formula.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Department of Education directed states to use a cohort method that tracks individual students, beginning with reports for academic year 2010-11.* The following year, states must include this graduation rate as one of the measures used to document adequate yearly progress for schools that include 12th grade.\n*Title I--Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged, Final Rule (73 Fed.

In most subjects, this increase has been substantial, rising by at least fivefold in many subjects since 1990. The AP statistics test stands out as experiencing especially rapid growth: in 1997 slightly fewer than 7,600 students took the test, rising to more than 106,000 students in 2008. In sum, proportionately more students are taking tests, but the AP program continues to involve a relatively small proportion of high school students.\nAs the number of students taking AP tests has increased, so has the number passing each exam (i.e., receiving a score of 3, 4, or 5 on a scale of 1\u00ad5). Almost 250,000 students passed a mathematics AP exam in 2008, compared with a little more than 50,000 in 1990. More than 200,000 passed a science AP exam in 2008, compared with about 100,000 in 1997 and fewer than 50,000 in 1990.\nWhile increasing numbers of students are taking and passing AP exams, passing rates have declined or remained steady in most subjects. The percentage of students passing the calculus AB, biology, and chemistry tests dropped by at least 9 points between 1990 and 2008, and in only one subject, computer science A, did the passing rate increase by more than 2 percentage points.\nGenerally, more students of both sexes and all racial/ethnic groups took AP tests in these subjects in 2008 than in 1997 (appendix table 1-19). Passing rates did not change by more than about 3 percentage points for most of these groups in most subjects.\nRelationship of High School Courses Taken to Postsecondary Success\nThe rigor of states' academic standards and graduation requirements and student enrollment in advanced mathematics and science courses other than AP courses continue to increase.23 The number of students taking advanced math and science courses increased on average between 1990 and 2005, although most of the gains in science leveled off after 2000 (NSB 2008). At 29%, precalculus/analysis had the highest completion rate among advanced mathematics courses; chemistry was the most commonly completed science course at 54%. Overall, state policies have shifted to increase the rigor of high school standards and improve preparation for college. Twenty states have published definitions of college readiness, and 11 more are working on such definitions (Editorial Projects in Education Research Center 2009b). In 2009, 23 states had aligned K\u00ad12 standards with college and employer expectations, up from only four in 2006, according to benchmarks established by the American Diploma Project, an initiative that promotes high expectations for high school graduates to prepare them for college (Achieve, Inc. 2009).

Nearly half of states required the class of 2008 to pass exit exams, 23 of which included math and 12 of which included science, to earn a diploma (Editorial Projects in Education Research Center 2009b). The most recent available data on courses required for high school graduation indicate that the majority of states require 3\u00ad4 math courses (36 states) and 3\u00ad4 science courses (30 states) to graduate. In addition, 26 states require specific math courses and 21 states require specific science courses. The most commonly required courses are algebra and biology. However, only a few states require advanced courses, for example, nine require algebra II (CCSSO 2009).\nTaking certain high school courses, particularly advanced mathematics, is linked to postsecondary enrollment and outcomes, as many studies have shown (Adelman, Daniel, and Berkovits 2003; Horn 1997; Horn and Kojaku 2001; Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000; Laird, Chen, and Levesque 2006; Sadler and Tai 2007). Although they do not imply causality, data from the high school class of 2004 show that the highest course students completed in mathematics and science and whether they earned advanced credits in these subjects were closely related to whether students had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 2006 (appendix table 1-20). These indicators of better preparation in high school were also associated with a greater likelihood of enrolling in a 4-year program. For example, among students whose highest mathematics course was below algebra II (the lowest level, which also includes students with no high school mathematics course), 9% had enrolled in a 4-year program by 2006, compared with 83% of those who studied calculus. Among students with more than two advanced mathematics or science credits, 88% and 90%, respectively, had enrolled in a 4-year college (figure 1-15).

Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nwas also associated with enrollment in a 4-year institution: 76% of those with scores in the highest mathematics quartile enrolled in a 4-year college, compared with 13% of students who scored in the lowest quartile.\nConversely, taking lower-level mathematics courses was associated with enrolling in a 2-year college. Among students with no advanced mathematics credits, 33% had enrolled in a 2-year college by 2006, compared with 6% of students with two or more advanced mathematics credits.\nAmong 2004 high school graduates who had enrolled in postsecondary education by 2006, 30% reported that they had taken a remedial course in mathematics at the postsecondary level. Students who completed advanced mathematics and science courses were less likely to undertake postsecondary remediation in mathematics.24 More than 40% of students whose highest high school mathematics course was less advanced than algebra II reported taking remedial mathematics at the postsecondary level, compared with 17% of students who took calculus in high school. Achievement on mathematics assessments was also related to postsecondary remediation rates: 45% of those who scored in the bottom quartile of the twelfth grade mathematics test took a remedial mathematics course in college, compared with 18% of those who scored in the top quartile.25\nImmediate Enrollment in Postsecondary Education\nMost secondary students expect to attain a postsecondary degree. In 2007, 95% of eighth graders expected to attain a postsecondary education, and 70% planned to complete at least a bachelor's degree (Walston and Rathburn 2008). Not all meet these expectations, however: in 2008, 69% of students who completed high school (already a subset of all high school students) had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by the October following high school completion (appendix table 1-21). Wide differences in enrollment rates by family income, race/ethnicity, and parents' education persisted. In 2008, females outpaced men in immediate college enrollment 72% to 66%; most of this difference in immediate enrollment rates was accounted for by enrollment in 2-year colleges, where 31% of recently-graduated women and 25% of their male counterparts were enrolled in 2008 (figure 1-16).\nPostsecondary Enrollment in an International Context\nOnly broad comparisons of postsecondary enrollment rates in the United States and other OECD countries are possible. By one measure, immediate entry rates, U.S. students ranked ninth, above the OECD average (table 1-15) (OECD 2009). In most OECD countries, including the United States, female enrollment rates were higher than those of males. These comparisons are complicated by differences among education systems, types of degrees awarded, and methodological issues with the measure itself.26\n\n-PN\\YL\u00b0 High school graduates enrolled in college in October after completing high school, by sex and type of institution: 1975\u00ad2008\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n-LTHSL \n4HSL -LTHSL\u00b0`LHY\n 4HSL\u00b0`LHY\n-LTHSL\u00b0`LHY \n4HSL\u00b0`LHY\n\n                 \n\n  \n\n56;,!\u00b00UJS\\KLZ\u00b0Z[\\KLU[Z\u00b0HNLZ\u00b0\u00b6\u00b0JVTWSL[PUN\u00b0OPNO\u00b0ZJOVVS\u00b0PU\u00b0 Z\\Y]L`\u00b0`LHY\n:6<9*,:!\u00b05H[PVUHS\u00b0*LU[LY\u00b0MVY\u00b0,K\\JH[PVU\u00b0:[H[PZ[PJZ\u00b05*,:\u00b0;OL\u00b0 *VUKP[PVU\u00b0VM\u00b0,K\\JH[PVU\u00b0 \u00b05*,:\u00b0 \u00b0 I\"\u00b0<:\u00b0)\\YLH\\\u00b0 VM 3HIVY\u00b0:[H[PZ[PJZ\u00b0*\\YYLU[\u00b07VW\\SH[PVU\u00b0:\\Y]L`\u00b0*7:\u00b0\u00b06J[VILY\u00b0 Z\\WWSLTLU[\"\u00b0HUK\u00b05H[PVUHS\u00b0:JPLUJL\u00b0-V\\UKH[PVU\u00b0+P]PZPVU\u00b0VM\u00b0:JPLUJL\u00b0 9LZV\\YJLZ\u00b0:[H[PZ[PJZ\u00b0ZWLJPHS\u00b0[HI\\SH[PVUZ\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nConclusion\nLongitudinal data from ECLS-K illustrate gaps among groups within one cohort of elementary students: students of different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds began kindergarten with varying levels of achievement, and these gaps increased through grade 3 or 5, then stabilized through grade 8. The 2007 NAEP mathematics assessments indicate improvement in fourth and eighth graders' mathematics achievement, continuing a trend observed since 1990. Although some achievement gaps between students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds or family income decreased with this assessment, significant gaps remained.\nResults of international assessments of student achievement in math and science were more mixed. U.S. fourth and eighth grade students improved in mathematics on TIMSS: 2007, both in their average score and in their standing relative to other nations' students, although their relative standing rose only slightly. In science, U.S. students' performance on TIMSS did not change, but their standing relative to their counterparts in other nations did: U.S. fourth graders lost ground to other nations' fourth graders, while U.S. eighth graders gained slightly. Among 15-year-olds, U.S. students' standing declined rela-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-39\n\nTable 1-15 First-time entry rates into postsecondary education in OECD countries, by

improve student achievement include ensuring that all students have access to highly qualified teachers, although consensus definitions of \"highly qualified\" in individual subjects at various grade levels have yet to emerge. From the student perspective, while 40% of fifth grade students in 2004 were taught mathematics and science by teachers with either a degree or certificate in their teaching field (i.e.,\n\nin-field teachers), most students at this level (about 54%) had teachers with general education preparation. When these students reached eighth grade in 2007, more than 80% of them were taught mathematics and science by in-field teachers, and the percentage taught by mathematics and science teachers with general education preparation fell to 9%\u00ad10%. Gaps in access to teachers with these qualifications were observed, however: black and Hispanic students, students from lowincome families, and students whose prior achievement was low were less likely than their counterparts to have teachers with the highest qualifications or greatest experience.\nTeachers' professional development activities can strengthen subject matter knowledge and teaching abilities acquired through their formal education. Many fifth graders' teachers of mathematics and science, however, had not participated in professional development in mathematics or science. Those who had participated reported that their activities were of relatively short duration, and less than half of participants reported their activities as very useful.\nAlthough teachers' salaries have not kept pace with those of employees in occupations with similar training requirements and responsibilities, most teachers of fifth grade students had favorable perceptions of their working conditions. Again, however, teachers of some groups of students were less likely than others to have such positive perceptions, and the differences fell along student racial/ethnic and socioeconomic lines.\nBy 2005, access to computers and the Internet was virtually universal and did not vary with such student characteristics. Most states include technology in their curriculum standards. In addition, increasing numbers of states are providing virtual schools and other opportunities for distance education via technology, largely at the secondary level.\nIn 2006, the on-time (4-year) high school graduation rate was 73%, with significant gaps observed by race/ethnicity. Looking at secondary school completion in international terms, the United States ranked 17th among 23 OECD countries with available data. New federal regulations, effective in 2011, will improve accuracy and comparability of data concerning on-time graduation among the 50 states.\nRates of immediate entry into postsecondary education after high school completion have increased substantially since 1975. Longitudinal data indicate that students who took more advanced mathematics and science courses in high school were more likely than others to undertake postsecondary education within 2 years of completing high school. Once enrolled, such students were also less likely to have reported taking remedial courses at the postsecondary level.\nNotes\n1. Differences between two estimates were tested using Student's t-test statistic to minimize the chances of concluding that a difference exists based on the sample when no true difference exists in the population from which the sample was drawn. These tests were done with a significance level of 0.05, which means that a reported difference would occur\n\n\f1-40 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nby chance no more than once in 20 samples when there was no actual difference between the population means.\n2. About 89% of the students were in eighth grade in 2006\u00ad07 because some were held back one or more grades and a very small number advanced an extra grade. The cohort members are referred to as eighth graders in 2007, and in earlier years by that year's modal grade, for ease of reading. In subsequent sections of this chapter, students called eighth graders (and information about their teachers) are restricted to those actually in eighth grade during that year.\n3. These recent trends are based on data from the national NAEP program. The current national mathematics assessment for grades 4 and 8 was first administered in 1990 and was given again in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2007. The assessment using the current grade 12 mathematics framework has been administered only once, in 2005. Recent trend analyses for grade 12 mathematics are therefore not available. The current national science assessment was first administered in 1996 and again in 2000, 2005, and the spring of 2009. Results from the 2009 administration will be available in early 2010.\n4. Although the skills and knowledge tested remained similar throughout the LTT testing program, some changes were made in 2004, including replacing some test questions that used out-of-date contexts, adopting some new testing procedures, and accommodating some students' disabilities or limited English skills.\n5. Trend changes for the United States' standing are shown only in two figures, 1-7 and 1-8. Text and appendix tables show data only for the most recent year for the TIMSS and PISA assessments. Thus, fewer nations in each category may appear in figures 1-7 and 1-8 compared with the relevant tables. In addition, text tables for these international tests show only nations in the selected comparison group and, for TIMSS, only those that met all of the testing body's standards. The corresponding appendix tables include all nations in the report and therefore have more nations in each category.\n6. See endnote 5. 7. Teaching certification is generally awarded by state education agencies to teachers who have completed specific requirements. These requirements vary across states but typically include completing a bachelor's degree, completing a period of practice teaching, and passing some type of formal tests. States also issue other types of certification besides regular or standard certification. For example, probationary certification is generally awarded to those who have completed all the requirements except for a probationary teaching period. Provisional or temporary certification is awarded to those who still have requirements to meet. Emergency certification is issued to those with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program to continue teaching (Henke et al. 1997). 8. Specifically, NCLB defines a highly qualified elementary or secondary school teacher as someone who holds a bachelor's degree and full state-approved teaching\n\ncertificate or license (excluding emergency, temporary, and provisional certificates) and who demonstrates subject-matter competency in each academic subject taught by having an undergraduate or graduate major or its equivalent in the subject; passing a test on the subject; holding a full teaching certificate in the subject; or meeting some other state-approved criteria. NCLB requires that newly hired elementary school teachers pass tests in subject-matter knowledge and teaching skills in mathematics, reading, writing, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum. Newly hired middle and high school teachers must either pass a rigorous state test in each academic subject they teach or have the equivalent of an undergraduate or graduate major or teaching certification in their fields.\n9. In previous editions, data from the National Center for Education Statistics' Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) have been used to highlight various aspects of teachers and teaching. However, the 2007-08 SASS data were not available for analyses at the time this chapter was prepared.\n10. Typically, fifth grade teachers teach not only mathematics and science but also language arts, social studies, and other academic subjects and therefore cannot strictly be considered mathematics or science teachers. To refer to teachers who taught mathematics and science more accurately, the text uses such phrases as \"teachers of mathematics and science,\" \"teachers who taught mathematics and science,\" or \"students who were taught mathematics and science by teachers\" interchangeably.\n11. Alternatives to traditional teacher education have increased in number and scope. Among various alternative programs, Teach for America (TFA) is the most prominent one (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman 2004). TFA is designed to recruit top graduates from some of the most competitive colleges to teach in the most challenging K-12 schools throughout the nation. Although TFA has been successful in attracting college graduates (e.g., from 2000 to 2003, the number of TFA applicants grew almost fourfold, from about 4,000 to 16,000) (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman 2004), studies that have addressed the effectiveness of TFA teachers yielded mixed results from no to significant effects (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman 2004; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger 2006; Xu, Hannaway, and Taylor 2007).\n12. SASS teachers responded to a much longer list of possible fields for their degree major and certification than ECLS teachers, allowing more refined categorization of the variable. For more information about the definition of the subject area preparation variable in SASS, see the sidebar \"In-Field and Out-of-Field Teaching\" in the 2008 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators (NSB 2008).\n13. SASS collects data on teachers, whereas ECLS collects data on students, including data about those students' teachers. This difference may contribute to the different in-field teaching estimates in the two surveys. Another difference is that SASS includes all middle school teachers, whereas ECLS data refer only to those who teach eighth grade students.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 1-41\n\n14. The Federation collects teacher salary data from each state's department of education.\n15. Because teachers' annual work schedules are different from those of other professions, these researchers compared wages earned for a week of work, rather than for the entire year. Critics of this method (e.g., Podgursky and Tongrut 2006) argue that the use of weekly wages to compare teachers with other workers may bias teacher earnings downward, in that teachers report a weekly wage that may be an annual salary divided over a full year rather than the partial year they actually work. To address this concern, Allegretto, Corcoran, and Mishel (2008) used several alternative methods to compare the salaries of teachers and other workers in their 2008 study and concluded that this bias is small.\n16. As part of the National Compensation Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects specific occupational skill information and rates each occupation on the level of skills required across 10 different dimensions (e.g., knowledge, complexity). Allegretto, Corcoran, and Mishel (2008) used the 6 most common occupations among the 16 identified as having skill ratings comparable to those of teachers to form the group of comparable occupations in their 2008 study. These 6 occupations are accountants, reporters, registered nurses, computer programmers, members of the clergy, and personnel officers, accounting for 83% of the employment in 16 occupations with skill ratings comparable to teaching.\n17. That is, 86% of fifth grade students had teachers of mathematics and science reporting this condition.\n18. \"Classrooms\" includes computer and other labs, library/media centers, regular classrooms, and any other rooms used for instructional purposes.\n19. These numbers are counts of enrollments in each course: if students enroll in more than one course, they are counted more than once.\n20. There are several other widely accepted estimates of on-time graduation rates. Using the Cumulative Promotion Index, the annual Diploma's Count report reported a nationwide rate of 69.2% (Editorial Projects in Education Research Center 2009b).\n21. This measure of high school completion has its critics, however. Some believe that those who earn General Educational Development credentials should not be included with high school graduates in measures of graduation rates and also object to the base for the calculation. Because the base typically excludes incarcerated or institutionalized dropouts, critics believe this measure overestimates the high school completion rate for young people overall (Heckman and LaFontaine 2008; Pinkus 2006; Greene 2002).\n22. Cited in Title I--Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged, Final Rule (73 Fed. Reg. 64435 [2008]).\n23. Advanced courses referenced in this section are defined as courses that not all students complete and that are not, as a rule, required for graduation. They include trigonometry or algebra III, precalculus or analysis, statistics or probability, any calculus, AP/IB calculus, advanced biology,\n\nchemistry, physics, environmental science, engineering, and engineering or science technologies.\n24. Postsecondary transcript data are not yet available, and so information about taking remedial courses comes from student reports, which may be less accurate.\n25. While rates of remediation are lower for students who achieve on tests and take courses at the highest levels, almost one in five of those students still reports taking remedial math. In part, this may be due to a lack of alignment in academic expectations between secondary and postsecondary institutions. The Education Commission of the States (ECS) tracks states' efforts to resolve these discrepancies by means of P-16 or P-20 councils, which involve stakeholders from early childhood education through college or graduate school and work to align expectations and provide seamless transitions between levels of education (ECS 2008). As of May 2008, 38 states had established a P-16 or P-20 council, and 5 more had consolidated agencies or boards that perform essentially the same function. The scope and mission of these councils vary widely, however, and there is no nationwide indicator of their accomplishments.\n26. OECD measures of enrollment rates shown in table 1-15 are imperfect and have been criticized by some researchers in the United States and Europe (Wellman 2007; Adelman 2008; Kaiser and O'Heron 2005), who argue that the OECD methodology--dividing total tertiary enrollment by the population at the most common age of entry--penalizes countries, such as the United States, whose population is growing. They also contend that the differences between education systems and types of degrees awarded across countries make international comparisons problematic.\nGlossary\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nEligibility for National School Lunch Program: Student eligibility for this program, which provides free or reduced-price lunches, is a commonly used indicator for family poverty. Eligibility information is part of the administrative data kept by schools and is based on parentreported family income and family size.\nLongitudinal studies: Researchers follow the same group of students over a period of years, such as from kindergarten through fifth grade. These studies can show achievement gains in a particular subject from grade to grade.\nRepeating cross-sectional studies: This type of research focuses on how a specific group of students performs in a particular year then looks at the performance of a similar group of students at a later point in time. An example would be comparing fourth graders in 1990 to fourth graders in 2005.\nScale score: Scale scores place students on a continuous achievement scale based on their overall performance on\n\n\f1-42 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Mathematics and Science Education\n\nthe assessment. Each assessment program develops its own scales.\nTeachers of Mathematics and Science\nHigh schools: Schools that have at least one grade higher than 8 and no grade in K\u00ad6.\nMain teaching assignment field: The field in which teachers teach the most classes in school.\nMajor: A field of study in which an individual has taken substantial academic coursework at the postsecondary level, implying that the individual has substantial knowledge of the academic discipline or subject area.\nMiddle schools: Schools that have any of grades 5\u00ad8 and no grade lower than 5 and no grade higher than 8.\nSecondary schools: Schools that have any of grades 7\u00ad12 and no grade in K\u00ad6.\nTeaching certification: A license or certificate awarded to teachers by the state to teach in a public school. The SASS surveys include five types of certification: (1) regular or standard state certification or advanced professional certificate; (2) probationary certificate issued to persons who satisfy all requirements except the completion of a probationary period; (3) provisional certificate issued to persons who are still participating in what the state calls an \"alternative certification program\"; (4) temporary certificate issued to persons who need some additional college coursework, student teaching, and/or passage of a test before regular certification can be obtained; and (5) emergency certificate issued to persons with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program to continue teaching.\nTransition to Higher Education\nPostsecondary education: The provision of a formal instructional program with a curriculum designed primarily for students who have completed the requirements for a high school diploma or its equivalent. These programs include those with an academic, vocational, or continuing professional education purpose and exclude vocational and adult basic education programs.\nAdvanced Placement: Courses that teach college-level material and skills to high school students who can earn college credits by demonstrating advanced proficiency on a final course exam. The curricula and exams for AP courses, available for a wide range of academic subjects, are developed by the College Board.\nReferences\nAchieve, Inc. 2009. Closing the Expectations Gap 2009.

Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nHighlights\n\nUndergraduate Education, Enrollment, and Degrees\nEnrollment in U.S. higher education is projected to continue rising because of increases in the U.S. college-age population.\n Reflecting changes in the population of 18-year-olds, the number of high school graduates is expected to increase 6% between 2004\u00ad05 and 2017\u00ad18, a slower rate of growth than between 1992\u00ad93 and 2004\u00ad05 (25%).\n Postsecondary enrollment rose from 14.5 million in fall 1993 to 18.7 million in fall 2006, and is projected to increase to 20.1 million students in 2017.\n Postsecondary enrollment of all racial/ethnic groups is projected to increase, but the percentage that is white is projected to decrease to 61% in 2017, whereas the percentages that are black and Hispanic are projected to increase.\nThe number of S&E bachelor's degrees has risen steadily over the past 15 years.\n The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded reached a new peak of 485,800 in 2007.\n Most S&E fields (except computer sciences) experienced increases in the number of degrees awarded in 2007. In computer sciences, the number of bachelor's and master's degrees increased sharply from 1998 to 2004 but has decreased since then.\n S&E bachelor's degrees have consistently accounted for roughly one-third of all bachelor's degrees for the past 15 years.\nThe share of bachelor's degrees awarded to women increased in many major S&E fields from 1993 to 2007.\n Women have earned 58% of all bachelor's degrees since 2002; they have earned about half of all S&E bachelor's degrees since 2000, but major variations persist among fields.\n In 2007, men earned a majority of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering, computer sciences, and physics (81%, 81%, and 79%, respectively). Women earned half or more of bachelor's degrees in psychology (77%), biological sciences (60%), social sciences (54%), agricultural sciences (50%), and chemistry (50%).\n Among fields with notable increases in the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded to women are earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (from 30% to 41%); agricultural sciences (from 37% to 50%); and chemistry (from 41% to 50%).\n Women's share of bachelor's degrees in computer sciences, mathematics, and engineering has declined in recent years.\n\nThe racial/ethnic composition of those earning S&E bachelor's degrees is changing, reflecting both population change and increasing college attendance by members of minority groups.\n For all racial/ethnic groups except white, the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields has generally increased since 1995.\n Between 1995 and 2007, the proportion of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to Asians/Pacific Islanders increased from 8% to 9%; to black students, from 7% to 8%; to Hispanic students, from 6% to 8%; and to American Indian/Alaska Native students, from 0.5% to 0.7%, although the shares to black and American Indian/Alaska Native students have remained fairly flat since 2000. The proportion of S&E degrees awarded to white students declined from 73% to 64%.\n For white students, the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields remained fairly flat from 1995 through 2001 as their numbers in the collegeage population dropped but rose again through 2007.\nStudents in the United States on temporary visas earned only a small share (4%) of S&E bachelor's degrees in 2007.\n The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to students on temporary visas increased from about 14,700 in 1995 to 18,800 in 2004 before declining to 17,400 in 2007.\n Students on temporary visas earned larger shares of bachelor's degrees in certain fields in 2007: 9% of those awarded in economics and about 10% of those awarded in electrical and industrial engineering.\nGraduate Education, Enrollment, and Degrees\nS&E graduate enrollment in the United States continued to rise, reaching a new peak of almost 600,000 in fall 2006.\n Following a long period of growth, graduate enrollment in S&E declined in the latter half of the 1990s but has increased steadily since 1999. First-time full-time enrollment, an indicator of future trends in enrollment, has also increased since the late 1990s.\n Graduate enrollment in computer sciences and engineering has decreased in recent years, although first-time full-time enrollment in these fields increased in 2005 and 2006.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-5\n\nForeign S&E graduate students in U.S. institutions increased in fall 2006 after 2 years of decline.\n S&E graduate students on temporary visas increased from 22% to 25% of all S&E graduate students from 1993 to 2006.\n The number of first-time full-time S&E graduate students with temporary visas increased in fall 2005 and fall 2006 after declining 18% from 2001 to 2004. The increases (and previous declines) were mainly in computer sciences and engineering.\nMaster's degrees awarded in S&E fields increased from 86,400 in 1993 to 121,000 in 2006 but declined in 2007.\n Increases occurred in most major science fields, although the number of master's degrees awarded in engineering and computer sciences has dropped since 2004.\n The number and percentage of master's degrees awarded to women in most major S&E fields have increased since 1993.\n The number of S&E master's degrees awarded increased for all racial/ethnic groups from 1995 to 2007, and the percentage awarded to Asians/Pacific Islanders, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives increased during that time period.\nThe number of S&E doctorates awarded by U.S. academic institutions reached a new peak of almost 41,000 in 2007.\n After rising from the mid-1980s through 1998, the number of S&E doctorates declined through 2002 but has increased in recent years. The largest increases were in engineering and biological/agricultural and medical/other life sciences.\n The recent growth through 2007 occurred among both U.S. citizens/permanent residents and temporary residents.\nForeign students make up a much higher proportion of S&E master's and doctoral degree recipients than of bachelor's degree recipients.\n Foreign students received 24% of S&E master's degrees, 33% of S&E doctoral degrees, and 4% of S&E bachelor's degrees in 2007.\n The number of S&E master's degrees earned by temporary residents rose from 1995 to 2004 and then dropped through 2007.\n The number of S&E doctorates earned by temporary residents rose to a new peak of 13,700 in 2007.\nMost foreign recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates plan to stay in the United States after graduation.\n Among 2004\u00ad07 graduates, more than three-quarters of foreign S&E doctorate recipients with known plans re-\n\nported they planned to stay in the United States and about half had accepted firm offers of employment.\n More than 90% of 2004\u00ad07 U.S. S&E doctorate recipients from China and 89% of those from India reported plans to stay in the United States, and 59% and 62%, respectively, reported accepting firm offers of employment or postdoctoral research in the United States.\n Between 2000\u00ad03 and 2004\u00ad07, the percentage reporting definite plans to stay in the United States decreased among U.S. S&E doctorate recipients from all of the top five countries/economies of origin (China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada). However, for all but Taiwan, increases in the number of doctorate recipients more than offset declines in the percentage staying.\nPostdoctoral Education\nThe number of doctorate recipients with S&E postdoctoral appointments at U.S. universities increased to almost 50,000 in fall 2006.\n More than two-thirds of academic postdoctoral appointments were in biological and medical/other life sciences.\n Temporary visa holders accounted for 57% of S&E postdocs in 2006. They accounted for much of the increase in the number of S&E postdocs, especially in biological and medical sciences.\n The number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E postdocs at these institutions increased more modestly, from approximately 16,700 in 1993 to 21,100 in 2006.\n An increasing share of academic S&E postdocs are funded through federal research grants. In fall 2006, 56% of S&E postdocs at U.S. universities were funded through this mechanism, up from 52% in 1993. Federal fellowships and traineeships funded a declining share of S&E postdocs.\nInternational S&E Higher Education\nStudents in China earned about 21%, those in the European Union earned about 19%, and those in the United States earned about 11% of the more than 4 million first university degrees awarded in S&E in 2006.\n The number of S&E first university degrees awarded in China, Poland, and Taiwan more than doubled between 1998 and 2006, and those in the United States and many other countries generally increased. Those awarded in Japan decreased in recent years.\n In China, the number of first university degrees awarded in natural sciences and engineering has risen particularly sharply since 2002. In comparison, those awarded in Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States have remained relatively flat.\n\n\f2-6 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\n In the United States, S&E degrees are about one-third of bachelor's degrees and have been for a long time. More than half of first degrees were awarded in S&E fields in Japan (63%), China (53%), and Singapore (51%).\n In the United States, about 5% of all bachelor's degrees are in engineering. In Asia about 20% are in engineering, and in China about one-third are in engineering (although the percentage has declined in recent years).\nIn 2006, the United States awarded the largest number of S&E doctoral degrees of any individual country, followed by China, Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n The numbers of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in China, Italy, and the United States have risen substantially in recent years. The numbers of S&E doctoral degrees in India, Japan, South Korea, and many European countries have risen more modestly.\n Women earned 40% of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in the United States in 2006, about the same as the percentages earned by women in Australia, Canada, the European Union, and Mexico. The percentage of S&E doctoral degrees earned by women ranged from less than 20% in some countries to 50% or more in others.\n\nInternational migration of students and highly skilled workers expanded over the past two decades, and countries are increasingly competing for foreign students. In particular, migration of students occurred from developing countries to the more developed countries and from Europe and Asia to the United States.\n Some countries expanded recruitment of foreign students as their own populations of college-age students decreased, both to attract highly skilled workers and increase revenue for colleges and universities.\n The United States remains the destination of the largest number of foreign students worldwide (undergraduate and graduate), although its share of foreign students worldwide decreased from 25% in 2000 to 20% in 2006.\n In addition to the United States, other countries that are among the top destinations for foreign students include the United Kingdom (11%), Germany (9%), and France (8%).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-7\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nHigher education performs a number of societal functions, including developing human capital, building the knowledge base (through research and knowledge development), and disseminating, using, and maintaining knowledge (OECD 2008). S&E higher education provides the advanced skills needed for a competitive workforce and, particularly in the case of graduate S&E education, the research capability necessary for innovation. This chapter focuses on the development of human capital by higher education; chapter 5 focuses on S&E research.\nIndicators presented in this chapter are discussed in the context of national and global events, including changing demographics, increasing foreign student mobility, and global competition in higher education. After declining in the 1990s, the U.S. college-age population is currently increasing and is projected to increase for the next decade. The composition of the college-age population is also changing, with Asians and Hispanics becoming an increasing share of the population. Recent enrollment and degree trends, to some extent, reflect these changes. Increases in foreign students contributed to most of the growth in overall S&E graduate enrollment in recent years, but after 11 September 2001, the number of foreign students coming to the United States for graduate education dropped. In 2006 the number of foreign S&E graduate students increased (although they have not yet regained earlier levels). Finally, although the United States has historically been a world leader in providing broad access to higher education and in attracting foreign students, many other countries are expanding their own higher education systems, providing expanded educational access to their own population, and attracting growing numbers of foreign students. The effects of these trends, as well as the effects of the recent global financial crisis on domestic and foreign student enrollment in U.S. institutions, remain to be seen.\nThis chapter does not address the issues of quality of higher education or demand for S&E-educated personnel. Although the quality of higher education and especially the quality of learning outcomes are important, adequate national quantitative measures of quality do not yet exist. This chapter makes no attempt to determine whether current or future trends in degrees are adequate for the expected short- or long-term needs of the labor market. For information on labor market conditions for recent S&E graduates, see chapter 3, \"Labor Market Conditions for Recent S&E Graduates,\" particularly the sidebar \"Projected Growth of Employment in S&E Occupations.\" Chapter 5, \"Trends in Academic Employment of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers,\" contains information on academic employment.\n\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter describes characteristics of the U.S. higher education system and trends in higher education worldwide. It begins with characteristics of U.S. higher educational institutions providing S&E education, followed by characteristics of undergraduate education, enrollment, and degrees; graduate education, enrollment, and degrees; and postdoctoral education. Trends are discussed by field and demographic group. The chapter highlights the flow of foreign students into the United States by country and their intentions to remain in this country. The chapter then presents various international higher education indicators, including comparative S&E degree production in several world regions and the growing dependence of all industrialized countries on foreign S&E students.\nThe data in this chapter come from a variety of federal and nonfederal sources, primarily from surveys conducted by the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Division of Science Resources Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics. Most of the data in the chapter are from censuses of the population--for example, all students receiving degrees from U.S. academic institutions--and are not subject to sampling variability. When sample data are used, differences are discussed only if they are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\nThe U.S. Higher Education System\nHigher education in S&E is important, because it produces an educated S&E workforce and an informed citizenry. It has also been receiving increased attention as an important component of U.S. economic competitiveness. In his 24 February 2009 address to a joint session of Congress, President Obama called for every American to commit to at least 1 year of postsecondary education. This section discusses the characteristics of U.S. higher education institutions providing S&E education as well as trends in and the characteristics of students and degree recipients.\nInstitutions Providing S&E Education\nThe U.S. higher education system consists of a large number of diverse academic institutions that vary in their missions, learning environments, selectivity, religious affiliation, types of students served, types of degrees offered, and whether public or private and for-profit or nonprofit (NCES 2008a). The number of these degree-granting institutions (including branch campuses) has increased from about 3,000 in 1975 to about 4,300 in 2007, with most of the growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and again from 2000 to 2007. The latter growth occurred largely because of growth in the number of for-profit institutions (NCES 2009b). In 2007, U.S. academic institutions awarded more than 2.9 million associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees; 23% of these degrees were in S&E (appendix table 2-1).\n\n\f2-8 \nResearch institutions are the leading producers of S&E degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels. In 2007, research institutions (i.e., doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity) awarded 70% of S&E doctoral degrees, 40% of master's degrees, and 36% of bachelor's degrees in S&E fields. (See sidebar \"Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions.\") Master's colleges and universities awarded another 28% of S&E bachelor's degrees and 25% of S&E master's degrees in 2007. Baccalaureate colleges were the source of relatively few S&E bachelor's degrees (13%) (appendix table 2-1). (See sidebar \"Baccalaureate-Origins of S&E Doctorate Recipients.\")\nCommunity colleges (also known as 2-year colleges or associate's colleges) are important in preparing students to enter the workforce with certificates or associate's degrees and in preparing students to transition to 4-year colleges or universities (Karp 2008). Thus, they provide the education needed for S&E or S&E-related occupations that require less than a bachelor's degree, and they provide the first 2 years of many students' education before they transfer to an S&E program at a 4-year college or university. Community colleges serve diverse groups of students and offer a more affordable means of participating in postsecondary education. Compared with 4-year colleges, community colleges enroll greater concentrations of low-income, first-generation, minority, immigrant, part-time, older, and academically underprepared students. The more than 1,000 U.S. community colleges enrolled more than 6 million students, or about a third of all postsecondary students in the 2006\u00ad07 academic year, more than half of whom were enrolled part time (NCES 2008a).\nCommunity colleges also act as a bridge between high school and college. Dual enrollment programs, which enable high school students to take courses that can earn them college credit, are one way to make this link. In 2002\u00ad03, 71% of U.S. public high schools offered dual credit courses, and 57% of U.S. postsecondary institutions had high school students taking courses for college credit (NCES 2005a, b). In 2006, 42 states had dual enrollment policies (WICHE 2006).\nHistorically, dual enrollment opportunities were offered to high-achieving, academically oriented students. However, dual enrollment programs are increasingly viewed as means to support postsecondary achievement by averageachieving students and students in career and technical education programs. Students enrolled in dual enrollment programs can take college courses on a college campus or courses taught by high school teachers certified as college adjuncts. Courses vary in their eligibility requirements and target populations. Dual enrollment programs are presumed to have many positive outcomes, including early acclimation to postsecondary education, increased high school graduation, decreased need for remediation, and success in postsecondary education. Dual enrollment helps to upgrade career and technical education curricula with high-level academic and technical experiences (Karp et al. 2008).\n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\nCarnegie Classification of Academic Institutions\nThe Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is widely used in higher education research to characterize and control for differences in academic institutions. The 2005 version of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's basic classification scheme for colleges and universities is more complex than previous versions and includes subcategories, new names, and new criteria for categories. Academic institutions are categorized primarily on the basis of highest degree conferred, level of degree production, and research activity.* In this report, several categories have been aggregated for statistical purposes. The characteristics of those aggregated groups are as follows:\n Doctorate-granting universities include institutions that award at least 20 doctoral degrees per year. They include three subgroups based on level of research activity: very high research activity (96 institutions), high research activity (103 institutions), and doctoral/research universities (84 institutions).\n Master's colleges and universities include the 663 institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees per year.\n Baccalaureate colleges include the 767 institutions for which baccalaureate degrees represent at least 10% of all undergraduate degrees and that award fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees per year.\n Associate's colleges include the 1,814 institutions in which all degrees are associate's degrees or bachelor's degrees account for less than 10% of all undergraduate degrees.\n Special-focus institutions are the 806 institutions in which at least 75% of degrees are concentrated in a single field or a set of related fields.\n Tribal colleges are the 32 colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.\n* Research activity is based on two indices (aggregate level of research and per capita research activity) derived from a principal components analysis of data on R&D expenditures, S&E research staff, and field of doctoral degree. See http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ for more information on the classification system and on the methodology used in defining the categories.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-9\n\nBaccalaureate Origins of S&E Doctorate Recipients\n\nAlthough baccalaureate colleges produce relatively small numbers of undergraduate S&E degree holders compared with doctorate- and master's-granting institutions, they are important contributors to producing future S&E doctorate recipients (NSF/SRS 2008). When adjusted by the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields, baccalaureate colleges as a group yield more future S&E doctorates per hundred bachelor's degrees awarded than other types of institutions, except research universities. Private institutions, whether research universities or baccalaureate colleges, outperform public institutions in the proportion of their bachelor's degree recipients who go on to receive S&E doctorates. The number of 1997\u00ad2006 S&E doctorate recipients per hundred bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields 9 years earlier is higher among private research universities and a subset of baccalaureate schools, the Oberlin 50 liberal arts schools.* The Oberlin 50 colleges have a higher yield in the social and behavioral sciences and about the same yield in the natural sciences but a far lower yield in engineering than the private research universities. In engineering, the research universities, both public and private, yield more future doctorates than either public or private baccalaureate colleges. The yield of future doctorate recipients is only partly related to the range of fields that the various types of institutions offer. Research institutions (both public and private) and the Oberlin 50 schools award more than half of their bachelor's degrees in S&E fields. Baccalaureate and master's institutions (both public and private) award approximately one-third of their bachelor's degrees in S&E fields.\n\nHistorically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are important baccalaureate-origin institutions of black S&E doctorate recipients. In 2006, about one-third of black S&E doctorate recipients received their baccalaureate degrees from HBCUs. When the data were adjusted for the number of bachelor's degrees awarded, HBCUs as a group yielded about as many future S&E doctorates per thousand bachelor's degrees awarded as non-HBCU institutions. The Oberlin 50 colleges and the private research universities yielded the most S&E doctorate recipients per thousand black recipients of bachelor's degrees, but private HBCUs as a group have a yield similar to private baccalaureate colleges and public research universities. Similarly, Hispanic-serving institutions are important baccalaureate-origin institutions of Hispanic S&E doctorate-recipients. Because few tribal colleges or universities award bachelor's degrees in S&E, tribal colleges are not a major source of American Indian S&E doctorate recipients (NSF/SRS 2009d).\n* The Oberlin 50 institutions are Albion College, Alma College, Amherst College, Antioch University, Barnard College, Bates College, Beloit College, Bowdoin College, Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell University, Carleton College, Colgate University, Colorado College, Davidson College, Denison University, DePauw University, Earlham College, Franklin and Marshall College, Grinnell College, Hamilton College, Hampton University, Harvey Mudd College, Haverford College, College of the Holy Cross, Hope College, Kalamazoo College, Kenyon College, Lafayette College, Macalester College, Manhattan College, Middlebury College, Mount Holyoke College, Oberlin College, Occidental College, Ohio Wesleyan University, Pomona College, Reed College, Smith College, St. Olaf College, Swarthmore College, Trinity College (CT), Union College (NY), Vassar College, Wabash College, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University, Wheaton College (IL), Whitman College, Williams College, and College of Wooster. Two of these institutions (Hampton University and Manhattan College) are now Carnegie master's-granting institutions.\n\nOnline and Distance Education\nOnline education and distance education enable institutions of higher education to reach a wider audience by expanding access to students in remote geographic locations and providing greater flexibility for students who have time constraints. Online education is a relatively new phenomenon and online enrollment has grown substantially over the past 5 years. Institutions believe that higher fuel costs and rising unemployment will drive increased demand for online courses in coming years (Allen and Seaman 2008).\nAbout two-thirds of 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities offer distance education courses (table 2-1). Distance education is prevalent in public 2-year colleges (97%) and public 4-year colleges and universities (88%). A little more than half of private not-for-profit 4-year institutions offered online courses. Public 2-year colleges account for most of the enrollment (4.8 million), followed by public 4-year colleges (3.5 million). Private not-for-profit and\n\nprivate for-profit 4-year institutions both accounted for a little more than 1.8 million enrollments in 2006\u00ad07. Most (more than 80%) of the 3.9 million students who took at least one online course in fall 2007 were undergraduates (Allen and Seaman 2008).\nColleges and universities' most prevalent reasons for offering online courses are meeting students' need for flexible schedules (68%); offering courses to those who would not have access because of geographic, family, or work-related reasons (about two thirds); making more courses available (46%); and seeking to increase student enrollment (45%) (NCES 2009b). A smaller percentage of institutions offering programs in engineering (16%) than those offering programs in other major disciplines (psychology; social sciences and history; computer and information sciences; education; health and related sciences; business; and liberal arts and sciences, general studies, humanities) (from 24% to 33%) offered fully online programs in 2007 (Allen and Seaman 2008).\n\n\f2-10 \n\nChapter 2.

Over the past 10 years, the number of for-profit institutions has grown and the number of degrees that they have awarded has more than doubled (NCES 2009a; appendix table 2-2). In 2007, about 2,800 academic institutions in the United States operated on a for-profit basis. More than half of these institutions offer less-than-2-year programs and less than half are degree-granting institutions. Of the degree-granting institutions, close to half award associate's degrees as their highest degree (NCES 2008b).\nFor-profit academic institutions awarded 2%\u00ad3% of S&E degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels and 29% of those at the associate's level in 2007. Computer sciences accounted for 97% of the associate's degrees and 86% of the bachelor's degrees awarded by for-profit institutions in science and engineering fields in 2007 (appendix table 2-3). For-profit institutions award relatively few S&E master's and doctoral degrees; those they do award are mainly in psychology. For-profit institutions are among the top institutions awarding master's and doctoral degrees in psychology. In addition, a for-profit institution, the University of Phoenix Online Campus, awarded more computer sciences bachelor's degrees than any other academic institution in the United States in 2007 (table 2-2).\n\nCost of Higher Education\nAffordability and access to U.S. higher education institutions are perennial concerns (NCPPHE 2008; NSB 2003). In the 2008\u00ad09 academic year, average tuition and fees at 4-year colleges rose at a rate greater than inflation. Compared with the previous academic year, average tuition and fees rose 6.4% for in-state students at public 4-year colleges, 5.9% for students in private 4-year colleges, and 4.7% for students at public 2-year colleges, while the Consumer Price Index increased by 5.6% between July 2007 and July 2008 (College Board 2008). Another inflation index, the Higher Education Price Index, which measures the average relative level in the price of a fixed-market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities each year, rose 3.6% in that year (Commonfund Institute 2008). For students at public 4-year colleges, tuition and fee increases over the past decade have been larger than in previous decades and the net price (that is, the published price minus grant aid and tax benefits) has risen since 2003\u00ad04 (College Board 2008). In the coming years, greater tuition increases may occur in response to state reductions in higher education funding as a result of the financial downturn that began in 2008.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-11\n\nTable 2-2 Top 10 colleges and universities awarding degrees in computer sciences and psychology, by level of degree: 2007\n\nDegree/academic institution\n\nDegrees (n) Degree/academic institution\n\nDegrees (n)\n\nComputer sciences associate's All institutions............................................................

It also prepares nonmajors to become knowledgeable citizens with a basic understanding of science and mathematics concepts. This section includes indicators related to enrollment and intentions to major in S&E fields, the need for remediation at the college level, and recent trends in the number of earned degrees in S&E fields.\nCurricular Reform\nResearch on how students learn, as well as concern for the number of young people entering S&E, have driven numerous efforts to improve instructional materials and practices and to assess the effectiveness of curricular reforms (Fortenberry et al. 2007; Lewis and Lewis 2008; Quitadamo et al. 2008). Education innovators in all S&E fields are examining problems in student learning and designing ways to address them through integration of disciplinary knowledge and education research.\nMany of these newer methods involve more interaction between students and faculty, improved technology,\n\nteamwork, and applications to real-world problems (Brainard 2007). Although research indicates that many of the newer methods are effective in improving student understanding of the scientific process and fundamental concepts, they are not widely adopted. Universities and departments are often unaware of or resistant to new models of instruction, and strong incentives to improve teaching are often lacking (Brainard 2007).\nRemedial Education\nRemedial education (also known as developmental education) offers below-college-level courses or instruction to students who enter college without skills in reading, writing, or mathematics adequate for college-level courses. In recent years, state university systems have moved remedial education out of 4-year colleges and universities and into community colleges. In the 2003\u00ad04 academic year, about 29% of community college students had taken at least one remedial course in their first year of study (NCES 2008a), and nearly 60% of students take at least one remedial course at some point during their college education (Attewell et al. 2006). Mathematics was the most common remedial course taken in 2004 (NCES 2008a). Although more than half of students pass remedial writing and reading courses, less\n\n\f2-12 \nthan half pass their remedial mathematics courses (Attewell et al. 2006). (For information on the relationship between achievement in science and mathematics courses and postsecondary remediation rates, see chapter 1, \"Relationship of High School Courses Taken to Postsecondary Success.\")\nSome have recently begun to question the effectiveness of remedial education (Bailey 2009; Calcagno and Long 2008). Fewer than half of students in all remedial classes complete the required sequence of remedial courses and few of these students go on to college-level courses (Bailey 2009). States and individual colleges and universities lack consensus on the criteria and cutoff points used for assessing college readiness and on the best strategies to address poor skills. Efforts in some colleges are more effective than others. Although some students may make progress, they still may not reach college-level skills and knowledge. Various efforts have attempted to bridge the gaps in expectations between K\u00ad12 and higher education expectations for achievement (Cohen et al. 2006), and several states are currently developing initiatives to improve remedial education. Chapter 1, \"Transition to Higher Education,\" provides more information on the transition from high school to college as well as information specifically on states' efforts to establish standards for transitioning into higher education.\nUndergraduate Enrollment in the United States\nRecent trends in higher education enrollment reflect the expanding U.S. college-age population. This section examines trends in undergraduate enrollment by type of institution, field, and demographic characteristics. For information on enrollment rates of high school seniors, see chapter 1, \"Transition to Higher Education.\"\nTrends in Enrollment and Degrees in Light of Population and Economic Trends and World Events\nTrends in the college-age population, economic trends, and world events have influenced recent trends in college enrollment and degrees. Population trends and, to a lesser extent, economic factors are also used in projections of future enrollment and degree trends. Undergraduate enrollment, S&E bachelor's degrees, and graduate S&E enrollment have generally risen over time at a faster rate than population growth, reflecting increases in the percentage of the population participating in higher education. The greatest gains in higher education relative to the population occurred in the 1980s (figure 2-1). The college-age (20\u00ad24-year-old) population in the United States declined through the mid1990s, especially for whites (NSF/SRS 2007). Undergraduate enrollment in all fields and bachelor's degrees in some fields declined in that period, and graduate S&E enrollment and S&E doctoral degrees declined a few years later. In contrast to population trends, the economy has generally grown faster than higher education enrollment and degrees. That is, enrollment and degrees have generally declined over time\n\nChapter 2.

This pattern reverses, however, in economic recessions. Upturns in enrollment and degrees relative to GDP occurred during recession periods in 1973\u00ad75, 1980\u00ad 82, 1990\u00ad91, and 2001 (figure 2-1). Finally, higher education enrollment and degrees are affected by world events in very specific ways. For example the dot-com bust in the early 2000s was followed by a precipitous decline in enrollment and degrees in computer sciences, and the 9/11 attacks on the United States were followed by a steep drop in international student enrollment through 2004. (See \"S&E Bachelor's Degrees\" and \"Foreign Undergraduate Enrollment.\")\nOverall Enrollment Enrollment in U.S. institutions of higher education at\nall levels rose from 14.5 million students in fall 1993 to 18.5 million in fall 2007 (appendix table 2-4). More than 7 million students (about 38% of all students enrolled in higher education institutions in the United States) were enrolled in associate's colleges in 2007. Research universities (doctorate-granting universities with very high research activity) accounted for 13% and master's-granting universities accounted for 22% of all students enrolled (appendix table 2-4). (See sidebar \"Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions\" for definitions of the types of academic institutions.) These trends are expected to continue in the near future.\nProjections of High School Graduation and College Enrollment Trends\nBecause of increases in the population of 18-year-olds (rather than changes in graduation rates), the number of high school graduates is expected to increase through 2017, although at a lower rate than in the recent past. The number of high school graduates is projected to increase 6% between 2004\u00ad05 and 2017\u00ad18 to 3.3 million graduates. From 1992\u00ad93 to 2004\u00ad05, the number of high school graduates increased 25% (NCES 2008c). (See chapter 1 for more information on high school graduation rates, course taking, and transition from secondary to postsecondary education.)\nAmong public schools, the number of high school graduates is projected to increase 8% nationally, but large variations exist among the states, with increases projected in 27 states (mainly in the South and West) and the District of Columbia and decreases projected in 23 states (mainly in the Midwest and Northeast) (NCES 2008c). Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, and Utah are projected to have the largest percentage increases. Louisiana, Maine, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and Vermont are projected to have the largest percentage decreases in public high school graduates.\nSimilarly, enrollment in higher education is projected to increase through 2017. These projections are based primarily on population projections but also incorporate information about household income (a measure of ability to pay) and age-specific unemployment rates (a measure of opportunity costs).1 According to Census Bureau projections, the number of college-age (ages 20\u00ad24) individuals is expected\n\nto grow from 21.8 million in 2010 to 28.2 million by 2050 (appendix table 2-5). From 2010 to 2050, Asians are projected to increase from 4% to 6% and Hispanics are projected to increase from 18% to 37% of the college-age population, whereas blacks are projected to decrease from 15% to 12% and whites are projected to decrease from 60% to 40% of the college-age population (NCES 2008c).\nLargely because of these demographic changes, postsecondary enrollment is expected to increase 13%, to 20.1 million students, in 2017 (NCES 2008c). Increased enrollment in higher education is projected to come mainly from minority groups, particularly Hispanics. Enrollment of all racial/ethnic groups is projected to increase, but the percentage that is white is projected to decrease from 65% in 2006 to 61% in 2017, whereas the percentages that are black and Hispanic are projected to increase from 13% and 11%, respectively, to 14% for both groups. (For further information on assumptions underlying these projections, see \"Projection Methodology\" in Projections of Education Statistics to 2017 [NCES 2008c], http://nces.ed.gov/ programs/projections/projections2017/app_a.asp, accessed 23 June 2009.)\nUndergraduate Enrollment in S&E Freshmen Intentions to Major in S&E. Since 1972, the\nannual Survey of the American Freshman, National Norms, administered by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles, has asked freshmen at a large number of universities and colleges about their intended majors.2 The data provided a broadly accurate picture of degree fields several years later.3 For at least the past two decades, about one-third of all freshmen planned to study S&E. In 2008, about one-third of white, black, Hispanic, and American Indian freshmen and 47% of Asian freshmen reported that they intended to major in S&E (figure 2-2). The proportions planning to major in S&E were higher for men than for women in every racial/ethnic group, with the exception of blacks. In 2007 and 2008, similar percentages of black men and black women planned to major in S&E (appendix table 2-6). For most racial/ethnic groups, about 10%\u00ad16% planned to major in social/behavioral sciences, about 6%\u00ad10% in engineering, about 8%\u00ad10% in biological/agricultural sciences, 1%\u00ad2% in computer sciences, 2%\u00ad3% in physical sciences,4 and 1% in mathematics or statistics. Higher proportions of Asian freshmen than of those from other racial/ethnic groups planned to major in biological/agricultural sciences (18%) and engineering (14%). The percentage of all freshmen intending to major in computer sciences has dropped in recent years, whereas the percentage intending to major in biological/agricultural sciences has increased. (See appendix table 2-13 and \"S&E Bachelor's Degrees\" for trends in bachelor's degrees.) Generally, the percentages earning bachelor's degrees in particular S&E fields are similar to the percentages planning to major in those fields, with the exception of engineering and social/ behavioral sciences. The percentage earning bachelor's degrees in engineering is smaller than, and the percentage\n\n\f2-14 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nearning bachelor's degrees in social/behavioral sciences is larger than, previous years' percentages planning to major in those fields. (See NSB 2008, pages 2-24 and 2-25, for a discussion of longitudinal data on undergraduate attrition in S&E.)\nThe demographic composition of students planning S&E majors has become more diverse over time. Women increased from 44% of freshmen planning S&E majors in 1993 to 47% in 2008. White students declined from 79% in 1993 to 69% in 2008. On the other hand, the proportion of Asian students increased from 6% to 12% and the proportion of Hispanic students increased from 4% to 12%. American Indian students were roughly 2% and black students were roughly 11% of freshmen intending to major in S&E in both 1993 and 2008 (appendix table 2-7).\nForeign Undergraduate Enrollment. The number of foreign students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs in U.S. academic institutions rose 5% in the 2007\u00ad08 academic year to approximately 178,000 (IIE 2008). The increase was the second in a row after 4 years of decline, but the number of foreign undergraduates in 2007\u00ad08 was still 7% below the peak in 2001\u00ad02. Among new foreign undergraduates, enrollment increased 7% in 2007\u00ad08, the fourth increase in a row, suggesting that enrollment increases are likely to continue. South Korea (almost 33,000), Japan (almost 21,000), China (16,500), Canada (13,600), and India (13,600) accounted for the largest numbers of foreign undergraduates in the United States in 2007\u00ad08. The number of Chinese undergraduates increased 65% over the previous year and the numbers of South Korean and Indian undergraduates\n\n-PN\\YL  -YLZOTLU PU[LUKPUN :\n, THQVY I` YHJLL[OUPJP[`!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(ZPHU (TLYPJHU Black Mexican American/Chicano/Puerto Rican/ other Latino >OP[L American Indian/Alaska Native\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:6<9*,! /PNOLY ,K\\JH[PVU 9LZLHYJO 0UZ[P[\\[L <UP]LYZP[` VM *HSPMVYUPH H[ 3VZ (UNLSLZ :\\Y]L` VM [OL (TLYPJHU -YLZOTHU! 5H[PVUHS 5VYTZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nincreased 17% and 8%, respectively. Among all foreign students (undergraduate and graduate) in 2007\u00ad08, the number of those studying the physical and life sciences increased 2%; agricultural sciences, 20%; engineering, 7%; and computer sciences, 4%, compared with the preceding year (IIE 2008). The number of foreign students studying mathematics decreased 9%.\nMore recent data from the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services show an 11% increase in undergraduate enrollment of foreign students in science and engineering from April 2008 to April 2009, mostly in engineering. South Korea, China, Japan, Canada, and India were among the top countries sending foreign undergraduates in spring 2009 and were also among the top countries sending foreign S&E undergraduates (figure 2-3; appendix table 2-8). Nepal and Saudi Arabia, which accounted for fewer total undergraduates in the United States, were also among the top countries sending foreign undergraduates in S&E fields, sending more than Canada and Japan.\nEngineering Enrollment. For the most part, undergraduate enrollment data are not available by field. Students often do not declare majors until their sophomore year; thus,\n\n-PN\\YL  -VYLPNU \\UKLYNYHK\\H[L Z[\\KLU[ LUYVSSTLU[ PU <: \\UP]LYZP[PLZ I` [VW  WSHJLZ VM VYPNPU HUK MPLSK!

However, because engineering programs generally require students to declare a major in the first year of college, engineering enrollment data can serve as early indicators of both future undergraduate engineering degrees and student interest in engineering careers. The Engineering Workforce Commission administers an annual fall survey that tracks enrollment in undergraduate and graduate engineering programs (EWC 2008).\nUndergraduate engineering enrollment declined through most of the 1980s and 1990s, rose from 2000 to 2003, declined slightly through 2006, and rose to 431,900 in 2007 (figure 2-4; appendix table 2-9). The number of undergraduate engineering students in 2007 was the highest it has been since the early 1980s. Full-time freshman enrollment followed a similar pattern, reaching 110,600 in 2007, the highest since 1982. These trends correspond with declines in the college-age population through the mid-1990s, particularly the drop in white 20\u00ad24-year-olds, who account for the majority of engineering enrollment (NSF/SRS 2007). Similar trends in undergraduate engineering enrollment are reported by the American Society for Engineering Education (Gibbons 2008).\nUndergraduate Degree Awards\nThe number of degrees awarded by U.S. academic institutions has been increasing over the past two decades both in S&E and non-S&E fields. These trends are expected to continue at least through 2017 (NCES 2008c).\n\n-PN\\YL  ,UNPULLYPUN LUYVSSTLU[ I` SL]LS!   \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ \n<UKLYNYHK\\H[L \n\n\n\n .YHK\\H[L\n\n\n           \n\n \n\n56;,! ,UYVSSTLU[ KH[H PUJS\\KL M\\SS HUK WHY[[PTL Z[\\KLU[Z\n:6<9*,! ,UNPULLYPUN >VYRMVYJL *VTTPZZPVU ,UNPULLYPUN \n ;LJOUVSVN` ,UYVSSTLU[Z ]HYPV\\Z `LHYZ (TLYPJHU (ZZVJPH[PVU VM ,UNPULLYPUN :VJPL[PLZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nS&E Associate's Degrees Community colleges often are an important and relatively\ninexpensive gateway for students entering higher education. Associate's degrees, largely offered by 2-year programs at community colleges, are the terminal degree for some people, but others continue their education at 4-year colleges or universities and subsequently earn higher degrees.5 Many who transfer to baccalaureate granting institutions do not earn associate's degrees before transferring. Associate's degrees in S&E and engineering technology accounted for about 11% of all associate's degrees in 2007 (appendix table 2-10).\nS&E associate's degrees from all types of academic institutions rose from 23,400 in 1993 to 62,800 in 2003, before declining to 47,500 in 2007. Most of the increase through 2003, and the subsequent decrease, are attributable to computer sciences, which peaked in 2003. Associate's degrees earned in engineering technology (not included in S&E degree totals because of their applied focus) declined from more than 40,000 in the early 1990s to 30,100 in 2007 (appendix table 2-10).\nWomen earned 62% of all associate's degrees in 2007, up from 59% in 1993. They earned a smaller and decreasing share of associate's degrees in S&E: 39% in 2007, down from 48% in 1993. Most of the decline is attributable to a decrease in women's share of computer sciences degrees, from 51% in 1993 to 26% in 2007 (appendix table 2-10).\nStudents from underrepresented groups (blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians) earn a higher proportion of associate's degrees than of bachelor's or more advanced degrees.6 (See \"S&E Bachelor's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity\" and \"Doctoral Degrees by Race/Ethnicity.\") In 2007, they earned 27% of S&E associate's degrees, more than onethird of all associate's degrees in social and behavioral sciences, and more than one-quarter of all associate's degrees in biological sciences, computer sciences, and mathematics (appendix table 2-11). Since 1995, the number of S&E associate's degrees earned by these students doubled.\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees The baccalaureate is the most prevalent S&E degree, ac-\ncounting for more than 70% of all S&E degrees awarded. S&E bachelor's degrees have consistently accounted for roughly one-third of all bachelor's degrees for the past 15 years. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees rose steadily from 366,000 in 1993 to 485,800 in 2007 (appendix table 2-12).\nTrends in the number of S&E bachelor's degrees vary widely among fields (figure 2-5). The number of bachelor's degrees earned in social and behavioral sciences plateaued for much of the 1990s, before rising again through 2007. In engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences, the number of bachelor's degrees dropped in the late 1990s, but\n\n\f2-16 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nthen rose through 2007. In computer sciences, the number of bachelor's degrees increased sharply from 1998 to 2004, then dropped sharply through 2007. Except for declines from 2000 to 2002, bachelor's degrees in biological sciences have been generally increasing, reaching a new peak in 2007 (appendix table 2-12).\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees by Sex. Since 1982, women have outnumbered men in undergraduate education and have earned relatively constant fractions of all bachelor's and S&E bachelor's degrees for several years. Since 2002, women have earned about 58% of all bachelor's degrees; since 2000, they have earned about half of all S&E bachelor's degrees. Within S&E, men and women tend to study different fields. In 2007, men earned a majority of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering, computer sciences, and physics (81%, 81%, and 79%, respectively). Women earned half or more of bachelor's degrees in psychology (77%), agricultural sciences (50%), biological sciences (60%), chemistry (50%), and social sciences (54%) (appendix table 2-12).\nAlthough gains in recent years have been more modest or nonexistent, the share of bachelor's degrees awarded to women in many major S&E fields has increased (except computer sciences and mathematics) over the past 15 years (figure 2-6). Among fields with notable increases in the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded to women are earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (from 30% to 41%);\n\n-PN\\YL  :\n, IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ KLNYLLZ I` MPLSK! \n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n :VJPHSILOH]PVYHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)PVSVNPJHSHNYPJ\\S[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n4H[OLTH[PJZ    \n\n  \n\n\n\n56;,:! 7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KL LHY[O H[TVZWOLYPJ HUK VJLHU ZJPLUJLZ +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY  \n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ 0U[LNYH[LK 7VZ[ZLJVUKHY` ,K\\JH[PVU +H[H :`Z[LT *VTWSL[PVUZ :\\Y]L`\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nagricultural sciences (from 37% to 50%); and chemistry (from 41% to 50%) (appendix table 2-12).\nThe number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women in S&E and in all fields rose from 1993 through 2007. In contrast, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to men in S&E and in all fields remained fairly flat in the 1990s but increased from 2001 through 2007.7\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity. The racial/ethnic composition of S&E bachelor's degree recipients has changed over time, reflecting population changes and increasing college attendance by members of minority groups.8 Between 1995 and 2007, the proportion of S&E degrees awarded to white students declined from 73% to 64% (appendix table 2-13). The proportion awarded to Asians/ Pacific Islanders increased from 8% to 9%; to black students, from 7% to 8%; to Hispanic students, from 6% to 8%; and to American Indian/Alaska Native students, from 0.5% to 0.7%, although the shares to black and American Indian/ Alaska Native students have remained fairly flat since 2000 (figure 2-7). The number of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by white students decreased in the 1990s as their numbers in the college-age population dropped but then rose again through 2007. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by students of unknown race/ethnicity also increased (appendix table 2-13). (See sidebar \"Increase in Student Nonreporting of Race/Ethnicity\" in Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 [NSB 2008].)\n\n-PN\\YL  -LTHSL ZOHYL VM :\n, IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ KLNYLLZ I` MPLSK!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n 7Z`JOVSVN`\n\n\n)PVSVNPJHSHNYPJ\\S[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ \n\n\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n4H[OLTH[PJZ \n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n *VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n ,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n56;,:! 7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KL LHY[O H[TVZWOLYPJ HUK VJLHU ZJPLUJLZ +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY  \n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ 0U[LNYH[LK 7VZ[ZLJVUKHY` ,K\\JH[PVU +H[H :`Z[LT *VTWSL[PVUZ :\\Y]L`\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-17\n\nDespite considerable progress over the past couple of decades for underrepresented minority groups earning bachelor's degrees in any field, the gap in educational attainment between young minorities and whites continues to be wide. The percentage of the population ages 25\u00ad29 with bachelor's or higher degrees was 20% for blacks, 12% for Hispanics, and 36% for whites in 2007, up from 12%, 9%, and 25%, respectively, in 1987 (NCES 2008a). Differences in completion of bachelor's degrees in S&E by race/ethnicity reflect differences in high school completion rates, college enrollment rates, and college persistence and attainment rates. In general, blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders to graduate from high school, to enroll in college, and to graduate from college. (For information on immediate post-high school college enrollment rates, see chapter 1, \"Transition to Higher Education.\") Among those who do enroll in or graduate from college, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives are about as likely as whites to choose S&E fields; Asians/Pacific Islanders are more likely than members of other racial/ethnic groups to choose these fields. For Asians/Pacific Islanders, almost half of all bachelor's degrees received are in S&E, compared with about one-third of all bachelor's degrees earned by each of the other racial/ethnic groups (appendix table 2-13).\nThe contrast in field distribution among whites, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives on the one hand and Asians/Pacific Islanders on the other is apparent\n\n-PN\\YL  4PUVYP[` ZOHYL VM :\n, IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ KLNYLLZ I` YHJL L[OUPJP[`!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n (ZPHU7HJPMPJ 0ZSHUKLY\n\n\n\n)SHJR\n\n/PZWHUPJ \n\n\n\n (TLYPJHU 0UKPHU(SHZRH 5H[P]L\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY   +H[H I` KL[HPSLK MPLSK HUK YHJLL[OUPJP[` UV[ H]HPSHISL ILMVYL  \n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ 0U[LNYH[LK 7VZ[ZLJVUKHY` ,K\\JH[PVU +H[H :`Z[LT *VTWSL[PVUZ :\\Y]L`\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nwithin S&E fields as well. White, black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native S&E baccalaureate recipients share a similar distribution across broad S&E fields. In 2007, between 9% and 11% of all baccalaureate recipients in each of these racial/ethnic groups earned their degrees in the natural sciences,9 2% to 4% in engineering, and 15% to 18% in the social and behavioral sciences. Asian/Pacific Islander baccalaureate recipients earned 19% of their bachelor's degrees in natural sciences and 9% in engineering (appendix table 2-13).\nFor all racial/ethnic groups (except white), the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields (except computer sciences) has generally increased since 1995. For white students, the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields remained fairly flat from 1995 through 2001 but have increased since then (appendix table 2-13).\nBachelor's Degrees by Citizenship. Since 1995, students on temporary visas in the United States have consistently earned a small share (4%) of S&E degrees at the bachelor's level. These students earned 9% of bachelor's degrees awarded in economics in 2007 and about 10% of degrees awarded in electrical and industrial engineering. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to students on temporary visas increased from about 14,700 in 1995 to about 18,800 in 2004 before declining to 17,400 in 2007 (appendix table 2-13).\nGraduate Education, Enrollment, and Degrees in the United States\nGraduate S&E educational institutions are a major source of both the highly skilled workers of the future and the research needed for a knowledge-based economy. This section includes indicators related to graduate enrollment, financial support for graduate education, recent trends in the number of earned degrees in S&E fields, and participation by women, minorities, and foreign students in graduate education in U.S. academic institutions.\nGraduate Enrollment in S&E\nS&E graduate enrollment in the United States reached a new peak of 597,600 in fall 2006. Following a long period of growth that began in the 1970s (NSB 2008), graduate enrollment in S&E declined in the latter half of the 1990s, then increased steadily through 2006 (appendix table 2-14). Growth occurred through 2006 in most major science and engineering fields except agricultural sciences (which remained fairly flat) and computer sciences (which has been declining for several years). In engineering, enrollment dropped in recent years but rose in 2006. According to more recent data from the Engineering Workforce Commission\n\n\f2-18 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nand the American Society for Engineering Education (Gibbons 2008), graduate engineering enrollment continued to rise in 2007. Moreover, the number of full-time engineering students reached a new peak in 2007 of 104,900 (figure 2-4; appendix table 2-15).\nThe number of full-time students enrolled for the first time in S&E graduate departments offers a good indicator of developing trends. The number of first-time full-time S&E graduate students also reached a new peak (116,500) in 2006. It declined in the mid-1990s in all major S&E fields but increased in most fields through 2006 (appendix table 2-16). Growth was greatest in biological sciences, medical/other life sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. After declines in recent years, first-time full-time graduate enrollment in engineering and computer sciences increased in 2005 and 2006.\nEnrollment by Sex The increase in S&E graduate enrollment occurred across\nall major U.S. citizen and permanent resident demographic groups. The number of women enrolled in S&E graduate programs has increased steadily since 1993. In contrast, the number of men enrolled in S&E graduate programs declined from 1993 through the end of that decade before increasing through 2003 and remaining more or less at that level through 2006 (appendix table 2-14).\nWomen's rising percentages in S&E fields also continued. Women made up 42% of S&E graduate students in 1993 and 50% in 2006, although large variations among fields persist. In 2006, women constituted the majority of graduate students in psychology (76%), medical/other life sciences (78%), biological sciences (56%), and social sciences (54%). They constituted close to half of graduate students in earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (47%) and agricultural sciences (48%) and more than one-third of graduate students in mathematics (37%), chemistry (40%), and astronomy (34%). Their percentages in computer sciences (25%), engineering (23%), and physics (20%) were low in 2006, although higher than in 1993 (23%, 15%, and 14%, respectively) (appendix table 2-14).\nEnrollment by Race/Ethnicity The proportion of underrepresented minority (black,\nHispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native) students in graduate S&E programs increased from about 8% in 1993 to about 11% in 2006.10 Increases occurred in all major science fields and in engineering during that period (appendix table 2-17). In 2006, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives as a group made up 6%\u00ad7% of graduate enrollment in many S&E fields (engineering; mathematics; physical sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and computer sciences), 8%\u00ad10% of graduate enrollment in agricultural and biological sciences, 15% in medical/other life sciences, 17% in social sciences, and 19% in psychology. Asians/Pacific Islanders accounted for about 6% of S&E graduate enrollment in 2006, up from 5% in 1993.\n\nThe number of white S&E graduate students decreased from 1994 to 2001 and then increased through 2006, whereas the numbers of Asian, black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native students increased almost every year from 1993 through 2006 (figure 2-8). The rise in the numbers of black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native graduate students occurred in most S&E fields. The number of Asian students increased in most science fields but decreased in engineering and in computer sciences in the past 3 or 4 years (appendix table 2-17).\nForeign Student Enrollment Foreign graduate student enrollment in S&E grew from\n110,300 in 1993 to 155,000 in 2003, declined for 2 years, and increased slightly in 2006 to 151,000. Foreign students increased from 22% to 25% of all S&E graduate students from 1993 to 2006 (appendix table 2-17). The concentration of foreign enrollment was highest in engineering (45%), computer sciences (44%), physical sciences (40%), mathematics (36%), and economics (52%).11\nFirst-time full-time enrollment of foreign S&E graduate students increased in fall 2005 and fall 2006 after declining 18% from 2001 through 2004. The numbers still remain slightly below those of 2001 (appendix table 2-18). Declines and subsequent increases were concentrated mainly in engineering and computer sciences, fields heavily favored by\n\n-PN\\YL  :\n, NYHK\\H[L LUYVSSTLU[ I` JP[PaLUZOPW HUK YHJL L[OUPJP[`!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>OP[L\n\n;LTWVYHY` YLZPKLU[\n\n(ZPHU7HJPMPJ 0ZSHUKLY\n\n\n\n)SHJR 6[OLY\\URUV^U YHJLL[OUPJP[`\n\n/PZWHUPJ\n\n(TLYPJHU 0UKPHU(SHZRH 5H[P]L \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n       \n\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM .YHK\\H[L :[\\KLU[Z HUK 7VZ[ KVJ[VYH[LZ PU :JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-19\n\nforeign students. Foreign students' share of first-time fulltime S&E graduate enrollment dropped from 35% in fall 2000 to 30% in fall 2006, with most of the decrease in computer sciences (from 71% to 62%) and engineering (from 61% to 55%) (appendix table 2-18).\nAccording to data collected by the Institute of International Education (IIE 2009), the overall number of foreign graduate students in all fields increased 5% from academic year 2006\u00ad07 to 2007\u00ad08, with almost all of the increase occurring among master's degree students. The number of foreign doctoral students increased 0.9% to approximately 109,000, and the number of foreign master's students increased 9% to approximately 133,700. The number of new foreign graduate students rose 8%. India, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada are the top places of origin for foreign graduate students. More than half of all foreign graduate students are studying S&E.\nMore recent data from the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services show a continuing increase in foreign graduate students from April 2008 to April 2009, with foreign enrollment in S&E fields growing 8% (appendix table 2-19). As in the recent past, most of the growth was in computer sciences (up 13%) and engineering (up 11%). Two countries--India, with 56,680 foreign S&E graduate students, and China, with 36,890--accounted for more than half of the foreign S&E graduates in the United States in April 2009. South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey also sent large numbers of S&E graduate students, although South Korea and Taiwan sent far larger numbers of graduate students in non-S&E fields (primarily business and humanities).\nFinancial Support for S&E Graduate Education\nMore than one-third of all S&E graduate students are self-supporting; that is, they rely primarily on loans, their own funds, or family funds for financial support. The other approximately two-thirds receive primary financial support from a variety of sources, including the federal government, university sources, employers, nonprofit organizations, and foreign governments.\nSupport mechanisms include research assistantships (RAs), teaching assistantships (TAs), fellowships, and traineeships. Sources of funding include federal agency support, nonfederal support, and self-support. Nonfederal support includes state funds, particularly in the large public university systems; these funds are affected by the condition of overall state budgets. Most graduate students, especially those who pursue doctoral degrees, are supported by more than one source or mechanism during their time in graduate school, and some receive support from several different sources and mechanisms in any given academic year.\nOther than self-support, RAs are the most prevalent primary mechanism of financial support for S&E graduate students. In 2006, a little more than one-fourth of full-time S&E graduate students were supported primarily by RAs, 18%\n\nwere primarily supported through TAs, and 12% relied primarily on fellowships or traineeships (appendix table 2-20).\nPrimary mechanisms of support differ widely by S&E field of study (appendix table 2-21). For example, in fall 2006 full-time students in physical sciences were financially supported mainly through RAs (42%) and TAs (38%) (figure 2-9). RAs also were important in agricultural sciences (57%); biological sciences (42%); earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (41%); and engineering (40%). In mathematics, more than half (53%) of full-time students were supported primarily through TAs and another 21% were self-supported. Full-time students in the social and behavioral sciences were mainly self-supporting (46%) or received TAs (20%), and students in medical/other life sciences were mainly self-supporting (60%).\nThe federal government served as the primary source of financial support for one-fifth of full-time S&E graduate students in 2006 (appendix table 2-22). The federal government plays a substantial role in supporting S&E graduate students through some mechanisms and in some fields, and a smaller role in others. For example, in 2006 the federal government\n\n-PN\\YL  -\\SS[PTL :\n, NYHK\\H[L Z[\\KLU[Z I` MPLSK HUK TLJOHUPZT VM WYPTHY` Z\\WWVY[! \n\n9LZLHYJO HZZPZ[HU[ZOPW\n\n-LSSV^ZOPW\n\n;YHPULLZOPW\n\n;LHJOPUN HZZPZ[HU[ZOPW\n\n6[OLY\n\n:LSMZ\\WWVY[\n\n:\n,\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n(NYPJ\\S[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ ,HY[O H[TVZWOLYPJ HUK VJLHU ZJPLUJLZ *VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n4H[OLTH[PJZZ[H[PZ[PJZ 4LKPJHSV[OLY SPML ZJPLUJLZ\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n7Z`JOVSVN`\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n56;,! :LSMZ\\WWVY[ PUJS\\KLZ HU` SVHUZ PUJS\\KPUN MLKLYHS HUK Z\\WWVY[ MYVT WLYZVUHS VY MHTPS` MPUHUJPHS JVU[YPI\\[PVUZ\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM .YHK\\H[L :[\\KLU[Z HUK 7VZ[KVJ[VYH[LZ PU :JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f2-20 \n\nChapter 2.

Federal financial support for graduate education reaches relatively more students in the biological sciences; the physical sciences; the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and engineering. Relatively fewer students in computer sciences, mathematics, other life sciences, psychology, and social sciences receive federal support (figure 2-10). Appendix table 2-22 provides detailed information by field and mechanism. (For information on federal academic R&D funding by discipline, see chapter 5, \"Expenditures by Field and Funding Source.\")\nMost federal financial support for graduate education is in the form of RAs funded through grants to universities for academic research. RAs are the primary mechanism of support for 69% of federally supported full-time S&E graduate students, up from 66% in 1993. Fellowships and traineeships are the means of funding for 21% of the federally funded full-time S&E graduate students. The share of federally supported S&E graduate students receiving traineeships declined from 15% in 1993 to 12% in 2006, and the share receiving fellowships declined from 11% to 10%.

In 2006, they supported about 27,600 and 20,300 students, respectively. Trends in federal agency support of graduate students show considerable increases from 1993 to 2006 in the proportion of students funded (NIH, from 27% to 33%; NSF, from 20% to 24%). Support from the U.S. Department of Defense declined from 14% to 11% of federally supported graduate students (appendix table 2-23).\nFor doctoral degree students, notable differences exist in primary support mechanisms by type of doctorate-granting institution. In 2007, the primary support mechanism for S&E doctorate recipients from research universities (i.e., doctorategranting institutions with very high research activity, which receive the most federal funding) was RAs. For those from medical schools, which are heavily funded by NIH, the primary support mechanism was fellowships or traineeships, and for those from doctoral/research universities, which receive less federal funding, the primary support mechanism was personal funds (table 2-3). These differences by type of institution hold for all S&E fields (NSF/SRS 2000). As noted earlier in this chapter, about 70% of S&E doctorate recipients received their doctorate from research universities with very high research activity.\nNotable differences also exist for doctoral degree students in primary support mechanisms by sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents in 2007, men were more likely than women to be supported by RAs (29% compared with 21%) and women were more likely than men to support themselves from personal sources (21% compared with 13%). Also, among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, whites and Asians were more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to receive primary support from RAs (26% and 32%, respectively), whereas underrepresented minorities depended more on fellowships or traineeships (35%). The primary source of support for doctoral degree students with temporary visas was an RA (54%) (appendix table 2-24).\nWhite and Asian men, as well as foreign doctoral degree students, are more likely than white and Asian women and underrepresented minority doctoral degree students of both sexes to receive doctorates in engineering and physical sciences, fields largely supported by RAs. Women and underrepresented minorities are more likely than other groups to receive doctorates in social sciences and psychology, fields in which self-support is prevalent. Differences in type of support by sex, race/ethnicity, or citizenship remain, however, even accounting for doctorate field (NSF/SRS 2000). Although remaining differences in self-support are small (2\u00ad3 percentage points) in some fields, differences between men and women in self-support remain substantial (13\u00ad25 percentage points) in computer and health sciences, and differences between underrepresented minorities and whites in RA support remain substantial (15\u00ad31 percentage points) in\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-21\n\nagricultural sciences; computer sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; physical sciences; and engineering.\nAt the time of doctoral degree conferral, 44% of S&E doctorate recipients have debt related to their undergraduate or graduate education. More than one-fourth have some undergraduate debt and about one-third owe money directly related to graduate education. In 2007, 27% of S&E doctorate recipients reported having undergraduate debt and 30% reported having graduate debt. For some, debt levels were high, especially for graduate debt: 0.3% reported more than $70,000 of undergraduate debt and 4% reported more than $70,000 of graduate debt (appendix table 2-25).\nLevels of debt vary widely by doctorate fields. In 2007, high levels of graduate debt were most common among doctorate recipients in psychology, social sciences, and medical/other health sciences. Psychology doctorate recipients were most likely to report having graduate debt and also high levels of debt.12 In 2007, 16% of psychology doctoral degree recipients reported graduate debt of more than $70,000. Doctorate recipients in engineering; biological sciences; computer sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; mathematics; and physical sciences were least likely to report graduate debt. A higher percentage of doctorate recipients in non-S&E fields than those in S&E fields reported graduate debt.\nInterdisciplinary Education\nThe scientific community increasingly views interdisciplinary research as critical to innovation and scientific advance and as a means to respond to emerging complex problems (COSEPUP 1995, 2004; NSF/DGE 2009). Over\n\nthe past decade, academic institutions and federal funding agencies have made efforts to promote interdisciplinary education and research. Although new programs and efforts have arisen, academic institutions and funding agencies remain for the most part organized around disciplines; thus, university structures, evaluation and promotion practices, and funding opportunities often do not facilitate interdisciplinary research (NSF/DGE 2009). Measurement of interdisciplinary enrollment and degree attainment also remains a challenge, as students often are assigned to only one department or program to avoid duplication in records, and schools are asked to report the enrollment or degree in only one department or program. As interdisciplinary degree programs become established and award degrees, measurement becomes easier. For example, the number of doctoral degrees increased in interdisciplinary fields such as neuroscience (from 117 in 1982 to 737 in 2006), materials science (from 147 in 1982 to 582 in 2006), and bioengineering (from 59 in 1982 to 525 in 2006) (NSF/SRS 1993, 2009c). For information based on students' own reports of their research, see the sidebar \"Interdisciplinary Dissertation Research.\"\nS&E Master's Degrees\nIn some fields, such as engineering and geology, a master's degree is often the terminal degree for students. In other fields, master's degrees are a step toward doctoral degrees, and in certain others, master's degrees are awarded when students fail to advance to the doctoral level. Professional master's degree programs, which stress interdisciplinary\n\nTable 2-3 Primary support mechanisms for S&E doctorate recipients, by Carnegie classification of doctorate-granting institution: 2007\n(Percent distribution)\n\nMechanism\n\nAll institutions\n\nResearch universities (very high research activity)\n\nResearch universities (high research\nactivity)\n\nMedical schools\n\nDoctoral/research and medical Other/not\n\nuniversities\n\ncenters classified\n\nDoctorate recipients (n) ..................\n\n33,826\n\n24,860\n\n6,045\n\n1,118\n\n1,110\n\n693\n\nAll mechanisms ..............................

(See sidebar \"Professional Science Master's Degrees.\")\nMaster's degrees in S&E fields increased from 86,400 in 1993 to 121,000 in 2006 before dropping slightly in 2007 (appendix table 2-26). Increases occurred in most major science fields. Master's degrees in engineering and computer sciences have dropped since 2004 (figure 2-11).\nMaster's Degrees by Sex The number of S&E master's degrees earned by women\nrose from about 31,000 in 1993 to about 54,900 in 2007 (figure 2-12). The number of master's degrees earned by men grew more slowly, from about 55,500 in 1993 to about 65,400 in 2007, with most of the growth between 2002 and 2004. The number of S&E master's degrees earned by men declined between 2005 and 2007. As a result, the\nInterdisciplinary Dissertation Research\nOne indicator of interdisciplinary research is the number of doctorate recipients reporting two or more dissertation fields. A recent analysis from the Survey of Earned Doctorates shows that during the period 2004\u00ad07, the share of doctorate recipients reporting more than one dissertation research field fluctuated between 28% and 30% (NSF/SRS 2009a).\nThe report found that interdisciplinary research at the dissertation research level occurred mostly within the same knowledge domain, whether science (80.2%), engineering (58.5%), or non-science and engineering (non-S&E, 69.3%). Respondents who reported a primary dissertation field in the sciences most frequently reported a secondary research field within the same broad field in the sciences. However, this varied considerably by field of primary dissertation research, from the biological sciences (81.2%) to computer sciences (11.2%). About half of the doctorate recipients who reported a primary dissertation research field in the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; the physical sciences; psychology; or the social sciences reported a secondary dissertation research field within the same broad field. The biological sciences were also the most frequent secondary dissertation research field across all the other sciences except the social sciences.\nAbout 29% of mathematics and 11% of computer sciences doctorate holders listed a secondary field within the same respective major field. Dissertations in which the primary research field was computer sciences most frequently had engineering (24.9%) or a non-S&E field (20.1%) as the secondary dissertation research field. Dissertations with mathematics as the primary research field most often had biological sciences (24.6%) or engineering (11.7%) as the secondary field.\n\npercentage of women earning master's degrees rose steadily during that time period. In 1993, women earned 36% of all S&E master's degrees; by 2007, they earned 46% (appendix table 2-26).\nProfessional Science Master's Degrees\nPartially in response to the call for more realistic programs to serve the nation's S&E needs and students' professional goals, a number of universities have developed Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs (CGS 2008d; Colwell 2009; NAS 2008; NPSMA 2009). These programs are designed to prepare people to work primarily in nonacademic sectors as laboratory administrators or project directors in, for example, large government or industrial laboratories or in small startup companies. They serve people who need advanced technical training (beyond the bachelor's degree) within an S&E field combined with knowledge of and skills in business fundamentals, management, team building, and communication. Prospective students include people already working as S&E professionals and others who feel the \"strictly research\" approach does not appeal to them. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) includes funds specifically for support of such programs.*\nStarting from a handful of PSM programs in 1997, there are now more than 125 such programs in more than 60 institutions in 25 states and the District of Columbia in disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biological sciences, computational science, forensics, chemistry, and geographical information systems. Most PSM programs are interdisciplinary in nature. About 2,500 students are enrolled annually, and these numbers are increasing. Student enrollment is highest in the biological sciences and biotechnology disciplines. More than 2,100 PSM students have graduated thus far, and 65% of these graduates have found employment in industry or government (NPSMA 2009). Many PSM programs were initiated with startup funds from the Sloan Foundation and the Council of Graduate Schools with the intent that they become self-supporting as their value to industry and their students' professional aspirations become apparent. Also of note are the growing number of such programs abroad, as other nations see the value of preparing an S&Etrained managerial workforce, and the growing interest in them of professional societies and journals (CGS 2008a; Teitelbaum and Cox 2007).\n* See the Joint Explanatory Statement\u00adDivision A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, http://www.rules. house.gov/bills_details.aspx?NewsID=4149, accessed 12 June 2009.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-23\n\nWomen's share of S&E master's degrees varies by field.

Women earned a small share of master's degrees in engineering, although their share in 2007 (23%) was higher than their share in 1993 (15%) (appendix table 2-26). The number of master's degrees awarded to women in most major S&E fields increased through 2005 but has flattened or declined since then.\nMaster's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity The number of S&E master's degrees awarded to U.S.\ncitizens and permanent residents increased for all racial/ ethnic groups between 1995 and 2007, although degrees to white students dropped from 1997 to 2002 before increasing again (figure 2-13; appendix table 2-27).13\nThe proportion of master's degrees in S&E fields earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident racial and ethnic minorities increased over the past two decades. Asians/ Pacific Islanders accounted for 8% of S&E master's degrees in 2007, up from 6% in 1995. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives also registered gains during this period (from 4% to 7% for blacks, from 3% to 5% for Hispanics, and from 0.3% to 0.5% for American Indians/ Alaska Natives). The percentage of S&E master's degrees earned by white students fell from 58% in 1995 to 49% in 2007 as the percentage of degrees earned by minorities and temporary residents increased (appendix table 2-27).\n\n-PN\\YL  :\n, THZ[LY\u00bbZ KLNYLLZ I` YHJLL[OUPJP[` HUK JP[PaLUZOPW!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n >OP[L\n\n(ZPHU7HJPMPJ 0ZSHUKLY\n\n\n\n)SHJR /PZWHUPJ\n\n(TLYPJHU 0UKPHU\n\n(SHZRH 5H[P]L\n\n\n\n;LTWVYHY` YLZPKLU[\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n56;,:! 9HJLL[OUPJP[` PUJS\\KLZ <: JP[PaLUZ HUK WLYTHULU[ YLZPKLU[Z +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY  \n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ 0U[LNYH[LK 7VZ[ZLJVUKHY` ,K\\JH[PVU +H[H :`Z[LT *VTWSL[PVUZ :\\Y]L`\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f2-24 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nMaster's Degrees by Citizenship Foreign students make up a much higher proportion of\nS&E master's degree recipients than of bachelor's or associate's degree recipients. In 2007, foreign students earned 24% of S&E master's degrees. Their degrees are heavily concentrated in computer sciences and engineering, where they earned 39% and 38%, respectively, of all master's degrees awarded in 2007 (appendix table 2-27). Within engineering, students on temporary visas earned half of the master's degrees in electrical engineering.\nS&E master's degrees awarded to students on temporary visas rose from approximately 22,200 in 1995 to about 35,500 in 2004, then declined to 28,700 in 2007. Most of the decline in recent years is accounted for by declines in computer sciences and engineering.\nS&E Doctoral Degrees\nDoctoral education in the United States prepares a new generation of faculty and researchers in academia, as well as a high-skilled workforce for other sectors of the economy. It also generates new knowledge important for the society as a whole and for U.S. competitiveness in a global knowledgebased economy.\nAfter rising from the mid-1980s through 1998, the number of S&E doctorates conferred annually by U.S. universities declined through 2002 but increased in recent years, reaching a new peak of almost 41,000 in 2007 (NSB 2008; appendix table 2-28). The recent growth through 2007 occurred among both U.S. citizens/permanent residents and temporary residents. The largest increases were in engineering, biological/agricultural sciences, and medical/other life sciences (figure 2-14).\nTime to Doctoral Degree Completion The time required to earn a doctoral degree and the suc-\ncess rates of those entering doctoral programs are concerns for those pursuing a degree, the universities awarding the degree, and the agencies and organizations funding graduate study (NORC 2007). (See sidebar \"Doctoral Completion and Attrition.\") Time to degree (as measured by time from graduate school entry to doctorate receipt) increased through the mid-1990s but since then has decreased for S&E fields as a whole and for each field (appendix table 2-29). The physical sciences, mathematics, biological sciences, and engineering had the shortest time to degree, while the social sciences and medical/other life sciences had the longest. In 2007, the median time to doctorate receipt was 6.4 years in physical sciences, 6.9 years in mathematics and biological sciences, 7.0 years in engineering, 8.9 years in social sciences, and 9.7 years in medical/other life sciences. From 1995 to 2007, time to degree shortened in each of these fields. In science and engineering as a whole, median time to degree decreased from 8.0 to 7.2 years during this period.\nTime to degree for doctorate recipients decreased in each of the Carnegie types of academic institutions awarding doctoral degrees from 1993 to 2007. (See sidebar \"Carnegie\n\nClassification of Academic Institutions.\") The majority of S&E doctorates are earned at research universities (i.e., doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity). Time to degree is shortest at these universities: 7.0 years for 2007, down from 7.8 in 1993. Doctorate recipients at medical schools also finish quickly (7.1 years in 2007). Time to degree is longer at research universities with high research activity (7.9 years) and longest at doctoral/research universities (9.0 years) (table 2-4).\nDoctoral Degrees by Sex Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, the pro-\nportion of S&E doctoral degrees earned by women has risen considerably since 1993, reaching a record high of 55% in 2007 (appendix table 2-28). During this period, women made gains in most major fields, but considerable differences by field continue. In 2007, women earned half or more of doctorates in non-S&E fields, in social/behavioral sciences, and in medical/other life sciences, but they earned considerably less than half of doctorates in physical sciences (31%), mathematics/computer sciences (26%), and engineering (23%) (appendix table 2-28).

The number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident women earning doctorates in S&E increased from 6,800 in 1993 to 15,000 in 2007 (appendix table 2-28). Meanwhile, the number of S&E doctorates earned by U.S. citizen or permanent resident men increased from 10,900\nDoctoral Completion and Attrition\nAn ongoing study by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS 2008c) collected data on doctoral completion and attrition of doctoral students from the 1992\u00ad93 academic year to the 2003\u00ad04 academic year from about 30 academic institutions for 5 broad fields: engineering, mathematics and physical sciences, the life sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. The study, which focused on 10-year completion and attrition rates, revealed that 57% of doctoral students complete their degrees within 10 years (and some are likely to complete after that). Completion rates varied by field, with higher percentages of students in engineering and the life sciences and lower percentages of students in mathematics and the physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities completing within 10 years. Ten-year completion rates varied by subdisciplines within the broader disciplines (e.g., within engineering, 10-year completion rates were higher for civil engineering and lower for electrical engineering) and also differed between men and women and among racial and ethnic groups. Ten-year completion rates were higher for men than for women in most fields (except the social sciences and humanities) and were higher for whites than for all other racial/ethnic groups (CGS 2008b).\nExit surveys of doctorate completers conducted as part of the study found that financial support, mentoring/advising, and family (nonfinancial) support headed the factors reported as influencing doctorate completion, with more than half of the respondents reporting each of these as factors in their ability to complete their doctoral programs. The relative prevalence of these factors varied by field, although differences by broad field of study may reflect differences in the demographics of students in the fields (CGS 2009).\nThe study found that most students who leave doctoral programs leave within the first 4 years. Attrition rates have improved over time, with rates of attrition lower for later cohorts than for earlier cohorts of students. Attrition was highest in mathematics and the physical sciences (CGS 2008a).\n\nin 1993 to 12,300 in 2007. The increase in the number of S&E doctorates earned by women occurred in most major S&E fields. For example, the number of engineering doctorates earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident women increased from approximately 300 in 1993 to 700 in 2007; biological sciences doctorates, from 1,300 to 2,300; physical sciences doctorates, from 600 to 700; and social/behavioral sciences doctorates, from 3,300 to 4,700. A decrease in the number of doctorates earned by men after the mid-1990s and through about 2002 to 2004 occurred in non-S&E fields as well as in engineering and in most science fields (except for biological sciences and medical/other life sciences). In recent years, the number of doctorates earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident men increased in biological sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; computer sciences; physical sciences; mathematics; and engineering.\nDoctoral Degrees by Race/Ethnicity The number and proportion of doctoral degrees in\nS&E fields earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident underrepresented minorities has also increased since 1995. Blacks earned 1,287, Hispanics earned 1,301, and American Indians/Alaska Natives earned 128 S&E doctorates in 2007, together accounting for 7% of all S&E doctoral degrees earned that year, up from 4% in 1995 (appendix table 2-30). Their share of S&E doctoral degrees earned by U.S. citizens and permanent residents rose from 6% to 10% in the same period. Gains by all groups contributed to this rise, although the number of S&E degrees earned by blacks and Hispanics rose considerably more than the number earned by American Indians/Alaska Natives (figure 2-15). Asian/Pacific Islander U.S. citizens and permanent residents earned 6% of all S&E doctorates in 2007, down from 7% in 1995. The number of S&E doctorates earned by white U.S. citizens and permanent residents declined from the mid-1990s to 2002, with most of the decrease among white men. The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by white U.S. citizen and permanent resident men declined in the late 1990s through 2003, then gradually increased (figure 2-16). The number of degrees earned by white U.S. citizen and permanent resident women dropped briefly in 1996 and has increased since then. As the number of S&E doctorates awarded to minorities and temporary residents increased, the proportion of S&E doctoral degrees earned by white U.S. citizens and permanent residents decreased from 54% in 1995 to 49% in 2007 (appendix table 2-30).\nForeign S&E Doctorate Recipients Temporary residents earned approximately 13,700 S&E\ndoctorates in 2007, up from 8,700 in 1995. Foreign students on temporary visas earn a larger proportion of doctoral degrees than master's, bachelor's, or associate's degrees (appendix tables 2-11, 2-13, 2-27, and 2-30). The temporary resident share of S&E doctorates rose from 31% in 1995 to 33% in 2007. Foreign students earn considerable shares of doctoral degrees in some fields. In 2007, foreign students\n\n\f2-26 \n\nChapter 2.

The major Asian countries/economies sending doctoral degree students to the United States have been, in descending order, China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan.\nAsia. From 1987 to 2007, students from four Asian countries/economies (China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan) earned more than half of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students (110,600 of 206,300), almost four times more than students from Europe (27,900). Most of these degrees were awarded in engineering, biological sciences, and physical sciences (table 2-6).\nStudents from China earned the largest number of U.S. S&E doctorates awarded to foreign students during the 1987\u00ad2007 period (50,200), followed by those from India (21,400), South Korea (20,500), and Taiwan (18,500) (table 2-6). The numbers of S&E doctorates earned by students from China and India dropped in the late 1990s but have been increasing since then (figure 2-17). Over the 20-year period, the number of S&E doctorates earned by Chinese nationals increased more than tenfold14 and the number of S&E doctorates earned by students from India more than trebled. The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by South Korean students also dipped in the late 1990s and then rose, but the number of students did not rise as dramatically as those from China and India. In 1987, students from Taiwan earned more U.S. S&E doctoral degrees than students from China, India, or South Korea. However, as universities in Taiwan increased their capacity for advanced S&E education in the 1990s, the number of students from Taiwan earning S&E doctorates from U.S. universities declined.\nEurope. European students earned far fewer U.S. S&E doctorates than Asian students between 1987 and 2007, and they tended to focus less on engineering than did their Asian counterparts (table 2-7).

This section examines data on foreign S&E doctorate recipients' plans for staying in the United States at the time of doctorate receipt. Chapter 3 provides data based on examination of Social Security records on the percentage of foreign students with U.S. S&E doctorates who remain in the U.S. labor force up to 5 years after graduation.\nAt the time of doctorate receipt, more than three-quarters of foreign recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates plan to stay in the United States and about half have either accepted an offer of postdoctoral study or employment or are continuing employment in the United States (appendix table 2-31). Until the early 1990s, about half of foreign students who earned S&E degrees at U.S. universities reported that they planned to stay in the United States after graduation, and about one-third said they had firm offers for postdoctoral study or employment (NSB 1998). In the 1990s, however, these percentages increased substantially. For example, in the period 1996\u00ad99, 71% of foreign S&E doctoral degree recipients reported plans to remain in the United States after receiving their degree and 45% already had firm offers for postdoctoral study or employment. In the 2004\u00ad07 period, 77% of foreign doctoral recipients in S&E fields with known plans intended to stay in the United States and 51% had firm offers to do so (appendix table 2-31).

In the period 2004\u00ad07, more than 90% of U.S. S&E doctoral recipients from China and 89% of those from India reported plans to stay in the United States, and more than half reported accepting firm offers for employment or postdoctoral research in the United States (appendix table 2-31). Doctorate recipients from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan were less likely than those from China and India to stay in the United States (figure 2-22). Among U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients from Europe, a relatively high percentage from the United Kingdom planned to stay, whereas smaller percentages from Greece and Spain (compared with other Western European countries) planned to stay after graduation. In North America, the percentage of 2004\u00ad07 doctoral degree students who had definite plans to stay in the United States was higher for Canada than for Mexico (appendix table 2-31).\nBetween 2000\u00ad03 and 2004\u00ad07, the percentage of U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients from all of the top five countries/economies of origin (China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada) reporting definite plans to stay in the United States declined. However, for all but Taiwan, increases in the numbers of doctorate recipients more than offset declines in the percentage staying. Thus, the numbers of U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients from Canada, China, India, and South Korea who had definite plans to stay in the United States were larger in the 2004\u00ad07 period than in the 2000\u00ad03 period (appendix table 2-31).\n\n-PN\\YL  7SHUZ VM MVYLPNU YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: :\n, KVJ[VYH[LZ [V Z[H` PU <UP[LK :[H[LZ!  \u00b6\n5\\TILY\n\n\n\n\n \n\n9LJPWPLU[Z\n\n \n\n7SHUZ [V Z[H`\n\n \n\n-PYT WSHUZ [V Z[H`\n\n             \n\n   \n\n56;,:! +LNYLL YLJPWPLU[Z PUJS\\KL WLYTHULU[ HUK [LTWVYHY` YLZPKLU[Z :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  MVY WSHUZ [V Z[H` I` MPLSK VM Z[\\K` HUK WSHJL VM VYPNPU PU `LHY PUJYLTLU[Z\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM ,HYULK +VJ[VYH[LZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL  :OVY[[LYT Z[H` YH[LZ VM MVYLPNU YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: :\n, KVJ[VYH[LZ I` WSHJL VM VYPNPU!  \u00b6 HUK \u00b6\n\n0UKPH\n\n*OPUH\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n\n0YHU\n\n(YNLU[PUH\n\n(\\Z[YHSPH\n\n*HUHKH\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n;\\YRL`\n\n5PNLYPH\n\n1HWHU\n\n;HP^HU\n\n4L_PJV )YHaPS\n\n\u00b6  \u00b6\n\n        7LYJLU[\n56;,:! +LNYLL YLJPWPLU[Z PUJS\\KL WLYTHULU[ HUK [LTWVYHY` YLZPKLU[Z :OVY[[LYT Z[H` YH[LZ HYL [OVZL ^P[O MPYT JVTTP[TLU[Z VM WVZ[H^HYK VY WVZ[KVJ[VYHS LTWSV`TLU[ 3VUNLY[LYT Z[H` YH[LZ TH` KPMMLY :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  MVY WSHUZ [V Z[H` I` MPLSK VM Z[\\K` HUK WSHJL VM VYPNPU PU `LHY PUJYLTLU[Z\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM ,HYULK +VJ[VYH[LZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nPostdoctoral Education\nTypically, postdoctoral fellows (\"postdocs\") have temporary appointments involving full-time research or scholarship, the purpose of which is to further their education and training. The titles associated with these positions and the conditions of employment vary widely. The status of postdoctoral fellows within the academic hierarchy is not well defined and varies among institutions, although it is generally accepted that the postdoctoral experience represents the last step of a person's training for becoming an independent investigator and faculty member (COSEPUP 2000). Postdoctoral fellows also are important contributors to academic research. They bring a new set of techniques and perspectives to the laboratory that broadens research teams'\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-31\n\nexperience and can make them more competitive for additional research funding. Chapter 3 provides more detail on postdoctoral employment, including reasons for and length of postdoc appointments, salaries and subsequent employment. Chapter 5 provides more detail on postdocs in the academic R&D setting.\nSince 1993, the number of S&E postdocs at U.S. universities increased from 34,300 to 49,300 in fall 2006 (appendix table 2-32). Most of the growth was in biological and medical/other life sciences, accounting for more than two-thirds of S&E postdocs (figure 2-23).15\nNoncitizens account for much of the increase in the number of S&E postdocs, especially in biological sciences and medical sciences (figure 2-24). The number of S&E postdocs with temporary visas at U.S. universities increased from approximately 17,600 in 1993 to 28,200 in 2006. The number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E postdocs at these institutions increased more modestly, from approximately 16,700 in 1993 to 21,100 in 2006 (appendix table 2-32). Temporary visa holders accounted for 57% of S&E postdocs in 2006.\nAn increasing share of academic S&E postdocs are funded through federal research grants. In fall 2006, 56% of S&E postdocs at U.S. universities were funded through this mechanism, up from 52% in 1993. Federal fellowships and traineeships funded a declining share of S&E postdocs: 13% in 2006, down from 17% in 1993. In 2006, 31% of S&E postdocs were funded through nonfederal sources (table 2-8).\n\n-PN\\YL  7VZ[KVJ[VYHS Z[\\KLU[Z H[ <: \\UP]LYZP[PLZ I` MPLSK!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n4LKPJHSV[OLY SPML ZJPLUJLZ \n\n\n\n 7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n(SS V[OLYZ :VJPHSILOH]PVYHS ZJPLUJLZ    \n\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM .YHK\\H[L :[\\KLU[Z HUK 7VZ[KVJ[VYH[LZ PU :JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nInternational S&E Higher Education\nIn the 1990s, many countries expanded their higher education systems and access to higher education. At the same time, flows of students worldwide increased. More recently, a number of countries adopted policies to encourage the return of students who studied abroad, to attract foreign students, or both. (For information on worldwide trends affecting doctoral education, see sidebar \"Globalization and Doctoral Education.\")\nHigher Education Expenditures\nIncreasingly, governments around the world have come to regard movement toward a knowledge-based economy as key to economic progress. Realizing that this requires a well-trained workforce, they have invested in upgrading and expanding their higher education systems and broadening participation. In most instances, government spending underwrites these developments. One indicator of the importance of higher education is the percentage of resources devoted to higher education, as measured by expenditures on tertiary education (education beyond high school) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The United States, Canada, and Korea spend the highest percentage of GDP on higher education (appendix table 2-33).\nAn indicator of the growing importance of higher education is the change in expenditures for higher education over time. Expenditures for tertiary education rose more in the United States than in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries between\n\n-PN\\YL  7VZ[KVJ[VYHS Z[\\KLU[Z H[ <: \\UP]LYZP[PLZ I` MPLSK HUK JP[PaLUZOPW Z[H[\\Z!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6[OLY MPLSKZ MVYLPNU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n)PVTLKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ MVYLPNU 6[OLY MPLSKZ <: JP[PaLUWLYTHULU[ YLZPKLU[ )PVTLKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ <: JP[PaLUWLYTHULU[ YLZPKLU[\n       \n\n56;,:! )PVTLKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KL IPVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ HUK TLKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ 6[OLY MPLSKZ PUJS\\KL LUNPULLYPUN\" HNYPJ\\S[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ\" LHY[O H[TVZWOLYPJ HUK VJLHU ZJPLUJLZ\" TH[OLTH[PJZ\" JVTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\" V[OLY SPML ZJPLUJLZ\" WO`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\" WZ`JOVSVN`\" HUK ZVJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM .YHK\\H[L :[\\KLU[Z HUK 7VZ[KVJ[VYH[LZ PU :JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f2-32 \n\nChapter 2.

From 1995 to 2000, educational expenditures in the United States increased faster than the OECD average and faster than almost all of the other OECD countries (except Greece, Ireland, and Poland). From 2000 to 2005, educational expenditures in the United States increased more slowly than the OECD average but at a similar or faster rate than many countries. (In 2006, expenditures per student in the U.S. were double the OECD average [OECD 2008].) Several countries, the Czech\n\nRepublic, Greece, Iceland, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, and the United Kingdom, far exceeded the OECD average increase in expenditures from 2000 to 2005 (appendix table 2-33). Examination of higher education funding over time is complicated by many things, including changes in measurement, prevalence of public versus private institutions (private institutions are much more prevalent in the United States than in other countries), types and levels of government funding included, and types and levels of education included.\n\nTable 2-8 Source of funding of S&E postdoctoral students: 1993\u00ad2006\n(Percent distribution)\n\nSource\n\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n\nAll sources ............................

In addition, doctoral education in many countries around the world is being shaped by common forces in common ways. Globalization of the economy, shifts to a knowledge-based economy, and various policy efforts are transforming doctoral education around the world. Nerad and Heggelund (2008) identified several key interrelated dimensions of these global trends in doctoral education:\n Across countries, doctoral education is increasingly seen as a commodity with a measurable economic value.\n The market economy is demanding skills in addition to technical skills, that is, skills such as communication, leadership, and team work, which are increasingly being incorporated into graduate curricula. Private institutions and for-profit institutions are arising where only public institutions used to prevail, and tuition is being charged in countries in which education used to be free.\n Research has shifted from individual curiositydriven research to team research on marketable proj-\n\nects, and research has become more collaborative and interdisciplinary.  Developing countries are losing their doctoral students to more developed countries through \"brain drain.\"  Doctoral education around the world is increasingly conducted in English, and scholarly papers are written in English.  Doctoral education is becoming more standardized in terms of common definitions of degrees, common curricular elements, interdisciplinary training, ethics training, relationship between bachelor's degrees and doctorates, and length of time.  Universities are developing and applying quality assurance standards and assessment techniques to compete more effectively in the global marketplace, and new accreditation agencies are being developed.  The Bologna Accords in Europe are moving toward harmonization of doctoral education in terms of supervision, length of study, mobility across borders, and collaboration.\nThe nature of the individual university's responses to these changes and the extent to which universities and countries embrace or resist them vary.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\nEducational Attainment\nHigher education in the United States expanded greatly after World War II, and for several decades the United States led the world in its population's educational attainment. In the 1990s, many countries in Europe and Asia also began to expand their higher education systems. The United States continues to be among those countries with the highest percentage of the population ages 25\u00ad64 with a bachelor's degree or higher, but several other countries have surpassed the United States in the percentage of the younger (ages 25\u00ad34) population with a bachelor's degree or higher (figure 2-25; appendix table 2-34).16\nFirst University Degrees in S&E Fields\nMore than 12 million students worldwide earned first university degrees17 in 2006, with more than 4 million of these in S&E fields (appendix table 2-35). These worldwide totals include only countries for which relatively recent data are available (primarily countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas) and therefore are likely an underestimation. Asian universities accounted for 1.8 million of the world's S&E first university degrees in 2006, almost 900,000 of these in engineering. Students across Europe (including Eastern Europe and Russia) earned more than 1 million S&E degrees and students in North and Central America more than 600,000 in 2006.\nIn the United States, S&E degrees are about one-third of U.S. bachelor's degrees and have been for a long time. In several countries/economies around the world, the proportion of first university degrees in S&E fields, especially engineering, is higher. More than half of first university degrees were in S&E fields in Japan (63%), China (53%), and Singapore (51%). China has traditionally awarded a large proportion of its first university degrees in engineering, although the percentage has declined in recent years (appendix table 2-36). In the United States, about 5% of all bachelor's degrees are in engineering. However, in Asia, about 20% are in engineering, and in China about one-third are in engineering (appendix table 2-35). About 12% of all bachelor's degrees in the United States and worldwide are in natural sciences (physical, biological, computer, and agricultural sciences, and mathematics). See the sidebar \"International Changes in the Ratio of Natural Science and Engineering Degrees to the College-Age Population.\"\nThe number of S&E first university degrees awarded in China, Poland, and Taiwan more than doubled between 1998 and 2006, and those in the United States and many other countries generally increased. Those awarded in Japan decreased in recent years (appendix table 2-36). Natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) degrees account for most of the increase in S&E first university degrees in China. The number of NS&E first university degrees in China rose sharply from 2002 to 2006 and more than trebled between 1998 and 2006 (figure 2-26). In comparison, those awarded in Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and\n\n 2-33\n\n-PN\\YL  ([[HPUTLU[ VM [LY[PHY`[`WL ( HUK HK]HUJLK YLZLHYJO WYVNYHTZ I` JV\\U[Y` HUK HNL NYV\\W! \n\n5VY^H` <UP[LK :[H[LZ\n0ZYHLS 5L[OLYSHUKZ\n+LUTHYR 0JLSHUK *HUHKH\n(\\Z[YHSPH 2VYLH\n5L^ ALHSHUK 1HWHU\n,Z[VUPH <UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n:^LKLU 9\\ZZPHU -LKLYH[PVU  :^P[aLYSHUK\n0YLSHUK :WHPU -PUSHUK 7VSHUK /\\UNHY` 3\\_LTIV\\YN -YHUJL .YLLJL .LYTHU` 4L_PJV )LSNP\\T *aLJO 9LW\\ISPJ 7VY[\\NHS :SV]HR 9LW\\ISPJ\n0[HS` :SV]LUPH\n;\\YRL` *OPSL \n(\\Z[YPH\n\n\u00b6 `LHYZ VSK \u00b6 `LHYZ VSK\n\n          7LYJLU[\n56;,:! ;LY[PHY`[`WL ( WYVNYHTZ 0U[LYUH[PVUHS :[HUKHYK *SHZZPMPJH[PVU VM ,K\\JH[PVU B0:*,+D ( HYL SHYNLS` [OLVY` IHZLK HUK KLZPNULK [V WYV]PKL Z\\MMPJPLU[ X\\HSPMPJH[PVUZ MVY LU[Y` [V HK]HUJLK YLZLHYJO WYVNYHTZ HUK WYVMLZZPVUZ ^P[O OPNO ZRPSS YLX\\PYLTLU[Z Z\\JO HZ TLKPJPUL KLU[PZ[Y` VY HYJOP[LJ[\\YL HUK OH]L H TPUPT\\T K\\YH[PVU VM  `LHYZ\u00bb M\\SS[PTL LX\\P]HSLU[ HS[OV\\NO [`WPJHSS` SHZ[  `LHYZ 0U <UP[LK :[H[LZ JVYYLZWVUK [V IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ HUK THZ[LY\u00bbZ KLNYLLZ (K]HUJLK YLZLHYJO WYVNYHTZ HYL [LY[PHY` WYVNYHTZ SLHKPUN KPYLJ[S` [V H^HYK VM HU HK]HUJLK YLZLHYJO X\\HSPMPJH[PVU LN KVJ[VYH[L :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:6<9*,! 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVW TLU[ 6,*+ ,K\\JH[PVU H[ H .SHUJL! 6,*+ 0UKPJH[VYZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f2-34 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nthe United States remained relatively flat. (For information on reforms affecting degree awards in Europe, see sidebar \"Changes in European Higher Education Since the Bologna Process.\")\nInternational Changes in the Ratio of Natural Science and Engineering Degrees to the\nCollege-Age Population\nThe ratio of natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) degrees to the college-age population is one measure of the technical skill level of those entering the workforce. Over time, the United States has fallen from one of the top countries in terms of its ratio of NS&E degrees to the college-age population to near the bottom of the 23 countries for which data are available. The ratios of first university degrees in NS&E to the college-age population increased substantially in recent decades in these 23 countries. In 1975, only Japan had a higher ratio than the United States of NS&E degrees per hundred 20\u00ad24-year-olds (the college-age population). By 1990, a few other countries/economies had surpassed the U.S. ratio, and by 2005 nearly all had done so. A recent NSF report (NSF/SRS 2009b) examined the relative influence on this ratio of increased university degree completion relative to the college-age population and NS&E degrees as an increasing share of all degrees. This study examined increases in the ratio of NS&E first university degrees to the college-age population in the United States and 22 other countries/economies for two periods: 1975\u00ad90 and 1990\u00ad2005.\nThe study found that the rising ratio of NS&E degrees to the college-age population in the locations compared with the United States can primarily be attributed to increased university degree completion, not to an increased emphasis on NS&E education; however, the relative importance of these components varies substantially by location. In both the 1975\u00ad90 and the 1990\u00ad2005 periods, the university degree completion component was either the only component or the larger component for the majority of countries/ economies for which such data were available. That is not to say that increased emphasis on NS&E was not an important factor in some countries. The NS&E share component was either the only component or the larger component for five countries in the 1975\u00ad90 period but for no countries in the 1990\u00ad2005 period. In another eight countries in which the university degree completion component was larger, the NS&E share component and/or the interaction component was substantial in one or the other period.\n\nS&E First University Degrees by Sex Women earned half or more of first university degrees in\nS&E in many countries around the world in 2006, including Algeria, Argentina, Canada, Greece, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and a number of smaller countries. Several countries in Europe are not far behind, with more than 40% of first university S&E degrees earned by women. In many Asian and African countries, women generally earn about one-third or less of the first university degrees awarded in S&E fields (appendix table 2-37). In Canada, Japan, the United States, and many smaller countries, more than half of the S&E first university degrees earned by women are in the social and behavioral sciences. In South Korea, 45% of the S&E first university degrees earned by women are in engineering; in Europe, more than 20% are in engineering. In the United Kingdom and the United States, 6% of S&E first university degrees earned by women are in engineering.\n\n-PN\\YL  -PYZ[ \\UP]LYZP[` UH[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ HUK LUNPULLYPUN KLNYLLZ I` ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n\n\n*OPUH\n\n\n\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n\n\n1HWHU\n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n\n\n<2\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n      \n\n<2 $ <UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n56;,:! 5H[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KL WO`ZPJHS IPVSVNPJHS LHY[O H[TVZWOLYPJ VJLHU HUK HNYPJ\\S[\\YHS ZJPLUJLZ\" JVTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\" HUK TH[OLTH[PJZ +H[H MVY <UP[LK :[H[LZ UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY  \n:6<9*,:! *OPUH\u00b75H[PVUHS )\\YLH\\ VM :[H[PZ[PJZ VM *OPUH *OPUH :[H[PZ[PJHS @LHYIVVR HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ )LPQPUN ]HYPV\\Z `LHYZ\" 1HWHU\u00b7.V]LYUTLU[ VM 1HWHU 4PUPZ[Y` VM ,K\\JH[PVU *\\S[\\YL :WVY[Z :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` /PNOLY ,K\\JH[PVU )\\YLH\\ 4VUI\\ZOV :\\Y]L` VM ,K\\JH[PVU\" :V\\[O 2VYLH HUK .LYTHU`\u00b76YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ 6,*+ :[H[ ,_[YHJ[Z O[[W!Z[H[ZVLJKVYN>)6:PUKL_HZW_\" <UP[LK 2PUNKVT\u00b7/PNOLY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ (NLUJ`\" HUK <UP[LK :[H[LZ\u00b75H[PVUHS *LU[LY MVY ,K\\JH[PVU :[H[PZ[PJZ 0U[LNYH[LK 7VZ[ZLJVUKHY` ,K\\JH[PVU +H[H :`Z[LT *VTWSL[PVUZ :\\Y]L`\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ >LI*(:7(9 KH[HIHZL O[[W!^LIJHZWHYUZMNV] :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-35\n\nGlobal Comparison of S&E Doctoral Degrees\nAlmost 174,000 S&E doctoral degrees were earned worldwide in 2006. The United States awarded the largest number of S&E doctoral degrees of any country (about 30,000),18 followed by China (about 23,000), Russia (almost 20,000), and Germany and the United Kingdom (about 10,000 each) (appendix table 2-38). More than 52,000 S&E doctoral degrees were earned in the European Union.\nChanges in European Higher Education Since the\nBologna Process\nIn 1999, 29 European countries, through the Bologna Declaration, initiated a system of reforms in higher education in Europe. The goal of the Bologna Process is to harmonize certain aspects of higher education within participating countries by the year 2010 so that degrees are comparable, credits are transferable, and students, teachers, and researchers can move freely from institution to institution across national borders. Its aim is to replace the varied degree programs in existence, which typically have taken 5 or more years to complete, with a standard 3-year bachelor's degree and a 2-year master's degree and with a standardized credit system. Implementation of these reforms has implications for graduate admissions to U.S. academic institutions: Will U.S. academic institutions see these 3-year bachelor's degrees as equivalent to U.S. 4-year bachelor's degrees? (IIE 2009). The Bologna Process is also stimulating discussion about reform of the U.S. higher education system (Adelman 2008).\nBy 2008, higher education reform in Europe had been extended to more than 45 countries, but it is still in process in many countries and in many fields, and the impact is still uncertain. Many countries have established regulations for reform, but implementation of changes is ongoing, particularly in some disciplines. In many European countries, law and medicine have not moved to the 2-cycle (bachelor's and master's) structure. One of the major difficulties countries are experiencing in the shift to the 2-cycle structure, particularly in law and medicine, is with the bachelorlevel degree's relevance to the labor market (Huisman, Witte, and File 2006). In a few countries, the impact of the change on degree trends is already apparent. In 2001, Italy introduced a 3-year bachelor's degree in accordance with the Bologna guidelines, and the number of students completing an undergraduate degree has since increased, particularly from 2004 on (appendix table 2-36). In Germany, implementation was later, but evidence of the change is apparent in the number of first university degrees in 2006.\n\nWomen earned 40% of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in the United States in 2006, about the same as the percentage earned by women in Australia, Canada, the European Union, and Mexico. They earned more than half of S&E doctoral degrees in Portugal and less than one-quarter of S&E doctoral degrees in the Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, and Taiwan (appendix table 2-39).\nThe number of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in China, Italy, and the United States has risen steeply in recent years (appendix tables 2-40 and 2-41). The United States awarded the largest number of natural sciences and engineering doctoral degrees, but China (as of 2006) was rapidly catching up (figure 2-27) and may have since surpassed the United States. In the United States, as well as in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, the largest numbers of S&E doctoral degrees are in the physical and biological sciences.

The number of S&E doctoral degrees in Germany has declined slightly since 2000 (appendix table 2-40).\nIn Asia, China was the largest producer of S&E doctoral degrees. The number of S&E doctorates awarded in China rose from about 1,900 in 1993 to almost 23,000 in 2006 (appendix table 2-41). Recently, the Chinese State Council Academic Degrees Committee announced that China would begin to limit admissions growth in doctoral programs and would focus more on quality of graduates (Mooney 2008). The number of S&E doctorates awarded in India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also rose from 1993 to 2006, but at a lower rate. In China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, more than half of S&E doctorates were awarded in engineering. In India, most doctorates were awarded in the physical and biological sciences (appendix table 2-41).\nGlobal Student Mobility\nInternational migration of students and highly skilled workers expanded in the past two decades, and countries are increasingly competing for foreign students. In particular, students migrated from developing countries to the more developed countries, and from Europe and Asia to the United States. Some migrate temporarily for education, whereas others remain permanently. Some factors influencing the decision to migrate are economic opportunities, research opportunities, research funding, and climate for innovation in the country of destination (OECD 2004). In recent years, many countries, particularly Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have expanded their provision of transnational education, that is, programs for foreign students in their home countries (NSB 2008). The rise in transnational education, however, has not had much impact on foreign student flows (De Wit 2008). The influence of the worldwide economic and monetary crises beginning in 2008 on international flows of students in the future is uncertain.\nSome countries expanded recruitment of foreign students as their own populations of college-age students decreased, both to attract highly skilled workers and increase revenue for colleges and universities (OECD 2008). The population of individuals ages 20\u00ad24 (a proxy for the college-age population) decreased in China, Europe, Japan, and the United States in the 1990s and is projected to continue decreasing in China, Europe (mainly Eastern Europe), Japan, and South Korea (appendix table 2-42). The U.S. population of 20\u00ad24-year-olds is projected to increase.\nThe U.S. share of foreign students worldwide declined in recent years, although the United States remains the destination of the largest number of foreign students worldwide (both undergraduate and graduate) of all OECD countries (figure 2-28). In 2006, the United States received 20% of foreign students worldwide, down from 25% in 2000\n\nChapter 2.

Other countries that are among the top destinations for foreign students include the United Kingdom (11%), Germany (9%), and France (8%).\nAlthough Australia has a higher percentage of higher education students (undergraduate and graduate) who are foreign (18%) than the United States (3%), it has a lower share (6%) of foreign students worldwide. Other countries with relatively high percentages of higher education students who are foreign include New Zealand (16%), Switzerland and the United Kingdom (14%), and Austria (12%). A number of countries, including Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have relatively high percentages (more than 20%) of doctoral students who are foreign (OECD 2008).\nThe United Kingdom has been actively expanding its position in international education, both by recruiting foreign students to study in the country and expanding its provision of transnational education (British Council 2007). Foreign student enrollment in the United Kingdom is increasing, especially at the graduate level, with increasing flows of students from China and India (appendix table 2-43). In just 5 years, from 2001 to 2006, foreign students increased from 35% to 45% of all graduate students studying S&E in the United Kingdom. Foreign students now account for more than half of graduate students in mathematics/computer sciences and engineering. Students from China and India accounted for most of the increase, but the number of graduate students from France, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the United States also increased. The number of foreign undergraduate students also increased, but not as dramatically. Foreign undergraduates accounted for 10% of S&E enrollment in the United Kingdom in 2001 and 11% in 2006.\nJapan has increased its enrollment of foreign students in recent years and in 2008 announced plans to triple foreign enrollment in 12 years (McNeil 2008). Almost 60,000 foreign students were enrolled in S&E programs in Japanese universities in 2008, up from 42,000 in 2001. Foreign S&E student enrollment in Japan is concentrated at the undergraduate level, accounting for 68% of all foreign S&E students. Foreign undergraduates account for 3% of undergraduate and 14% of graduate S&E students in Japan. Most of the foreign students were from Asian countries. China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam were among the top 10 countries of origin for both undergraduates and graduate students. Chinese students accounted for more than half of foreign undergraduate (68%) and graduate (54%) S&E students in Japan in 2008 (appendix table 2-44).\nForeign students are an increasing share of enrollment in Canadian universities. Foreign S&E students accounted for about 6% of undergraduate and 20% of graduate S&E enrollment in Canada in 2006, up from 3% and 17% in 1996, although the foreign shares in 2006 were down slightly from recent years (NSB 2008). In 2005\u00ad06, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, the highest percentages of foreign\n\nS&E students were in mathematics/computer sciences and engineering. Asian countries/economies were the top places of origin of foreign S&E graduate and undergraduate students in Canada. China alone accounted for 18% of foreign S&E graduate and undergraduate students in Canada. The United States was also among the top countries of origin of foreign students, accounting for 6% of foreign S&E graduate students and 12% of foreign S&E undergraduate students in Canada (appendix table 2-45).\nAlthough foreign students are a large share of U.S. higher education, U.S. students are a relatively small share of foreign students worldwide. About 49,000 U.S. students (in all fields) were reported as foreign students by OECD and OECD partner countries in 2006, far fewer than the numbers of foreign students from China, France, Germany, India, Japan, or South Korea. The main destinations of U.S. students were the United Kingdom (14,800), Canada (9,500), Germany (3,300), Australia (2,900), France (2,800), Ireland (2,100), and New Zealand (2,100)--mainly English speaking countries (OECD 2008).\nApproximately 242,000 U.S. students from U.S. universities enrolled in study-abroad programs in the 2006\u00ad07 academic year, up 8.5% from 2005\u00ad06 (IIE 2008). A little more than one-third were in programs lasting one semester, and more than half were in short-term programs (2\u00ad8 weeks). About 5% were graduate students; the rest were undergraduates, primarily juniors or seniors. About one-third were studying in S&E fields: 21% in social sciences, 7% in physical or life sciences, 3% in engineering, 2% in math or computer sciences, and 1% in agricultural sciences.\nConclusion\nS&E higher education in the United States is attracting growing numbers of students. The number of bachelor's and doctoral degrees awarded in all fields and in S&E fields continues to rise, having reached new peaks in 2007. Graduate enrollment in S&E fields is also increasing. Most of the growth in undergraduate S&E education occurred in science fields. In engineering, bachelor's degrees increased since 2001 but have not yet attained the levels of the 1980s. Computer sciences degrees dropped precipitously in recent years. In doctoral degrees, growth occurred in both science and engineering fields.\nForeign graduate student enrollment in S&E increased in 2006 after declines in 2004 and 2005. The number of entering foreign students dropped after 11 September 2001 but partially rebounded in 2005 and 2006. Students on temporary visas earned 33% of S&E doctorates in the United States in 2007 and half or more of doctoral degrees awarded in engineering, physics, mathematics, computer sciences, and economics. A large fraction of these students stay in the United States: more than three-quarters of foreign doctoral degree recipients in 2007 planned to stay in the United States after graduation.\n\n\f2-38 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nGlobalization of higher education continues to expand. Although the United States continues to attract the largest number and fraction of foreign students worldwide, its share of foreign students has decreased in recent years. Universities in several other countries (e.g., Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom) have expanded their enrollment of foreign S&E students.\nNotes\n1. Based on previous projections, NCES has estimated that the mean absolute percentage error for bachelor's degrees projected 9 years out was 8.0 (NCES 2008c).\n2. These data are from sample surveys and are subject to sampling error. Information on estimated standard errors can be found in appendix E of the annual report \"The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 2008\" published by The Cooperative Institutional Research Program of the Higher Education Research Institute, University of California\u00adLos Angeles (http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/pr-display.php?prQry=28, accessed 23 June 2009). Data reported here are significant at the .05 level.\n3. The number of S&E degrees awarded to a particular freshmen cohort is lower than the number of students reporting such intentions and reflects losses of students from S&E, gains of students from non-S&E fields after their freshman year, and general attrition from bachelor's degree programs.\n4. The physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\n5. About 17% of 2001 and 2002 S&E bachelor's degree recipients had previously earned an associate's degree (NSF/ SRS 2006).\n6. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n7. For longer trends in degrees, see the NSF report series \"Science and Engineering Degrees,\" http://www.nsf.gov/ statistics/degrees/, accessed 12 June 2009.

Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n9. The natural sciences include agricultural; biological; computer; earth, atmospheric, and ocean; and physical sciences and mathematics.\n10. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n11. See Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2009 (NSF/SRS 2009d) for more detail on enrollment of foreign students by sex.\n12. Clinical psychology programs and programs that emphasize professional practice (professional schools and Psy.D. programs) are associated with higher debt, but even in the more research-focused subfields of psychology, lower\n\npercentages of doctorate recipients were debt free and higher percentages had high levels of debt than those in other S&E fields. For information on debt levels of clinical versus nonclinical psychology doctorates in 1993\u00ad96, see \"Psychology Doctorate Recipients: How Much Financial Debt at Graduation?\" (NSF 00-321) at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/issuebrf/ sib00321.htm (accessed 12 June 2009).\n13. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n14. The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by students in Chinese universities continued to increase throughout this period, from 1,894 in 1993 to 22,953 in 2006.\n15. For more information about the distribution of postdoc positions according to sex, see Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2009 (NSF/SRS 2009d).\n16. These data are based on national labor force surveys and are subject to sampling error; therefore, small differences between countries may not be meaningful. The standard error for the U.S. percentage of 25\u00ad64-year-olds with a bachelor's or higher degree is roughly 0.1, and the standard error for the U.S. percentage of 25\u00ad34-year-olds with a bachelor's or higher degree is roughly 0.4.\n17. A first university degree refers to the completion of a terminal undergraduate degree program. These degrees are classified as level 5A in the International Standard Classification of Education, although individual countries use different names for the first terminal degree (e.g., laureata in Italy, diplome in Germany, ma\u00eetrise in France, bachelor's degree in the United States and Asian countries).\n18. In international comparisons, S&E fields do not include medical or health fields.\nGlossary\nBaccalaureate-origin institution: The college or university from which an S&E doctorate recipient earned a bachelor's degree.\nDistance education: Formal education process in which the student and instructor are not in the same place.\nFirst university degree: A terminal undergraduate degree program; these degrees are classified as level 5A in the International Standard Classification of Education, although individual countries use different names for the first terminal degree (e.g., laureata in Italy, diplome in Germany, ma\u00eetrise in France, and bachelor's degree in the United States and in Asian countries).\nInternationally mobile students: Those individuals who are not citizens of the country in which they study.\nNet price: The published price of an undergraduate college education minus the average grant aid and tax benefits that students receive.\nOnline education: A type of distance education where the medium of instruction is computer technology via the Internet.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 2-39\n\nStay rate: The proportion of students on temporary visas who have plans to stay in the United States immediately after degree conferral.\nTertiary type A programs: Higher education programs that are largely theory based and designed to provide sufficient qualifications for entry to advanced research programs and to professions with high skill requirements, such as medicine, dentistry, or architecture, and have a minimum duration of 3 years, although they typically last 4 or more years.

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nHighlights\n\nThe S&E workforce has shown sustained growth for over half a century, and growth is projected to continue into the future.\n The number of workers in S&E occupations grew from about 182,000 in 1950 to 5.5 million in 2007. This represents an average annual growth rate of 6.2%, nearly 4 times the 1.6% growth rate for the total workforce older than age 18 during this period.\n More recently, from 2004 to 2007, S&E workforce growth averaged 3.2% but was still twice as high as that of the total U.S. workforce.\n The sustained U.S. S&E workforce growth rests largely on three factors: increased S&E degree production, immigration of scientists and engineers, and few retirements because of the relative youth of the S&E workforce compared to the total U.S. workforce.\nScientists and engineers can be categorized in many ways, including by occupation and by degree field.\n Defined by occupation, the U.S. S&E workforce totaled between 4.3 million and 5.8 million people in 2006.\n Individuals with an S&E bachelor's degree or higher (16.6 million) or whose highest degree was in S&E (12.4 million) substantially outnumbered those working in S&E occupations.\n The majority of those with an S&E degree but working in non-S&E occupations report that their jobs are related to their degree.\nR&D is an important activity for the S&E workforce.\n The majority of S&E degree holders who report R&D as a major work activity have bachelor's degrees as their highest degree (53%); only 12% have doctorates.\n Engineering degree holders comprise more than one-third (36%) of the total R&D workforce; those with degrees in computer sciences and mathematics constitute another 17%.\n Well above half of doctorate holders in most S&E fields report participating in R&D; the exception is those with social science doctorates.\n Among all scientists and engineers named on patent applications from fall 1998 to fall 2003, 41% held a bachelor's degree, 31% a master's degree, and 24% a doctorate.\nScientists and engineers work for all types of employers.\n For-profit firms employed 47% of all individuals whose highest degree is in S&E but only 28% of S&E doctorate holders.\n Academic institutions employed about 42% of individuals with S&E doctorates, including those in postdocs or other temporary positions.\n\n About 17% of employed workers whose highest degree was in S&E (1.7 million workers) reported they were self-employed in 2006, with two-thirds in incorporated businesses.\nS&E occupations are found throughout industry.\n Industries with above-average proportions of S&E jobs tend to pay higher average salaries to both their S&E and non-S&E workers.\n Small firms are important employers of those with science or engineering degrees. Firms with fewer than 100 persons employ 36% of them.\nAging and retirement patterns are likely to alter the composition of the S&E labor force.\n Absent changes in degree production, immigration, and retirement patterns, the number of S&E-trained persons in the workforce will continue to grow, but at a slowing rate, as more S&E workers reach traditional retirement age (26% were older than age 50 in 2006).\n Across all S&E degree levels, by age 61 about half of S&E workers are no longer working full time; for doctorate holders, half no longer work full time by age 66.\n A much larger proportion of doctorate holders than those with bachelor's and master's degrees are near retirement age.\nWomen remain underrepresented in the S&E workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past.\n Women constituted two-fifths (40%) of those with S&E degrees in 2006, but their proportion is smaller in most S&E occupations.\n As more women than men have entered the S&E workforce over the decades, their proportion in S&E occupations rose from 12% in 1980 to 27% in 2007.\n Women in the S&E workforce are on average younger than men, suggesting that larger proportions of men than of women may retire in the near future, thus changing these sex ratios.\nThe proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the S&E labor force is lower than their proportion in the general population; the reverse is true for Asians/Pacific Islanders.\n The proportions of blacks and Hispanics in S&E occupations have continued to grow over time. However, these groups remain underrepresented relative to their proportions in the total population.\n Blacks, Hispanics, and other underrepresented minorities together constitute 24% of the U.S. population, 13% of college graduates, and 10% of the college-degreed in S&E occupations.\n The proportion of blacks in nonacademic S&E occupations was 3% in 1980 and 5% in 2007; that of Hispanics was 2% and 4%, respectively.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-7\n\n At the doctoral level, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives combined represented just over 4% of employment in nonacademic S&E occupations in 1990 and 6% in 2007.\n Asian/Pacific Islanders constitute 5% of the U.S. population, 7% of college graduates, and 14% of those in S&E occupations; most of them (82%) are foreign born.\nWorkers with S&E degrees or occupations tend to earn more than other comparable workers.\n Half of the workers in S&E occupations earned $70,600 or more in 2007, more than double the median earnings ($31,400) of the total U.S. workforce.\n Workers with S&E degrees, regardless of their occupations, earn more than workers with comparable-level degrees in other fields.\nEspecially at lower education levels, people whose work is associated with S&E are less often exposed to unemployment.\n Unemployment rates for those in S&E occupations tend to be lower than those for all college-degreed individuals and much lower than those of persons with less than a bachelor's degree.\n Unemployment data through September 2009 illustrate the advantages occurring to those whose jobs involve S&E: 9.7% unemployment for all workers, 7.6% for S&E technicians and computer programmers, 5.4% for all bachelor's degree holders, and 5.5% for those in S&E occupations.\n For the 12 months beginning in September 2008, unemployment rates rose sharply for all workers, moving from 6.1% to 9.7%. Substantial increases occurred for technicians and programmers (4.9 percentage points) and workers in S&E occupations (3.3 percentage points), which exceeded those for all bachelor degree holders (2.3 percentage points).\n The unemployment rates for S&E doctorate holders are generally much lower than for those at other degree levels.\nPostdoc positions are increasingly common, but their frequency is different in different disciplines.\n The total number of postdocs in the United States is unknown. About half of the known postdocs in 2005 are in the biological and other life sciences.\n The incidence of individuals taking S&E postdoc positions during their careers has risen, from about 31% of those with a pre-1972 doctorate to 46% of those receiving their doctorate in 2002\u00ad05.\n A majority of doctorate holders in the life or physical sciences now have a postdoc position as part of their career path; so do 30% or more of doctorate holders in mathematics and computer sciences, social sciences, and engineering.\n\nThe importance of foreign-born scientists and engineers to the S&E enterprise in the United States continues to grow.\n Twenty-five percent of all college-educated workers in S&E occupations in 2003 were foreign born, as were 40% of doctorate holders in S&E occupations.\n More than 40% of all university-educated foreign-born workers had their highest degree from a foreign institution, up from about half that percentage before the 1980s.\n From 2003 to 2007, the shares of the foreign born among master's degree and doctorate holders rose 2 percentage points each.\n About half of all foreign-born scientists and engineers are from Asia, including: 16% from India; 11% from China; 4% to 6% each from the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n More than a third of U.S.-resident doctorate holders come from China (22%) and India (14%).\nThe number of most types of temporary work visas issued to high-skilled workers has continued to increase from their post-9/11 lows.\n More temporary visas are issued than are used.\n H-1B temporary work visas are restricted to 65,000 annually, with 20,000 exemptions for students earning U.S. master's degrees or doctorates and further exemptions for U.S. academic and research institutions in their own hiring.\n Over two-thirds of H-1B visas were issued for S&E occupations, with a large portion of the remainder for closely related work.\n More than half of all H-1B visa recipients were from India; Asian citizens made up three-quarters of all H-1B visa recipients.\nMost foreign doctoral students choose to remain in the United States after earning their degree.\n The 5-year stay rate for foreign doctoral students showed a small decline: 62% of 2002 doctorate recipients were in the country in 2007, down from 65% for the class of 2000 but remaining near its record high.\n Overall declines in stay rates reflect lower rates for doctorate recipients from some countries (e.g., Taiwan, Japan, and India), whereas stay rates for students from other countries (e.g., the United Kingdom and Germany) increased.\n Tentative evidence suggests that foreign students who receive their doctorates from highly rated departments may have long-term (5-year) stay rates that are below the rates for those who receive their doctorates from less highly reputed departments.\n\n\f3-8 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nThe capability to work in science and technology has increased throughout the world.\n There are no comprehensive measures of the global S&E labor force, but fragmentary data suggest that the U.S. world share is continuing to decline.\n Data on the number of researchers compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) show moderate average growth from 1995 to 2007 for established scientific nations and regions, in contrast to rapid growth in selected developing regions.\n Over about a decade, the estimated number of U.S. researchers rose by 40% to about 1.4 million in 2007, that of the European Union to 1.4 million, and Japan's to about 710,000.\n\n The number of researchers in China rose to an estimated 1.4 million, comparable to the estimates for the EU-27 and the United States.\nR&D employment of multinational companies (MNCs) has been increasing.\n In 2004 U.S.-based MNCs employed about 854,000 research and development (R&D) workers globally, 16% of them overseas in majority-owned subsidiaries, compared with about 727,000 researchers in 1994 (14% of them overseas).\n From 1994 to 2004, R&D employment of foreign-based MNCs in the United States rose from about 90,000 to 129,000.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-9\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nLike most developed economies, the United States increasingly depends on a technically skilled workforce, including scientists and engineers. Workers for whom knowledge and skill in S&E are central to their jobs have an effect on the economy and the wider society that is disproportionate to their numbers: they contribute to research and development, increased knowledge, technological innovation, and economic growth. Moreover, the knowledge and skills associated with science and engineering have diffused across occupations and become more important in jobs that are not traditionally associated with S&E.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter has five major sections. The first describes different measures of the U.S. S&E workforce by occupation, education, and technical expertise needed on the job. It also presents a discussion of the size and growth of the S&E workforce.\nThe second section examines employment patterns. This includes discussion of the types of jobs that S&E degree holders have, where they work, and what they do on the job.\nS&E labor force demographics are the subject of the third section. Topics include the age distribution and retirement patterns of the S&E labor force, trends in the participation of women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities, and the continuing importance of foreign-born, and often foreign-educated, scientists and engineers.\nThe fourth section presents measures of recent S&E labor market conditions. It includes measures of earnings and unemployment, indicators which are applicable to all segments of the labor market. In addition, it reports data on the proportion of S&E-trained workers who are involuntarily working outside of their field. Because highly educated S&E workers often prefer, but cannot always find, work that uses knowledge and skills related to their education, variations in this measure can be a valuable indicator of labor market conditions for these workers. For recent S&E doctoral recipients, data on academic employment and postdoc appointments are also presented.\nHigh-quality data on the global S&E labor force are quite sparse. The available data are presented in the final section. It includes data on the growth in S&E human capital across most of the globe and on the increasing importance of international movements of highly skilled workers to developed nations and elsewhere. This section also includes a more detailed discussion of the globalization of the U.S. S&E workforce, about which there are relatively more complete data.\nScope of the S&E Workforce\nMeasures of the S&E Workforce\nThe terms scientist and engineer can include very different sets of workers. This section presents three types of\n\nmeasures that can be used to estimate the size and describe the characteristics of the U.S. S&E labor force.1 Different categories of measures are better adapted for addressing some questions than others, and not all general population and workforce surveys include questions in each category.\nOccupation U.S. federal occupation data classify workers by the ac-\ntivities or tasks they primarily perform in their jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS's) Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey collects data that rely on employers to classify their workers using standard occupational definitions. Census Bureau and National Science Foundation (NSF) occupational data in this chapter come from surveys in which individuals supplied information about job titles and/or work activities. This information enables jobs to be coded into standard occupational categories.\nAlthough there is no standard definition of an S&E occupation, NSF has developed a widely used set of occupational categories that it calls S&E occupations. These occupations are generally associated with a bachelor's level of knowledge and education in S&E fields. A second set of occupations, S&E-related occupations, also require some S&E knowledge or training, but not necessarily as a required credential or at the bachelor's degree level. Examples of such occupations are S&E technicians or managers of the S&E enterprise who may supervise people working in S&E occupations. Other occupations, although classified as non-S&E, may include individuals who use their S&E technical expertise in their work. Examples include salespeople who sell specialized research equipment to chemists and biologists and technical writers who edit scientific publications. The NSF occupational classification of S&E, S&E-related, and non-S&E occupations appears in table 3-1.\nOther general terms, including science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), science and technology (S&T), and science, engineering, and technology (SET), are often used to designate the part of the labor force that works with S&E. These terms are broadly equivalent and have no standard meaning.\nIn this chapter, the narrow classification of S&E occupations is sometimes expanded to include S&E technicians, computer programmers, S&E managers, and a small number of non-health S&E-related occupations such as actuary and architect. This broader grouping is referred to here as STEM occupations.\nEducation The pool of S&E workers could also be identified in\nterms of educational credentials. Individuals who possess an S&E degree, whose highest degree is in S&E, or whose most recent degree is in S&E may be qualified to hold jobs that require S&E knowledge and skills and may choose to seek such jobs if they do not currently hold them. However, a focus on people with relevant educational credentials includes individuals who do not hold jobs that are generally identified with S&E and are not likely to seek them in the future.\n\n\f3-10 \n\nChapter 3.

For a more detailed classification of occupations and degrees by S&E, S&E-related, and non-S&E, see National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics (NSF/SRS), Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), http://sestat.nsf.gov/docs/occ03maj.html and http://sestat.nsf.gov/docs/ed03maj.html.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nWorkers with degrees in S&E may not have maintained current knowledge of the fields in which they were trained, may lack interest in working in jobs that require skills associated with S&E education, or may have advanced in their careers to a point where other skills have become more important.\nS&E Technical Expertise The S&E workforce may also be defined by the expertise\nrequired to perform a job or the extent to which job requirements are related to formal training in S&E. Many people, including some outside S&E occupations or without S&E degrees, report that their jobs require at least a bachelor's degree level of technical expertise in engineering, computer sciences, mathematics, the natural sciences, or social sciences (S&E technical expertise). Unlike defining the S&E workforce by occupational groupings or educational credentials, defining it by the use of technical knowledge, skills, or expertise involves assessing the content and characteristics of individual jobs. However, it also involves asking survey respondents to make a complex judgment about their jobs and apply a criterion that they are likely to interpret differently.2\n\nSize of the S&E Workforce\nDefined by occupation, the U.S. S&E workforce totaled between 4.3 million and 5.8 million people in 2006 (table 3-2). Those in S&E occupations who also had bachelor's degrees were estimated at between 4.3 million (Census Bureau 2007) and 5.0 million (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics [SRS], Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System [SESTAT]).3 SESTAT's 2006 estimates for individuals with an S&E degree at the bachelor's level or higher (16.6 million) or whose highest degree was in S&E (12.4 million) were substantially higher than the number of current workers in S&E occupations. Many of those whose highest degree is in S&E reported that their job, although not in an occupation classified as S&E, was closely or somewhat related to their highest degree (1.95 million closely related and 2.02 million somewhat related). Counting these people, along with those in S&E occupations, as part of the S&E workforce increases by 80% the size of the estimate by occupation alone.\nThe 2003 SESTAT surveys provide the most recent estimate for a different subjective assessment of S&E\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-11\n\nTable 3-2 Measures and counts of S&E workforce: 2003 and 2006\n\nMeasure\n\nEducation coverage\n\nData source\n\nNumber\n\nOccupation Employment in S&E occupations .......................................

According to these surveys, 12.9 million bachelor's degree holders reported that their jobs required at least this level of expertise in one or more S&E fields. This contrasts with 2003 SESTAT estimates of 4.8 million in S&E occupations and 11.9 million whose highest degree is in an S&E field.\nGrowth of the S&E Workforce\nHowever defined, the S&E workforce has for decades grown faster than the total workforce. Defined by occupation, growth in the S&E workforce can be examined over nearly 6 decades using Census Bureau data. (For a discussion of longer periods, see the sidebar \"Scientists Since Babylon.\") The number of workers in S&E occupations grew from about 182,000 in 1950 to 5.5 million in 2007. This represents an average annual growth rate of 6.2%, nearly 4 times the 1.6% growth rate for the total workforce older than age 18 during this period. The somewhat broader category of S&T occupations grew from 205,000 to 6.5 million (figure 3-1).\nIn each decade, the growth rate of S&E occupations exceeded that of the total workforce (figure 3-2). During the 1960s, 1980s, and 1990s, the difference in growth rates was very large (about 3 times the rate for the total labor force). It\n\nwas smallest during the slower growth period of the 1970s and between 2000 and 2007. S&E occupational employment has grown from 2.6% of the workforce in 1983 to 4.3% of all employment in 2007 (figure 3-3).\nRecent OES employment estimates for workers in S&E occupations indicate that the S&E workforce is continuing to grow faster than the total workforce (see table 3A in sidebar \"Scientists Since Babylon\"). The OES estimate was 5.6 million in May 2007, up 9.9% from the May 2004 total of 5.1 million. This implies an average annual growth rate of 3.2%, about double the 1.6% average annual increase in employment in all occupations. During the same period, the broader STEM aggregate (including technicians, S&E managers, etc.) reached 7.6 million in May 2007 but grew at an average annual rate of 2.2%--slower than S&E occupations because of employment declines for both technicians/ programmers and S&E managers. OES projections are that S&E occupations will continue to grow at a faster rate than the total workforce. (See sidebar, \"Projected Growth of Employment in S&E Occupations.\")\nBetween 1980 and 2000, although the number of S&E degree holders in the workforce grew more than the number of people working in S&E occupations, degree production in all broad categories of S&E fields rose at a slower pace than employment in S&E jobs (figure 3-4; see chapter 2 for a\n\n\f3-12 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nScientists Since Babylon\n\nIn the early 1960s, a prominent historian of science, Derek J. de Solla Price, examined the growth of science and the number of scientists over very long periods in history and summarized his findings in a book entitled Science Since Babylon (1961). Using a number of empirical measures (most over at least 300 years), Price found that science, and the number of scientists, tended to double about every 15 years, with measures of higher quality science and scientists tending to grow slower (doubling every 20 years) and measures of lower quality science and scientists tending to grow faster (every 10 years).\nAccording to Price (1961), one implication of this long-term exponential growth is that \"80 to 90% of all the scientists that ever lived are alive today.\" This insight follows from the likelihood that most of the scientists from the past 45 years (a period of three doublings) would still be alive. Price was interested in many implications of these growth patterns, but in particular, he was interested in the idea that this growth could not continue indefinitely and the number of scientists would reach \"saturation.\" Price was concerned in 1961 that saturation had already begun.\n\nHow different are the growth rates in the number of scientists and engineers in recent periods from what Price estimated for past centuries? Table 3-A shows growth rates for some measurements of the S&E labor force in the United States and elsewhere in the world for a period of available data. Of these measures, the number of S&E doctorate holders in the United States labor force showed the lowest average annual growth of 2.4% (doubling in 31 years if this growth rate were to continue). The number of doctorate holders employed in S&E occupations in the United States showed a faster average annual growth of 3.8% (doubling in 20 years if continued). There are no global counts of individuals in S&E, but counts of \"researchers\" in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) grew at an average annual rate of 3.3% (doubling in 23 years if continued). Data on the population of scientists and engineers in most developing countries are very limited, but OECD data for researchers in China show a 10.8% average annual growth rate (doubling in 8 years if continued). All these numbers are broadly consistent with a continuation of growth in S&E labor exceeding the rate of growth in the general labor force.\n\nTable 3-A Growth rates for selected S&E labor force measurements\n\nMeasurement\n\nSource\n\nYears\n\nAverage annual First year Last year growth rate (%)\n\nResearchers in OECD countries.........................................\n\nOECD 1995\u00ad2005 2,815,000 3,880,000\n\n3.3\n\nCollege graduates in the U.S. in S&E occupations\n\n(except postsecondary teachers) ....................................\n\nU.S. Census 1990\u00ad2005 200,000 390,000\n\n4.6\n\nDoctorate holders in the U.S. in S&E occupations\n\n(except postsecondary teachers) ....................................\n\nU.S. Census 1990\u00ad2005 2,362,000 4,111,000\n\n3.8\n\nWorkers with highest degree in S&E who report job\n\nrelated to degree .............................................................

During this period, S&E employment grew from 2.1 million to 4.8 million (4.2% average annual growth), while total S&E degree production increased from 526,000 to 676,000 (1.5% average annual growth). Except for mathematics, computer sciences, and the social sciences, the growth rate for advanced degrees was higher than for bachelor's degrees.\nThis growth in the S&E labor force was largely made possible by the following three factors: (1) increases in U.S. S&E degrees earned by both native and foreign-born students who entered the labor force, (2) temporary and permanent migration to the United States of those with foreign S&E education, and (3) the relatively small proportion of scientists and engineers leaving the S&E labor force because they had reached retirement age. Many have expressed concerns about the effects of changes in any or all of these factors on the future of the U.S. S&E labor force (see NSB 2003).\n\n-PN\\YL  (]LYHNL HUU\\HS NYV^[O YH[LZ VM [V[HS ^VYRMVYJL HUK ^VYRMVYJL PU :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ!  \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n>VYRMVYJL PU :\n,\n\n>VYRMVYJL\n\nVJJ\\WH[PVUZ\n\n `LHYZ VSK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00b6\n\n \u00b6\n\n \u00b6   \u00b6 \u00b6\n\n:6<9*,! <UP]LYZP[` VM 4PJOPNHU 0U[LNYH[LK 7\\ISPJ <ZL 4PJYVKH[H :LYPLZ  \u00b6 +LJLUUPHS *LUZ\\Z MPSLZ HUK  (TLYPJHU *VTT\\UP[` :\\Y]L` O[[W!\\ZHPW\\TZVYN\\ZH ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nFigure 3-3 <: ^VYRMVYJL PU :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ!  \u00b6\n\nS&E employees (millions) (bars) \n\nWorkforce (percent) (line) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n              \n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations from Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey Monthly Outgoing Rotation files (1983\u00ad2007).\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nEmployment Patterns\nThis section describes the distribution of members of the S&E labor force in the economy. In view of the disjunction between S&E occupations and S&E degrees, this discussion begins with an analysis of data on the educational characteristics of those in S&E occupations and the occupations of workers with S&E degrees. It then describes the institutional sectors in which members of the S&E labor force are employed and provides industry breakdowns within the\n\n\f3-14 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nProjected Growth of Employment in S&E Occupations\n\nProjections of employment growth are notoriously difficult to make, and the present economic environment makes them even more uncertain. Conceivably, the worldwide economic crisis will produce long-term changes in employment patterns and trends. The reader is cautioned that the assumptions underlying projections such as these, which rely on past empirical relationships, may no longer be valid.\nThe most recent BLS occupational projections, for the period 2006\u00ad16, suggest that total employment in occupations that NSF classifies as S&E will increase at more than double the overall growth rate for all occupations (figure 3-A). These projections involve only the demand for strictly defined S&E occupations and do not include the wider range of jobs in which S&E degree holders often use their training.\nS&E occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% between 2006 and 2016, while employment in all occupations is projected to grow 10.4% over the same period (table 3-B, appendix table 3-2).4 Yet, there are challenges to making projections about the S&E workforce. Many corporate and government spending decisions on R&D are difficult or impossible to anticipate. In addition, R&D money increasingly crosses borders in search of the best place to have particular research performed. (The United States may be a net recipient of these R&D funds; see the discussion in chapter 4.) Finally, it may be difficult to anticipate new products\n\nand industries that may be created via the innovation processes that are most closely associated with scientists and engineers.\nApproximately 64% of BLS's projected increase in S&E jobs is in computer and mathematical scientist occupations (table 3-B). Apart from these occupations, the growth rates projected for physical scientists, life scientists, and social scientists are above those for all occupations. Engineering occupations, with projected growth of 10.6%, are growing at about the same rate as all jobs.\nTable 3-B also shows occupations that either contain significant numbers of S&E trained people or represent other career paths for those pursuing graduate training. Among these, postsecondary teacher or administrator, which includes all fields of instruction, is projected to grow faster than computer and mathematical occupations, from 1.8 million to 2.3 million workers over the decade between 2006 and 2016--an increase of 31.4%. In contrast, BLS projects computer programmers to increase by only 2.0%.\nBLS also projects that job openings in NSF-identified S&E occupations over the 2006\u00ad16 period will represent a greater proportion of current employment than all other occupations--43.9% versus 33.7% (figure 3-B). Job openings include both growth in total employment and openings caused by attrition.\n\n-PN\\YL ( )\\YLH\\ VM 3HIVY :[H[PZ[PJZ WYVQLJ[PVUZ VM PUJYLHZL PU LTWSV`TLU[ MVY :\n, HUK ZLSLJ[LK V[OLY VJJ\\WH[PVUZ! \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SS :\n, *VTW\\[LY 7O`ZPJHS :VJPHS\n\n3PML ,UNPULLYZ\n\nZJPLU[PZ[Z ZJPLU[PZ[Z ZJPLU[PZ[Z ZJPLU[PZ[Z\n\nTH[OLTH\n\n[PJPHUZ\n\n(SS\n\n7VZ[ 7O`ZPJPHUZ\n\nVJJ\\WH[PVUZ ZLJVUKHY` HUK\n\n[LHJOLYZ Z\\YNLVUZ\n\nLK\\JH[PVU\n\nHKTPUPZ[YH[VYZ\n\n3H^`LYZ\n\n*VTW\\[LY WYVNYHTTLYZ\n\n)3: $ )\\YLH\\ VM 3HIVY :[H[PZ[PJZ :6<9*,! )3: 6MMPJL VM 6JJ\\WH[PVUHS :[H[PZ[PJZ HUK ,TWSV`TLU[ 7YVQLJ[PVUZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-15\n\nTable 3-B Bureau of Labor Statistics projections of employment and job openings in S&E occupations: 2006\u00ad16\n(Thousands)\n\nOccupation\n\nBLS National Employment Matrix 2006\nestimate\n\nBLS projected 2016\nemployment\n\nJob openings from growth and net replacements,\n2006\u00ad16\n\n10-year job\n\n10-year\n\nopenings as\n\ngrowth in total percent of 2006\n\nemployment (%) employment\n\nAll occupations................................................. 150,620\n\n166,220\n\n50,732\n\n10.4\n\n33.7\n\nAll S&E ..........................................................\n\n5,187\n\n6,296\n\n2,280\n\n21.4\n\n43.9\n\nComputer/mathematical scientists ...........\n\n2,859\n\n3,694\n\n1,466\n\n29.2\n\n51.3\n\nLife scientists ............................................\n\n258\n\n292\n\n103\n\n12.8\n\n40.0\n\nPhysical scientists .....................................\n\n267\n\n309\n\n109\n\n15.7\n\n41.0\n\nSocial scientists/related occupations .......\n\n291\n\n330\n\n96\n\n13.3\n\n32.9\n\nEngineers ..................................................\n\n1,512\n\n1,671\n\n505\n\n10.6\n\n33.4\n\nS&E-related occupations\n\nS&E managers...........................................\n\n513\n\n616\n\n200\n\n20.1\n\n39.0\n\nS&E technicians ........................................\n\n874\n\n986\n\n303\n\n12.8\n\n34.7\n\nComputer programmers............................\n\n455\n\n464\n\n117\n\n2.0\n\n25.6\n\nPhysicians and surgeons ..........................\n\n633\n\n723\n\n204\n\n14.2\n\n32.3\n\nHealth technologists and technicians .......\n\n2,612\n\n3,094\n\n1,074\n\n18.5\n\n41.1\n\nSelected other occupations\n\nPostsecondary teachers/administrators ...\n\n1,760\n\n2,312\n\n953\n\n31.4\n\n54.1\n\nLawyers .....................................................\n\n761\n\n844\n\n228\n\n11.0\n\n29.9\n\nBLS = Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nNOTES: Estimates of current and projected employment for 2006\u00ad16 period from BLS's National Employment Matrix.

Data on work-related training, which can foster innovation through organizational and individual learning, are also presented.\nEducational Distribution of Those in S&E Occupations\nWorkers in S&E occupations have undergone more formal education than the general workforce (figure 3-5). Nonetheless, these occupations include workers with a range of educational qualifications. For all workers in S&E occupations except postsecondary teachers,5 2007 ACS data indicate that slightly more than one-quarter had not earned a bachelor's degree. For an additional 44%, a bachelor's was their highest degree. The proportion of workers with advanced degrees was about equal to that of those without a bachelor's degree. Only about 7% of all S&E workers (except postsecondary teachers) had doctorates.\nTechnical issues of occupational classification may inflate the estimated size of the nonbaccalaureate S&E workforce. Even so, these data indicate that many individuals enter the S&E workforce with marketable technical skills\n\n-PN\\YL  ,K\\JH[PVUHS H[[HPUTLU[ I` [`WL VM VJJ\\WH[PVU! \n7LYJLU[\n\n\n+VJ[VYH[L\n\n\n\n7YVMLZZPVUHS\n\n4HZ[LY\u00bbZ\n )HJOLSVY\u00bbZ\n\n(ZZVJPH[L\u00bbZ\u00b6HJHKLTPJ\n\n:VTL JVSSLNL UV KLNYLL\n\n/PNO ZJOVVS\n\n\n\nNYHK\\H[L.,+\n\n/PNO ZJOVVS\n\n :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ\nL_JLW[ WVZ[ZLJVUKHY` [LHJOLYZ\n\n(SS V[OLY VJJ\\WH[PVUZ\n\n.,+ $ .LULYHS ,X\\P]HSLUJ` +PWSVTH\n\n:6<9*,! *LUZ\\Z )\\YLH\\ (TLYPJHU *VTT\\UP[` :\\Y]L` \n\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-17\n\nTable 3-3 Educational background of workers in S&E occupations: 2006\n\nEducational background\n\nNumber Percent\n\nS&E occupations ..................................... 5,023,635 At least one S&E degree ...................... 4,294,666 First bachelor's degree in S&E ......... 4,023,000 Highest degree in S&E ..................... 3,929,860 All degrees in S&E ............................ 3,696,443 At least one degree in-- Computer/mathematical sciences ..................................... 1,052,725 Life sciences ................................. 576,922 Physical sciences.......................... 495,985 Social sciences ............................. 651,519 Engineering ................................... 1,867,172 No S&E degrees but at least one S&E-related degree ........................... 216,509 No S&E or S&E-related degrees .......... 512,459\n\n100.0 85.5 80.1 78.2 73.6\n21.0 11.5\n9.9 13.0 37.2\n4.3 10.2\n\nNOTE: Detail may not add to total because of rounding.\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) (2006), http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nfrom technical or vocational school training (with or without earned associate's degrees) or college courses, and many acquire such skills through workforce experience or on-thejob training. In information technology, and to some extent in other occupations, employers frequently use certification exams, not formal degrees, to judge skills. (See \"Who Performs R&D?\" and the discussion in chapter 2.)\n\nAmong individuals with at least a bachelor's degree who work in S&E occupations, a large proportion (86%) have at least one S&E degree, and 74% have S&E degrees only (table 3-3). S&E workers who have both S&E and non-S&E degrees very likely earned their first bachelor's degree in S&E, even if their highest degree was not in an S&E field. Among workers in S&E occupations, the most common degrees are in engineering (37%) and computer and mathematical sciences (21%) (figure 3-6).\nEmployment in Non-S&E Occupations\nS&E degree holders work in all manner of jobs. For example, they work in S&E-related jobs such as health occupations (1.3 million workers) or in S&E managerial positions (267,000 workers), but they also hold non-S&E jobs such as college and precollege teachers in non-S&E areas (622,000 workers) or work in social services occupations (632,000 workers). In 2006, 6.2 million workers whose highest degree was in an S&E field did not work in an S&E occupation. Some 1.1 million worked in S&E-related occupations, while just over 5.0 million worked in non-S&E jobs. The largest category of non-S&E jobs was management and management-related occupations, with 1.4 million workers, followed by sales and marketing occupations, with 990,000 workers (NSF/SRS 2006).\nOnly about 39% of college graduates whose highest degree is in an S&E field work in S&E occupations (figure 3-7). The proportion is higher for those with more advanced degrees. The overall proportion varies substantially by field, ranging from engineering (66%) at the top, followed closely by computer and mathematical sciences (59%) and physical sciences (55%).

Individuals with social science degrees (14%) are least likely to work in S&E occupations. This pattern of field differences generally characterizes individuals whose highest degree is either a bachelor's or a master's. At the doctoral level, these field differences shrink substantially.\nBy field, holders of degrees in computer and mathematical sciences and engineering most often work in the broad occupation group in which they were trained (51% and 45%, respectively). S&E doctorate holders more often work in the same broad S&E occupation (64%) compared with individuals whose highest degree is an S&E bachelor's (24%) (appendix table 3-1).\nRelationships Between Jobs and Degrees\nMost individuals with S&E highest degrees who work in S&E-related and non-S&E occupations do not see themselves as working entirely outside their field of degree. Rather, they indicate that their jobs are either closely (31%) or somewhat (32%) related to their degree field (table 3-4). Among those in managerial and management-related occupations, for example, 31% characterize their jobs as closely related and 41% as somewhat related. Almost half (47%) of workers in sales and marketing say their S&E degrees are closely or somewhat related to their jobs. Among S&E precollege teachers whose highest degree is in S&E, 74% say their jobs are closely related to their degrees.\nWorkers with more advanced S&E education more often do work that is at least somewhat related to their field of degree. One to 4 years after receiving their degrees, 96%\n\nof S&E doctorate holders say that they have jobs closely or somewhat related to their degree field, compared with 92% of master's degree holders and 72% of bachelor's degree holders (figure 3-8). Even when the fit between an individual's job and field of degree is assessed using a stricter criterion (\"closely related\"), the data indicate that many S&E bachelor's degree holders who received their degree 1\u00ad4 years earlier are working in jobs that use skills developed during their college training (figure 3-9). In the natural sciences and engineering fields, about half characterized their jobs as closely related to their field of degree: 57% in engineering and physical sciences, 50% in computer sciences, and 48% in biological/agricultural sciences. The comparable figure for social science graduates (30%) was substantially lower.\nThe stronger relationship between S&E jobs and S&E degrees at higher degree levels holds at all career stages, as evidenced by comparisons among groups of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree holders at comparable numbers of years since degree award. However, for each group, the relationship between job and field of degree becomes weaker over time. There are many reasons for this decline: individuals may change their career interests, gain skills in different areas, take on general management responsibilities, forget some of their original college training, or even find that some of their original college training has become obsolete. Against this background, the career-cycle decline in the relevance of an S&E degree appears modest.\nFigures 3-10 and 3-11 summarize the loose relationship among jobs, degrees, and individuals' perceptions of the expertise they need to do their work.

Smaller percentages of the oldest (aged 65 and older) and youngest (24 and under) age groups of workers attended training. SESTAT survey respondents at companies of all sizes took work-related training, but more of those who worked for larger organizations did so: 58% of respondents working in organizations with 10 or fewer people compared with 72% in organizations that employ 500 to 24,999 people (appendix table 3-5).\nWho Performs R&D?\nAlthough individuals with S&E degrees use their knowledge in many ways, there is a special interest in work in research and development. R&D creates new knowledge and new types of goods and services that fuel economic growth. (See sidebar, \"Patenting Activity of Scientists and\n\nEngineers.\") Figure 3-12 shows the distribution of individuals with S&E degrees, by degree level, who report R&D as a major work activity--the activity involving the greatest or second greatest number of work hours from a list of 14 choices.\nIndividuals with doctorates constitute only 6% of all individuals with S&E degrees but represent 12% of individuals who report R&D as a major work activity. However, the majority of S&E degree holders who report R&D as a major work activity have only bachelor's degrees (53%). An additional 31% have master's degrees and 4% have professional degrees, mostly in medicine.\nFigure 3-13 shows the distribution by field of highest degree of individuals whose highest degree is in S&E and who reported R&D as a major work activity. Individuals with engineering degrees constitute more than one-third (36%) of the total R&D workforce, followed by those with social science degrees (22%).\n\nPatenting Activity of Scientists and Engineers\n\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants patents to inventions that are new, useful, and nonobvious. Thus, patenting is a limited but useful indicator of the inventive activity of scientists and engineers.\nIn its 2003 SESTAT surveys of the S&E workforce, NSF asked scientists and engineers to report on their recent patenting activities. Among those who had ever worked, 2.6% reported that from fall 1998 to fall 2003, they had been named as an inventor on a U.S. patent\n\napplication (appendix table 3-6). This patent activity rate was 3.5% for those working in the business/industry sector, 1.7% in the education sector, and 0.9% in the government sector (appendix table 3-7).\nBy degree level, S&E doctorate holders have the highest patent activity rate (15.7%), while bachelor's degree holders in S&E-related fields have the lowest (0.7%) (figure 3-C). However, there are far fewer doctoral-level scientists and engineers, so they account for only about\n\n-PN\\YL * 7H[LU[PUN HJ[P]P[` YH[L VM ZJPLU[PZ[Z HUK LUNPULLYZ I` IYVHK MPLSK HUK SL]LS VM OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL! \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n(SS KLNYLL SL]LSZ\n\n)HJOLSVYZ\n\n4HZ[LYZ\n\n\n\n+VJ[VYH[L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (SS MPLSKZ\n\n:\n, MPLSKZ\n\n:\n,YLSH[LK MPLSKZ\n\n5VU:\n, MPLSKZ\n\n56;,:! \u00b8(SS KLNYLL SL]LSZ\u00b9 PUJS\\KLZ WYVMLZZPVUHS KLNYLLZ UV[ IYVRLU V\\[ ZLWHYH[LS`\" P[ KVLZ UV[ PUJS\\KL PUKP]PK\\HSZ ^OV OH]L UL]LY ^VYRLK :JPLU[PZ[Z HUK LUNPULLYZ PUJS\\KL [OVZL ^P[O VUL VY TVYL :\n, VY :\n,YLSH[LK KLNYLLZ H[ IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ SL]LS VY OPNOLY VY ^OV OH]L H UVU:\n, KLNYLL H[ IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ SL]LS VY OPNOLY HUK ^LYL LTWSV`LK PU HU :\n, VY :\n,YLSH[LK VJJ\\WH[PVU PU  -VY JSHZZPMPJH[PVU VM KLNYLLZ I` :\n, :\n,YLSH[LK HUK UVU:\n, ZLL :JPLU[PZ[Z HUK ,UNPULLYZ :[H[PZ[PJHS +H[H :`Z[LT :,:;(; O[[W!ZLZ[H[UZMNV]KVJZLKTHQO[TS 7H[LU[ HJ[P]P[` YH[L PZ WYVWVY[PVU VM LHJO NYV\\W PUKPJH[PUN [OL` OHK ILLU UHTLK HZ PU]LU[VY VU <: WH[LU[ HWWSPJH[PVU K\\YPUN WLYPVK MYVT 6J[VILY   [V MHSS \n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :,:;(;  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f3-22 \n\nChapter 3.

Bachelor's and master's degree holders account for 41% and 31%, respectively, of all patenting activity reported in the survey (figure 3-D).\nUSPTO does not grant all patent applications, and not all granted patents produce useful commercial products or processes. NSF estimates that in the 5-year period for which data were collected, U.S. scientists and engineers filed 1.8 million patent applications. USPTO granted some 1.0 million (although applicants may have applied for some of these at an earlier period). (See appendix tables 3-6 through 3-8.)\nOf those patents granted between 1998 and 2003, about 54% resulted in a commercialized product, process, or license during the same period. Scientists and engineers employed in the business/industry sector reported the highest commercialization success rate (58%), much higher than the education (43%) and government (13%) sectors. The overall commercialization rate varies by degree level, at 60%\u00ad65% for bachelor's and master's degree holders but 38% for doctorate holders (many of whom work in education, which has a low commercialization rate relative to other sectors).\n\n-PN\\YL + +PZ[YPI\\[PVU VM WH[LU[PUN HJ[P]P[` VM ZJPLU[PZ[Z HUK LUNPULLYZ I` SL]LS VM OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL! \n+VJ[VYH[L \f\n\n7YVMLZZPVUHS \f\n\n)HJOLSVY\u00bbZ \f\n\n4HZ[LY\u00bbZ \f\n56;,:! ;V[HS KVLZ UV[ PUJS\\KL PUKP]PK\\HSZ ^OV OH]L UL]LY ^VYRLK :JPLU[PZ[Z HUK LUNPULLYZ PUJS\\KL [OVZL ^P[O VUL VY TVYL :\n, VY :\n,YLSH[LK KLNYLLZ H[ IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ SL]LS VY OPNOLY VY ^OV OH]L H UVU:\n, KLNYLL H[ IHJOLSVY\u00bbZ SL]LS VY OPNOLY HUK ^LYL LTWSV`LK PU HU :\n, VY :\n,YLSH[LK VJJ\\WH[PVU PU  -VY JSHZZPMPJH[PVU VM KLNYLLZ I` :\n, :\n,YLSH[LK HUK UVU:\n, ZLL :JPLU[PZ[Z HUK ,UNPULLYZ :[H[PZ[PJHS +H[H :`Z[LT :,:;(; O[[W!ZLZ[H[UZMNV] KVJZLKTHQO[TS\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :,:;(;  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nIndividuals who are in non-S&E occupations do much R&D.

The percentage of doctorate holders engaged in R&D activities declines with increasing time since award of the degree. The decline may reflect movement into management or other career interests. It may also reflect increased opportunity for more experienced scientists to perform functions involving the interpretation and use of, as opposed to the creation of, scientific knowledge.\nEmployment Sectors\nIndividuals with S&E degrees are employed in all sectors of the U.S. economy. For-profit firms are their largest employer, but substantial numbers work in academia, nonprofit organizations, and government, or are self-employed.\nFor-profit firms employ the greatest number of individuals with S&E degrees (figure 3-15). They employed 47% of all individuals whose highest degree is in S&E and 28% of S&E doctorate holders. For those with an S&E doctorate, 4-year colleges and universities are an important but not a majority employer (42%). This 42% includes tenured and tenure-track faculty, individuals in postdoc and other temporary positions, and individuals with teaching, research, and administrative functions.\nThe OES survey provides more detailed estimates for sectors of employment, although it excludes the self-employed and those employed in recent startups (figure 3-16). The largest such employment segment for S&E occupations was \"professional, scientific, and technical services\" with 29%, followed by manufacturing with 17%. Government and educational services sectors each had less than 11% of total employment in S&E occupations in 2007.\n\n\f3-24 \n\nChapter 3.

Most reports of federal data on self-employment include only individuals whose businesses are unincorporated. While only a minority (33%) of all self-employed workers in the United States work in incorporated businesses (Census Bureau 2007), the reverse is true for those whose highest degree is in S&E.

While 18% of S&E bachelor's degree holders are self-employed, the proportion falls to 11% for S&E doctorate holders. However, self-employment increases with age at all degree levels. By age 60\u00ad64 self-employment reached about 30% for bachelor's and master's degree holders and 20% for S&E doctorate holders.\nThe rates of self-employment are similar across broad S&E fields, at the bachelor's degree level ranging from 14.8% in computer and mathematical sciences to 20.4% in the physical sciences (see figure 3-19). The highest self-employment rate among doctorate holders occurs in the social sciences (19%) and the lowest (6%) in computer and mathematical sciences.\nFederal S&E Employment The United States federal government is a major em-\nployer of scientists and engineers, largely limited to those with U.S. citizenship.6 According to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the federal government employed approximately 210,000 persons in S&E occupations in 2005. Many of these workers were in occupations that, nationwide, include relatively large concentrations of foreign-born persons, some of whom are non-citizens, rendering them ineligible for many federal jobs. Among federal employees, 59% were in science occupations and 41% were\n\n-PN\\YL  :LSMLTWSV`TLU[ YH[LZ VM ^VYRLYZ ^OVZL OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL PZ PU :\n, I` KLNYLL SL]LS HUK MPLSK! \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n(SS KLNYLL SL]LSZ\n\n)HJOLSVY\u00bbZ\n\n4HZ[LY\u00bbZ\n\n+VJ[VYH[L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SS :\n, MPLSKZ\n\n*VTW\\[LY TH[OLTH[PJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n3PML ZJPLUJLZ\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n56;,! \u00b8(SS KLNYLL SL]LSZ\u00b9 PUJS\\KLZ WYVMLZZPVUHS KLNYLLZ UV[ IYVRLU V\\[ ZLWHYH[LS` :6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :JPLU[PZ[Z HUK ,UNPULLYZ :[H[PZ[PJHS +H[H :`Z[LT :,:;(;  O[[W!ZLZ[H[UZMNV]\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f3-26 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nin engineering occupations. The Department of Defense was the largest employer, with nearly 45% of the federal S&E workforce (NSF/SRS 2008a).\nWith regard to gender, the federal S&E workforce (defined by occupation) generally reflects the total S&E workforce. Women make up 26% of all U.S. employees in S&E occupations; for federal employees, the comparable proportion is 25%. The number of women in federal S&E positions shows a consistent decrease as age increases beyond the ages of 40\u00ad49; this is also true of the whole S&E workforce.\nThe S&E workforce at large is younger than the federal S&E workforce. Twenty-eight percent of the general S&E workforce is under 35 years of age, with only 15% of those in federal S&E occupations in that age group (appendix table 3-9).\nS&E Occupation Density by Industry\nHigh-technology employers are not the only companies who hire individuals in S&E occupations. As shown in table 3-7, workers with high-technology knowledge are found in industries with very different percentages of S&E occupations as a portion of total employment. Almost 1 million workers in S&E jobs are employed in industries whose S&E employment component is less than the national average of 4.2%. These industries employ 79% of all workers and 18% of all workers in S&E occupations. Illustrative examples include local government (at 3.0%, with 163,000 S&E jobs), hospitals (at 1.4%, with 68,000 S&E jobs), and plastic parts manufacturers (at 2.6%, with 16,000 S&E jobs).\nIndustries with higher proportions of individuals in S&E occupations tend to pay higher average salaries to both their S&E and non-S&E workers. The average salary of workers in non-S&E occupations employed in industries where more than 40% of workers are in S&E occupations is nearly double the average salary of workers in non-S&E occupations in industries with below-average proportions of workers in S&E occupations ($71,550 versus $36,146).\n\nMetropolitan Areas\nThe availability of highly skilled workers can be relevant to an area's economic competitiveness. Two measures of availability with regard to S&E occupations are (1) the number of workers in S&E occupations and (2) the proportion of the entire metropolitan workforce that S&E occupations represent. These estimates should be used with care in comparing areas because the geographic scope of a metropolitan area varies significantly from city to city.\nThe Census Bureau divides some larger metropolitan areas into metropolitan divisions, and these divisions are used in comparisons with smaller metropolitan areas. Accordingly, table 3-8 lists metropolitan divisions with the largest estimated proportion of the workforce employed in S&E occupations. Table 3-9 lists areas and divisions with the largest estimated total number of workers employed in S&E occupations. Table 3-10 presents these data for larger metropolitan areas with multiple metropolitan divisions. These data are for May 2007.\nThe San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara and Boulder metropolitan areas had 14.3% and 14.2% of their workforces employed in S&E occupations, respectively. San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara had 18.2% of their workers in STEM occupations. No metropolitan areas had higher estimates for S&E or STEM occupations. Although the metropolitan areas with the highest estimated proportion of S&E employment are mainly smaller and perhaps less economically diverse, Washington, DC, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and San Jose also appear on the list of metropolitan areas with the greatest intensity of S&E occupational employment.\nThe largest numbers of workers in S&E occupations are in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, New York-White Plains-Wayne, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, and Chicago-Naperville-Joliet metropolitan divisions. These divisions have very large and diverse workforces even after being broken off from their larger metropolitan areas. With the exception of Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, each of\n\nTable 3-7 Employment distribution and average earnings of workers in NAICS 4-digit industries, by proportion of employment in S&E occupations: 2007\n\nAverage annual worker salary ($)\n\nWorkers in S&E occupations (%)\n\nAll occupations\n\nS&E occupations\n\nNon-S&E occupations\n\nS&E occupations\n\n>40 ....................................................................................... 20-40 .................................................................................... 10\u00ad20 .................................................................................... 4.2\u00ad10 ................................................................................... <4.2 (below national average) ..............................................\n\n2,456,900 3,533,150 10,558,950 12,158,410 105,112,220\n\n1,150,410 952,320\n1,444,490 880,540 988,950\n\n71,550 54,039 56,319 47,237 36,146\n\n81,093 80,230 74,833 68,179 64,961\n\nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System\n\nNOTE: NAICS has hierarchal structure that uses 2 to 4 digits; 4-digit NAICS industries are subsets of 3-digit industries, which are subsets of 2-digit sectors.\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey (May 2007).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-27\n\nTable 3-8 Metropolitan areas with highest percentage of workers in S&E occupations: 2007\n\nPercentage of workforce\n\nWorkers employed\n\nMetropolitan area\n\nS&E occupations\n\nSTEM occupations\n\nS&E\n\nSTEM\n\noccupations occupations\n\nSan Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA........................................\n\n14.3\n\n18.2\n\nBoulder, CO ................................................................................\n\n14.2\n\n17.4\n\nHuntsville, AL..............................................................................\n\n12.8\n\n16.2\n\nFramingham, MA NECTA Division ..............................................\n\n12.7\n\n16.6\n\nDurham, NC................................................................................\n\n11.1\n\n15.5\n\nLowell-Billerica-Chelmsford, MA-NH NECTA Division ...............\n\n11.1\n\n14.1\n\nWashington-Arlington-Alexandria,\n\nDC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Division ......................................\n\n10.6\n\n12.7\n\nBethesda-Gaithersburg-Frederick, MD Metropolitan Division ...\n\n9.6\n\n12.0\n\nSeattle-Bellevue-Everett, WA Metropolitan Division ..................\n\n9.3\n\n11.8\n\nOlympia, WA...............................................................................\n\n8.7\n\n10.1\n\nKennewick-Richland-Pasco, WA ...............................................\n\n8.4\n\n11.2\n\nAustin-Round Rock, TX ..............................................................\n\n8.4\n\n11.0\n\nIthaca, NY...................................................................................\n\n8.0\n\n12.5\n\nBloomington-Normal, IL .............................................................\n\n8.0\n\n10.1\n\nAnn Arbor, MI..............................................................................\n\n8.0\n\n10.3\n\nBoston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH NECTA Division ................\n\n7.9\n\n10.3\n\nPalm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, FL ............................................\n\n7.9\n\n10.7\n\nAmes, IA .....................................................................................\n\n7.8\n\n10.7\n\nSan Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City,\n\nCA Metropolitan Division ..........................................................\n\n7.6\n\n9.7\n\nFort Walton Beach-Crestview-Destin, FL...................................\n\n7.2\n\n8.8\n\n130,180 22,830 25,680 19,900 29,880 13,100\n242,350 54,370\n131,620 8,300 7,300\n62,270 4,020 6,880\n15,620 134,190\n16,210 3,270\n75,700 5,860\n\n165,400 28,010 32,630 25,940 41,560 16,580\n290,700 68,340\n167,060 9,700 9,700\n82,100 6,270 8,680\n20,250 174,180\n21,800 4,480\n96,170 7,200\n\nNECTA = New England City and Town Area; STEM = science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\n\nNOTES: Larger metropolitan areas broken into component metropolitan divisions.

Across all degree levels, companies with fewer than 100 employees employ 36% of S&E degree holders. About 33% work at large firms with more than 5,000 employees. In general, there is a similar pattern of employment across employer size by degree levels, except that S&E doctorate holders are more concentrated at very small firms.\n\nDemographics\nAge and Retirement\nThe age distribution and retirement patterns of the S&E labor force affect its size, productivity, and the opportunities it offers for new S&E workers. For many decades, rapid increases in new entries into the workforce created a relatively young pool of workers, with only a small percentage near traditional retirement age. Now, individuals who earned S&E degrees in the late 1960s and early 1970s are moving into the later part of their careers.\nThe increasing average age of S&E workers may mean increased experience and greater productivity among them. However, it could also reduce opportunities for younger researchers to make productive contributions by working independently. In many scientific fields, folklore and empirical evidence indicate that the most creative research comes from younger people (Stephan and Levin 1992).\n\n\f3-28 \n\nChapter 3.

This section does not attempt to project future S&E labor market trends; however, it posits some general conclusions. Absent changes in degree production, retirement patterns, or immigration, the number of S&E-trained workers in the labor force will continue to grow for some time, but the growth rate may slow considerably as an increasing proportion of the S&E labor force reaches traditional retirement age. With slowing growth, the average age of the S&E labor force will increase.\nAge Distribution of the S&E Workforce Net immigration, morbidity, mortality, and, most of all,\nhistorical S&E degree production patterns affect the age distribution of scientists and engineers in the workforce. With the exception of new fields such as computer sciences (in which 56% of degree holders are younger than age 40), the greatest population density of individuals with S&E degrees occurs between the ages of 40 and 49. Figure 3-21 shows the age distribution of the labor force with S&E degrees broken out by level of degree. In general, the majority of individuals in the labor force with S&E degrees are in their late thirties through their early fifties, with the largest group at ages 40\u00ad44. More than half of workers with S&E degrees are age 40 or older, and the 40\u00ad44 age group is more than twice as large as the 60\u00ad64 age group.\nThis general pattern also holds for individuals with S&E doctorates. Because of the length of time needed to obtain a doctorate, those who hold these degrees are somewhat older than individuals who have less advanced S&E degrees. The greatest population density of S&E doctorate holders occurs\n\nFigure 3-21 (NL KPZ[YPI\\[PVU VM PUKP]PK\\HSZ PU SHIVY MVYJL ^P[O OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL PU :\n,! \n\nPercent of total S&E degree holders\n\n16\n\nDoctorate 14\nMaster's\n\n12\n\nBachelor's\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 <25 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35\u00ad39 40\u00ad44 45\u00ad49 50\u00ad54 55\u00ad59 60\u00ad64 65\nAge (years)\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) (2003), http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nbetween the ages of 40 and 54. This can be seen most easily in figure 3-22, which compares the age distribution of S&E degree holders in the labor force at each level of degree, and in figure 3-23, which shows the cumulative age distribution for individuals at each degree level. Even if one takes into account the somewhat older retirement ages of doctorate holders, a much larger proportion of S&E doctorate holders are near traditional retirement ages than are individuals with either S&E bachelor's or master's degrees.\n\n\f3-30 \n\nChapter 3.

S&E doctorate holders under age 35 are about the same proportion of the S&E doctorate holders in the total labor force in both years. However, over the decade, the 35\u00ad54 age group became a much smaller proportion of the doctoral-level S&E labor force. What grew was the proportion of S&E doctorate holders age 55 and older.\nAcross all degree levels and fields, 26.4% of the labor force with S&E degrees is older than age 50. The proportion ranges from 15% of individuals with their highest degree in computer sciences to 41% of individuals with their highest degree in geosciences (figure 3-25).\nAltogether, the age distribution of S&E-educated individuals suggests the following likely effects on the future of the S&E labor force:\n Barring large changes in degree production, retirement rates, or immigration, the number of trained scientists and engineers in the labor force will continue to increase, because the number of individuals currently receiving S&E degrees exceeds the number of workers with S&E degrees nearing traditional retirement age.\n However, unless large increases in degree production occur, the average age of workers with S&E degrees will rise.\n\n 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTE: Age distribution smoothed using kernel density techniques.

Both trends would be accentuated if either new degree production were to drop or immigration were to slow, both concerns raised by a 2003 report of the Committee on Education and Human Resources Task Force on National Workforce Policies for Science and Engineering of the National Science Board (NSB 2003).\nS&E Workforce Retirement Patterns The retirement behavior of individuals can differ in com-\nplex ways. Some individuals retire from one job and continue to work part time or even full time at another position, sometimes even for the same employer. Others leave the workforce without a retired designation from a formal pension plan. Table 3-11 summarizes three ways of looking at changes in workforce involvement for S&E degree holders: leaving full-time employment, leaving the workforce, and retiring from a particular job.\nBy age 61, slightly more than 50% of those with an S&E bachelor's degree as their highest degree are no longer working full time.

Longevity also differs by degree level when measuring the number of individuals who leave the workforce entirely: half of all S&E bachelor's degree holders left the workforce entirely by age 65, compared with S&E master's degree and doctorate holders who left the workforce at ages 66 and 69, respectively. Although many S&E degree holders who formally retire from one job continue to work full time or part time, formal retirement occurs at similar ages for all levels of degree holders: more than 50% of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree holders have formally retired from jobs by age 65, 66, and 67, respectively.\nFigure 3-26 shows data on S&E degree holders working full time at ages 55\u00ad69. For all degree levels, the proportion of S&E degree holders who work full time declines fairly steadily by age, but after age 55, full-time employment for doctorate holders becomes significantly greater than for bachelor's and master's degree holders. At age 69, 27% of doctorate holders work full time, compared with 16% of bachelor's degree recipients.\nTable 3-12 shows the rates at which holders of U.S. S&E doctorates left full-time employment, by sector of employment, between October 2003 and April 2006. For every age group, the retirement rates for S&E doctorate holders were slightly higher for those working in the private sector than\n\nTable 3-11\nLabor force participation for individuals with highest degree in S&E, by education level and age: 2003\n\nAge at which more than half were--\n\nHighest degree\n\nNo longer employed Not in full-time labor force\n\nEver retired\n\nBachelor's................. 61\n\n65\n\n65\n\nMaster's.................... 62\n\n66\n\n66\n\nDoctorate.................. 66\n\n69\n\n67\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) (2003), http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nthose employed in education or government. Although many S&E degree holders who formally retire from one job continue to work full time or part time, this occurs most often among individuals younger than age 63 (table 3-13). However, of retired S&E degree holders age 71 to 75, only 12% of bachelor's degree holders keep working either full time or part time, 17% of master's degree holders, and 19% of doctorate holders.\n\n\f3-32 \n\nChapter 3.

This represents both a change in the composition of the total U.S. labor force and a growth in the participation of women and minorities in S&E.\nBoth women and underrepresented ethnic minorities have shown steady growth in their proportion of the S&E labor force (see figures 3-27 and 3-28, which look at sex and ethnic representation within S&E occupations).\nRepresentation of Women in S&E Women constituted more than one-fourth (26%) of the\ncollege-educated workforce in S&E occupations and twofifths (40%) of those with S&E degrees in 2006, according to NSF's SESTAT data.\nCensus data on S&E occupations from 1980 to 2007 show the number of women in S&E occupations rising from 12% to 27% over those 27 years (figure 3-27). Figures 3-29 and 3-30 show the growth in the number of women with education in S&E for different graduation cohorts and broad fields of degree. The notable exception is in computer and mathematical sciences at the bachelor's degree level, where the proportion of women in the workforce is lower for 2002\u00ad05 graduates (27%) than it is for 1972\u00ad76 graduates (35%). In contrast, the proportion of women in the most recent bachelor's degree cohorts in both the social sciences and the life sciences has risen to above 60%. Among S&E doctorate holders in the workforce, the proportion of women is generally higher in more recent cohorts, including the computer and mathematical sciences.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL  *VSSLNLLK\\JH[LK ^VTLU HUK YHJPHSL[OUPJ TPUVYP[PLZ PU :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ!

On average, women in the S&E workforce are younger than men (figures 3-31 and 3-32). Forty-six percent of women and 31% of men employed in science and engineering in 2003 received their degrees within the previous 10 years. The difference is even more profound at the doctoral level, which has a much greater concentration of women in their late thirties. Consequently, a much larger proportion of male scientists and engineers at all degree levels, but particularly at the doctorate level, will reach traditional retirement age during the next decade. This will affect sex ratios and potentially the number of female scientists in senior-level positions.\nUnemployment. Unemployment rates in 2006 were somewhat higher for women in S&E occupations than for men: 2.2% of men and 2.9% of women were unemployed. In contrast, the unemployment rate in 1993 was 2.7% for men and 2.1% for women (table 3-14).\nRepresentation of Racial and Ethnic Minorities in S&E\nWith the exception of Asians/Pacific Islanders, racial and ethnic minorities represent only a small proportion of those employed in S&E occupations in the United States.\n\nFigure 3-31 (NL KPZ[YPI\\[PVU VM PUKP]PK\\HSZ PU :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ I` ZL_! \nDensity (percent)\n0.035\n\n0.030\n\n0.025\n\n0.020 0.015\n\nWomen Men\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTE: Age distribution smoothed with kernel density techniques.

Although most (82%) Asians/Pacific Islanders in S&E occupations were foreign born, those born in the United States were also more highly represented in S&E than in the total workforce.\nAge Distribution. As is the case for women, underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in the S&E workforce are much younger than non-Hispanic whites in the same S&E jobs (figure 3-33), and this difference is even more pronounced for doctorate holders in S&E occupations (figure 3-34). This finding could point to an upcoming shift in the overall composition of the S&E workforce. In the near future, a much greater proportion of non-Hispanic white doctorate holders in S&E occupations will be reaching traditional retirement ages. This circumstance could signal a more rapid increase in the number of non-Hispanic white\n\ndoctorate holders who will retire or otherwise leave S&E employment. On the other hand, Asian/Pacific Islander doctorate holders in S&E occupations (measured by race and not by place of birth) are on average the youngest racial/ ethnic group, and thus the least likely to have large numbers of retirees.\nSalary Differentials for Women and Minorities\nTrends in Median Salaries. Women and members of underrepresented minority groups have generally lower earnings than their male and nonminority counterparts. However, differences in average age, work experience, fields of degree, sector of employment, and other characteristics can make direct comparison of salary and earnings statistics misleading. This section discusses these income gaps and explores some of the underlying factors that may affect them.\nFactors Influencing Salary Differentials. Regression analysis is a statistical method that can be used to examine salary and other differences simultaneously.7 Although this type of analysis can provide insight, it cannot give definitive answers to questions about the openness of S&E to women\n\nFigure 3-33 (NL KPZ[YPI\\[PVU VM PUKP]PK\\HSZ PU :\n, VJJ\\WH[PVUZ I` YHJLL[OUPJP[`! \nDensity (percent)\n0.050\n\n0.045 0.040 0.035 0.030\n\nAsian Underrepresented minority White\n\n0.025\n\n0.020\n\n0.015\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTES: Age distribution smoothed with kernel density techniques.

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nand minorities. The most basic reason is that no labor force survey ever captures information on all characteristics that may affect compensation.\nFigures 3-35 and 3-36 show estimates of salary differences for different groups after controlling for several individual characteristics. Differences in mean annual salary are substantial when comparing all individuals with S&E degrees by level of degree only.\nIn 2006, women with S&E bachelor's degrees working full time had mean salaries that were 36.2% less than those of their male counterparts. Likewise, full-time salaries of blacks, Hispanics, and individuals in other underrepresented ethnic groups with S&E bachelor's degrees were 25.8% less than those of non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders with S&E bachelor's degrees.8 While still substantial, these salary differentials decrease as level of degree increases for both women and ethnic minorities, reaching 21.1% and 15.0% respectively.\n\nEffects of Age and Years Since Degree. On average, women and members of underrepresented minority groups are younger than their counterparts in most S&E fields. Controlling for differences in both age and years since receipt of degree reduces the estimated salary differential for both women and minorities at every degree level.\nFor women, it reduces salary differentials by about onethird at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, and by about half at the doctorate level.9 Statistical controls may make less difference at lower degree levels because similar proportions of men and women with S&E degrees are in mid-career, but a larger proportion of men are at older ages, where salaries begin to decline.\nFor underrepresented ethnic minorities, controlling for age and years since degree produces proportionally larger reductions in salary differentials than is the case for women. Introducing these controls reduces salary differentials between underrepresented minorities and both non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders by more than half at all degree levels.\n\nFigure 3-35 ,Z[PTH[LK KPMMLYLUJLZ PU M\\SS[PTL ZHSHY` IL[^LLU ^VTLU HUK TLU ^P[O OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL PU :\n, JVU[YVSSPUN MVY SL]LS VM KLNYLL HUK V[OLY JOHYHJ[LYPZ[PJZ! \n\n;V[HS KPMMLYLUJL PU M\\SS[PTL ZHSHY`\n*VU[YVSSPUN MVY HNL HUK `LHYZ\nZPUJL KLNYLL\n\n)HJOLSVY\u00bbZ 4HZ[LY\u00bbZ +VJ[VYH[L\n\n7S\\Z MPLSK VM KLNYLL\n\n7S\\Z VJJ\\WH[PVU HUK LTWSV`LY JOHYHJ[LYPZ[PJZ\n\n7S\\Z MHTPS` HUK WLYZVUHS JOHYHJ[LYPZ[PJZ\n\n7S\\Z ZL_ZWLJPMPJ THYYPHNL HUK * JOPSK LMMLJ[Z * \n\n        Negative salary differential (percent)\n\n* = not significantly different from zero at p = .05\nNOTES: Salary differentials represent estimated differences in full-time salary for women compared to men in regression analyses including different characteristics.

Controlling for field of degree in addition to age and years since degree reduces the estimated salary differentials for women with S&E degrees to \u00ad12.0% at the bachelor's degree level and to \u00ad7.6% at the doctorate level.10 These reductions generally reflect the greater concentration of women in the lower-paying social and life sciences as opposed to engineering and computer sciences.\nField of degree is also associated with reduction of estimated salary differentials for underrepresented ethnic groups. Controlling for field of degree further reduces salary differentials to \u00ad9.1% for individuals with S&E bachelor's degrees and to \u00ad5.5% for individuals with S&E doctorates. At the doctoral level, field of degree, age, and years since degree together account for two-thirds of salary differentials for underrepresented ethnic groups.\nEffects of Occupation and Employer Characteristics on Salary Differentials. Occupation and employer characteristics affect compensation.11 Academic and nonprofit employers typically pay less for the same skills than employers pay in the private sector, and government compensation falls somewhere between the two groups. Other factors affecting salary are the sector of the economy, the U.S. region where a person works, and whether the person is working in S&E or in R&D. However, occupation and employer characteristics may not be determined solely by individual choice; they may also in part reflect an individual's career success.\nWhen comparing women with men and underrepresented ethnic groups with non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders, controlling for occupation and employer further reduces salary differentials. At the doctoral level, controlling for occupation leaves no statistically significant difference between the salaries of underrepresented ethnic groups compared with non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders.\nEffects of Family and Personal Characteristics on Salary Differentials. Marital status, the presence of children, parental education, and other personal characteristics are often associated with differences in compensation. Although these differences may involve discrimination, they may also reflect many subtle individual differences that can affect work productivity.12 For example, having highly educated parents is associated with higher salaries for individuals of all ethnicities and both sexes. It may well be associated with greater academic achievement not directly measured in these data; alternatively, it may be associated with family and personal networks that are conducive to career success. In any event, for many individuals in many ethnic groups, historical discrimination probably affected parents' educational opportunities and achievement.\nControlling for these additional characteristics changes salary differentials only slightly for each group and degree level.13 An additional issue for the wage differentials of women, however, is that family and child variables often have different effects for men and women. In these estimates, both marriage and children are associated with higher\n\nsalaries for men with S&E degrees at all levels, but have a negligible association with women's earnings. Allowing for these differences in sex effects reduces the salary differential at the bachelor's degree level to 4.7% and leaves no statistically significant difference in salary at the master's degree and doctorate levels.\nS&E Labor Market Conditions\nLabor market conditions for scientists and engineers affect the attractiveness of S&E fields to both students and those already in the labor force. In general, holders of S&E degrees have higher rates of pay and lower rates of unemployment than other college graduates. However, this does not exempt them from unemployment due to overall business cycles or specific events affecting individuals with training in their fields. This section looks at both long-term and recent trends using NSF, Census Bureau, and BLS data.\nEarnings\nThe estimated annual wages of individuals in S&E occupations, based on BLS's OES survey, are considerably higher than the average of the total workforce. Median annual wages in 2007 (regardless of education level or field) in S&E occupations were $70,600, more than double the median ($31,410) for total U.S. employment (table 3-15). The spread in average (mean) wage was less dramatic but still quite wide, with individuals in S&E occupations again earning considerably more on average ($74,070) than workers in all occupations ($40,690). Mean S&E wages ranged from $66,370 for social science occupations to $81,050 for engineering occupations. Mean annual wages for technology occupations ranged from $53,165 for technicians and programmers to $114,470 for S&E managers.\nThe 2004\u00ad07 growth in mean wages for both the S&E and STEM occupation groups (3.4%) was slightly greater than that for all workers included in the OES survey (3.2%). Among S&E occupations, those in physical S&E occupations experienced the highest wage growth (3.7% average annual rate) and those in social science occupations experienced the lowest (3.1% average annual rate).\nWorkers with S&E degrees also have higher earnings than those with degrees in other fields. Figure 3-37 shows estimates of median salary at different points in life for individuals with a bachelor's degree as their highest degree in a variety of fields. Except in the first 4 years after earning their degrees, holders of S&E bachelor's degrees earn more than those with non-S&E degrees at every year since degree. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders in 2003 peaked at $65,000 at 15\u00ad19 years after receiving their degree, compared with $49,000 for those with non-S&E bachelor's degrees. Median salaries of individuals with bachelor's degrees in S&E-related fields (such as technology, architecture, or health) peaked at $52,000 at 25\u00ad29 years after degree, but were higher than those for non-S&E bachelor's degree holders at most years since receiving their degree.\n\n\f3-38 \n\nChapter 3.

(The distributions are heavily skewed, making the median a preferred summary statistic.) Not surprisingly, salaries are higher for those with more advanced degrees. In 2003, 11% of S&E bachelor's degree holders had salaries higher than $100,000, compared with 28% of doctorate holders. Similarly, 22% of bachelor's degree holders earned less than $30,000, compared with 8% of doctorate holders.14\nFigure 3-39 shows a cross-sectional profile of median 2003 salaries for S&E degree holders over the course of their career. Median earnings generally increase with time since degree, as workers add on-the-job knowledge to the formal training they received in school. For holders of bachelor's and master's degrees in S&E, average earnings adjusted for inflation begin to decline in mid to late career, a common pattern that is often attributed to \"skill depreciation.\" In contrast, earnings for S&E doctorate holders continue to rise even late in their careers. Median salaries in 2003 peaked at $65,000 for bachelor's degree holders, $73,000 for master's degree holders, and $96,000 for doctorate holders.\nUnemployment in S&E Occupations\nAlong with higher salaries, relatively low unemployment rates are among the labor market rewards of the S&E labor force. Historically, unemployment rates in S&E occupations have tended to be lower than those for college-educated\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-39\n\nFigure 3-38 :HSHY` KPZ[YPI\\[PVU VM :\n, KLNYLL OVSKLYZ LTWSV`LK M\\SS [PTL I` KLNYLL SL]LS! \nDensity (percent)\n\n\n \n\n)HJOLSVY\u00bbZ 4HZ[LY\u00bbZ\n\n \n\n+VJ[VYH[L\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n  \n\n                    Salary ($thousands)\n\nNOTE: Salary distribution smoothed using kernel density techniques.

During most of the period, computer programmers had an unemployment rate similar to that of S&E occupations, but greater volatility (from 1.2% to 6.7%).\nData on the economic downturn that began in late 2007 initially fit with long-term trends. In 2008, workers in S&E occupations or S&E technician and computer programmer occupations had lower unemployment rates (2.1% or 3.9%, respectively) than all workers (5.8%). College-educated S&E workers had lower unemployment rates (2.1%) than all college graduates (2.8%). However, in the 3-month period ending in September 2009, the unemployment rate of college educated S&E workers rose to 5.5%, approximately the same rate as for all college graduates (5.4%). S&E technicians and computer programmers continued to experience a considerably lower unemployment rate (7.6%) than that of the general labor force (9.7%) (figure 3-41).\nIn most economic downturns, workers with advanced S&E degrees have been less vulnerable to changes in economic conditions than individuals who hold only S&E bachelor's degrees.

The relatively difficult 2003 labor market had a greater effect on bachelor's degree holders: for individuals at various points in their careers, the unemployment rate increased by between 1.6 and 3.5 percentage points between 1999 and 2003. Labor market conditions had a smaller effect on doctorate holders, but some increases in unemployment rates affected individuals in most years-since-degree cohorts.\nSimilarly among those who said they were working involuntarily out of the field (IOF) of their highest degree, labor market conditions from 1999 to 2003 had a greater effect on the proportion of bachelor's degree holders than on doctorate holders (figure 3-43). These rates ranged from 7% to 12% for bachelor's degree holders in 2003 versus 2% to 5% for those with doctorates. IOF rates for doctorate holders changed little between 1999 and 2003.\nAlthough S&E qualifications may help workers weather recessions, they do not make them immune from adverse labor market conditions.

Across all fields of S&E degrees in 2006, there was a 3.8% unemployment rate for bachelor's degree holders who received their degrees in the previous 1\u00ad5 years. This ranged from 1.9% for those with engineering degrees to 5.1% for social science degree recipients. Individuals early in their career tend to change jobs more often and have higher unemployment, yet most of these values are less than the unemployment rate of 4.7% for the full labor force in 2006. For doctorate recipients across all fields of degree, the unemployment rate was 1.1%.\nA useful but more subjective indicator of labor market conditions for recent graduates is the proportion reporting that they sought, but could not find, full-time employment related to their field of degree. The involuntarily out of field (IOF) rate is a measure unique to NSF's labor force surveys. At the bachelor's degree level, across all S&E fields, the IOF rate was 11.0%, but it ranged from 3.6% for recent engineering graduates to 15.7% for recent graduates in the social sciences. In all fields of degree, the IOF rate decreases with\n\nTable 3-16 Labor market indicators for recent S&E degree recipients 1\u00ad5 years after receiving degree, by field: 2006\n\nHighest degree field\n\nIndicator and degree\n\nAll S&E fields\n\nComputer/ mathematical\nsciences\n\nLife sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nEngineering\n\nPercent\n\nUnemployment rate\n\nBachelor's ..........................\n\n3.8\n\n4.6\n\n4.6\n\n4.0\n\n5.1\n\n1.9\n\nMaster's .............................\n\n2.5\n\n3.1\n\n2.9\n\n2.6\n\n4.6\n\n2.5\n\nDoctorate ...........................\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n1.9\n\n1.4\n\nInvoluntary out-of-field rate\n\nBachelor's ..........................\n\n11.0\n\n8.5\n\n9.9\n\n9.4\n\n15.7\n\n3.6\n\nMaster's .............................\n\n4.2\n\n3.5\n\n4.1\n\n6.4\n\n9.5\n\n2.9\n\nDoctorate ...........................\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n0.6\n\n4.1\n\n4.0\n\n2.5\n\nAverage salary Bachelor's ..........................

Recent master's degree recipients had average salaries of $55,000 and recent doctorate recipients had salaries yielding only slightly more at $56,000. This reflects in part the relatively low postdoc salaries of some recent doctorate recipients (see discussion in next section) and the greater employment of doctorate holders in academia.\nRecent Doctorate Recipients\nThe career rewards of highly skilled individuals in general, and doctorate holders in particular, often extend beyond salary and employment to more personal rewards that come from doing the kind of work for which they have trained. No single standard measure satisfactorily reflects the state of the doctoral S&E labor market; a range of available labor market indicators are discussed below, including unemployment rates, IOF employment, satisfaction with field of study, employment in academia versus other sectors, employment in postdoc positions, and salaries. Although a doctorate opens career\n\nopportunities both in terms of salary and type of employment, these opportunities come at the price of many years of foregone labor market earnings. Some doctorate holders also face an additional period of low earnings while in a postdoc position. In addition, some doctorate holders do not obtain the jobs they desire after completing their education.\nIn 2006, aggregate measures of labor market conditions for recent (1\u00ad3 years after receipt of degree) recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates showed improvement from the already generally good conditions found when last measured in 2003. Unemployment fell from 2.3% to 1.3% and IOF rates fell from 3.3% to 1.3% (table 3-17). In addition, the percentage of recent graduates entering tenure-track programs at 4-year institutions--a goal of many young doctorate holders--increased, rising from 17.8% in 2003 to 19.2% in 2006 (table 3-18).\nUnemployment The 1.3% unemployment rate for recent S&E doctor-\nate recipients as of April 2006 was even lower than other generally low 2006 unemployment rates. The 2006 unemployment rate for all civilian workers was 4.6%, with lower rates of 2.2% for those with a bachelor's degree or above and 1.6% for those in S&E occupations (figure 3-40).\n\nTable 3-17 Labor market rates for recent doctorate recipients 1\u00ad3 years after receiving doctorate, by selected field: 2001, 2003, and 2006\n(Percent)\n\nUnemployment rate\n\nInvoluntarily out-of-field rate\n\nField\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\nAll S&E ................................................................\n\n1.3\n\n2.3\n\n1.3\n\nComputer/mathematical sciences ..................\n\n0.3\n\n4.2\n\n0.7\n\nComputer sciences .....................................\n\n0.4\n\n4.4\n\n1.7\n\nMathematics ................................................\n\n0.3\n\n4.0\n\n0.0\n\nLife sciences ...................................................\n\n1.1\n\n2.5\n\n0.9\n\nAgriculture ...................................................\n\n0.3\n\n3.1\n\n0.0\n\nBiological sciences......................................\n\n1.0\n\n2.6\n\n1.0\n\nPhysical sciences ...........................................\n\n1.3\n\n0.9\n\n1.6\n\nChemistry ....................................................\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.9\n\nGeosciences................................................\n\n1.9\n\n1.5\n\n1.9\n\nPhysics/astronomy ......................................\n\n1.9\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nSocial sciences ...............................................\n\n1.3\n\n2.5\n\n1.2\n\nEconomics...................................................\n\n2.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\nPolitical science ..........................................\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nPsychology ..................................................\n\n1.4\n\n2.8\n\n1.2\n\nSociology/anthropology ..............................\n\n1.2\n\n5.0\n\n2.4\n\nEngineering .....................................................\n\n1.8\n\n2.3\n\n1.9\n\nChemical .....................................................\n\n1.6\n\n2.1\n\n0.7\n\nElectrical ......................................................\n\n0.9\n\n2.3\n\n0.3\n\nMechanical ..................................................\n\n3.2\n\n5.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.4\n\n3.3\n\n1.3\n\n2.4\n\n3.6\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n1.4\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n5.6\n\n2.1\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.3\n\n4.1\n\n2.9\n\n1.7\n\n2.4\n\n1.3\n\n0.2\n\n5.0\n\n3.6\n\n2.3\n\n3.2\n\n4.3\n\n0.9\n\n3.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n8.2\n\n4.3\n\n5.9\n\n5.1\n\n5.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.1\n\n1.9\n\n0.0\n\n8.7\n\n9.0\n\n0.6\n\n3.8\n\n5.2\n\n1.3\n\n6.3\n\n4.5\n\n4.8\n\n1.7\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n8.9\n\n9.8\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.7\n\n2.6\n\n0.0\n\nNOTES: Doctorate recipients in health fields included in life sciences.

Unemployment in both fields (which also had the highest unemployment rates in 2003) fell from 5.8% and 5.0%, respectively, in 2003. The unemployment rate for recent S&E doctorate recipients in computer sciences, the field with the third highest unemployment rate in 2003, fell from 4.4% to 1.7% in 2006.\nWorking Involuntarily Outside the Field In addition to the 1.3% who were unemployed in 2006,\nanother 1.3% of recent S&E doctorate recipients in the labor force reported that they took a job that was not related to the field of their doctorate because a job in their field was not available. Comparable figures were 3.4% in 2001 and 3.3% in 2003.\nThe highest IOF rates were found for recent doctorate recipients in chemical engineering (9.8%), physics/astronomy (5.9%), and sociology/anthropology (4.8%).\nTenure-Track Positions Many S&E doctorate recipients may aspire to tenure-\ntrack academic appointments, but most will end up working in other positions and sectors. Recently, the proportion of all recent doctorate recipients entering tenure-track academic jobs has increased, breaking a long-term decline. Such\n\nincreases can be seen between 2001 and 2003, and again between 2003 and 2006. As a result, 2006 tenure-track rates for those 1\u00ad3 years after receiving their degree and those 4\u00ad6 years after receiving their degree were broadly the same as in 1993 (figure 3-44; table 3-18). From 2003 to 2006, the rate for those 1\u00ad3 years since receiving their degree rose from 18% to 19%, and the rate for those 4\u00ad6 years since receiving their degree increased from 24% to 26%. (See chapter 5 for a discussion of trends in tenure-track positions as a proportion of all academic positions.)\nThe availability of tenure-track positions may be counterbalanced by the availability of desirable nonacademic employment opportunities. One of the quickest declines in tenure-track employment occurred in computer sciences, from 52% in 1993 to 24% in 2001 despite the difficulties computer sciences departments had in finding faculty.\nSalaries for Recent S&E Doctorate Recipients In 2006 for all S&E degree fields, the median annual\nsalary for recent doctorate recipients 1\u00ad5 years after they received their degrees was $52,000. Across various S&E fields of degree, median annual salaries ranged from a low of $46,000 in the life sciences to a high of $70,000 in engineering (table 3-19).\nBy type of employment, salaries for recent doctorate recipients ranged from $40,000 for postdoc positions to\n\n\f3-44 \n\n-PN\\YL  +VJ[VYH[L YLJPWPLU[Z OVSKPUN [LU\\YL HUK [LU\\YL [YHJR HWWVPU[TLU[Z H[ HJHKLTPJ PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ \u00b6 `LHYZ HM[LY KLNYLL I` MPLSK!  \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n *VTW\\[LYTH[OLTH[PJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n(SS :\n,\n\n3PML ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n56;,:! ;^V`LHY PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ UV[ PUJS\\KLK 3PML ZJPLUJLZ PUJS\\KLZ KVJ[VYH[L YLJPWPLU[Z PU OLHS[O MPLSKZ\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM +VJ[VYH[L 9LJPWPLU[Z  \u00b6\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nTable 3-19 Salary of recent doctorate recipients 1\u00ad5 years after receiving degree, by degree field and percentile: 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nDegree field\n\n25th\n\n50th\n\n75th\n\npercentile percentile percentile\n\nAll S&E fields ....................

Neither the reasons for this growth nor its effect on the health of science are well understood. Increases in competition for tenure-track academic research jobs, collaborative research in large teams, and needs for specialized training are possible factors explaining this growth. Although individuals in postdoc positions often perform cutting-edge research, there is a concern that time spent in a postdoc position is time added onto the already long time spent earning a doctorate, thereby delaying the start and advancement of independent careers. Because postdoc positions usually offer low pay, forgone earnings add significantly to the costs of a doctoral education and may discourage doctoral-level careers in S&E.\nHow Many Postdocs Are There? The total number of postdocs in the United States is un-\nknown; broad estimates depend upon a number of assumptions. NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) covers U.S. residents with research doctorates in S&E and health fields from U.S. universities, but not those with non-U.S. doctorates. The NSF Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering gathers information on postdocs from U.S. academic graduate departments, regardless of where their doctorate was earned. It does not cover people in nonacademic employment, at some university research centers, or at academic departments that lack graduate programs. Table 3-21 shows the SDR and GSS estimates of the U.S. postdoc population that these surveys cover.\nAcademic Postdocs. SDR estimates that 22,900 U.S. citizens and permanent residents were in academic postdoc positions in fall 2005, along with 7,700 temporary visa holders.16 The corresponding 2005 GSS estimate is 16,200 U.S. citizens and permanent residents but 26,600 temporary visa holders.\nPostdocs in FFRDCs. Many federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) employ postdocs as part of their efforts to assist government agencies with scientific research and analysis and to train the country's researchers and scientists. According to NSF's 2007 Survey of Postdocs at FFRDCs, 22 of the 38 FFRDCs on the master government FFRDC list maintained by the NSF reported employing 2,235 postdocs. Of those 2,235 postdocs, 1,336 (about 60%) were temporary visa holders and 2,030 (about 91%) received federal support.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-45\n\nTable 3-20 Median annual salary of recent doctorate recipients 1\u00ad5 years after receiving degree, by type of employment: 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nField\n\nAll sectors\n\nPrivate\n\nTenure track\n\nPostdoc\n\nOther\n\nNonprofit/\n\neducation government\n\nAll S&E fields ....................................................

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nOther Postdocs. Neither the GSS nor the SDR survey includes data on the number of foreign-educated postdocs in all sectors. SDR estimates that 29% of U.S.-educated postdocs, 13,000 in all, are in industry, nonprofits, government, and other types of educational institutions. Using these data, one might estimate as follows:\n 22,900 U.S. citizens and permanent residents in academic postdoc positions (SDR)\n 26,900 persons on temporary visas in academic postdoc positions (GSS)\n 13,000 U.S.-educated persons in postdoc positions not covered by GSS (SDR)\n 26,500 postdocs on temporary visas in positions not covered by GSS, based on the assumption that proportions of temporary visa postdocs in sectors and parts of academia not covered by GSS are the same as in the GSS estimates.\nThese assumptions yield approximately 89,300 postdocs, but other comparably plausible assumptions lead to substantially different totals.\nPostdocs by Academic Discipline About half of all U.S.-educated postdocs in 2005 (49%)\nhad doctorates in the biological and other life sciences (figure 3-45). In this field, postdoc training has been common for a long time and individuals remain in postdoc positions longer than in other fields. Psychology, chemistry, and physics also have high rates of graduates entering postdoc positions and together make up another one-quarter of postdoc positions. The remaining quarter come from all other fields of S&E, most of which do not have a strong postdoc tradition as part of their career paths.\n\nFigure 3-45 -PLSK VM KVJ[VYH[L VM <:LK\\JH[LK :\n, KVJ[VYH[L YLJPWPLU[Z PU WVZ[KVJ WVZP[PVUZ! -HSS \n6[OLY LUNPULLYPUN \f *OLTPJHS LUNPULLYPUN \f 4LJOHUPJHS LUNPULLYPUN \f ,SLJ[YPJHS LUNPULLYPUN \f 6[OLY ZVJPHS ZJPLUJLZ \f\n\n7Z`JOVSVN` \f\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ \f 4H[OLTH[PJZ \f .LVZJPLUJLZ  \f 7O`ZPJZ \f\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ \f\n\n*OLTPZ[Y` \f\n\n6[OLY SPML\n\nZJPLUJLZ \f\n\nNOTE: Percentages do not add to 100% because of rounding.

This proportion has risen over time to 46% among 2002\u00ad05 graduates and has increasingly involved fields in which formerly only a small number of doctorate recipients went on to postdoc positions. In traditionally high-postdoc fields such as the life sciences (from 46% to 60%) and the physical sciences (from 41% to 61%), a majority of doctorate recipients now have a postdoc position as part of their career path. Similar increases were found in mathematical and computer sciences (19% to 31%), social sciences (18% to 30%) and engineering (14% to 38%). Recent engineering doctorate recipients are now almost as likely to take a postdoc position as physical sciences doctorate holders were 35 years ago.\nPostdoc Pay and Benefits Low pay and fewer benefits for postdocs are frequently\nraised as concerns by those worried about the effect of the increasing number of postdoc positions on the attractiveness of science careers. The median academic postdoc salary is one-third less than the median salary for nonpostdocs 1\u00ad3 years after receiving their doctorates (table 3-22).

Indeed, across all S&E fields, 90% of postdocs reported having medical benefits and 49% reported having retirement benefits. It is not possible to know from the survey how extensive medical benefits may be or how transferable retirement benefits are. In the social sciences, medical benefits are less available, with only 75% of postdocs reporting that they had medical benefits.\nPostdoc Positions as a Sign of Labor Market Distress for Recent Doctorate Recipients\nFormer postdoc position holders reported reasons for accepting their appointment that are consistent with the traditional intent of a postdoc as a type of apprenticeship, such as seeking \"additional training in doctorate field\" or \"training in an area outside of doctorate field.\" However, 9% of Survey of Doctorate Recipients respondents in a postdoc position in April 2006 reported that they took their current postdoc position because \"other employment not available.\" This reason was given by 5% of postdocs in the life sciences, 8% in computer and mathematical sciences, 10% in the physical sciences, 14% in the social sciences, and 16% in engineering.\nPostdoc Outcomes Most former postdocs report that their most recent post-\ndoctoral appointment enhanced their career opportunities, and the proportions who say this are similar for different cohorts (figure 3-47). Across all S&E fields and cohorts, 53%\u00ad56% of former postdocs said that their postdoc appointment enhanced their career opportunities to a \"great extent\"; an additional 33%\u00ad38% said that their postdoc appointment \"somewhat\" enhanced their career opportunities. The proportion of those completing postdoc positions who said that it was no help to their career opportunities ranged from only 8% for the 2002\u00ad05 graduation cohort to 12% for the 1987\u00ad91 cohort. For a more detailed look at perceived\n\nand actual outcomes from a postdoc experience, see chapter 3 of Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 (NSB 2008) and NSF/SRS (2008b).\n\nGlobal S&E Labor Force\nScience is a global enterprise.

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\ntechnical innovations is creating a new competitive environment. New ways of doing business and performing R&D take advantage of gains from new knowledge discovered anywhere in the world, from increases in foreign economic development, and from the expanding international migration of highly trained scientists and engineers.\nThis section begins with an overview of what is known about S&E labor forces in advanced countries, which mostly concerns researchers and people performing R&D for multinational firms. The remainder of the section deals with foreign-born scientists and engineers in the United States.\nOther chapters provide indirect indicators on the global S&E labor force. Chapter 2 reports on the production of new scientists and engineers through university degree programs. Chapter 4 provides indicators of R&D performed globally, chapter 5 discusses publications output and international collaboration, and chapter 6 has information on high-technology activities and global patenting activity.\nCounts of Global S&E Labor Force\nThere are no comprehensive measures of the global S&E labor force, but fragmentary data on the global S&E labor force suggest that the U.S. world share is continuing to decline, even as U.S. reliance on foreign-born scientists and engineers may be near or at a historic high. Data exist within some national data systems, and some countries report data in standardized form to international agencies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Existing data provide a strong indication of rapid growth in the number of individuals who pursue advanced education and find employment in technical fields, particularly in developing nations.\nOECD collects data on researchers from its member countries and selected other countries. Unfortunately, this source misses many countries that appear to have high levels of S&T activity, including India, Brazil, and Israel.\nFigure 3-48 shows the growth between 1995 and 2007 in the reported number of researchers in selected countries/ economies. The United States had about the same growth of researchers as the EU-27, about 40% each over the time period. The number of researchers in Japan rose by just over 5%. Over the same 12-year period, the reported number of researchers in China rose by 173% to more than 1.4 million in 2007--close to the estimated U.S. figure and the number of the combined EU-27. An important caution in interpreting these data is that although countries used a common definition of \"researcher\" when reporting their data to OECD, there are many judgments necessary to translate from a wide variety of national data systems to the OECD definition.\nTertiary Education One widely available measure of the education level of\na country's population is the number of its residents with a tertiary level of education. This is roughly equivalent in U.S. terms to individuals who have earned at least a technical associate's degree, but also includes all higher degrees\n\n-PN\\YL  ,Z[PTH[LK U\\TILY VM YLZLHYJOLYZ PU ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUZJV\\U[YPLZLJVUVTPLZ!  \u00b6\n\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n  \n\n<: ,< 1HWHU :V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n*OPUH :PUNHWVYL ;HP^HU 9\\ZZPH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n\n56;,:! 9LZLHYJOLYZ HYL M\\SS[PTL LX\\P]HSLU[Z  KH[H MVY <UP[LK :[H[LZ HYL LZ[PTH[LK IHZLK VU HUU\\HS NYV^[O YH[L IL[^LLU   HUK \n\n:6<9*,! 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ   HUK LHYSPLY `LHYZ\n\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nup to the doctorate. Figure 3-49, based on estimates by Barro and Lee (2000), shows the global distribution of tertiary education graduates in 2000 or the most recent available year. About one-fourth of the world's tertiary graduates were in the United States; the next three largest countries in terms of tertiary education are China, India, and Russia, which are all non-OECD members.\nHighly Skilled Migrants in OECD Countries Docquier and Marfouk (2004) made estimates of the high-\nly educated international migrants residing in OECD countries by using data from various national censuses. Based on their data, figure 3-50 shows the leading countries of origin of non-natives with tertiary-level education who lived in OECD countries in 2000. With 1.4 million, the United Kingdom has the largest high-skilled diaspora. (Although originally used to describe much less voluntary dispersals of population in history, the term diaspora is increasingly used to describe the internationally mobile portion of a country's nationals, which forms a network for contact and information flow. These networks can provide advantages for a country that help mitigate the loss of human capital through migration.)\nThe United States, ranking 11th with 448,000 tertiaryeducated citizens who live in other OECD countries, has a fairly small high-skilled diaspora compared with its\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nFigure 3-49 ;LY[PHY`LK\\JH[LK WVW\\SH[PVU TVYL [OHU  `LHYZ VSK I` JV\\U[Y`!

Data on MNC R&D employment include all employees engaged in research and development, including managers, scientists, engineers, and other professional and technical employees. Data on R&D employment of parent companies of U.S. MNCs and their overseas affiliates are available every 5 years from the Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Separately, data on R&D employment by foreign-based MNCs in the United States are available from BEA's Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States.\nBy definition, FDI does not include external arrangements ranging from R&D contracting to consulting work and strategic collaborations.18 Nevertheless, R&D employment by subsidiaries is an important indicator of international R&D activity.\nR&D employment in the United States by foreign firms grew slightly faster than R&D employment abroad by U.S. firms. R&D employment in the United States by majorityowned affiliates19 of foreign firms rose from 89,800 in 1994 to 128,500 in 2004, for a 43% increase over the decade (figure 3-51). Over the same 10 years, R&D employment by U.S. firms at their majority-owned foreign affiliates grew 35%, from 102,000 in 1994 to 137,800 in 2004.

Governments in many industrialized countries increasingly view the immigration of skilled S&E workers as an important contributor to the quality and flexibility of their S&E labor force. Many countries have not only increased their research investments, but have also made encouraging high-skilled immigration an important part of their national economic strategies.\nThe United States has benefited, and continues to benefit, from this international flow of knowledge and personnel (see Regets 2001 for a general discussion of high-skilled migration). However, competition for skilled labor continues to increase.

(See sidebar \"High-Skill Migration to Japan and the UK.\")\nBroadly consistent estimates of U.S. reliance on foreignborn scientists and engineers are available from several sources. Table 3-23 shows upward trends in the percentage of foreign-born individuals in U.S. S&E occupations over time. The percentage changes since 2000 may appear small but are quite substantial, given the short time span and the overall growth of the number of persons in S&E occupations from 2000 to 2007: of an estimated 341,000 total increase, 100,000 were foreign born.\nSESTAT surveys include only individuals who were counted in the most recent Decennial Censuses or who received a U.S. S&E degree, thereby missing recently arrived foreign-born and foreign-educated scientists and engineers. Yet, a large proportion of the foreign-born and foreign-educated members of the S&E labor force are recent arrivals. For example, in 2000, about 43% of all college-educated foreign-born workers in U.S. S&E occupations reported arriving in the United States after 1990; among doctorate holders 62% reported arriving after this date.\nThe 2000 census data provide a good estimate of the foreign born who were actually in the United States in April 2000 but give no information about those performing S&E tasks in a wide variety of non-S&E occupations (as discussed earlier in this chapter), nor about which postsecondary teachers are in S&E fields. Within these limitations, the Census Bureau's 2007 American Community Survey permits an analysis of trends in the proportion of the foreign born in S&E occupations at each degree level during the current decade. It shows growth of 3 percentage points overall, with an extra 4 percentage points each at the master's degree and doctorate levels.\nBetween 2003 and 2007, employment of college graduates in nonacademic S&E occupations, as measured by the ACS, increased by 345,000: 235,000 U.S. natives and 110,000 foreign born (figure 3-53). The estimated overall proportion of the foreign born rose only slightly over these 4 years (from 24.6% to 25.2%) but increased by 2 percentage points each for those with master's degrees and doctorates in this short span.\nDetails on the proportion of foreign-born S&E degree holders by field of degree are shown in table 3-24, based on 2003 SESTAT estimates. At the doctoral level, foreign-born individuals constitute about half the total number of workers in both engineering (51%) and mathematics/computer sciences (48%), up from 41% and 33% a decade earlier. Only in the geosciences and the social sciences are the foreign born significantly less than a third of doctorate holders in S&E fields. At the bachelor's degree level, 15% of S&E degree holders were foreign born, ranging from 7% of individuals in sociology/anthropology to 27% in physics/astronomy and 28% in electrical engineering. Given the continuing increase in foreign participation, it is likely that these 2003-based percentages are conservative estimates.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-51\n\nHigh-Skill Migration to Japan and the UK\n\nRecent debates and legislative changes in many developed (and sometimes less developed) countries have focused on visa programs for temporary high-skilled workers. The United Kingdom and Japan are just two examples of countries that have made temporary high-skilled migration important parts of national economic policies.\nA 1989 revision of Japanese immigration laws made it easier for high-skilled workers to enter Japan with temporary visas, which allow employment and residence for an indefinite period (even though the same visa classes also apply to work visits that may last for only a few months). In 2005, 169,800 workers entered Japan in selected highskilled temporary visa categories, compared with just over 30,000 in 1990 (figure 3-E). For comparison purposes, this equals half the number of Japanese university graduates entering the labor force each year and is more than the number entering the United States in roughly similar categories (H-1B, L-1, TN, O-1, O-2).\nThe United Kingdom's programs for the entry of highskilled workers continue to evolve in ways to encourage migration and are currently part of an overall point system. Under the United Kingdom's recent Highly Skilled Migrant Program, admissions grew from 1,197 in 2002 to 21,939 in 2006. An important note for these numbers is that high-skilled EU citizens enter the UK without needing this visa, so actual high-skilled migration to the UK is likely to be much larger. During these years, the number of U.S. citizens entering the UK as high-skilled migrants grew from 273 to a still modest 629 (Salt 2007).\n\n-PN\\YL , ,U[Y` [V 1HWHU VM ^VYRLYZ ^P[O ZLSLJ[LK JSHZZLZ VM OPNOZRPSSLK [LTWVYHY` ]PZHZ!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n7YVMLZZVYZ\n\n9LZLHYJOLYZ \n0UZ[Y\\J[VYZ\n\n,UNPULLYZ\n\n\n\n0U[YHJVTWHU` [YHUZMLYLLZ\n\n:RPSSLK SHIVYLYZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:6<9*,! :[H[PZ[PJZ )\\YLH\\ 1HWHULZL 4PUPZ[Y` MVY 0U[LYUHS (MMHPYZ HUK *VTT\\UPJH[PVUZ ]HYPV\\Z `LHYZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nTable 3-23 Estimates of foreign-born individuals in S&E occupations from NSF/SRS and Census Bureau, by educational attainment: 1999, 2000, and 2003\n(Percent)\n\n2003\n\nEducation\n\n1999 NSF/SRS SESTAT\n\n2000 Census 5% PUMS NSF/SRS SESTAT\n\nCensus Bureau ACS\n\nAll college educateda.......................................................\n\n15.0\n\n22.4\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\nBachelor's ....................................................................\n\n11.3\n\n16.5\n\n16.3\n\n18.8\n\nMaster's .......................................................................\n\n19.4\n\n29.0\n\n29.0\n\n32.0\n\nDoctorate .....................................................................\n\n28.7\n\n37.6\n\n35.6\n\n39.5\n\nACS = American Community Survey; NSF/SRS = National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics; SESTAT = Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System; 5% PUMS = Public Use Microdata Sample with 5% of sample cases\n\naIncludes professional degrees not broken out separately.\n\nNOTES: Includes all S&E occupations except postsecondary teachers because these occupations not separately reported in 2000 Census or 2003 American Community Survey data files.\n\nSOURCES: NSF/SRS, SESTAT (1999 and 2003), Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), http://sestat.nsf.gov; and Census Bureau, PUMS (2000) and ACS (2003).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\f3-52 \n\nChapter 3.

Table 3-25 illustrates the various educational routes that highly skilled workers from around the world take into the United States workforce and indicates how these workers help connect the United States to universities and research institutions worldwide.\nAcross all levels of degree, 42% of the university-educated foreign born in the United States had their highest degree from a foreign educational institution and 56% had at least\n\nTable 3-24 Foreign-born proportion of individuals with highest degree in S&E, by field and education level: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nHighest degree\n\nField\n\nAll degree levelsa\n\nBachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\nAll S&E ..........................................................................\n\n18.8\n\nComputer/mathematical sciences ............................\n\n25.8\n\nComputer sciences ...............................................\n\n29.9\n\nMathematics ..........................................................\n\n18.5\n\nBiological/agricultural/environmental life sciences...\n\n16.6\n\nAgricultural and food sciences..............................\n\n11.6\n\nBiological sciences................................................\n\n19.0\n\nEnvironmental life sciences...................................\n\n6.6\n\nPhysical sciences .....................................................\n\n22.9\n\nChemistry ..............................................................\n\n25.3\n\nGeosciences..........................................................\n\n11.3\n\nPhysics/astronomy ................................................\n\n32.6\n\nOther physical sciences ........................................\n\n16.3\n\nSocial sciences .........................................................\n\n11.5\n\nEconomics ............................................................\n\n21.7\n\nPolitical science ....................................................\n\n11.0\n\nPsychology ............................................................\n\n9.7\n\nSociology/anthropology ........................................\n\n7.2\n\nOther social sciences ............................................\n\n13.0\n\nEngineering ...............................................................\n\n26.8\n\nAerospace/aeronautical/astronautical ...................\n\n16.4\n\nChemical ...............................................................\n\n26.0\n\nCivil ........................................................................\n\n24.9\n\nElectrical ................................................................\n\n34.1\n\nIndustrial ................................................................\n\n21.5\n\nMechanical ............................................................\n\n23.0\n\nOther engineering..................................................\n\n23.4\n\n15.2 19.3 22.3 14.4 12.6\n8.8 14.6\n4.3 16.9 18.1\n8.3 27.4 14.1 10.8 19.8\n9.5 10.1\n6.7 10.6 21.5\n9.7 17.7 19.7 28.1 17.5 19.6 18.8\n\n27.2 40.5 46.5 25.5 21.2 15.9 23.9 13.5 28.9 42.1 13.0 34.4 11.1 13.3 30.5 17.1\n8.5 10.2 18.2 38.3 29.6 49.4 39.3 45.9 33.1 34.3 25.8\n\n34.6 47.5 57.4 43.1 36.2 32.7 37.4 13.3 36.9 37.0 26.2 40.1 48.7 16.9 31.5 24.2\n9.8 13.6 31.3 50.6 52.6 47.0 54.2 57.5 42.0 52.2 44.6\n\naIncludes professional degrees not broken out separately.\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) (2003), http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-53\n\nFigure 3-54 -VYLPNUIVYU PUKP]PK\\HSZ ^P[O OPNOLZ[ KLNYLL PU :\n, SP]PUN PU <UP[LK :[H[LZ I` WSHJL VM IPY[O! \n\n(SS :\n,\n\n:\n, KVJ[VYH[L\n\nOther foreign born 31%\n\nIndia 16% China 11%\n\nOther foreign born 34%\n\nChina 22%\n\nCuba 1% Japan 2%\nIran 3% Mexico 3%\nVietnam 3% Germany 3%\nTaiwan 4%\n\nPhilippines 6%\nFormer Soviet Union 5%\nCanada 4% UK 4%\nSouth Korea 4%\n\nJapan 2% Iran 2%\nSouth Korea 3% Germany 4%\nTaiwan 4%\n\nIndia 14%\nUK 6% Former Soviet Union 6% Canada 4%\n\nUK = United Kingdom NOTE: Percents may not add to 100% because of rounding.

These percentages increase for more recent entry cohorts of immigrants. It should be noted that some portion of the increase in the most recent entry years reflects immigrants who entered during those years but have not yet had sufficient time to complete an American degree.\nCitizenship and Visa Status of Foreign-Born Scientists and Engineers in the United States\nThe length of time it takes for foreign scientists and engineers to earn U.S. citizenship affects both their decision to come to the United States and their subsequent decision to stay. As figure 3-56 shows, only about half of foreign S&E degree holders who entered the United States in 1991 and remained in 2003 had obtained citizenship. Citizenship status may particularly affect the supply of S&T talent available to segments of the U.S. economy that can typically hire only citizens: the federal government and private companies engaged in defense and other classified research.20 While a significant portion of any group of immigrants never seeks citizenship, the type of visas that scientists, engineers, and other high-skilled workers use for initial entry into the United States affects their path to citizenship. Time spent in the United States on a student or temporary work visa does not count toward the 5-year waiting period before immigrants can apply for citizenship.\nTemporary Work Visas In recent years, policy discussion has focused on the use\nof various forms of temporary work visas by foreign-born scientists and other high-skilled workers. The use of these temporary visas for high-skilled workers has increased over time (as seen in figure 3-57). For all types of temporary work visas, the actual number of individuals using them is\n\n\f3-54 \n\nChapter 3.

For example, some individuals may have job offers from employers in more than one country and may choose not to foreclose any options until a visa is certain.\nJ-1 Exchange Visas. Of the visa types shown, the J-1 exchange visitor visa is the most issued--more than 350,000 in FY 2008. However, many of these visas are given to lower skilled workers, and many J-1s are issued for semester or summer stays. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) showed approximately 165,000 J-1 visa holders in the United States, of whom 50% were in categories that were clearly highly skilled, including nearly 50,000 professors and research scholars.\nOther Visa Types. There has also been growth in visas issued in other high-skilled categories. Between 2003 and 2008, issuances of L-1 (intracompany transfer) visas grew by 47% to 84,000. The smallest series shown in Figure 3-57 groups together four much smaller high-skilled visa programs: O-1 (a person of outstanding ability), O-2 (an assistant to an O-1, sometimes a postdoc), TN (college-degreed citizens of Canada and Mexico), and E-3 (college-degreed citizen of Australia). Taken together, these four visa types grew by 142% between 2003 and 2008, reaching nearly 22,000 in the number of visas issued.\n\n-PN\\YL  ;LTWVYHY` ^VYR ]PZHZ PZZ\\LK PU JH[LNVYPLZ [OH[ PUJS\\KL THU` OPNOZRPSSLK ^VYRLYZ! -@   \u00b6\n\n;OV\\ZHUKZ \n\n\n1 L_JOHUNL ]PZP[VYZ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n/) HUK LHYSPLY OPNOZRPSS / ]PZHZ\n3 PU[LYJVTWHU` [YHUZMLYZ\n6 6 ;5 ,\n\n  \n\n  \n\n56;,! 1 L_JOHUNL ]PZP[VY ]PZH \\ZLK MVY THU` KPMMLYLU[ ZRPSS SL]LSZ\n:6<9*,! <: +LWHY[TLU[ VM :[H[L 9LWVY[ VM [OL =PZH 6MMPJL ]HYPV\\Z `LHYZ O[[W![YH]LSZ[H[LNV]]PZHMY]PZ[H[PZ[PJZZ[H[PZ[PJZF O[TS\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nH-1B Visas H-1B temporary work visas are likely to account for a\nlarger number of high-skilled workers than other visa classes. The United States typically issues H-1B visas for 3 years with the possibility of a 3-year renewal. In October 2003, the United States lowered its annual ceiling on admissions from 195,000 to 65,000, but granted universities and academic research institutions exemptions in their own hiring. In 2005, the United States granted an additional 20,000 exemptions for students receiving master's degrees or doctorates from U.S. schools.\nAlthough the occupational categories used in H-1B visa records do not precisely correspond to the classifications used elsewhere in this chapter, it is safe to say that the bulk of H-1B visa recipients work in S&E or S&E-related occupations (figure 3-58; table 3-1).\nIn 2006, half of new H-1B visa recipients were employed in computer-related occupations. This represents a recent increase from a low of 25% in 2002. Of those receiving new H-1B visas in 2006 who were in computer-related occupations, 44% had master's degrees and just over 1% had doctorates.\nCharacteristics of Workers Issued New H-1B Visas\nEducation Levels. In FY 2006, 57% of new H-1B visa recipients had advanced degrees, including 41% with master's degrees, 5% with professional degrees, and 11% with doctorates. This degree distribution differs by occupation, with 87% of those holding advanced degrees in math and physical sciences occupations (47% with doctorates) and 89% in life science occupations (61% with doctorates).\nMany H-1B visa recipients earned their degrees abroad. In FY 2006, 41% of doctorate holders, 79% of professional degree holders, and 48% of master's degree holders who received H-1B visas indicated on their applications that they did\n\nFigure 3-58 6JJ\\WH[PVUZ VM UL^ YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: /) [LTWVYHY` ^VYR ]PZHZ! -@ \n\nSocial sciences 2% Other education 2% Mathematics/physical sciences 2% Life sciences 3% Electrical/electronic engineering 3% Other computer-related 4%\nMedicine/health 5%\nOther engineering/architecture 6%\n\nOther 6%\nSystems analysis/ programming 46%\n\nCollege/university education 8%\nManagement/administration/other professionals and technicians 13%\nSOURCE: Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f3-56 \n\nChapter 3.

More than half of recent H-1B visa recipients were from India and an additional 9% from China. Among doctorate holders, one-third were from China and another 13% from India (figures 3-59 and 3-60). Altogether, Asian citizens made up three-quarters of all H-1B visa recipients; among doctorate holders, they were well above half.\nRelatively few doctorate holders from countries with better university systems had U.S. degrees. For example, the United Kingdom (21%), Germany (28%), Canada (29%), France (30%), and Japan (31%). In contrast, 71% of doctorate holders from China and 59% of doctorate holders from India claimed advanced degrees from U.S. institutions on their visa applications.\nH-1B Salaries. Table 3-26 shows salaries paid to new recipients of H-1B temporary work visas by occupation group and level of degree. These starting salary figures, taken from final visa application forms sent to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are different from, and generally higher than, H-1B salaries that firms report on their applications to the Department of Labor, which are filed much earlier in the H-1B process. The relatively low average salaries for doctorate holders in the life sciences may reflect the common use of H-1B visas to hire individuals for relatively low-paid postdoc fellowships.\nVisa Applications and Rejections for Students and Exchange Visitors\nThe F-1 and J-1 visas used by students and exchange visitors have recovered from the declines experienced after\n\nFigure 3-59 *V\\U[Y` VM JP[PaLUZOPW MVY UL^ YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: /) [LTWVYHY` ^VYR ]PZHZ! -@ \n\nOther countries 20%\n\nMexico 1% Germany 1% Pakistan 1% Taiwan 1% United Kingdom 2%\nJapan 2% Philippines 3%\nSouth Korea 3%\nCanada 3%\nChina 9%\n\nIndia 54%\n\nSOURCE: Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nSeptember 11, 2001 (see table 3-27). F-1 visa applications declined from 380,385 in FY 2001 to a low of 282,662 in FY 2004. After 2004, the number of applications increased each year; the number of F-1 applications was 21% higher in FY 2008 than in FY 2001. J-1 visa applications experienced smaller declines after September 11, 2001, and were 35% higher in FY 2008 than in FY 2001.\nStay Rates for U.S. Doctorate Recipients with Temporary Visas\nMany foreign students opt to stay in the United States after earning their degree. As reported in the Survey of Earned Doctorates, between 2004 and 2007, 76% to 82% of nonU.S. citizen S&E doctorates had firm commitments for work or study in the United States at the time of graduation. The rates were slightly lower for temporary visa holders over the same time period (75% to 81%) (see chapter 2 for further discussion).\nLonger-term stay rates are also high. According to a report by Michael Finn (2009) of the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, 62% of 2002 U.S. S&E doctorate recipients with temporary visas were in the United States in 2007. This is down slightly from a 65% 5-year stay rate found in 2005 (figure 3-61), but due to a long upward trend in stay rates, this was still higher than any other 5-year stay rate estimated between 1992 and 2003. As shown in figure 3-61, stay rates differ significantly by country of origin, but have generally been increasing for most major source countries.\nNew doctorate recipients in 2002 faced relatively poor labor market conditions (see discussions earlier in this chapter), and foreign students earning degrees may have also been worried about greater difficulties with securing visas for themselves and their families.\n\nFigure 3-60 *V\\U[Y` VM JP[PaLUZOPW VM KVJ[VYH[L OVSKLYZ ^OV HYL UL^ YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: /) [LTWVYHY` ^VYR ]PZHZ! -@ \n\nOther countries 26%\n\nChina 32%\n\nFrance 2% Turkey 2% Taiwan 2%\nRussia 2% Japan 3% UK 3% Germany 3%\nCanada 5%\n\nIndia 13% South Korea 7%\n\nUK = United Kingdom\nSOURCE: Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-57\n\nTable 3-26 Average annual salary of new recipients of H-1B temporary work visas, by occupation and degree: FY 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nOccupation\n\nAll degree levels Bachelor's Master's Professional Doctorate\n\nAdministrative specializations ...........................................

Stay rates actually showed large percentage point increases for students from the largest European source countries: the UK (+6 percentage points) and Germany (+3 percentage points). The overall decline in stay rate between 2005 and 2007 was driven largely by decreases in stay rates for several Asian source countries: Taiwan (\u00ad8 percentage points), Japan (\u00ad6 percentage points), and India (\u00ad4 percentage points).\nFinn also estimates stay rates for doctorate recipients from graduate programs of different quality based on ratings\n\nTable 3-27 Initial applications for student/exchange visitor visas: FY 2001\u00ad08\n\nStudent (F-1)\n\nExchange visitor (J-1)\n\nRefused\n\nRefused\n\nYear Applications\n\n(%) Applications\n\n(%)\n\n2001... 380,385\n\n22.9\n\n275,959\n\n5.1\n\n2002... 322,644\n\n27.4\n\n270,702\n\n6.2\n\n2003... 288,731\n\n25.3\n\n275,335\n\n7.8\n\n2004... 282,662\n\n22.6\n\n274,789\n\n7.4\n\n2005... 333,161\n\n19.8\n\n311,728\n\n5.8\n\n2006... 385,596\n\n20.1\n\n349,598\n\n5.9\n\n2007... 386,144\n\n24.0\n\n346,946\n\n6.2\n\n2008... 458,406\n\n25.7\n\n371,527\n\n6.6\n\nNOTE: Application counts and refusal rates adjusted for reapplications and appeals by same individual.\n\nSOURCE: Department of State, Immigrant Visa Control and Reporting Division, administrative data (2001\u00ad08).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL  -P]L`LHY Z[H` YH[LZ MVY YLJPWPLU[Z VM <: :\n, KVJ[VYH[LZ ^OV OH]L [LTWVYHY` <: ]PZHZ I` WSHJL VM VYPNPU HUK `LHY VM KVJ[VYH[L!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n 0UKPH\n\n*HUHKH\n\n*OPUH\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n\n1HWHU\n\n;HP^HU\n\n2VYLH\n\n(SS JV\\U[YPLZ\n\n)YHaPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             \n56;,! @LHY VM VIZLY]H[PVU PU WHYLU[OLZLZ :6<9*,! -PUU 4 :[H` YH[LZ VM MVYLPNU KVJ[VYH[L YLJPWPLU[Z MYVT <: \\UP]LYZP[PLZ!   6HR 9PKNL 0UZ[P[\\[L MVY :JPLUJL HUK ,K\\JH[PVU MVY[OJVTPUN\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f3-58 \n\nChapter 3.

Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (forthcoming).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nof faculty by the publication U.S. News and World Report and on separate ratings by the National Research Council. Finn used these ratings to select 20 to 25 \"top-rated\" departments in major S&E fields. Doctorate recipients from the graduate programs that Finn designated as top rated were somewhat less likely to remain in the United States than were graduates of other programs (see table 3-28). For doctorate recipients, the difference in 1-year stay rates was 3 percentage points: 67% of those from the top-rated programs and 70% of other doctorate recipients remained in the United States 1 year after receiving their degrees. By 5 years after receiving their degree, the two groups showed differences that rose to 5 percentage points, with stay rates of 58% and 63%, respectively.\nConclusion\nGrowth of the U.S. S&E workforce continues to exceed that of the overall workforce. However, the 2000\u00ad07 period showed the smallest growth rate (2.2%) in S&E occupations since NSF began tracking these data in the 1950s. Although the U.S. recession that began in 2007 affected workers across all occupations, S&E occupations appear to be less severely affected. The unemployment rate in April 2009 was 9.0% for all workers, but 4.3% for those working in S&E occupations. The influence of the recession on longer-term S&E labor force behavior (e.g. retirement rates, part- and full-time employment) remains to be seen.\nA large and growing number of Americans hold degrees in S&E fields; in 2006, 16.6 million individuals in the U.S. workforce held at least one S&E degree. Individuals in S&E occupations are highly educated, with more than 70% holding at least a bachelor's degree in any field; in contrast, less than 30% of persons working in all other occupations hold a bachelor's or higher degree. Workers in S&E occupations also received higher wages than those in other occupations.\nThe globalization of the S&E labor force continues to increase. The number of people with S&E is skills rising, especially in developing nations, and the location of S&E employment is becoming more internationally diverse. S&E\n\nworkers are becoming more internationally mobile. These trends reinforce each other: as R&D spending and business investment cross national borders in search of available talent, talented people cross borders in search of interesting and lucrative work, and employers recruit and move employees internationally.\nThe growth rate of the S&E labor force would be significantly reduced if the United States became less successful in the increasing international competition for scientists and engineers. Compared with the United States, many other countries are more actively reducing barriers to highly skilled immigrants entering their labor markets. Nonetheless, the United States is still an attractive destination for many foreign scientists and engineers.\nNotes\n1. The standard definition of the term labor force includes the population that is employed or not working but seeking work (unemployed); other individuals are not considered in the labor force. When data refer only to employed persons, the term workforce is used. For data on unemployment rates by occupation, calculations assume that unemployed individuals are seeking further employment in their most recent occupation.\n2. Despite the limitations of this subjective measure, variations among occupations in the proportions of workers who say they need this level of S&E technical expertise accord with common sense. For example, among doctoral level postsecondary teachers of physics, 99.7% said they needed at least a bachelor's level of knowledge in engineering, computer sciences, mathematics or the natural sciences, compared with 5% among doctoral level postsecondary teachers of English. Likewise, among the small numbers of S&E bachelor's degree holders whose occupation is \"secretary/receptionist/typist,\" fewer than one in six reported that their job needed bachelor's level S&E expertise of any kind.\n3. Estimates of the size of the S&E workforce vary across the example surveys because of differences in the scope of the data collection (SESTAT surveys collect data\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 3-59\n\nfrom individuals with bachelor's degrees and above only); because of the survey respondent (SESTAT surveys collect data from individuals, OES collects data from establishments, and ACS collects data from households); or because of the level of detail collected on an occupation, which aids in coding. All of these differences can affect the estimates.\n4. Although BLS labor force projections do a reasonable job of forecasting employment in many occupations (see Alpert and Auyer 2003), the mean absolute percentage error in the 1988 forecast of employment in detailed occupations in 2000 was 23.2%.\n5. Many comparisons using Census Bureau data on occupations are limited to looking at all S&E occupations except postsecondary teachers because the current U.S. occupation taxonomy does not break out these teachers by field. Only NSF surveys of scientists and engineers collect data on postsecondary teachers by field.\n6. Only U.S. citizens and nationals may be appointed in the competitive civil service; however, federal agencies may employ certain noncitizens who meet specific employability requirements in the excepted service or the Senior Executive Service.\n7. Specifically presented here are coefficients from linear regressions using the 2003 SESTAT database of individual characteristics on the natural log of reported full-time annual salary as of October 2003.\n8. Underrepresented ethnic group, as used here, includes individuals who reported their race as black, American Indian/Alaska Native, of Hispanic origin, or other ethnicity.\n9. In the regression equation, this is the form: age1, age2, age3, age4; years since highest degree (YSD)1, YSD2, YSD3, YSD4.\n10. The regressions included 20 dummy variables for SESTAT field-of-degree categories (out of 21 S&E fields; the excluded category was \"other social science\").\n11. Variables added here include 34 SESTAT occupational groups (excluding \"other non-S&E\"), whether individuals worked in R&D, the employer's U.S. census region, and the sector of the economy.\n12. Variables added here include dummy variables for marriage, number of children in the household younger than 18, whether the father had a bachelor's degree, whether either parent had a graduate degree, citizenship, nativity, and age at receipt of first bachelor's degree minus 20. Sex and ethnic minority variables are included in all regression equations.\n13. This may be because differences between groups in many of these family and personal characteristics are not large. It is also possible that variations in these characteristics correlate with those in other controls already in the statistical model and in that sense have already been taken into account.\n14. Many doctorate holders with salaries at this level are postdocs in temporary training positions.\n15. Although the formal job title is often postdoctoral fellowship or research associate, titles vary among organizations. This chapter generally uses the shorter, more\n\ncommonly used, and best understood name, postdoc. A postdoc is traditionally defined as a temporary position that graduate students take primarily for additional training--a period of advanced professional apprenticeship--after completion of a doctorate.\n16. Some part of the citizen and permanent resident postdoc population in the fall of 2005 will not be counted even in the SDR. Excluded are summer 2005 graduates who may be in postdoc positions in the fall of 2005, doctorate holders who may have left the country before April 2006, and those who have foreign doctorates.\n17. Respondents also had to be under age 76 and resident in the United States in April 2006. In a similar retrospective question on the 1995 SDR, 25% of those earning their doctorates before 1964 reported having had postdoc positions.\n18. See section `Business-to-business linkages' in chapter 4 for information on international transactions in R&D services and technology alliances.\n19. An affiliate is a company or business enterprise located in one country but owned or controlled by a parent company in another country. Majority-owned affiliates are those in which the ownership stake of parent companies is more than 50%.\n20. Outside of government, it is illegal to discriminate in employment on the basis of citizenship status. However, if the work requires a security clearance, this usually also requires citizenship.\n21. These figures are likely to somewhat underestimate the proportion of H-1B recipients without U.S. graduate degrees. Because a portion of H-1B visas were restricted to applicants with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions, these applicants had an incentive to answer the optional question about where their degrees were earned; applicants whose degrees came exclusively from foreign institutions had no reason to answer this question.\nGlossary\nCareer path job: A job that helps graduates fulfill their future career plans.\nEU-27: The 27 member states of the European Union since 2007, including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nFederally funded research and development center (FFRDC): An organization that performs research and development and is exclusively or substantially financed by the federal government either to meet a particular research and development objective or, in some instances, to provide major facilities at universities for research and associated training purposes.\nHigh-skilled diaspora: Networks of contact and information flow that form among the internationally mobile portion of a country's nationals.\n\n\f3-60 \n\nChapter 3.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nHighlights\n\nTrends in National R&D Performance\nU.S. R&D expenditures continued to rise in 2008, outpacing the overall expansion of the nation's economy.\n NSF estimates that overall spending on R&D conducted in the United States was $398 billion (current dollars) in 2008, up from $373 billion in 2007. This increase represents growth in 2008 of 6.7% over the 2007 level, or 4.5% in inflation-adjusted 2000 dollars. However, this 2008 figure may not fully reflect the effects of the downturn in U.S. and global economic conditions that intensified in late 2008.\n National R&D spending has increased mostly uninterrupted since 1953. Over the past 20 years, growth in R&D spending has averaged 5.6% in current dollars and 3.1% in constant dollars--somewhat ahead of the average pace of GDP growth over the same period (in both current and constant dollars).\nThe business sector accounts for most U.S. R&D performance and funding.\n The business sector performed an estimated $289 billion of R&D in 2008, or 73% of the U.S. total, drawing on both business and federal sources of R&D support. The business sector itself provided an estimated $268 billion of funding for R&D in 2008, or 67% of the U.S. total; almost all of it supported R&D performed by business. Over the past 5 years, expanded business spending has accounted for much of the nation's R&D growth.\n The academic sector is the second-largest performer of U.S. R&D, an estimated $51 billion in 2008, just under 13% of the U.S. total.\n The federal government is the second-largest funder of U.S. R&D, providing an estimated $104 billion, or 26% of the U.S. total in 2008.\nU.S. R&D is dominated by development expenditures, largely performed by the business sector, and most basic research is conducted at universities and colleges.\n In 2008, basic research was about 17% ($69 billion) of the U.S. total, applied research was about 22% ($89 billion), and development was about 60% ($240 billion).\n Universities and colleges historically have been the main performers of U.S. basic research, an estimated 56% of total U.S. basic research in 2008. The federal government has been the prime source of basic research funding, accounting for 57% of the nation's total in 2008.\n The business sector, which currently accounts for more than half of all U.S. applied research funding, spends more than four times as much on applied research as on basic research.\n\n Development in the United States is chiefly a business sector activity, which performed 90% of the total development in 2008 and provided 84% of the funding. Most of the rest of development funding is provided by the federal government.\nLocation of R&D Performance\nR&D is geographically concentrated, and states vary significantly in the types of research performed within their borders.\n In 2007, the 10 states with the greatest R&D expenditure levels accounted for 64% of all U.S. R&D expenditures. California alone represented 22% of U.S. R&D--triple that of Massachusetts, the next highest state. New Mexico, Massachusetts, and Maryland had the highest R&Dto-GDP ratios in 2006. California ranked seventh in R&D/GDP intensity.\n Massachusetts, Illinois, California, and Texas accounted for about two-thirds of the R&D performed by computer and electronics products companies in 2007; New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are the leaders in chemicals manufacturing, accounting for 41% of the R&D in that industry.\n Nationally, small companies (defined as having from 5 to 499 employees) perform 19% of the nation's total business R&D. The R&D performance of these small companies is concentrated geographically. Among the top 10 business R&D-performing states, New York and California had the highest totals of small companies performing business R&D, with 23% and 20%, respectively.\nBusiness R&D\nBusiness sector R&D rose to its highest level in 2007. Although 2008 projections show additional growth, they do not reflect the effects of the U.S. economic downturn.\n R&D performed by the business sector is estimated to have reached $269 billion in 2007 and is projected to have increased to $289 billion in 2008.\n The company-funded R&D-to-sales ratio of companies in all industries performing R&D in the United States varied between 3.2% and 3.4% during 2003\u00ad06; in 2007 it was 3.5%.\n Over three-fourths of business R&D is performed in six business sectors. The R&D-to-sales ratio for these sectors as a group was 8.0% in 2007, compared with 1.4% for all other business sectors.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-5\n\nFederal R&D\nFederal R&D spending continued to grow in recently proposed and enacted budgets and received further increases through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n Budget appropriations for federal spending on R&D in FY 2009 totaled $147.1 billion (current dollars), an increase of $3.3 billion (or 2.4%) over the enacted FY 2008 spending level. The proposed overall increase for FY 2010 is smaller (0.4%).\n However, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 included a one-time additional increase in R&D funding that is estimated to total $18.3 billion in FY 2009.\n In the FY 2009 budget, increases in R&D funding were greatest for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Along with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, these agencies also received the largest increases from ARRA.\n Defense continues to be the largest function in the federal R&D budget. It accounted for 59% of the federal total (budget authority) in FY 2008.\n The most dramatic change in national R&D priorities over the past 25 years has been the large rise in healthrelated R&D, which grew from 25% of the federal nondefense R&D budget in FY 1980 to 55% in FY 2005. In FY 2008, health accounted for 52% of the nondefense R&D budget.\nFederal R&D Tax Credit\n Along with direct funding of R&D, the government also promotes the conduct of R&D through tax incentives. About 11,000 U.S. companies claimed an estimated $7.3 billion in federal research and experimentation tax credits in 2006, compared with $6.4 billion in 2005.\nInternational R&D Comparisons\nMany countries conduct R&D, but much of global R&D performance continues to be concentrated in a few highincome countries and regions.\n Worldwide R&D expenditures totaled an estimated $1.107 trillion in 2007 (the latest year for which data are available). The United States accounted for about 33% of this total. Japan, the second-largest performer, accounted for about 13%. China was third, at about 9%. Germany and France, respectively, fourth and fifth (and the largest performers in Europe), accounted for 6% and 4%, respectively. The top 10 countries (also including South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), the Russian Federation, Canada, and Italy) account for almost 80% of current global R&D performance.\n\n The 27 nations of the European Union (EU-27) accounted for about 24% of global R&D. R&D by the EU-27 grew at an average annual constant dollar rate of 3.3% between 1997 and 2007. By comparison, the U.S. pace of growth, on the same basis, averaged 3.3%.\n Recent growth in R&D expenditures has been most dramatic in China, averaging just above 19% annually in inflation-adjusted dollars over the past decade.\nWealthy economies generally devote larger shares of their gross domestic product (GDP) to R&D than do less developed economies.\n The U.S. R&D/GDP ratio was 2.7% in 2007 and has fluctuated between 2.6% and 2.8% over the past 10 years, largely reflecting changes in business R&D spending. In 2007, the United States ranked eighth among the economies tracked by the OECD; Japan, South Korea, and several smaller developed economies had higher ratios.\n Among the major European R&D-performing countries, Italy (2006) and the Russian Federation (2007) had R&D/ GDP ratios of 1.1%. The UK ratio was 1.8% in 2007, and those of France and Germany were 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively, in 2007. Canada's R&D/GDP ratio was 1.9% in 2007. Over the past 10 years, these ratios were stable or changed only modestly.\n R&D/GDP ratios increased substantially in Japan, South Korea, and China over the past 10 years. The Japanese and South Korean ratios were among the highest in the world in 2007, at 3.4% and 3.5% respectively. China's ratio remains relatively low, at 1.5%, but has more than doubled from 0.6% in 1996.\nAmong the countries with the largest R&D expenditures, the business sector accounts for the bulk of total R&D performance.\n Among the top 10 countries for R&D expenditures, the business sector is the largest R&D performer, ranging from 77% for South Korea and Japan to 49% for Italy.\n No single industry accounted for more than 18% of total business R&D in the United States in 2007; many other countries displayed much higher industry and sector concentrations.\n The pharmaceuticals industry accounts for more than 25% of business R&D in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and more than 20% in Belgium and Ireland. The computers, office and accounting machines industry represents only a small share of business R&D in most countries; only Japan reports a double-digit concentration of business R&D in this industry. The service sector accounted for 30% or more of all business R&D in many countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United States.\n\n\f4-6 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nR&D by Multinational Companies\nMultinational companies (MNCs) represent a substantial component of U.S. R&D. Overseas R&D by U.S. MNCs reflects gradual changes in their geographic focus.\n Majority-owned affiliates of foreign-based MNCs spent $34.3 billion on U.S. R&D in 2006, up from $31.1 billion in 2005. Their U.S. R&D expenditures have grown faster than total U.S. business R&D and have represented about 14% of U.S. business R&D since 2003, up from the single digits in the early 1990s.\n U.S. MNCs performed $216.3 billion in R&D worldwide in 2006, including $187.8 billion in the United States by parent companies and $28.5 billion by their overseas affiliates. The R&D by MNC parents represented 87% of their global R&D and about 76% of total U.S. business R&D. Both shares have changed little in recent years. However, the geographic distribution of R&D by their overseas affiliates is gradually reflecting the role of emerging markets.\n Europe, Canada, and Japan accounted for a decreasing share of R&D by overseas affiliates of U.S. MNCs, representing 90% in 1994 and 80% in 2006. Over the same period, the share performed in Asia (excluding Japan) rose from 5.4 % to 13.5%, driven by affiliates' R&D spending in China, Singapore, and South Korea.\n R&D performed by U.S.-owned affiliates located in China and India increased from less than $10 million in each country in 1994 to $804 million and $310 million, respectively, in 2006. Although the 2006 levels for China and India represented only about 3% and 1%, respectively, of total overseas R&D by U.S. MNCs, funding levels in some lower cost locations may still be significant from the perspective of purchasing power.\n\nTechnology and Innovation Linkages\nFederal agencies and laboratories continue to engage in collaborative and technology transfer activities. Business increased its R&D funding to contractors within the United States.\n Federal agencies participated in more than 7,000 formal Cooperative Research and Development Agreements in 2007 and more than 9,000 less formally structured collaborative R&D relationships. Federal agencies issued more than 1,400 patents in 2007 and held more than 10,000 active licenses based on their total stock of intellectual property.\n Businesses in the United States reported contracting out an estimated $19.0 billion in R&D to other U.S.-located companies in 2007, compared with $12.4 billion in 2006. This increased the ratio of contracted-out R&D to company-funded and company-performed R&D from 5.5% in 2006 to 7.8% in 2007. For manufacturers, the ratio reached 8.5% in 2007, up from 5.7% in 2006.\nInternational trade in R&D services and technology alliances indicate the role of external sources and cooperative arrangements aimed at acquiring or jointly developing new knowledge.\n In 2007, the United States maintained a trade surplus in research, development, and testing services of $3.3 billion. Trade within MNCs dominates these statistics-- which is not surprising, given their large role in U.S. R&D performance.\n Almost 900 worldwide business technology alliances were established in 2006, approximately two-thirds of which involved at least one U.S.-owned company regardless of location. Since 1999, the proportion of U.S.-foreign alliances has surpassed U.S.-only alliances, a change driven by rapid growth in alliances with European companies. However, in 2006 the number of U.S. alliances with Asian non-Japanese partners (50) reached parity with U.S.-Japan alliances (54), reflecting growth of the former since 1990.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-7\n\nIntroduction\nAs we come to the end of the first decade of the 21st century, global economic trends are leading governments of most nations to implement financial market support measures and economic recovery packages. These policies often include measures to stimulate productivity, growth, and innovation through support of R&D--widely viewed as a long-term contributor to economic growth and national competitiveness.\nThe importance accorded to investment in R&D and innovation in public policy discussions is reflected in the national and international initiatives that help us better understand and measure their results. The America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110-69) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) both address the importance of the U.S. innovation system for national economic growth.\n\nFederal statistical agencies seek to incorporate R&D in the system of national accounts to measure, for example, its relation to gross domestic product (GDP) and productivity growth. These agencies are also exploring the role of cross-border investment in R&D and other intangibles. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is conducting a new Business R&D and Innovation Survey to collect a broad range of indicators that will form a platform for future modules on innovation. (See sidebar \"New U.S. Business R&D and Innovation Survey.\")\nAn ongoing project conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to design an Innovation Strategy examines how changes in the innovation enterprise of OECD member nations may affect their ability to achieve certain government and socioeconomic goals. Concurrently, the OECD, United Nations Statistical Commission, and other international bodies are collaborating to update or develop statistical manuals on intangibles,\n\nNew U.S. Business R&D and Innovation Survey\n\nTo better understand how R&D is conducted in today's innovation- and global-based economy and to investigate ways to improve NSF's portfolio of R&D measurements, NSF commissioned a study by the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) in 2004. The committee published its findings in the 2005 report Measuring Research and Development Expenditures in the U.S. Economy (NRC 2005a). The essence of CNSTAT's concerns and recommendations centered on the finding that a new, more comprehensive survey was needed to \"keep up with the fast-changing environment for the conduct and organization of research in the private business sector\" (NRC 2005a, p 4).\nIn early 2009, NSF and the U.S. Census Bureau launched a new Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). The survey covers manufacturing and service companies and includes questions on a broad range of R&D topics (listed below). The survey also begins to collect innovation data, with the ultimate objective of increasing the number and breadth of innovation-related items in the future.\n Financial measures of R&D activity:\ns Domestic and worldwide sales and revenue\ns Detail on domestic and worldwide R&D activity\ns Company R&D expense by business segment, type of expense, and location (state and country)\ns Capital expenditures for R&D (buildings, software, equipment)\ns Projected R&D expense\n\n Measures of company R&D activity funded by others: s Funds for worldwide and domestic R&D activity s R&D funded by others--by business segment, type of organization, type of expense, state, and location (domestic vs. foreign)\n Measures of R&D employment: s R&D headcount (domestic and worldwide) by occupation and sex\ns Number of U.S. R&D employees working under a visa (H-1B, L-1, and so on)\ns R&D full-time equivalent counts  Measures related to R&D management and strategy:\ns R&D partnerships s Share of R&D for the social sciences, new business\nareas, and specific applications\n Measures of intellectual property (IP), technology transfer, and innovation:\ns Participation in activities to introduce new or significantly improve existing goods, services, methods of production and distribution, or support systems\ns Patent-related data-number owned or applied for s Participation in specific technology transfer activities s Importance of types of IP protection s Licensing to outside parties\nFor more information on the new survey, see NSF/ SRS (2008b).\n\n\f4-8 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nnational economic accounts, and trade in services. The purpose of these efforts is to better harmonize data that will serve as future indicators for measuring innovation.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter is organized into seven main sections. An overview of national trends in the performance and funding of R&D is followed by a discussion of state-level R&D patterns and trends. A third section covers business, the largest performer and funder of U.S. R&D. This section is followed by a discussion of the patterns of federal government R&D, including how those patterns play out in the defense, energy, and health arenas, and concludes with federal tax incentives for business R&D.\nThe last three sections of the chapter cover international comparisons of R&D, investments by multinational companies (MNCs), and technology and innovation linkages, respectively. International comparisons of R&D include national R&D expenditures by performer and source, national R&D intensities, and government R&D priorities. The section devoted to MNCs covers overseas investments of U.S. MNCs and U.S. R&D by foreign-owned companies. Although global R&D is concentrated in a few developed countries or regions, China and other emerging Asian countries\n\nhave increased their R&D expenditures and have become hosts to R&D conducted by U.S. MNCs. The last section covers business-to-business external sourcing, technology alliances, and international transactions in R&D services. The latter represents the convergence of service-oriented R&D and global innovation networking. This section concludes with a discussion of innovation-related federal programs and activities aimed at technology transfer, R&D, and new technology development and deployment by small firms.\nTrends in National R&D Performance\nR&D, along with other social, economic, and technological factors, creates new knowledge and contributes to innovation and the introduction of new goods, services, processes, and managerial practices. Suppliers and users of R&D include businesses, educational institutions, not-forprofit research organizations, and governments. Statistics on R&D expenditures reported by performing and funding organizations are used as metrics throughout the United States and internationally.1 (See sidebar \"Definitions of R&D.\")\nNSF estimates indicate that overall spending on R&D conducted in the United States was $397.6 billion (current dollars) in 2008, up from $372.5 billion in 2007 (table 4-1). This represents growth of 6.7%, or 4.5% in inflation-adjusted\n\nDefinitions of R&D\n\nR&D. According to international guidelines for conducting R&D surveys, R&D, also called research and experimental development, comprises creative work \"undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge--including knowledge of man, culture, and society--and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications\" (OECD 2002).\nBasic research. The objective of basic research is to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without specific applications in mind. Although basic research may not have specific applications as its goal, it can be directed to fields of current or potential interest. This focus is often the case when performed by industry or mission-driven federal agencies.\nApplied research. The objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need. In industry, applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services.\nDevelopment. Development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes.\n\nR&D plant. This term refers to the acquisition of, construction of, major repairs to, or alterations in structures, works, equipment, facilities, or land for use in R&D activities.\nBudget authority. Budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, contract authority, and borrowing authority.\nObligations. Federal obligations represent the dollar amounts for orders placed, contracts and grants awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, regardless of when funds were appropriated or payment was required.\nOutlays. Federal outlays represent the dollar amounts for checks issued and cash payments made during a given period, regardless of when funds were appropriated or obligated.\nFor an annotated compilation of definitions of R&D by U.S. statistical agencies, tax statutes, accounting bodies, and other official sources, see NSF/SRS (2006).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-9\n\n(also called constant or real) 2000 dollars.2 The 2008 figures are preliminary, however, and may not yet fully reflect the effects of the sharp downturn in the U.S. economy and globally beginning in late 2008.\nTotal estimated R&D expenditures in 2008 were $13.9 billion higher in real dollars than in 2007 (table 4-1). Most of this increase reflected estimated increases in business R&D expenditures and funding.\n\nOver the longer term, increases in national R&D spending have been largely uninterrupted since 1953 in both current and real dollars (figure 4-1). The rates of the past several years have been above the average annual growth rate over the past 20 years (5.6% in current dollars, 3.1% in constant dollars). U.S. R&D spending crossed the $100 billion (current dollars) threshold in 1984, passed $200 billion in 1997, was nearly $300 billion in 2004, and almost reached\n\nTable 4-1 U.S. R&D expenditures, by performing sector and funding source: 2003\u00ad08\n\nSector\nAll performing sectors ....................................

Data based on annual reports by performers except for nonprofit sector. Expenditure levels for academic and federal government performers are calendar-year approximations based on fiscal year data. For federal government expenditures, approximation equal to 75% of amount reported in same fiscal year plus 25% of amount reported in subsequent fiscal year.

Over the past 20 years, the expansion of U.S. R&D spending has exceeded the pace of GDP growth, which averaged 5.3% in current dollars and 2.8% in constant dollars, with the difference becoming more substantial in the past few years.\nThe economic stimulus package enacted in early 2009 (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 [Public Law 111-5]) provided a substantial increase in federal FY 2009 funding for R&D and R&D infrastructure ($18.3 billion). However, these one-time funds do not enter into the federal funding base for subsequent fiscal year budgets, as discussed in the federal R&D section of this chapter.\nEstimates of U.S. R&D expenditures are generated by adding the annual R&D spending of all sectors of the economy for which expenditures can be reasonably estimated. The spending figures come from surveys of organizations that historically have performed the vast majority of R&D in the United States; however, some components of national R&D performance are not reflected in current NSF data, and measurement challenges remain. For a further discussion of R&D activities not currently captured in NSF's official R&D statistics, see the sidebar \"Unmeasured R&D.\"\nPerformers of R&D\nNSF tracks the R&D spending patterns of several performers in the overall U.S. R&D system: businesses, the intramural R&D activities of federal agencies, federally funded R&D centers (FFRDCs),3 universities and colleges, and other nonprofit organizations.\nBusiness Sector Estimated spending for R&D performed in the United\nStates by businesses totaled $289.1 billion (current dollars)\n\nUnmeasured R&D\nThe estimates of U.S. R&D presented in this volume are derived from surveys of organizations that have historically performed the vast majority of R&D in the United States. To evaluate U.S. R&D performance over time and in comparison with other countries, however, it is necessary to gauge how much R&D goes unmeasured. The following paragraphs describe types of unmeasured R&D performance in the United States.\nTo reduce cost and respondent burden, U.S. industrial R&D estimates are derived from a survey of R&D-performing companies with five or more employees. Accordingly, no estimates of R&D performance are available for companies with fewer than five employees.\nThe activity of individuals performing R&D on their own time and not under the auspices of a corporation, university, or other organization is similarly omitted from official U.S. R&D statistics.\nSocial science R&D has been excluded from U.S. industrial R&D statistics. Also, R&D in the humanities is excluded from U.S. academic R&D statistics. Other countries include both in their national statistics, making their national R&D expenditures relatively larger when compared with those of the United States. (The new U.S. Business R&D and Innovation Survey, being fielded for the first time in 2009, includes social science R&D and will better capture total federally funded R&D performed by others. Furthermore, NSF is in the process of redesigning its Higher Education R&D Survey, which will include non-S&E R&D expenditures in its reported totals.)\nNSF has not conducted a survey on R&D performance by nonprofit organizations since 1998, although the R&D performance of nonprofits is estimated for national R&D totals. NSF and the U.S. Census Bureau collected statistics for R&D performance by state governments in the United States for 2006 and 2007, but these data have not yet been included in the national time series. Data for these performers are discussed in \"Location of R&D Performance.\"\nin 2008 (table 4-1). NSF estimates that business R&D expenditures in 2008 expanded in real terms (constant dollars) by 5.1%, outpacing the real growth of total U.S. R&D in the same year (4.5%). Similarly high rates of growth prevailed for business R&D in 2005, 2006, and 2007, and again, the growth in business R&D outpaced that of total U.S. R&D.\nThe business sector is by far the largest performer of U.S. R&D, accounting for 73% of the total in 2008 (figure 4-2). The high-water mark of the business sector's share of U.S. R&D to date was 75% in 2000.

With the renewal of vigorous business activity thereafter, business spending on R&D moved to a higher-growth path. The business sector's share of R&D rose above 70% in 2005 and has since continued to increase.\nOver the past 5 years, expanded business spending on R&D has accounted for much of the growth (in both current and real-dollar terms) in all U.S. R&D spending. The most striking trend when contrasting business-sector R&D with that of other performers over the past several decades is the sustained, far larger real-dollar expansion in the level of R&D spending by the business sector (figure 4-3).\n\n\n\n                      \n56;,:! +H[H MVY  HYL WYLSPTPUHY` -LKLYHS WLYMVYTLYZ VM 9\n+ PUJS\\KLZ MLKLYHS HNLUJPLZ HUK MLKLYHSS` M\\UKLK YLZLHYJO HUK KL]LSVWTLU[ JLU[LYZ :[H[L HUK SVJHS NV]LYUTLU[ Z\\WWVY[ [V PUK\\Z[Y` PZ PUJS\\KLK PU PUK\\Z[Y` Z\\WWVY[ MVY PUK\\Z[Y` WLYMVYTHUJL :[H[L HUK SVJHS NV]LYUTLU[ Z\\WWVY[ [V \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNLZ PZ PUJS\\KLK PU \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNLZ Z\\WWVY[ VM \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNL WLYMVYTHUJL :6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ 5H[PVUHS 7H[[LYUZ VM 9\n+ 9LZV\\YJLZ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \nAs discussed in the section \"R&D by Character of Work,\" three-quarters of the business sector's R&D performance in recent years has been directed toward development activities rather than basic and applied research. Other U.S. R&D performers are relatively more active with respect to basic and applied research.\nThe business sector is the chief source of funding for its own R&D spending. In 2008, it is estimated that $263.3 billion, or 91%, of the business sector's overall R&D expenditures ($289.1 billion) came from the business sector itself (table 4-2), with the balance ($25.8 billion) coming from the federal government.

For details on this discrepancy, see the sidebar \"Tracking R&D: The Gap Between Performer- and SourceReported Expenditures\" later in this chapter.\nUniversities and Colleges Universities and colleges performed an estimated\n$51.2 billion of R&D in 2008. The academic sector is the second-largest performer of U.S. R&D. It currently represents just below 13% of total U.S. R&D performance, about a fifth of the size of business R&D. In the late 1990s and first years of the current decade, academic R&D grew faster than R&D in any other U.S. sector, with real annual growth rates in the range of 6% to 8%. After 2004, however, real growth has been much slower, falling to 2.1% in 2008, well below the real growth rates for business R&D and total U.S. R&D.\nUniversities and colleges are estimated to have performed more than half (56%) of the nation's basic research in 2008. (See \"R&D by Character of Work.\") They also rely much more than the business sector on external R&D funding. In 2008, about 27% of academic R&D was funded by the institutions themselves; 59% was funded by the federal government; and the balance was funded by state and local governments, nonprofits and other types of organizations, and private gifts (table 4-2).\nFederal Agencies and FFRDCs R&D performance by the federal government (which\nspans the activities of agency intramural research laboratories, agency planning and administration of both intramural and extramural R&D projects, and the FFRDCs) totaled an estimated $41.7 billion in 2008, about 11% of all U.S. R&D performance. Federal agencies' intramural R&D activities (including the aforementioned planning and administration costs) accounted for $27.0 billion (6.8%) of the U.S. total, and FFRDCs accounted for $14.7 billion (3.7%). Federal agencies' intramural R&D performance is entirely funded by the federal government; FFRDCs also rely chiefly on federal funding, with small amounts of nonfederal funds at some facilities.\nReal expenditures for R&D conducted by federal agencies and FFRDCs combined grew rapidly from 2001 to 2003, reflecting increased defense spending following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. From 2004 to 2007, federal government R&D performance was essentially flat. It is estimated to have returned to modest growth in 2008, with increases in both federal intramural and FFRDC R&D performance.\nThe volume of the federal government's R&D performance is small compared with that of the U.S. business sector. However, the federal sum of $41.7 billion exceeds the national R&D expenditures of every country except Japan, China, and Germany. Furthermore, this federal expenditure\n\ndoes not include sizable government investments in R&D infrastructure and equipment. In addition, the federal government maintains research facilities and conducts research projects that would be too costly or risky for a single company or university to undertake.\nOther Nonprofit Organizations The figure for R&D performed in the United States by\nother nonprofit organizations in 2008 was an estimated $15.6 billion. This amount represents about 4% of all U.S. R&D in that year, a share that has been fairly stable since 2000.\nSources of R&D Funding\nThe funding for R&D conducted by organizations in the United States comes from a variety of sources, including their own funds, as well as contracts and grants from other organizations. The funding mix varies across the main performing sectors. Data on the flows of R&D funding within sectors, such as between two companies, are limited, but data on the flows of R&D between sectors indicate that financial relationships between organizations play a significant role in the U.S. R&D system.\nIn 2008, an estimated 19% of U.S. R&D ($74 billion, current dollars) came from funding by an organization in a sector other than the performing sector (table 4-2). Most of this between-sector funding comes from the federal government, which supports significantly more R&D than it conducts in its own laboratories and FFRDCs. In sharp contrast, most businesses use a high percentage of their R&D budgets for internal projects or to contract for R&D performed by other businesses. The small remainder--about 2% of overall business funds for R&D--flows to universities and other nonprofit organizations to support R&D performance.\nR&D Funding by the Federal Government In 2008, according to the reports of R&D performers,\nthe federal government funded an estimated $103.7 billion (current dollars) of R&D (table 4-1). This amount represented about 26% of all R&D funding in the United States (figure 4-2).\nThe federal government was once the predominant sponsor of the nation's R&D, funding some 67% of all U.S. R&D in 1964 (figure 4-4). But the federal share decreased in subsequent years, falling to below 50% in 1979 and to a low of 25% in 2000. This declining share of federal R&D funding is particularly evident in the business sector. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than half of the nation's business R&D was funded by the federal government, but by 2000, less than 10% of business R&D was federally funded (appendix table 4-3).\nBetween 2001 and 2004, however, this decades-long trend was attenuated as private investment slowed in the face of the 2001\u00ad02 recession. In addition, federal R&D spending expanded, first in health and then in defense and counterterrorism. By 2004, the federal share of the nation's\n\n\f4-14 \n\nChapter 4.

Business provided an estimated $267.8 billion for R&D in 2008, 67% of the U.S. total.\nThe business sector's share of national R&D funding first surpassed the federal government's share in 1980 (figure 4-4). Almost all business funding for R&D is directed toward business R&D, with a small remainder (around 2%) allocated to academic and other nonprofit performers.\nFrom 1980 to 1985, business support for R&D grew, in real dollars, at an average annual rate of almost 8%. From 1985 to 1994, real growth dropped to 3% per year, before expanding to 9% through 2000. Growth declined by 3% a year during the 2000\u00ad02 recession, was flat in 2003\u00ad04, and has increased robustly (5% or more real growth annually) since 2005. NSF's preliminary estimate for real growth in business-sector R&D funding in 2008 is about 6%.\nR&D Funding From Other Sources R&D funding from other nonfederal sources--aca-\ndemia's own institutional funds, other nonprofits, and state and local governments--is small in comparison to federal and business sources, and is estimated to have been below 7% of the total in 2008. Nonetheless, this funding has been growing fairly rapidly for some time. From 1998 to 2008, growth in funding from these sectors averaged 5.4% per year in real-dollar terms--ahead of the pace of funding growth in both the federal and business sectors. Most R&D\n\nfunded by these nonfederal sources is performed by the academic sector.\nFinally, unlike many countries, the United States does not currently have data on domestic R&D that is funded by foreign sources. However, NSF has begun to collect these data as part of a new business survey. Separately, foreign direct investment in R&D, which is measured in the United States, provides an indication of international participation in business R&D. However, foreign ownership does not necessarily imply foreign R&D funding, because an affiliate may fund activities through its own revenues and other domestic sources. (See \"R&D by Multinational Companies.\")\nR&D by Character of Work\nR&D encompasses a wide range of activities, from fundamental research in the physical, life, and social sciences; to research addressing such critical issues as global climate change, energy efficiency, and health care; to the development of general-purpose technologies and new goods and services. Because the activities are so diverse, it helps to classify them into distinct categories when analyzing R&D expenditures.\nHistorically, the most common categories used to classify R&D are basic research, applied research, and (experimental) development. (See sidebar \"Definitions of R&D.\") In light of the complex feedback loops involved in knowledge creation and exploitation, these categories have been criticized as simplistic and too linear in their implied progression. No alternative measurement frameworks, however, have been widely adopted. Accordingly, this chapter relies on these longstanding, widely used, and internationally comparable categories (OECD 2002) to describe the current trends in the character of U.S. R&D expenditures.4\nIn 2008, the United States performed an estimated $69.1 billion of basic research, $88.6 billion of applied research, and $239.9 billion of development (table 4-2). Basic research represented a little more than 17% of the total; applied research, 22%; and development, just over 60% (figure 4-5).\nHistorically, the federal government has been the prime source of funding for basic research, accounting for an estimated 57% of the nation's total in 2008 (figure 4-5). The share of federal funding to universities and colleges, the nation's largest performers of basic research, was 61%.\nIndustry directs only small portions of its R&D funding to basic research--an estimated 5% in 2008 (figure 4-6). Many businesses believe that basic research involves significant uncertainties regarding both the near-term commercial value of any discoveries and the firm's ability to enforce intellectual property rights and earn a return. Some firms, however, view engaging in basic research (whether performed internally or in cooperation with other performers) as a way to boost human capital resources by attracting and retaining talented scientists and engineers. This can strengthen the firm's capacity for innovation and improve its ability to absorb external scientific and technological knowledge.

In 2008, industry invested an estimated $53.8 billion in applied research funding, 61% of the U.S. total. Industries that perform a relatively large amount of applied research include chemicals, aerospace (mostly funded by the Department of Defense [DOD]), and R&D services (where many companies engage in the licensing of technologies).\nThe bulk of the federal government's applied research funds support work that is performed by the federal agencies themselves or by FFRDCs.\n\n-PN\\YL  9\n+ WLYMVYTPUN ZLJ[VYZ HUK M\\UKPUN ZV\\YJLZ I` JOHYHJ[LY VM ^VYR! \n\n)HZPJ YLZLHYJO\n\n(WWSPLK YLZLHYJO\n\n+L]LSVWTLU[\n\n7LYMVYTPUN ZLJ[VY\n\n)\\ZPULZZ\n\n-LKLYHS PU[YHT\\YHS\n\n--9+*Z <UP]LYZP[PLZ\nHUK JVSSLNLZ\n\n)\\ZPULZZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n-\\UKPUN ZV\\YJL\n\n-LKLYHS NV]LYUTLU[\n\n<UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK\nJVSSLNLZ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n--9+*Z $ MLKLYHSS` M\\UKLK YLZLHYJO HUK KL]LSVWTLU[ JLU[LYZ\n56;,:! +H[H MVY  HYL WYLSPTPUHY` :[H[L HUK SVJHS NV]LYUTLU[ Z\\WWVY[ [V PUK\\Z[Y` PUJS\\KLK PU PUK\\Z[Y` Z\\WWVY[ MVY PUK\\Z[Y` WLYMVYTHUJL :[H[L HUK SVJHS NV]LYUTLU[ Z\\WWVY[ [V \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNLZ PUJS\\KLK PU \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNLZ Z\\WWVY[ MVY \\UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK JVSSLNLZ WLYMVYTHUJL\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ 5H[PVUHS 7H[[LYUZ VM 9\n+ 9LZV\\YJLZ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  [V \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f4-16 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nDevelopment expenditures totaled an estimated $239.9 billion in 2008, representing 60% of all U.S. R&D expenditures.5 The development of new and improved goods, services, and processes is dominated by the business sector, which funded 84% (an estimated $201.8 billion) of all U.S. development in 2008. The federal government funded most of the remaining development, totaling 15%, or $35.7 billion. Most federal development spending is defense related; this spending includes military aircraft, for which the federal government is the main customer.\nThe business sector performs a higher share of development activities than it funds, having conducted about 90% of all U.S. development in 2008. Federal agencies and FFRDCs conducted 8%, and all other performers combined conducted just below 2%.\nR&D expenditures by public and private organizations indicate the priority given to the creation of new science and technology (S&T)-based knowledge in support of their goals. As an input measure, however, R&D expenditures do not directly lead to subsequent economic and social outputs. For one approach to measuring the role of R&D in economic output and growth, see the sidebar \"The BEA/NSF R&D Satellite Account: R&D and Economic Growth.\"\nLocation of R&D Performance\nMore than half of all U.S. R&D is performed in only a few states.6 Nonetheless, patterns of expenditures for R&D activities vary among the top R&D-performing states. (For\n\na broader range of indicators on state-level S&E activities, see chapter 8.)\nDistribution of R&D Expenditures Among States\nIn 2007, the 10 states with the greatest R&D expenditure levels accounted for about 64% of U.S. R&D expenditures that can be allocated to the states. The top 20 states accounted for nearly 85% of the R&D total; the 20 lowest-ranking states, around 5%. California alone represented 22% of U.S. R&D, exceeding the next-highest state, Massachusetts, by more than three times. Appendix table 4-15 provides 2007 statistics on R&D performers and funders for all the states.\nTo some degree, state variations in the level of R&D expenditures reflect differences in economic scale. Reporting a state's R&D expenditures as a fraction of its GDP adjusts for these differences and is an indicator of R&D intensity at the state level.\nStates with the highest R&D/GDP ratios in 2007 included New Mexico, Massachusetts, and Maryland (table 4-3). New Mexico is the location of several major government research facilities. Massachusetts benefits from both leading research universities and thriving high-technology industries. Maryland is the site of many government research facilities and growing research universities. California ranks seventh in R&D intensity. See appendix table 4-16 for a complete list of states and their corresponding R&D intensities.\n\nThe BEA/NSF R&D Satellite Account: R&D and Economic Growth\n\nMeasuring R&D as capital investment rather than an expense (that is, capitalizing R&D) recognizes that R&D has long-term benefits, much as do investments in physical assets. Capitalized R&D has a direct impact on GDP because business R&D becomes part of economic output instead of an expense. International activities are underway to update systems of national accounts to recognize the investment nature of R&D (UNSC 2007). A first step in the statistical systems of the United States and other OECD countries is to develop R&D satellite accounts, that is, supplementary estimates of the GDP and related measures that provide greater detail or alternative measurement concepts without changing the core accounts. Future research topics include improving the price indexes used to produce inflation-adjusted R&D investment figures and measures of the depreciation of R&D as a capital asset.\nSeveral U.S. interagency efforts are aimed at identifying improved measures of intangibles, such as R&D, and their economic role (Aizcorbe, Moylan, and Robbins 2009; Jorgenson, Landefeld, and Nordhaus 2006). NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics, responsible for\n\nU.S. R&D statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), responsible for the U.S. national economic accounts, are jointly developing an R&D Satellite Account (Robbins and Moylan 2007). Current plans call for incorporation of R&D capital into the National Income and Product Accounts and other core accounts in 2013.\nAccording to BEA preliminary estimates, capitalizing R&D increased the level of current-dollar GDP by an average of 2.9% per year between 1959 and 2006. Adjusted for inflation, R&D capital would account for about 5.1% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2006. This figure compares with a 2.2% share for all business investment in commercial and all other types of buildings. During the more recent 1995\u00ad2006 period, R&D investment accounted for about 7% of real GDP growth, with the business sector's R&D contribution amounting to 4.6% percent.\nFrom 1995\u00ad2006, the largest estimated contributions to real GDP growth came from the pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing industry, which accounted for more than 1% of GDP growth. The software publishing industry accounted for an additional 0.5%.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-17\n\nTable 4-3 Top 10 states in R&D performance, by sector and intensity: 2007\n\nAll R&Da\n\nSector ranking\n\nR&D intensity (R&D/GDP ratio)\n\nRank State\n\nAmount (current $millions)\n\nBusiness\n\nUniversities and colleges\n\nFederal intramural and FFRDCb\n\nState\n\nR&D/ GDP GDP (current (%) $billions)\n\n1 California 2 Massachusetts 3 New Jersey 4 Texas 5 Michigan 6 New York 7 Washington 8 Illinois 9 Maryland 10 Pennsylvania\n\n77,608 24,557 19,552 17,853 17,402 15,939 15,061 14,287 14,130 13,510\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia\n\nMaryland\n\nNew Mexico\n\n7.53\n\nMassachusetts New York\n\nCalifornia\n\nMassachusetts\n\n6.97\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTexas\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMaryland\n\n5.34\n\nMichigan\n\nMaryland\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\n4.85\n\nTexas\n\nPennsylvania District of Columbia Connecticut\n\n4.82\n\nWashington\n\nMassachusetts Massachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\n4.58\n\nIllinois\n\nNorth Carolina Tennessee\n\nCalifornia\n\n4.31\n\nNew York\n\nIllinois\n\nWashington\n\nNew Jersey\n\n4.24\n\nPennsylvania Ohio\n\nIllinois\n\nDistrict of Columbia 4.17\n\nConnecticut\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n3.71\n\n75.2 352.2 264.4 310.3 212.3 379.9 1,801.8 461.3\n92.5 57.8\n\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center; GDP = gross domestic product\n\naIncludes in-state total R&D performance of business, universities, federal agencies, FFRDCs, and federally financed nonprofit R&D. bIncludes costs associated with administration of intramural and extramural programs by federal personnel and actual intramural R&D performance.\n\nNOTE: Small differences in parameters for state rankings may not be significant.

See also appendix tables 4-15 and 4-16.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nSector Distribution of R&D Performance by State\nThe proportion of R&D performed in each of the major R&D-performing sectors (business, universities and colleges, federal intramural facilities and FFRDCs) varies across states. States that lead in total R&D tend to be well represented in each of these sectors (table 4-3).\nIn 2007, business-sector R&D accounted for about 74% of the U.S. R&D total that could be allocated to specific states. Of the top 10 states in total R&D performance, 9 are also in the top 10 in industry R&D. Connecticut, 10th in business-sector R&D and home to substantial pharmaceutical R&D activity, surpasses Maryland in the business R&D ranking.\nUniversity-performed R&D accounts for 14% of the U.S. total, and it also closely follows state total R&D performance. Among the top 10 states in total R&D, only Michigan, New Jersey, and Washington are not also among the university R&D top 10, being replaced by North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida.\nRepresenting about 11% of the state-distributed U.S. total, federal R&D performance (both intramural and FFRDC) is more concentrated geographically than performance in other sectors--and the relationship between its geographical distribution and that of total R&D is less significant. The top four states (Maryland, California, New Mexico, and Virginia) and the District of Columbia represent 64% of all federal R&D performance.7 This figure rises to 78% when the other\n\nfive top 10 states (Massachusetts, Tennessee, Washington, Illinois, and Florida) are included.\nFederal R&D accounts for 82% of all R&D in New Mexico, home of the nation's two largest FFRDCs (Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories). The high figures for Maryland (54%), Virginia (38%), and the District of Columbia (74%) reflect the concentration of federal facilities and administrative offices in the national capital area. The share for Tennessee (32%) reflects the presence of a large federal facility, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nIn California, Massachusetts, Washington, and Illinois, federal R&D performance accounts for no more than 6% to 7% of the state R&D totals, even though each state is among the top 10 in federal performance. The federal R&D share in Florida was 13% in 2007.\nBusiness R&D in Top States\nDuring 2007, companies in the 10 states with the highest business R&D performance reported aggregate R&D expenditures of $186.0 billion and accounted for 69% of the business R&D performed in the United States. Companies in California alone accounted for 24% of the nation's business R&D. The types of companies that carry out R&D vary considerably among these 10 leading states (table 4-4), reflecting regional specialization or clusters of business activity. For example, the automotive manufacturing industry accounted for 75% of Michigan's business R&D in 2007, although it accounted for only 6% of the nation's total business R&D.\n\n\f4-18 \n\nChapter 4.

These states have clearly defined regional centers of high-technology research and manufacturing, including Cambridge and Route 128 in Massachusetts; Champaign County, Illinois; Silicon Valley, California; and the Silicon Hills of Austin. About two-thirds of R&D performed in the United States by computer and electronic product companies in 2007 was located in these four states and accounted for 14% of all business R&D nationwide (table 4-4; appendix table 4-11).\nR&D performed by chemical manufacturing companies remains prominent in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, all home to the pharmaceuticals and the chemicals industries. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC 2009), together these states are host to more than 2,000 chemical manufacturing establishments, an increase of about 500 since 2005, and rank among the top 18 in chemicals industry employment. In 2007, chemical manufacturers accounted for 63% of New Jersey's business R&D, 59% of Connecticut's, and 55% of Pennsylvania's (table 4-4). These three states represented more than 41% of the nation's R&D in this sector.\nThe R&D and related-services sector, which consists largely of biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, and early-stage technology firms, is also geographically concentrated, with California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey accounting for more than 42% of R&D. The companies in this sector maintain strong ties to the academic sector and are often located near large research universities (Stuart and Sorenson 2003).\n\nNationally, small companies (those that have from 5 to 499 employees8) performed 19% of total U.S. business R&D in 2007 (appendix table 4-11). Among the top 10 business R&D-performing states, New York and California had the highest totals of small companies performing business R&D, with 23% and 20%, respectively, in each state. Small companies in these two states performed 6% of the nation's total business R&D in 2007 (table 4-4).\nBusiness R&D\nBusinesses perform R&D with a variety of objectives in mind, but most business R&D is aimed at developing new and improved goods, services, and processes. R&D expenditures, therefore, indicate the level of effort dedicated to producing future products and process improvements while maintaining current market share and increasing operating efficiency. By extension, such expenditures may reflect firms' perceptions of the market's demand for new and improved technology.\nR&D performed by the business sector totaled $269.3 billion in 2007. The federal government funded 9.9% ($26.6 billion) of this total, and company funds and other private sources financed the remainder (appendix tables 4-11 to 4-13).9\nIn addition to absolute levels of R&D expenditures, another indicator in the business sector is R&D intensity--that is, R&D relative to production in a company, industry, or sector. The measure used most frequently is the ratio of company-funded R&D to net sales.10 This statistic provides a way to gauge the relative importance of R&D across industries and among firms in the same industry. The companyfunded R&D-to-sales ratio of companies in all industries\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-19\n\nperforming R&D in the United States varied between 3.2% and 3.4% during 2003-06; in 2007 it was 3.5% (table 4-5; appendix table 4-14).\nLargest R&D Industries\nBenefits from advances in S&T may be broadly shared among industries; however, different industries perform different amounts of R&D.11 Some industries, such as utility,12 finance, insurance, and real estate, have relatively low R&D\n\nintensities (0.5% or less). Appendix table 4-14 provides data on ratios of company-funded R&D to net sales for an array of industries.13 Six industry groups--four in manufacturing (chemicals, computer and electronic products, aerospace and defense manufacturing, and automotive manufacturing) and two in services (software and computer-related, and R&D services)--accounted for 78% of company-funded business R&D and 95% of federally funded business R&D in 2007 (table 4-5).14\n\nTable 4-5 Business R&D and domestic net sales, by industry: 2006 and 2007\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nBusinessperformed R&D\n\nFederally funded R&D\n\nCompany-funded R&D\n\nIndustry\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nAll ..........................................................

In 2007, pharmaceutical companies performed $47.6 billion of company-funded R&D, representing 86% of nonfederal R&D funding in the chemicals sector (appendix table 4-12).\nA related indicator is reported by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an industry association that represents the country's leading researchbased pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. This association conducts an annual survey of its members to gather information about R&D. In 2007, PhRMA estimated that its members invested $35.4 billion in R&D performed in the United States and $9.1 billion in R&D performed abroad. The total $44.5 billion investment represented 18.7% of domestic sales and 16.4% of global sales (PhRMA 2008a).15 According to PhRMA, U.S. biopharmaceutical research companies obtained approval for 26 new medicines in 2007 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. About 75% of PhRMA members' domestic R&D investment supports R&D on projects that originate in their own laboratories, and 25% supports R&D on products licensed from other organizations, notably biotechnology companies, universities, or the government (PhRMA 2008b).16\nComputer and Electronic Products Companies in the computer and electronic product manu-\nfacturing industry include producers of computers, computer peripherals, communications equipment, and similar electronic products and producers of components for such products.17 The design and use of integrated circuits and the application of highly specialized miniaturization technologies are common elements in the production processes of the computer and electronic product sector.\nIn 2007, companies in this industry performed $50.4 billion of R&D, or 19% of all business R&D (table 4-5).18 Company and other nonfederal sources funded almost all of this R&D. Two of the more R&D-intensive industries, communications equipment and semiconductor manufacturing, are included in this group. Both devoted more than 10% of sales to R&D in 2007 (appendix table 4-14).\nSoftware and Computer-Related Services Software and computer-related services industries, such\nas data processing and computer systems design, performed approximately $33.2 billion of company-funded R&D in 2007. The R&D of these industries (14% of the U.S. business sector total), combined with that of the computer and electronic product manufacturers, accounted for 34% of all industrial R&D in 2007. As computing and information technology has become more integrated with every sector of\n\nthe economy, the demand for services associated with these technologies has increased.\nBetween 1987 and 2007, R&D expenditures of companies providing these services grew. In 1987, when an NSF survey estimate of software and other computer-related services R&D first became available, companies classified in the industry group--computer programming, data processing, other computer-related, engineering, architectural, and surveying services--performed $2.4 billion of companyfunded R&D, or 3.8% of all company-funded industrial R&D. In 2007, the company-funded R&D of these industries (excluding engineering and architectural services) accounted for 13.7% of all company-funded industrial R&D, and these companies accounted for 4.3% of domestic sales of R&D-performing companies (table 4-6).19\n\nTable 4-6 Estimated share of computer-related services in company-funded R&D and domestic net sales of R&D-performing companies: 1987\u00ad2007\n(Percent)\n\nCompany-funded Domestic\n\nYear\n\nR&D\n\nnet sales\n\n1987................................\n\n3.8\n\n1.4\n\n1988................................\n\n3.6\n\n1.5\n\n1989................................\n\n3.4\n\n1.4\n\n1990................................\n\n3.7\n\n1.5\n\n1991................................\n\n3.6\n\n1.6\n\n1992................................\n\n4.0\n\n1.6\n\n1993................................\n\n8.2\n\n1.5\n\n1994................................\n\n6.6\n\n2.2\n\n1995................................\n\n8.8\n\n3.3\n\n1996................................\n\n8.8\n\n2.6\n\n1997................................\n\n9.1\n\n2.5\n\n1998................................\n\n9.5\n\n2.2\n\n1999................................\n\n10.6\n\n2.2\n\n2000................................\n\n10.9\n\n2.8\n\n2001................................\n\n13.0\n\n3.5\n\n2002................................\n\n14.6\n\n5.4\n\n2003................................\n\n14.3\n\n3.5\n\n2004................................\n\n14.7\n\n3.0\n\n2005................................\n\n14.7\n\n3.5\n\n2006................................\n\n14.7\n\n5.7\n\n2007................................\n\n13.7\n\n4.3\n\nNOTES: Before 1998 companies classified in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industries 737 (computer and data processing services) and 871 (engineering, architectural, and surveying services). After 1998 companies classified in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries 5112 (software) and 5415 (computer systems design and related services). With SIC classification, information technology services share of companyfunded R&D was 10.4% for 1998, indicating SIC-based data may overestimate information technology services R&D and net sales relative to NAICS-based data.\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Industrial Research and Development (annual series), http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyindustry/, accessed 6 May 2009.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-21\n\nAerospace and Defense Manufacturing Although it is common to refer to the \"defense industry,\"\nthe NAICS industry classification system does not include this category. Thus, to approximate the cost of defenserelated R&D, one can focus on aerospace products and parts, plus federally funded R&D in the following industries: navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments; automotive manufacturing; and other transportation manufacturing industries. Companies in this sector perform the majority of DOD's extramural R&D. In 2007, these industries reported performing $16.9 billion of federally funded R&D (table 4-5), about 64% of all federally funded industrial R&D. This total accounts for more than half of the $30.3 billion that the defense industry as a whole spent on R&D, including both federal and nonfederal sources of funds. (See \"Federal R&D\" for further discussion of defense R&D.)\nR&D and Related Services The R&D and related-services category includes compa-\nnies that provide scientific R&D, engineering, and architectural services to other firms. Also included are businesses that conduct R&D for their own use (e.g., biotechnology and other firms that conduct R&D in physical, engineering, and life sciences) but may not yet have sales. Companies in this sector performed $6.7 billion of federally funded R&D in 2007, the highest figure outside the aerospace and defense manufacturing category. Despite the significant amount of government-sponsored R&D performed by this sector, R&D and related-services companies increasingly rely on nonfederal sources of R&D financing. The R&D performed by companies in the R&D and related-services sector and funded by company and other nonfederal sources has grown from $5.8 billion in 1997 to $16 billion in 2007.20 Because much of the R&D reported by these companies also appears in their reported sales figures, the R&D intensity of this sector is particularly high (26% in 2007).21\nAutomotive Manufacturing The sixth-largest business sector in terms of R&D is auto-\nmotive manufacturing. Companies in this industry reported performing $16 billion of company-funded R&D in 2007, accounting for 6% of all such R&D performed by businesses in the United States.\nIn 2007, 15 companies in the automotive manufacturing industry reported company-funded R&D expenditures of more than $100 million each, collectively representing 83% of the industry's R&D (NSF/SRS 2009). In most industries, large companies perform more R&D than small companies, but in the automotive manufacturing industry, the distribution of R&D is even more skewed toward large companies, with the R&D activities of General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler dominating the sector. In their reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, these companies noted R&D expenses of $20.8 billion in 2006 (IEEE 2009). In addition to NSF statistics, other sources of indicators for business R&D include surveys conducted by the Industrial\n\nResearch Institute (IRI) and companies' own annual reports. (See sidebar \"Trends in R&D for Industrial Research Institute Members.\"22)\nFederal R&D\nThe government supports S&T through a number of policy measures, the most direct of which is the conduct and funding of R&D that would not or could not be conducted or financed in the private sector. This section presents data on federally funded R&D activities, on the government's contribution to the U.S. R&D infrastructure, and on federal R&D tax credits, which serve as an indirect means of stimulating R&D in the private sector.\nTrends in R&D for Industrial Research Institute Members\nFor more than 20 years, the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), a nonprofit association of more than 200 leading, R&D-performing, manufacturing and service companies, has surveyed its U.S.-based members on their intentions for the coming year with respect to R&D expenditures, focus of R&D, R&D personnel, and other items. Because IRI member companies carry out a large amount of industrial R&D in the United States, the results of these surveys help identify broad trends in corporate R&D strategies.\nThe most recent survey, administered during the summer of 2008, suggests that many companies continue to shift the focus of their R&D spending away from directed basic research and the support of existing business to new business projects (IRI 2009). As reflected in IRI's Sea Change Index,* IRI survey respondents also reported the following plans and expectations for 2009:\n Increase outsourcing of R&D to other companies  Increase outsourcing to universities and participa-\ntion in academic consortia\n Increase outsourcing to federal laboratories  Increase participation in alliances and joint R&D\nventures\n Increase acquisition of technological capabilities through mergers and acquisitions\n Increase spin-offs based on developed technology  Maintain total company expenditures for R&D  Maintain level of technology licensing to others\nOverall, these strategic moves are consistent with companies' expectations of flat R&D budgets.\n*IRI states that its Sea Change Index likely \"understates the absolute value of change,\" but the association believes it to be a \"good indicator of the direction of change.\" See IRI (2009) for details.\n\n\f4-22 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nR&D Funding in Current Federal Budget\nThe budget appropriations for federal spending on R&D in FY 2009 (signed into law in March 2009) totaled $147.1 billion (table 4-7), an increase of $3.3 billion, or 2.3%, over the enacted FY 2008 spending level of $143.7 billion. The president's proposed FY 2010 budget includes requests for spending on R&D of $147.6 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 0.4%, over the appropriated FY 2009 level.\nIn addition, a one-time but sizable increase in budget authority for federal R&D was provided by the American\n\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) (Public Law 111-5) in early 2009. In a preliminary estimate (May 2009), the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy placed the overall increase of federal R&D and R&D infrastructure funding from ARRA at about $18.3 billion in FY 2009 (table 4-7).\nAdjusted for inflation, the enacted federal budget for FY 2009 represents a 0.8% increase in constant dollars. The increase proposed by the president for FY 2010 represents a constant-dollar decline of 0.6%. The ARRA funding is a sizable increase, whether in current-dollar or inflation-adjusted\n\nTable 4-7 Federal budget authority for R&D and R&D plant: FY 2008\u00ad10\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nPerformer/character of work\nAll R&D, R&D facilities and equipment ...................

The overall effects on the growth of federal R&D funding in either year depends on whether added spending under ARRA occurs in FY 2009 or FY 2010.\nThe largest increases among the agencies in the FY 2009 budget for R&D go to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with an increase of $1.2 billion; the Department of Energy (DOE), up $814 million; and NSF, up $277 million (table 4-7). These same agencies are also major recipients of ARRA funds (table 4-7): $10.4 billion to NIH for added biomedical research and laboratory renovation and construction; $2.9 billion to NSF for increased basic research, education and human resources, research facility construction, and research instrumentation; and $2.4 billion to DOE for new collaborations at the frontiers of energy research and infrastructure investments at the national laboratories. In addition, $925 million goes to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for accelerated activities in earth science climate research missions and the development of a next-generation air transport system. Another $410 million goes to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for new standards research, advanced measurement equipment, and construction of research facilities.\nThe president's FY 2010 proposal for federal R&D notes investment priorities in four main areas, as follows:\n Sciences for a prosperous America--increased federal support for basic research. This focus recognizes that new fundamental knowledge and technology have often fueled the creation of new industries with associated hightechnology and high-wage jobs.\n A clean energy future--expanded investment in research, development, demonstration, and deployment of clean energy technologies to help reduce U.S. dependence on oil, create green jobs, and limit the impact of climate change. (See sidebar \"Public Investment in Energy R&D.\")\n Healthy lives for all Americans--increased funding for biomedical and health research.\n A safe and secure America--development of better science and technology to improve the prediction and prevention of, and the reaction to, destabilizing or paralyzing natural and man-made threats; improve capabilities for biodefense; and monitor nuclear nonproliferation compliance and prevent the surreptitious entry of weapons of mass destruction (OSTP 2009).\nFederal R&D Budget by National Objectives\nTo assist Congress and the president in evaluating and setting the federal budget and its components, the Office of Management and Budget classifies agency budget requests into specific categories called budget functions. Budget functions represent a wide range of national objectives that the government wants to advance, from defense to health to transportation.\n\nDefense-Related R&D In the FY 2008 budget, defense was the largest budget\nfunction, accounting for $81.1 billion (current dollars), or 59% of the federal R&D budget (appendix table 4-17). Nondefense functions totaled $56.9 billion. Defense R&D is supported by DOD, DOE, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with DOD accounting for $78 billion in FY 2008.\nThe proportional split between defense and nondefense R&D has fluctuated over the past several decades (figure 4-7). In FY 1980, federal budget authority for defense-related R&D roughly equaled nondefense R&D. During the next several years, however, defense R&D expanded rapidly. By FY 1985, defense R&D budget authority more than doubled that of nondefense R&D. In contrast, between 1986 and 2001 nondefense surged, and the gap between defense and nondefense R&D budgets shrank almost every year. In FY 2001, the defense budget function represented 53% of the federal R&D budget. The trend reversed yet again after September 11, 2001, as defense R&D became more prominent, accounting for 59% of the federal R&D budget in FY 2008.\nCivilian-Related R&D The most dramatic change in federal R&D priorities over\nthe past 25 years has been the increase in health-related R&D (figure 4-7), which rose from 25% of the federal nondefense R&D budget allocation in FY 1980 to 55% in FY 2005. Growth accelerated after 1998, when policymakers set the NIH budget on course to double by FY 2003. In FY 2008, health-related R&D represented 52% of nondefense R&D, even though recent increases have been below the level of inflation.\nThe budget allocation for space-related R&D peaked in the 1960s, during the height of the nation's efforts to surpass the Soviet Union in space exploration. The loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and its entire crew in February 2003 prompted curtailment of manned space missions. In more recent years, NASA's nondefense R&D budget share has increased, growing from 14% in FY 2005 to 17% in FY 2008. Nearly 58% of NASA's $17 billion budget in FY 2008 was allocated for R&D; adjusted for inflation, the space-related R&D total was higher in FY 2008 than at any time since FY 1999.\nFederal nondefense R&D classified as general science had about a 9% share in the mid 1990s, growing to 14% in FY 2008. However, this change reflected chiefly a reclassification of several DOE programs from energy to general science in FY 1998.\nWith respect to the federal budget for basic research, 94% of the funding in FY 2008 resided in nondefense budget functions (appendix table 4-18). In large part, this reflects the budgets of agencies with nondefense objectives such as general science (notably NSF), health (NIH), and space research and technology (NASA). Over the past several years, budget authority for basic research (which is not equivalent to general science R&D) has been flat after adjusting for inflation.\n\n\f4-24 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nPublic Investment in Energy R&D\n\nInternational public investment in energy research, development, and demonstration (hereafter R&D) has grown by about 30% over the 1997\u00ad2007 period, from $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars (figure 4-A). The data reflect annual energy R&D reports, by technology type, submitted by member governments of the International Energy Agency (IEA). These data provide insight into governmental R&D priorities in this area. The data do not include industry-funded activities in the listed energy types, nor do they cover broader activities that seek energy savings or reductions in such areas as industrial production and automotive and aircraft design.\nThe U.S. and Japanese governments reported by far the largest energy R&D government funds, fluctuating around 30% of the reported IEA total for the United States and declining from 38% to 30% for Japan. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, which are very broadly similar in overall R&D spending, committed very different public investments to energy R&D, with France's funding being much larger than expected relative to the other two countries. South Korea invested more than the combined total of the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe biggest energy type is nuclear fission and fusion (figure 4-B), which consumed 38% of the 2007 amount--down from 48% in 1997--and showed share losses in many major countries: from 75% to 65% in Japan, from 92% to 60% in France, and from 56% to 33% in Germany. In the United States, the energy share of nuclear fission/fusion rose from a low of 10% in 2002 to 18% in 2007--still well below the level of most other major countries.\nR&D in hydrogen and fuel cell energy is of most recent vintage. It represented about 7% of the IEA 2007 total; Canada stood out with 16% of its energy R&D funds in hydrogen and fuel cell technology. R&D in renewable energy has slowly risen to about 12% of the total, from 8% a decade ago; the United Kingdom led in renewable energy, with an increase from 9% to 36%; Sweden's level was high at 33%, as was Germany's at 22%.\nThe quest for energy efficiency received a fairly steady 13% of total energy R&D budgets, although the budget share was less in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. All other technologies combined averaged about 20% but garnered twice that level in the United States and much less than the IEA average in Japan and France.\n\n-PN\\YL ( ,ULYN` 9\n+ I\\KNL[Z VM UH[PVUHS NV]LYUTLU[Z VM\n\nZLSLJ[LK 0,( TLTILYZ!  \u00b6\n\n<: 1HWHU .LYTHU` -YHUJL <2 *HUHKH\n\n2VYLH 5VY^H` :^LKLU\n\n(SS V[OLYZ\n\n <: 777 KVSSHYZ TPSSPVUZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n       \n\n0,( $ 0U[LYUH[PVUHS ,ULYN` (NLUJ`\" 777 $ W\\YJOHZPUN WV^LY WHYP[`\" 9\n+ $ YLZLHYJO KL]LSVWTLU[ HUK KLTVUZ[YH[PVU :6<9*,! 0,( O[[W!^KZPLHVYN HJJLZZLK  1\\S`  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL ) *VTIPULK LULYN` 9\n+ I\\KNL[Z VM 0,( TLTILYZ I` [LJOUVSVN` [`WL!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n5\\JSLHY MPZZPVUM\\ZPVU \n\n\n\n(SS V[OLYZ \n,ULYN` LMMPJPLUJ`\n\n 9LUL^HISL LULYN`\n\n-VZZPS M\\LSZ\n\n/`KYVNLU M\\LS JLSSZ\n\n   \n\n       \n\n0,( $ 0U[LYUH[PVUHS ,ULYN` (NLUJ`\" 9\n+ $ YLZLHYJO KL]LSVWTLU[ HUK KLTVUZ[YH[PVU 56;,! 7LYJLU[HNL VM [V[HSZ YLWVY[LK I` HSS 0,( TLTILYZ :6<9*,! 0,( O[[W!^KZPLHVYN HJJLZZLK  1\\S`  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-25\n\n-PN\\YL  -LKLYHS 9\n+ I\\KNL[ H\\[OVYP[` I` I\\KNL[ M\\UJ[PVU! -@  \u00b6\n)\\KNL[ M\\UJ[PVU\nConstant FY 2000 dollars (billions)\n\n\n +LMLUZL\n 5VUKLMLUZL\n\n\n             \n\n5VUKLMLUZL I\\KNL[ M\\UJ[PVU\n /LHS[O\n\n\n\n:WHJL\n\n,ULYN`\n\n\n\n.LULYHS ZJPLUJL\n\n6[OLY \n\n\n\n\n\n             \n56;,:! -PN\\YLZ MVY -@  HYL WYLSPTPUHY` 6[OLY PUJS\\KLZ HSS UVUKLMLUZL M\\UJ[PVUZ UV[ ZLWHYH[LS` NYHWOLK Z\\JO HZ HNYPJ\\S[\\YL HUK [YHUZWVY[H[PVU   PUJYLHZL PU NLULYHS ZJPLUJL HUK KLJYLHZL PU LULYN` HUK  KLJYLHZL PU ZWHJL ^LYL YLZ\\S[Z VM YLJSHZZPMPJH[PVU\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ -LKLYHS 9\n+ -\\UKPUN I` )\\KNL[ -\\UJ[PVU! -PZJHS @LHYZ \u00b6  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nIn FY 2003, basic research budget authority was $23.8 billion (constant 2000 dollars); in FY 2008, $23.4 billion.\nFederal Spending on R&D by Agency\nFederal R&D obligations totaled an estimated $114.6 billion in FY 2008 (the most recent year for which complete data are available). An additional $1.8 billion was obligated for R&D plant (facilities and equipment). Federal obligations for R&D have increased annually on a current-dollar basis since the early 1990s, but when adjusted for inflation, the increases flatten out after FY 2005 (appendix table 4-19).\nMore than 20 federal agencies fund R&D in the United States. In FY 2008, seven agencies committed more than\n\n$1 billion each for R&D (figure 4-8; table 4-8; table 4-9; appendix table 4-20). These agencies accounted for about 96% of total federal R&D obligations that year.\nDepartment of Defense DOD funds more than half of all federal R&D, having\nprovided an estimated $58.7 billion (51%) in FY 2008. Of this total, $51.8 billion, or 88%, went to development, the majority ($45.8 billion) being allocated for \"major systems development,\" which includes the primary activities for developing, testing, and evaluating combat systems.\nExtramural performers received 71% of DOD's R&D obligations ($41.8 billion), the bulk going to industrial firms ($38.6 billion). DOD accounted for about 84% of all federal R&D funding to industry in FY 2008. DOD intramural R&D accounted for 26%, and FFRDC R&D accounted for 3%.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nis the primary federal source of funding for health-related R&D. In FY 2008, it obligated an estimated $29.7 billion, or 26% of all federal R&D, most ($28.5 billion) being R&D funding by NIH. HHS R&D funding is almost entirely allocated for research (almost 54% for basic and 46% for applied). Development activities accounted for less than 1% of the HHS total.\nExtramural performers accounted for 80% ($23.8 billion) of FY 2008 HHS R&D obligations. Universities and colleges received $17.1 billion; other nonprofit research organizations, $4.4 billion. HHS provided about 67% of all federal R&D funds distributed to universities and colleges in FY 2008 and 74% of federal R&D funds distributed to nonprofit institutions.\nDepartment of Energy DOE obligated an estimated $8.2 billion to R&D in\nFY 2008, 7% of the federal R&D total. Research accounted for 76% of these obligations (40% for basic and 36% for applied). FFRDCs received about 66% of DOE R&D obligations. Many of DOE's research activities require specialized equipment and facilities available only at its intramural laboratories and FFRDCs. Accordingly, DOE invests more resources in FFRDCs than other agencies. In FY 2008, DOE funds accounted for 59% of all federal R&D obligations to FFRDCs.\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA obligated an estimated $6.2 billion to R&D in\nFY 2008, 5% of the federal R&D total. Of this R&D support, 66% funded development activities; 21%, basic research; and 13%, applied research. Extramural R&D (chiefly by industry performers) accounted for 64% of NASA's R&D obligations in FY 2008. Agency intramural activities represented 19%--and FFRDC activities, another 17%--of the NASA R&D total.\n\n\f4-26 \n\nChapter 4.

Extramural performers includes federally funded R&D performed in the United States and U.S. territories by industry, universities and colleges, other nonprofit institutions, state and local governments, and foreign organizations.\n\nSOURCE: NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Federal Funds for Research and Development: Fiscal Years 2007\u00ad09.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nNational Science Foundation NSF obligated an estimated $4 billion for research in FY\n2008. About 92% of NSF's support funded basic research, and 95% funded extramural performers, chiefly universities and colleges ($3.3 billion). NSF is the federal government's primary source of funding for academic, basic S&E research and the second-largest federal source (after HHS) of R&D funds for universities and colleges.\nDepartment of Agriculture The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) obligated\nan estimated $2.4 billion for R&D in FY 2008, with the main focus on life sciences. The agency is also one of the largest research funders in the social sciences, particularly agricultural economics. Of USDA's total obligations for FY 2008, about 64% ($1.5 billion) funded intramural R&D, chiefly the Agricultural Research Service.\nDepartment of Commerce The Department of Commerce (DOC) obligated an esti-\nmated $1.1 billion for R&D in FY 2008, mainly for the R&D activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NIST. Research accounted for 91% of the R&D\n\nfor the department as a whole (10% for basic research and 81% for applied research); 78% of the total was for intramural R&D; and almost 22% supported extramural performers, primarily universities and colleges.\nOther Agencies Of the other R&D-funding agencies, eight obligated\nbetween $100 million and $1 billion for R&D in FY 2008 (table 4-8). This group included the Departments of Transportation, Homeland Security, the Interior, Veterans Affairs, and Education; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Smithsonian Institution; and the Agency for International Development. These agencies also varied with respect to the character of the research and the roles of intramural, FFRDC, and extramural performers.\nFederal Spending on R&D by Performer\nAcademia The federal government has historically been the pri-\nmary source of funding for R&D performed by universities and colleges.

As figure 4-9 illustrates, federal funding for academic R&D generally has increased over the long term. In FY 1955, federal obligations for academic R&D stood at $0.8 billion in constant 2000 dollars and accounted for 7% of all federal R&D funding. In FY 1985, federal obligations to this sector were $9.4 billion, 13% of all federal R&D funding. The corresponding figures for FY 2008 were $21.5 billion and 23%, respectively.\nFederal funding of academic R&D grew rapidly after FY 1998, the result of a successful bipartisan effort to double the budget of NIH from its FY 1998 level over the following 5 years. Since FY 2004, however, federal R&D obligations to universities and colleges have failed to keep pace with inflation. (For additional details on academic R&D, see chapter 5.)\nBusiness Federal obligations for R&D performed by businesses to-\ntaled an estimated $46.0 billion in FY 2008. For decades, the business sector has consistently received the bulk of federal R&D funds (figure 4-9).\nSpace program investments in the 1960s fueled the growth of federal obligations for business R&D, but after the successful Apollo 11 mission to the moon, R&D obligations to industry declined. A decade later, Cold War investments in military technology resulted in a renewed period\n\nof growth. Similarly, military investment in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, has increased the flow of federal R&D funding to industry. Adjusting for inflation, federal R&D obligations to industry increased by 42% from FY 2001 to 2008.\nThe amount of federally funded R&D reported by industry began to diverge from the amount reported by the federal government beginning in FY 1989. For details on this discrepancy, see the sidebar \"Tracking R&D: The Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures.\"\nFederal Intramural R&D Federal obligations for federal intramural R&D totaled an\nestimated $26.8 billion in FY 2008. These funds supported R&D performed at federal agencies' intramural laboratories, as well as the costs associated with the planning and administration of both intramural and extramural R&D projects.\nAmong individual agencies, DOD funds the most intramural R&D, having accounted for 56% of all federal obligations for intramural R&D in FY 2008 (table 4-9). DOD's intramural R&D obligations are almost three times those of HHS, the second-largest performer of federal intramural R&D. Only two other agencies reported intramural R&D obligations of more than $1 billion in FY 2008: NASA and USDA.\nFFRDCs Unique organizations in the federal R&D system,\nFFRDCs were established to help the U.S. government meet special long-term research or development needs that could not be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources. They were first established during World War II to assist DOD and DOE with R&D on nuclear weapons. Today, FFRDCs perform R&D for both defense and civilian applications across a broad range of S&E fields. Of the 37 currently active FFRDCs (appendix table 4-22), 16 are sponsored by DOE, the most of any federal agency. These 16 organizations accounted for about 69% of the R&D obligations of all FFRDCs combined in FY 2007.\nFive FFRDCs reported R&D obligations of more than $600 million in FY 2007: Los Alamos National Laboratory (DOE), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE), Sandia National Laboratory (DOE), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (DOE). These five accounted for 55% of the FFRDC total that year. Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are the only two laboratories in the United States where research on the nation's nuclear stockpile is conducted.\nFederal Spending on Research by Field\nFederal agencies fund research (that is, basic research plus applied research, excluding development) in a wide range of S&E fields, from physics and mathematics to aeronautical engineering to sociology. Furthermore, the share of funding for research differs by field, as do the trends in funding over time.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-29\n\nTracking R&D: The Gap Between Performerand Source-Reported Expenditures\n\nIn some OECD countries, including the United States, figures for total government R&D support reported by government agencies differ from those reported by performers of R&D work. In keeping with international guidance and standards, most countries' national R&D expenditure totals and time series are based primarily on data reported by performers (OECD 2002). Differences may be expected between funder and performer series for many reasons, such as different bases used for reporting government obligations (fiscal year) and performance expenditures (calendar year). Nonetheless, the gap between the two U.S. R&D series has widened over the past decade or more.\nDuring the mid-1980s, performer-reported federal R&D in the United States exceeded federal reports of funding by $3 to $4 billion annually (5% to 10% of the government total). This pattern reversed itself toward the end of the decade; in 1989, the government-reported R&D total exceeded performer reports by $1 billion. For FY 2007, federal agencies reported obligating $114 billion in total R&D to all R&D performers ($44 billion to the business sector), compared with $101 billion in federal funding reported by the performers of R&D ($27 billion by businesses). In other words, the business-reported total was approximately 40% smaller than the federally reported R&D support to industry in FY 2007 (figure 4-C). The difference in federal R&D totals resided primarily in DOD funding of development activities by industry.\nSeveral investigations into the possible causes for the data gap have produced insights but no conclusive explanation. According to a General Accounting Office investigation (GAO 2001):\nBecause the gap is the result of comparing two dissimilar types of financial data [federal obligations and performer expenditures], it does not necessarily reflect poor quality data, nor does it reflect whether performers are receiving or spending all the federal R&D funds obligated to them. Thus, even if the data collection and reporting issues were addressed, a gap would still exist.\nEchoing this assessment, the National Research Council (2005a) noted that comparing federal outlays for R&D (as opposed to obligations) to performer expenditures results in a smaller discrepancy. In FY 2007, federal agencies reported total R&D outlays of $109 billion.\n\n-PN\\YL * +PZJYLWHUJ` PU <: WLYMVYTLYYLWVY[LK HUK HNLUJ`YLWVY[LK MLKLYHS 9\n+!  \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[ \n\n(SS WLYMVYTLYZ\n\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6             \n0UK\\Z[YPHS WLYMVYTLYZ \n\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6             \n56;,! +PMMLYLUJL KLMPULK HZ WLYJLU[HNL VM MLKLYHSS` YLWVY[LK 9\n+ ^P[O WVZP[P]L KPMMLYLUJL PUKPJH[PUN [OH[ WLYMVYTLYYLWVY[LK 9\n+ L_JLLKZ HNLUJ`YLWVY[LK 9\n+\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ 5:-:9: 5H[PVUHS 7H[[LYUZ VM 9\n+ 9LZV\\YJLZ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ\" HUK 5:-:9: -LKLYHS -\\UKZ MVY 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[! -PZJHS @LHYZ \u00b6 MVY[OJVTPUN :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nIn FY 2008, an estimated $55.1 billion (48%) of the $114.6 billion for all R&D supported research.

Most of this amount funded research in medical and related life sciences. The five next-largest federal agencies for research funding that year were DOD (12%), DOE (11%), NSF (7%), USDA (4%), and NASA (4%).\nDOD's research funding emphasized engineering ($3.7 billion), and mathematics and computer sciences ($1.2 billion). DOE provided substantial funding for research in the physical sciences ($2.4 billion) and engineering ($2.2 billion), whereas USDA's research funding was chiefly directed at the life sciences ($1.8 billion). NASA's\n\nresearch funding emphasized engineering ($0.8 billion), followed by the physical sciences ($0.6 billion) and environmental sciences ($0.5 billion). NSF, which has a mission to \"promote the progress of science,\" had a relatively balanced research portfolio, contributing between $0.6 and $0.8 billion to researchers in each of the following fields: mathematics and computer sciences, physical sciences, engineering, environmental sciences, and life sciences.\nFrom 1986 to 2008, real growth in federal obligations for research averaged 3.2% per year, increasing from $23.1 billion in 2000 dollars in FY 1986 to $45.0 billion in FY 2008 (appendix table 4-24). The fields that experienced higherthan-average growth during this period were mathematics and computer sciences (5.5% per year in real terms), life sciences (4.8%), and psychology (5.8%). Funding for the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-31\n\nremaining fields also grew at a faster rate than inflation over this period: social sciences (1.9%), engineering (1.8%), and environmental sciences (1.3%).\nFederal R&D Tax Credits\nBackground Contributions of R&D to economic growth and social\nwelfare, along with likely underinvestment by private performers, given the difficulty in fully appropriating R&D benefits, are often cited as reasons for justifying public support for R&D (NRC 2005b).23 In addition to direct government funding discussed earlier in this chapter, fiscal policy tools used to provide such support include tax incentives.24 The federal government offers several corporate tax incentives for qualified R&D expenditures including a deduction under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 174 (C.F.R. Title 26) and a tax credit under section 41. As of 2006, at least 32 states also offered credits for company-funded R&D (NSB 2008; Wilson forthcoming). This section focuses on business R&D tax credits at the federal level.\nThe research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, established by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-34), covers R&D activities performed in the United States by domestic and foreign-owned firms but excludes R&D conducted abroad by U.S. companies. It is subject to periodic extensions and, at the time of writing, was last renewed by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 200825 through 31 December 2009.\nThe R&E tax credit encompasses a regular credit, as well as credits for payments for basic research to qualified universities, scientific research organizations, or grant organizations, and for payments to energy research consortia. Under the regular credit, companies can take a 20% credit for qualified research above a base amount for activities undertaken in the United States (IRC section 41(a)(1)).26 Thus, the regular credit is characterized as a fixed-base incremental credit. An incremental design is intended to encourage firms to spend more on R&D than they otherwise would by lowering after-tax costs. At the same time, the actual or effective credit rate for corporate taxpayers is lower than 20% because of limitations involving deductions under IRC section 174 (Guenther 2008).27\nFederal Corporate Tax Credit Claims According to the IRS Statistics of Income Division\n(SOI),28 U.S. companies claimed an estimated $7.3 billion in federal R&E tax credits in 2006, involving close to 11,000 corporate tax returns, compared with $6.4 billion in 2005 (table 4-10).29 The proportion of R&E credits going to corporations with business receipts of $250 million or more has fluctuated narrowly between 75% and 80% since 2003 and was 75% in 2006.30\nFor all industries, the size of R&E claims was about 3.3% relative to company-funded R&D in 2006, a proportion that has changed little in recent years (figure 4-11). Appendix\n\ntables 4-25 and 4-26 show data by NAICS industry up to 2005 (latest available year by detailed industry). Five industries accounted for about three-quarters of R&E credit claims in 2005. These industries had much higher ratios of R&E claims to industry-funded R&D: computer and electronic products (26%); chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and\n\nTable 4-10\nFederal research and experimentation tax credit claims and corporate tax returns claiming credit: 1990\u00ad2006\n\nTax credit claims\n\nYear\n\n($millions)\n\nTax returns\n\n1990.................. 1991.................. 1992.................. 1993.................. 1994.................. 1995.................. 1996.................. 1997.................. 1998.................. 1999.................. 2000.................. 2001.................. 2002.................. 2003.................. 2004.................. 2005.................. 2006..................\n\n1,547 1,585 1,515 1,857 2,423 1,422 2,134 4,398 5,208 5,281 7,079 6,356 5,656 5,488 5,554 6,363 7,311\n\n8,699 9,001 7,750 9,933 9,150 7,877 9,709 10,668 9,849 10,019 10,495 10,389 10,254 10,369 10,244 11,290 10,788\n\nSOURCE: Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income, special tabulations (historical data), http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/ article/0,,id=164402,00.html (2006), accessed 19 June 2009.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL  9LZLHYJO HUK L_WLYPTLU[H[PVU JYLKP[ JSHPTZ HZ WLYJLU[HNL VM PUK\\Z[Y`M\\UKLK 9\n+!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n\n\n\n\n               :6<9*,:! 0U[LYUHS 9L]LU\\L :LY]PJL :[H[PZ[PJZ VM 0UJVTL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\" HUK 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU :\\Y]L` VM 0UK\\Z[YPHS 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f4-32 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nComparing International R&D Expenditures\n\nComparisons of international R&D statistics are hampered by the lack of R&D-specific exchange rates. If countries do not share a common currency, some conversion must be made to compare their R&D expenditures. Two approaches are commonly used to facilitate international R&D comparisons: (1) normalize national R&D expenditures by dividing by GDP, thereby obviating the need for currency conversion altogether or (2) convert all foreign-denominated expenditures to a single currency, resulting in indicators of absolute effort. The first method is a straightforward calculation but permits only gross national comparisons of R&D intensity. The second method permits absolute-level comparisons and analyses of countries' sector- and field-specific R&D, but it entails choosing an appropriate method of currency conversion.\nBecause no widely accepted R&D-specific exchange rates exist, the choice is between market exchange rates (MERs) and purchasing power parities (PPPs). These rates are the only series consistently compiled and available for a large number of countries over an extended period of time.\nMERs. At their best, MERs represent the relative value of currencies for goods and services that are traded across borders. That is, MERs measure a currency's relative international buying power. Nevertheless, MERs may not accurately reflect the true cost of goods or services that are not traded internationally. In addition, fluctuations in MERs as a result of currency speculation, political events (such as wars or boycotts), and official currency intervention greatly impair their statistical utility--despite the fact that such occurrences have little or nothing to do with changes in the relative prices of internationally traded goods.\nPPPs. PPPs were developed because of the shortcomings of MERs (Ward 1985). PPPs take into account the cost differences across countries of buying a similar market basket of goods and services in numerous expenditure categories, including nontradables. The PPP basket is thereby assumed to be representative of total GDP across countries.\nAlthough the goods and services included in the market basket used to calculate PPP rates differ from the major components of R&D costs (fixed assets, as well as wages of scientists, engineers, and support personnel), they still result in a more suitable domestic price converter than one based on foreign trade flows. Exchange-rate movements bear little relationship to changes in the cost of domestically performed R&D. The adoption of the euro as the common currency for many European countries provides a useful example: although Germany and\n\nPortugal now share a common currency, the real costs of most goods and services are substantially less in Portugal. PPPs are, therefore, the preferred international standard for calculating cross-country R&D comparisons wherever possible and are used in all official R&D tabulations of the OECD.*\nBecause MERs tend to understate the domestic purchasing power of developing countries' currencies, PPPs can produce substantially larger R&D estimates than MERs for these countries. For example, China's 2006 R&D expenditures (as reported to the OECD) are $38 billion using MERs but $87 billion using PPPs. (Appendix table 4-2 lists the relative difference between MERs and PPPs for a number of countries.)\nAlthough PPPs are available for developing countries, such as India and China, they may be less useful for converting R&D expenditures in such countries than in more developed countries for a number of reasons:\n It is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of PPPs for some countries, most notably China. Although PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations. The latter estimates are based on extrapolations of numbers published by the United Nations International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.\n The composition of the market basket used to calculate PPPs likely differs substantially between developing and developed countries. The structural differences in the economies of developing and developed countries, as well as disparities in income, may result in a market basket of goods and services in a developing country that is quite different from that of a developed country, particularly as far as these baskets relate to the various costs of R&D.\n R&D performance in developing countries often is concentrated geographically in the most advanced cities and regions in terms of infrastructure and level of educated workforce. The costs of goods and services in these areas can be substantially greater than for the country as a whole.\n*Recent research raises some questions about the use of GDP PPPs for deflating R&D expenditures. In analyzing the manufacturing R&D inputs and outputs of six industrialized OECD countries, Dougherty et al. (2007) conclude that \"the use of an R&D PPP will yield comparative costs and R&D intensities that vary substantially from the current practice of using GDP PPPs, likely increasing the real R&D performance of the comparison countries relative to the United States.\"\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-33\n\nmedicines (18%); transportation equipment, including motor vehicles and aerospace (13%); information, including software (10%); and professional, scientific, and technical services, including computer and R&D services (10%). The same five industries accounted for 80% of 2005 companyfunded R&D from the NSF/Census Survey of Industrial Research and Development.31\nInternational R&D Comparisons\nData on R&D expenditures can provide a broad picture of the changing distribution of R&D activities around the world. R&D data available from the OECD cover the organization's 30 member countries and 9 nonmembers. Data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) Institute for Statistics are used here to supplement OECD statistics in order to cover a larger set of countries. Increasingly, these data are collected following OECD standards, but the reader should treat them as broad indicators of trends and patterns rather than as precise measures.\nInternational comparisons involve currency conversions. The discussion here follows the international convention to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars via purchasing\n\npower parity (PPP) exchange rates. (See sidebar \"Comparing International R&D Expenditures.\")\nGlobal Patterns of R&D Expenditures\nWorldwide R&D expenditures in 2007 totaled an estimated $1,107 billion. Although many countries conduct R&D, much of global R&D performance continues to be concentrated in a few high-income countries and regions.\nThree regions predominate (figure 4-12). North America accounts for 35% ($393 billion) of worldwide R&D performance; Asia, 31% ($343 billion); and Europe, 28% ($313 billion). The small remainder, approximately 5%, reflects the R&D of countries in the Latin America/Caribbean, Pacific, and Africa/Middle East regions.\nThe concentration is more apparent when reviewing the data of specific countries (table 4-11). By itself, the United States accounts for about 33% of the current global R&D total. Japan, the second-largest performer, accounts for about 13%. China (9%) comes next, followed by Germany (6%) and France (4%).\nThe top two countries thus account for 47% of the global R&D total, whereas the top five countries represent about 66%. Adding the next 5 countries--South Korea,\n\nFigure 4-12 National R&D expenditures and share of world total, by region: 2007\n(Billions of U.S. PPP dollars)\n\nNorth America $393 (35.5%)\nLatin America & Caribbean $26 (2.4%)\n\nEurope (Western, Central, Eastern) $313 (28.2%)\n\nAsia (East, South, West) $343 (31.0%)\n\nAfrica & Middle East $15 (1.3%)\n\nPacific $18 (1.6%)\n\nWorld total = $1,107\nPPP = purchasing power parity NOTES: Foreign currencies converted to dollars through purchasing power parities.

The Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries, of which the United States is a member (along with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom), account for about 65%. The 30 countries constituting the OECD account for about 80% of worldwide R&D. (Among the current major R&D-performing nations, only China is not an OECD member.)\nU.S. dominance of global R&D performance is notable as well with respect to these country groupings. U.S. R&D expenditures are currently 40% greater than the total for all of the EU-27 countries together. Within the G-7, the United\n\nStates currently accounts for more than half (52%) of the R&D total. (The U.S. share was 48% in 1990. It has exceeded 50% since 1997.) Within the OECD, U.S. R&D is about 42% of the total.\nAccording to OECD statistics (figure 4-13), total R&D by the EU-27 nations has been growing in real dollars over the past 10 years at an average annual rate of 3.3%. The pace of real growth during the same period for Germany, France, and the United Kingdom has been slower: averaging 2.9%, 1.8%, and 3.0%, respectively. By comparison, the U.S. pace of growth, on the same basis, has averaged 3.3%. Growth in Japan has been slower, at an annual average rate of 3.0%. For the OECD as a whole, real growth in R&D expenditures has also expanded on average at a rate of 3.6% annually over the past 10 years.\nChina continues to show the most dramatic growth pattern. The World Bank revised China's PPP exchange rate in late 2007, significantly lowering the dollar value of its R&D\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-35\n\nexpenditures. Nonetheless, the pace of real annual growth over the past 10 years in China remains exceptionally high at just above 19%.\nFinally, both India and Brazil are among the world's larger R&D performers, although neither has yet become part of OECD's statistical system. According to the UNESCO statistics, India performed $15 billion of R&D in 2004 (current U.S. dollars, PPP) and Brazil performed $13 billion in 2005. Both figures are about double the levels of R&D performance that each country reported in the mid-1990s. These levels of R&D expenditures would put both India and Brazil in the world's top 15 R&D performers.\nComparison of Country R&D Intensities\nR&D intensity--typically measured as the ratio of a country's national R&D expenditures to GDP for a given year--provides another basis for international comparisons of R&D performance. This approach does not require conversion of a country's currency to a standard international benchmark yet still provides a way to adjust for differences in the sizes of national economies.\n\n-PN\\YL  .YVZZ KVTLZ[PJ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ VU 9\n+ I` <UP[LK :[H[LZ ,< 6,*+ HUK ZLSLJ[LK V[OLY JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\n\nConstant 2000 PPP dollars (billions)\n\n\n\n6,*+\n\n.\n\n\n\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n,<\n\n\n\n1HWHU\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n-YHUJL\n\n\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n\n*OPUH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n            \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\" 6,*+ $ 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[\" 777 $ W\\YJOHZPUN WV^LY WHYP[`\n56;,:! +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY HSS JV\\U[YPLZ MVY HSS `LHYZ <: KH[H YLMSLJ[ 6,*+ TL[OVKVSVN` MVY JHSJ\\SH[PUN NYVZZ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ VU 9\n+ 1HWHU KH[H MVY   VU^HYK TH` UV[ IL JVTWHYHISL ^P[O LHYSPLY `LHYZ ILJH\\ZL VM JOHUNLZ PU TL[OVKVSVN`\n:6<9*,! 6,*+ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ   :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nThe structure of a national economy--that is, the relative prominence of agriculture, manufacturing, services, and so on--influences the interpretation of R&D intensity statistics. Businesses and organizations differ widely in their relative need for investment in the latest science and technology, and countries whose overall GDP depends considerably on industries in the high-technology sector will exhibit higher R&D/GDP ratios than other countries.\nFigure 4-14 provides background information on the GDP composition of the current top 10 R&D-performing countries. Agriculture is a comparatively small component (4% or less) for 9 of these 10 countries; only China is an exception, where agriculture is currently about 11%. For all but four of the countries, services account for 70% or more of current GDP. In China (49%), South Korea (39%), and Russia (41%), industry accounts for a more sizable fraction of GDP.\nTotal R&D/GDP Ratios The U.S. R&D/GDP ratio was about 2.7% in 2007 (table\n4-11). At this level, the United States is eighth among the economies tracked by the OECD. Israel has the highest ratio at 4.7%, with Sweden, Finland, Japan, and South Korea all above 3%.\n\n-PN\\YL  *VTWVZP[PVU VM NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[ MVY ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZ I` ZLJ[VY! \n\n(NYPJ\\S[\\YL\n\n0UK\\Z[Y`\n\n:LY]PJLZ\n\n<UP[LK\n\n:[H[LZ  \n\n\n\n1HWHU  \n\n\n\n*OPUH \n\n\n\n\n\n.LYTHU` \n\n\n\n\n\n-YHUJL \n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\\ZZPH \n\n\n\n \n \n\n*HUHKH \n\n\n\n\n\n0[HS` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n56;,:! +H[H MVY 9\\ZZPH HYL  +H[H JV]LY [OL  SHYNLZ[ 9\n+ WLYMVYTPUN JV\\U[YPLZ\n:6<9*,! *LU[YHS 0U[LSSPNLUJL (NLUJ` ;OL >VYSK -HJ[IVVR O[[W!^^^JPHNV]SPIYHY`W\\ISPJH[PVUZ[OL^VYSKMHJ[IVVRPUKL_ O[TS HJJLZZLK  -LIY\\HY`  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f4-36 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nThe R&D/GDP ratio in the United States has ranged from 1.4% in 1953 to a high of 2.9% in 1964 and has fluctuated in the range of 2.6% to 2.7% in recent years (figure 4-15). Most of the growth over time in the U.S. R&D/GDP ratio can be attributed to increases in nonfederal R&D spending, financed primarily by business. Non-federally financed R&D increased from about 0.6% of GDP in 1953 to 2.0% of GDP in 2007. This increase in the nonfederal R&D/GDP ratio reflects the growing role of business R&D in the national R&D system and, more broadly, the growing prominence of R&D-derived products and services in the national and global economies.\nHistorically, the many peaks and valleys in the U.S. R&D/GDP ratio reflect changing federal R&D priorities. The ratio's drop from its peak in 1964 largely resulted from federal cutbacks in defense and space R&D programs; from 1975 to 1979, gains in energy R&D activities kept the ratio stable. Beginning in the late 1980s, cuts in defense-related R&D kept growth in federal R&D spending below GDP growth, while nonfederal growth kept pace with or exceeded that of GDP. Since 2000, defense-related R&D spending has helped federal R&D spending growth outpace the growth of GDP.\nAmong other top 10 R&D-performing countries, total R&D/GDP ratios over the past 10 years show mixed trends (figure 4-16). Compared with 1996 R&D/GDP ratios, 2007 (or 2006) ratios were substantially higher in Japan, China, and South Korea; modestly higher for Germany and Canada; somewhat higher for Italy and the United Kingdom; and lower for France. Russia's R&D/GDP ratio grew consistently from the late 1990s but has fallen back to only somewhat above its 1996 level in recent years.\n\n-PN\\YL  <: 9\n+ ZOHYL VM NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n ;V[HS ZOHYL\n\n\n 5VUMLKLYHS ZOHYL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-LKLYHS ZOHYL\n\n                      \n\n56;,! +H[H MVY  HYL WYLSPTPUHY`\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ 5H[PVUHS 7H[[LYUZ VM 9\n+ 9LZV\\YJLZ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL  .YVZZ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ VU 9\n+ HZ ZOHYL VM NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[ MVY ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\n\nPercent \n\n;V[HS 9\n+.+7\n\n <UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n1HWHU :V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n -YHUJL\n\n *HUHKH\n\n\n\n0[HS`\n\n9\\ZZPH\n\n\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT *OPUH\n\n  \n\n\n       5VUKLMLUZL 9\n+.+7\n\n \n\n 1HWHU\n .LYTHU`\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ \n *HUHKH 0[HS`\n\n\n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n-YHUJL <UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n9\\ZZPH\n\n  \n\n      \n\n \n\n.+7 $ NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[\" 6,*+ $ 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[\n56;,:! ;VW  9\n+ WLYMVYTPUN JV\\U[YPLZ +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY HSS JV\\U[YPLZ MVY HSS `LHYZ <: KH[H YLMSLJ[ 6,*+ TL[OVKVSVN` MVY JHSJ\\SH[PUN NYVZZ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ VU 9\n+ 1HWHU KH[H MVY   VU^HYK TH` UV[ IL JVTWHYHISL ^P[O LHYSPLY `LHYZ ILJH\\ZL VM JOHUNLZ PU TL[OVKVSVN`\n:6<9*,! 6,*+ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ   :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-37\n\nIn addition to the United States, countries in Nordic and Western Europe and the most advanced areas of Asia have R&D/GDP ratios above 1.5%. This pattern broadly reflects the global distribution of wealth and level of economic development. Countries with high incomes tend to emphasize the production of high-technology goods and services and are also those that invest heavily in R&D activities. Private sectors in low-income countries often have a low concentration of high-technology industries, resulting in low overall R&D spending and, therefore, low R&D/GDP ratios.\nNondefense R&D and Basic Research Further perspective is provided by the ratio of nondefense\nR&D expenditures to GDP. This ratio more directly measures civilian R&D intensity and is useful when comparing nations with substantially different financial commitments to national defense. Figure 4-16 shows the trends since the early 1980s in the nondefense R&D/GDP ratios for 7 of the top 10 R&D-performing nations (for which data are available). Although the U.S. ratio (2.3% in 2007) ranks ahead of that for the United Kingdom, it lags behind Japan, South Korea, and Germany.\nAnother perspective comes from the extent to which spending on basic research accounts for a country's total\n\nR&D/GDP ratio. Estimates of the relative volume of basic research spending can provide a glimpse of the extent to which R&D resources are directed toward advancing the scientific knowledge base.\nBased on the most recent data available, the U.S. basic research/R&D ratio is about 0.5% and accounts for less than a fifth of the total R&D/GDP ratio (table 4-12). France's basic research ratio is slightly above the U.S. figure but accounts for nearly a quarter of its total ratio. South Korea's basic research ratio is close to the U.S. and French figures but accounts for less of the total ratio. The basic research ratios for Japan, Italy, and especially China are below the U.S. figure.\nThe following countries have basic research-to-GDP ratios at or above the U.S. level: Switzerland (0.83%), Israel (0.78%), Singapore (0.48%), Australia (0.45%), and Denmark (0.44%).\nR&D by Performing Sector and Source of Funds\nIn all top 10 countries ranked by R&D expenditures, the business sector is currently the largest performer, ranging from 77% for South Korea and Japan to 49% for Italy (table 4-13). Countries with relatively lower business-sector R&D\n\nTable 4-12 Gross expenditures on R&D as share of gross domestic product, for selected countries: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nCountry\nUnited States (2007) ...........................

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\ntend to have greater higher education R&D; these countries include Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, and France. The government sector is particularly prominent in the Russian Federation, Italy, China, and France.\nChina's business R&D sector has spurred much recent growth in national R&D expenditures, which rose from 60% of the total in 2000 to 72% in 2007. This increase reflects activities by private domestic companies and by multinational companies as well as the conversion of government-owned enterprises to the private sector.\nWith respect to R&D funding, the business sector supplies 66% of total R&D funds in the United States (table 4-14). In Japan and South Korea, the business sector supplies higher fractions of the total R&D funding than in the United States.\n\nGermany's and China's business sectors provide funding shares broadly similar to that of the United States. In France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Russian Federation, the business sector provides smaller shares of total R&D funding, but the government shares are relatively high. Government support for R&D is particularly low in Japan.\nMore precise analysis is impeded by the lack of comparable data for foreign-funded R&D in the United States (figure 4-17). Russia, the United Kingdom, and Canada had the strongest growth in foreign R&D funds during the 1990s but have recently experienced sharp drops. Foreign R&D funding largely comes from foreign companies but also includes resources from foreign governments and other overseas organizations.

However, this funding is not separately reported in U.S. R&D statistics; instead, it is included in the figures reported for the business sector.32\nBusiness Sector\nThe structure of business R&D varies substantially among countries in terms of both sector concentration and sources of funding. Because businesses account for the largest share of total R&D performance in the United States and most OECD countries, differences in business structure can help explain international differences in more aggregated statistics such as R&D/GDP. For example, countries with higher concentrations of R&D-intensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals or automotive manufacturing) are likely to also have higher R&D/GDP ratios than countries whose business structures are weighted more heavily toward less R&D-intensive industries.\n\nSector Focus for the United States and OECD Countries\nUsing internationally comparable data, no one industry accounted for more than 18% of total business R&D in the United States in 2007 (figure 4-18; appendix table 4-31) (OECD 2009c). This circumstance stems largely from the fact that total business R&D expenditures are so large in the United States that it is difficult for any one sector to dominate. However, the diversity of R&D investment by industry in the United States is also an indicator of how the nation's accumulated stock of knowledge and well-developed S&T infrastructure have made it a popular location for R&D performance for a broad range of industries.33\nCompared with the United States, many of the other countries shown in figure 4-18 display much higher industry sector concentrations. In countries with less business R&D, high sector concentrations can result from the activities of one or two large companies. This pattern is notable in Finland, where the communication, television, and radio equipment industry accounted for more than half of business R&D in 2007. This high concentration most likely reflects the activities of one company, Nokia, a major manufacturer of mobile phones at the forefront of the convergence of communications and the Internet. In contrast, South Korea's high concentration of R&D (48% of all business R&D in 2006) in this industry is not the result of any one or two companies, but reflects the structure of its export-oriented economy. South Korea is one of the world's top producers of electronic goods, and among its top export commodities are semiconductors, cellular phones, and computers. In the United States, the communication, television, and radio equipment industry accounted for 11% of all business R&D in 2007.\nOther industries also exhibit relatively high concentrations of R&D by country. Automotive manufacturers ranked among the largest R&D-performing companies in the world in 2006. (See table 4-15 and sidebar \"Global R&D Expenses of Public Corporations.\") Hence, countries that are home to the world's major automakers also boast the highest concentration of R&D in the automotive manufacturing industry. This industry accounts for 30% of Germany's business R&D, 23% of the Czech Republic's, and 19% of Sweden's (figure 4-18), reflecting the operations of automakers such as Daimler AG and Volkswagen in Germany, Skoda in the Czech Republic, and Volvo and Saab in Sweden. Also home to large R&D-performing firms in this industry are France (18% of all business R&D; PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Renault), Japan (17%; Toyota, Honda, Nissan), South Korea (15%; Hyundai, Kia), and Italy (12%; Fiat). In the United States, the automotive manufacturing industry accounted for 6% of all business R&D in 2007.\nThe pharmaceuticals industry is less geographically concentrated than the automotive manufacturing industry but is still prominent in several countries.

The annual reports of public corporations often include data on these R&D expenses. According to information gleaned from public reports, the 25 public corporations with the largest reported worldwide R&D expenses spent $143 billion on R&D in 2006. The six companies with the largest reported R&D expenses--Toyota, Pfizer, Ford Motor Company, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, and DaimlerChrysler-- each spent between $7 billion and $7.5 billion. The six automobile manufacturers on the list reported combined spending of $39 billion on R&D (27.3% of the total for the top 25) (table 4-15). Eleven companies in the information and communications technologies (ICT) sector spent a total of $57.9 billion (40.5% of the total). The remaining eight companies include six pharmaceutical manufacturers and two diversified consumer product\u00adoriented manufacturers. The top 25 companies are headquartered\n\nin 9 countries, with 10 headquartered in the United States. The location of a company's headquarters, however, is not necessarily the location of all its R&D activities. Most of the companies on this list have manufacturing and research facilities in multiple countries. (For more information, see section \"R&D by Multinational Companies.\")\nOverall, R&D spending for the top 25 public corporations increased 5.8% in 2006. (The top 25 list was the same for 2006 as it was for 2005 except for the addition of Cisco Systems, Inc., and the deletion of Nissan Motor Company.) Sales for the group as a whole increased 6.5%; sales increased 5.2% for the automobile and pharmaceutical manufacturers, 8.9% for the ICT companies in the group, and 5.4% for the consumer product manufacturers. R&D expenses increased for the manufacturers (pharmaceuticals, 8.5%; automobiles, 0.9%; and consumer products, 11.4%). The ICT companies, representing the sector that has historically had the highest R&D intensity, reported a 6.6% increase.\n\n\f4-42 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nBelgium and Ireland. Denmark, the largest performer of pharmaceutical R&D in Europe, is home to Novo Nordisk, a world leader in the manufacture and marketing of diabetesrelated drugs, and H. Lundbeck, a research-based company specializing in psychiatric and neurological pharmaceuticals. The United Kingdom is the second-largest performer of pharmaceutical R&D in Europe and is home to GlaxoSmithKline, which manufacturers medicines and vaccines for the World Health Organization's three priority diseases-- HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. GlaxoSmithKline was the third-largest pharmaceuticals company in the world in terms of R&D expenditures in 2005 and 2006 (table 4-15). In the United States, the pharmaceuticals industry accounted for 18% of all business R&D in 2007. U.S.-headquartered pharmaceutical companies include Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Schering-Plough, and Wyeth.\nThe computers, office and accounting machines industry represents only a small share of business R&D in most countries. Among the OECD countries shown in figure 4-18 and appendix table 4-31, only Japan reports a double-digit concentration of business R&D in this industry, 13% (2006). Japan is the home of Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC. In the United States, the computers, office and accounting machines industry accounted for 3% of all business R&D in 2007. The United States is home to Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and other companies in this industry.\nA significant trend in both U.S. and international business R&D activity has been the growth of R&D in the service sector. According to national statistics for recent years, the service sector accounted for 30% or more of all business R&D in 9 of the 19 OECD countries shown in figure 4-18 and less than 10% in only 4 of the countries. In the United States, service industries accounted for 30% of all business R&D in 2007.\nOther Countries Internationally comparable data for seven non-OECD\ncountries have recently been made available in OECD's Analytical Business Enterprise R&D (ANBERD) database (OECD 2009c). Percentage shares of total business R&D by industry for Chile, China, Israel, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, and Taiwan are detailed in appendix table 4-31.\nAmong these countries, the new data show that the communication, television, and radio equipment industry accounts for more than 40% of all business R&D in Singapore and Taiwan and more than 15% in Israel and China. Motor vehicle and pharmaceutical R&D account for smaller percentages of business R&D than in most of the OECD countries. Motor vehicle R&D accounts for 5% or more of business R&D in South Africa and China, and the two countries with the highest percentages of pharmaceutical R&D are Singapore (8%) and China (4%). R&D in the computer, office and accounting machines industry accounts for\n\n15% of the business R&D performed in Taiwan, the highest percentage among the seven nations.\nAmong the OECD countries shown in figure 4-18, the service sector accounts for as little as 7% of business R&D in South Korea to as much as 41% in Australia. The newly available data show a similar range among the seven nations. The percentage of business R&D accounted for by the service sector ranges from 7% in China to more than 60% in Israel and the Russian Federation.\nAcademic Sector\nThe academic sector's share of R&D is largest in Canada, where it accounted for 36% of national R&D performance in 2007 (table 4-13). It is lowest in the Russian Federation at 6%. The academic share in the United States and Japan is in the middle at 13%, whereas China is 9%.\nSource of Funds For most countries, the government is (and has long\nbeen) the largest source of academic research funding. (See sidebar \"Government Funding Mechanisms for Academic Research.\") Business support for academic R&D has increased over the past 25 years among the OECD countries as a whole. It was around 3% in the early 1980s, nearly 6% in 1990, and almost 7% in 2000 but then fell back to around 6% in 2006.\nIn the United States, business support for academic R&D was about 4% in the early 1980s and rose to about 7% later in that decade and through the 1990s but has dropped under 6% since 2000. Some commentators note with concern this recent trend of decline, in light of the significant role that academic basic research plays in providing a foundation for technological innovation important to the national economy.\nThe proportion of academic R&D financed by business is more varied among the other top R&D-performing countries (figure 4-19). The highest figures for business support of academic R&D are currently in China (35%) and Russia (31%). The figures are also high in Germany (14%) and South Korea (14%), whereas Japan, France, and Italy occupy the low end, with figures in the 1% to 3% range.\nS&E Fields Many countries that support a substantial level of aca-\ndemic R&D devote proportionately more of their R&D spending to engineering and social science than does the United States (table 4-16). The thrust of U.S. academic R&D support is more directed at the natural and medical sciences. (For a more detailed discussion of S&E field patterns of academic research in the United States and other countries, see chapter 5, \"Outputs of S&E Research.\")\nGovernment R&D Priorities\nPublic R&D budget directed toward specific socioeconomic objectives gives insight into government priorities. Statistics compiled by the OECD on annual government\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-43\n\nGovernment Funding Mechanisms for Academic Research\nU.S. universities generally do not maintain data on departmental research (i.e., research which is not separately budgeted and accounted). As such, U.S. R&D totals are understated relative to the R&D effort reported for other countries. The national totals for Europe, Canada, and Japan include the research component of general university fund (GUF) block grants provided by all levels of government to the academic sector. These funds can support departmental R&D programs that are not separately budgeted. GUF is not equivalent to basic research. The U.S. federal government does not provide research support through a GUF equivalent, preferring instead to support specific, separately budgeted R&D projects, usually to address the objectives of the federal agencies that provide the R&D funds. However, some state government funding probably does support departmental research at U.S. public universities.\nThe treatment of GUF is one of the major areas of difficulty in making international R&D comparisons. In many countries, governments support academic research primarily through large block grants that are used at the discretion of each higher education institution to cover administrative, teaching, and research costs. Only the R&D component of GUF is included in national R&D statistics, but problems arise in identifying the amount of the R&D component and the objective of the research. Moreover, government GUF support is in addition to support provided in the form of earmarked, directed, or project-specific grants and contracts (funds that can be assigned to specific socioeconomic categories).\nIn the United States, the federal government is much more directly involved in choosing which academic research projects are supported than are national governments in Europe and elsewhere--although this is not necessarily the case with state governments. In several European G-7 countries (France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom), GUF accounts for 50% or more of total government R&D funding to universities. In Canada, GUF accounts for about 38% of government academic R&D support. These data reflect not only the relative international funding priorities but also the funding mechanisms and philosophies regarded as the best methods for financing academic research.\nbudget appropriations or outlays for R&D (GBAORD) for its members and selected other countries provide a basis for such a comparison (table 4-17).\nDefense is an objective for government funding of R&D for all the top R&D-performing countries, but the share\n\n-PN\\YL  (JHKLTPJ 9\n+ MPUHUJLK I` I\\ZPULZZ MVY ZLSLJ[LK JV\\U[YPLZ!  \u00b6\n\nPercent\n\n\n\n*OPUH\n\n9\\ZZPH\n\n\n\n.LYTHU`\n\n:V\\[O 2VYLH\n\n\n\n*HUHKH\n\n<UP[LK :[H[LZ\n\n<UP[LK 2PUNKVT\n\n\n\n1HWHU\n\n-YHUJL\n\n0[HS` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           \n\n \n\n56;,:! +H[H MVY [VW  9\n+ WLYMVYTPUN JV\\U[YPLZ +H[H UV[ H]HPSHISL MVY HSS JV\\U[YPLZ MVY HSS `LHYZ 1HWHU KH[H MVY   VU^HYK TH` UV[ IL JVTWHYHISL ^P[O LHYSPLY `LHYZ ILJH\\ZL VM JOHUNLZ PU TL[OVKVSVN`\n:6<9*,! 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ 4HPU :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` 0UKPJH[VYZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nvaries widely. Defense accounted for 58% of U.S. federal R&D support in 2007 but was markedly lower elsewhere: a smaller but still significant 29% in France and 28% in the United Kingdom, 17% in South Korea, and below 10% in both Germany and Japan.\nDefense has remained the focus of more than 50% of the federal R&D budget in the United States for much of the past 25 years. It was 63% in 1990 as the long Cold War period drew to a close. It dropped to 52% in 2000 but has risen again in the wake of events stemming from September 11, 2001. The defense share of government R&D funding for the other countries over the past 25 years has generally declined or remained at a stable, low level.\nThe health and environment objective now accounts for 55% of nondefense federal R&D budget support in the United States and 26% in the United Kingdom. For both countries, the share has expanded dramatically over the prevailing levels several decades ago. The health and environment share is currently 17% in South Korea, 13% in France, and 10% or less in Germany and Japan. The funding under this objective goes primarily into the health arena in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the other countries, it is more balanced between health and the environment.\nThe economic development objective encompasses agriculture, fisheries and forestry, industry, infrastructure, and energy.

In the United States, it was 36% of all nondefense federal support for R&D in 1981, dropping to 10% in 2007.34 In the United Kingdom, it was 39% in 1981, declining to 7% in 2006. Despite a decline, support for this objective remains substantial in some countries: 22% in Germany and France (both with particular attention to industrial production and technology) and 31% in Japan (notably in energy and industrial production and technology). South Korea currently has by far the largest share for this objective, 52%, with a particularly strong emphasis in recent years on industrial production and technology.\nThe civil space objective accounts for 18% of nondefense federal R&D funding in the United States. The share has been around 20% in the United States for much of the past 25 years. The share in France is currently about 13%--and has been around that level for almost 20 years. The share has been below 10% for the rest of the OECD countries.\nThe other purposes objective includes the general advance of knowledge (university research and nonoriented\n\ngovernment research), education, and other activities directed toward cultural and socioeconomic system purposes. This objective accounts for 17% of nondefense federal R&D funding in the United States (table 4-17). The share is substantially greater elsewhere: 64% in Germany and the United Kingdom, 55% in Japan, and 52% in France. For all OECD countries, university research and nonoriented government research constitute the vast majority of the funding under this objective.\nR&D by Multinational Companies\nForeign direct investment (FDI) refers to the ownership of productive assets outside the home country by MNCs. (See sidebar \"Foreign Direct Investment in R&D.\") FDI and international trade are key channels for international knowledge and technology diffusion, which in turn contribute to productivity growth (Keller 2004; OECD 2008a).

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nForeign Direct Investment in R&D\nDirect investment is defined as ownership or control of 10% or more of the voting securities of a business (affiliate) in another country. As with other overseas activity, the geographic distribution of affiliates' R&D varies by investing country and industry (OECD 2007). FDI in R&D is driven by factors ranging from costs and long-term market and technological opportunities to infrastructure and policy considerations, such as availability of appropriately trained human resources and intellectual property protection (Niosi 1999; Thursby and Thursby 2006; von Zedtwitz and Gassmann 2002).\nStatistics on R&D by affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States, and by foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs and their parent companies, can be obtained from BEA's Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States (FDIUS) and BEA's Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (USDIA). BEA data used in this section cover nonbank companies.* Affiliate data cover majority-owned affiliates, that is, those in which the ownership stake of parent companies totals more than 50%. Annual changes in FDI R&D reflect a combination of mergers and acquisitions; newly built factories, service centers, or laboratories; and activities in existing facilities. Available data do not, however, allow for distinguishing among these alternative investments.\n*Nonbank data exclude activities by companies classified in depository credit intermediation, which comprises commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies.\nFor detailed methodology, see http://www.bea.gov/international/ usdia2004f.html (USDIA) and http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/internat/ fdinvest/meth/FDIUS2002Benchmark.pdf (FDIUS).\nof common ownership and control.35 Overseas locations may also facilitate networking opportunities with foreign companies, research centers, and universities. Thus, R&D by MNCs complements activities with external parties, such as R&D contracting, technology alliances, and international exchanges of R&D services, discussed later in this chapter. As a whole, these activities reflect a collaborative and global framework for creating and exploiting new knowledge by leveraging internal and external capabilities (OECD 2008a).\nAs described below, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the majority of R&D by U.S. MNCs continues to be performed in the United States. Western Europe has attracted the majority of U.S.-owned overseas R&D, followed by the Asia-Pacific region.36 Likewise, foreign-owned companies continue to invest in R&D in the United States.\n\nLinking MNC Data From International Investment\nand Industrial R&D Surveys\nAn ongoing data development project aims to integrate the statistical information from BEA's international investment surveys with the NSF/Census Survey of Industrial Research and Development. Combining technological and investment data from these complementary sources will facilitate a better assessment of globalization trends in R&D and technological innovation. The initial methodological study demonstrated the feasibility and utility of such a linkage.\nA combined preliminary data set provided information for the first time on R&D expenditures by U.S. and foreign MNCs by character of work (basic research, applied research, and development). The study has also produced tangible benefits for the participating agencies, including improvements in survey sampling and the quality of reported data. These promising initial results have prompted the three participating agencies to continue work in this area. For more information, see NSF/SRS (2007b) and Census Bureau et al. (2005).\nU.S. Affiliates of Foreign Companies\nR&D performed by majority-owned affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States (U.S. affiliates) reached $34.3 billion in 2006, compared with $31.1 billion in 2005 (appendix table 4-32).37 R&D expenditures by these companies grew at an annual average rate of 11.3% (8.6% after adjusting for inflation) from 1987 to 2006, more than double the 5.3% (2.8%) rate for total business R&D performed in the United States. This faster growth rate increased their share in total business R&D from the single digits in the early 1990s to 14.8% in 2003; their share has hovered near 14% since then. Details on the R&D character of work for MNCs are under development. (See sidebar \"Linking MNC Data From International Investment and Industrial R&D Surveys.\")\nSince the late 1980s, European subsidiaries have performed about three-fourths of all U.S. affiliates' R&D ($25.8 billion in 2006) (figure 4-20). The share of Japaneseowned companies grew from the single digits in the late 1980s to between 10% and 12% since 1996. European and Japanese subsidiaries combined have accounted for more than 85% of these expenditures since 2001.\nIn 2006, manufacturing accounted for about three-quarters of U.S. affiliates' R&D, including 37% in chemicals (of which pharmaceuticals was 90%), 12% in transportation equipment, and 9% in computer and electronic products (table 4-18; appendix table 4-33). These three industries also topped overall U.S. business R&D.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-47\n\nFigure 4-20 R&D performed by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies in United States, by investing region, and performed by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational corporations, by host region: 2006\n(Billions of current U.S. dollars)\n\n$1.6 $2.5\n\n$25.8\n\n$5.6\n\n$18.6\n\n$0.2\n\n$0.8\n\n$4.6 $1.3 $0.04\n$0.9\n\n$0.07\n\nNOTES: Preliminary estimates.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States (annual series); and Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (annual series).

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nStatistics from 2006 indicate that affiliates from different countries emphasized R&D in different industries. Germanowned affiliates located in the United States spent more than 40% of their $6.7 billion R&D in transportation equipment (table 4-18). British-owned companies accounted for more than half of affiliates' R&D in computers and electronic products. Japanese-owned firms accounted for 44% of affiliates' R&D expenditures in professional, scientific, and technical services. Swiss-owned firms performed a third of affiliates' R&D in pharmaceuticals.\nU.S. MNCs and Their Overseas R&D\nU.S. MNCs (parent companies and their foreign affiliates) performed $216.3 billion in R&D worldwide in 2006 (table 4-19). Parents of U.S. MNCs performed $187.8 billion in R&D, compared with $177.6 billion in 2005, a 2.5% increase on an inflation-adjusted basis.38 The 2006 R&D by MNC parents represented 87% of global R&D by U.S. MNCs and about 76% of U.S. business R&D. Both shares have changed little since 2004.39\nOverseas R&D performed by majority-owned foreign affiliates (henceforth, foreign affiliates) reached $28.5 billion in 2006, compared with $27.7 billion in 2005 (essentially unchanged on an inflation-adjusted basis). However, since 1999 foreign affiliates' R&D expenditures increased at a 4.0% annual average rate after adjusting for inflation, and have increased at a 5.0% annual average rate since 1994.\nIn 2006, affiliates located in Europe accounted for 65% ($18.6 billion of $28.5 billion) of overseas affiliates' R&D, of which the United Kingdom and Germany combined represented more than half ($10.3 billion) (appendix table 4-34).40 Europe's share, however, is down from 73% in 1994 (figure 4-21).\nIndeed, the geographic distribution of R&D by overseas affiliates of U.S. MNCs is gradually reflecting the role of\n\nTable 4-19 R&D performed by U.S. multinational companies: 2004\u00ad06\n\nR&D performed (current US$millions)\n\nShares of MNC (%)\n\nU.S.\n\nTotal\n\nU.S.\n\nYear parents MOFAs MNCs parents MOFAs\n\n2004..... 164,189 25,840 190,029 86.4\n\n13.6\n\n2005..... 177,598 27,653 205,251 86.5\n\n13.5\n\n2006..... 187,813 28,484 216,297 86.8\n\n13.2\n\nMNC = multinational company; MOFA = majority-owned foreign affiliate\n\nNOTE: MOFAs are affiliates in which combined ownership of all U.S. parents is >50%.\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Over the same period, the share of the region termed Asia except Japan more than doubled, from\n\n-PN\\YL  9LNPVUHS ZOHYLZ VM 9\n+ WLYMVYTLK HIYVHK I` MVYLPNU HMMPSPH[LZ VM <: 45*Z!  \u00b6\nPercent \n\n ,\\YVWL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n\n\n\n*HUHKH 1HWHU\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (ZPH7HJPMPJ L_JS\\KPUN 1HWHU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n3H[PU (TLYPJH \n 6>/\n\n4PKKSL ,HZ[\n\n(MYPJH\n\n      \n\n\n\n45* $ T\\S[PUH[PVUHS JVTWHU`\" 6>/ $ V[OLY >LZ[LYU /LTPZWOLYL\n56;,:! +H[H MVY THQVYP[`V^ULK HMMPSPH[LZ 7YLSPTPUHY` LZ[PTH[LZ MVY \n:6<9*,! )\\YLH\\ VM ,JVUVTPJ (UHS`ZPZ :\\Y]L` VM <: +PYLJ[ 0U]LZ[TLU[ (IYVHK HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-49\n\n5.4% to 13.5%, driven by the R&D spending of U.S.-owned affiliates in China, Singapore, and South Korea.\nOn an individual country basis, changes proved more modest in terms of global shares, although funding levels in some lower-cost locations may still be significant from the perspective of purchasing power. R&D performed by U.S.-owned affiliates in China and India increased from less than $10 million in each country in 1994 to $804 million in China and $310 million in India in 2006, but these levels represented only about 3% and 1%, respectively, of total overseas R&D by U.S. MNCs. In the Middle East, Israel accounted for virtually all R&D by affiliates of U.S. MNCs,\n\nwith about 3% of the global share. Brazil represented twothirds of Latin America's U.S.-owned affiliates' R&D and a 2% global share.\nIn 2006, manufacturing affiliates accounted for 83% of overseas affiliates' R&D, including 68% by three manufacturing industries: transportation equipment (29%), chemicals (including pharmaceuticals) (22%), and computer and electronic products (17%) (table 4-20). More than half of R&D by U.S.-owned affiliates in Europe was performed by affiliates classified in transportation equipment (35%) and chemicals (21%).

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nBrazil. Affiliates classified in chemicals performed half of R&D by U.S.-owned companies in Japan.\nReflecting the increasing global linkages in information technology production and development, affiliates classified in computer and electronic product manufacturing performed the majority of U.S.-owned R&D in some emerging markets: Malaysia (97%), China (67%), Singapore (66%), and Israel (60%) (table 4-20). In terms of service industries, affiliates classified in the information industry (which includes software and Internet publishers and telecommunications) performed about one-fourth of U.S.-owned R&D in Ireland. Finally, 35% of R&D by U.S.-owned affiliates in India was performed by those classified in professional, scientific, and technical services (which includes computer and scientific R&D services).42 Nevertheless, European-located affiliates performed two-thirds of the $2.7 billion in overseas, U.S.-owned R&D in this industry.\n\nTechnology and Innovation Linkages\nIncreasingly, R&D and innovation are pursued in a collaborative and interactive environment, often embedded in global supply, production, and distribution networks (Dahlander and Gann 2007; Howells 2008; OECD 2008a). This section presents indicators on two types of innovation linkages: (1) business-to-business interactions in the form of contracted-out R&D, international transactions in R&D services, and global technology alliances, and (2) publicprivate collaborations. Overall, these indicators illustrate a variety of intra- and cross-organizational arrangements intended to absorb, manage, and exploit external and/or jointly developed knowledge (Chesbrough, Birkinshaw, and Teubal 2006; Ozman 2009). For ongoing development activities related to innovation indicators, see the sidebar \"Recent Developments in Innovation-Related Metrics.\"\n\nRecent Developments in Innovation-Related Metrics\n\nInterest in R&D and innovation-related metrics by governments, academic researchers, and businesses has a long history (Earl and Gault 2006) but has intensified in recent years in the United States (DOC 2008; Mandel 2008; McKinsey & Company 2008; Moris, Jankowski, and Perolle 2008; NRC 2005a; NSF/TCB 2008) and elsewhere (Gault and von Hippel 2009; OECD 2008c). Recent developments in innovation-related metrics are driven by a number of factors, including:\n The rapidly evolving nature of innovation in terms of joint production and exploitation of knowledge, userbased innovation, new business models, entrepreneurship, and global linkages\n Advances in social, behavioral, economic, and management theories of creativity, productivity, and innovation\n Developments in national standards on statistical quality and protection of confidentiality\n Emerging international accounting standards and official statistics guidance on intangibles and other nonfinancial assets\n Advances in data development, integration, and empirical research methodology involving microdata sets, administrative data, data enclaves, and new computing and visualization tools\nInnovation is defined as the introduction of new or significantly improved products (goods or services), processes, organizational methods, and marketing methods in internal business practices or the marketplace (OECD/ Eurostat 2005, p 146). R&D is only one of many possible knowledge inputs driving innovation. For example, innovation may result from the integration of existing\n\ntechnology or from a new business model. Enhanced international guidance and ongoing methodological studies to better capture statistics on nontechnological innovation, innovation linkages, and service-sector activities are driving development of metrics across OECD countries.\nPart of the challenge in developing new metrics resides in the broad scope of innovation activities covering inputs, processes, cross-sector linkages, immediate outputs (for example, products or patents), long-term socioeconomic impacts, and infrastructure or system-wide variables (such as policy incentives or technology standards). Accordingly, data development spans multiple strategies, including surveys and data linking and integration, as well as non-survey-based methods, such as case studies, administrative databases, and Web-based information-- pursued in parallel or in combination (NSF/SRS 2007a; NSF/TCB 2008). The following describes selected activities in the development of these indicators.\nIntangible Investment and GDP Treating spending on intangibles, such as software and\nR&D, as investment in the national income and product accounts (NIPA) (which include GDP and other U.S. economic accounts) recognizes intangible capital, along with other forms of investment inputs, in the production of economic output (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel 2006; UNSC 2007). International statistical manuals are being updated or developed to provide guidance for comparable measures in this area, including an updated manual for the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) and a new OECD handbook covering intangibles and national accounts (Aspden 2008). Software has been considered an\n(continued on next page)\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-51\n\nBusiness-to-Business Linkages\nTechnology and innovation linkages vary by type of partner or knowledge source and level of interaction (OECD/Eurostat 2005). Knowledge sources range from academic papers, conference proceedings, and reports from government laboratories to information from commercial sources, such as marketing and management consultants, patent licensors, R&D contractors, and technology vendors. This section examines indicators related to business transactions and organizational arrangements to acquire or jointly develop new knowledge.\nContract R&D Expenses Within the United States Increasingly, companies that perform R&D in the United\nStates contract out these activities. These companies reported an estimated $19 billion in R&D performed by external organizations located in the United States43 in 2007, compared with $12.4 billion in 2006 (appendix tables 4-39 and 4-40).44\n\nThe all-industries ratio of contracted-out R&D to companyfunded, company-performed R&D increased from 5.5% in 2006 to 7.8% in 2007.45 For manufacturers, the ratio reached 8.5% in 2007, up from 5.7% in 2006 (figure 4-22).\nAcross R&D-intensive industries, pharmaceuticals had the highest ratio of contracted-out R&D (21%) in 2007. The ratio for automotive manufacturers was 7.3%, and for navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments (a subsector of the computer and electronic products industry) was 3.8%. Within services, the contracted-out R&D ratio was 13.8% for scientific R&D services and 8.3% for telecommunications in 2007.\nExports and Imports of R&D Services Across OECD countries, international trade in services,\nespecially those involving intangibles and knowledge-based assets, presents unique measurement challenges for both business accounting and official statistics (OECD 2008b; Reinsdorf and Slaughter 2009; Yorgason 2007). An indicator in\n\ninvestment in U.S. NIPA since 1999, and BEA and NSF continue to work on an R&D satellite account, as described earlier in this chapter. BEA plans to incorporate both R&D and spending on artistic and literary originals as intangible investment in the core economic accounts in 2013 and is considering an expanded satellite account that would contain experimental statistics for other intangibles (Aizcorbe, Moylan, and Robbins 2009).\nScience of Science and Innovation Policy Program, Research Data Infrastructure, and Advanced Computing Tools\nThe NSF Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program supports research designed to advance the scientific basis of science and innovation policy. Research funded by the program is aimed at developing, improving, and expanding models, analytical tools, data, and metrics. An area of interest is the development of data infrastructure to support empirical research on innovations within organizations (NSF/TCB 2008). Other efforts focus on cyber-infrastructure research; advanced computing and Web-based tools to protect, archive, link, mine, and analyze data (Lane, Heus, and Mulcahy 2008); and advanced visualization and analytical tools for document-based information, such as patents and bibliographic entries (B\u00f6rner, Chen, and Boyack 2003).\nEntrepreneurship and Business Dynamics Two National Research Council (NRC) reports cite\nthe need to leverage business data collected by statistical agencies for research and policymaking purposes by more effectively integrating data sets (NRC 2006, 2007b). Data sets for the study of business dynamics include the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics\n\n(BDS) (Census Bureau 2009) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program (Abowd, Haltiwanger, and Lane 2004), along with the Business Employment Dynamics published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS 2009). Research topics of interest include technology adoption, innovation, outsourcing, globalization, market entry and exit by companies, and new or small technology-based firms. Indeed, entrepreneurship has been extensively researched as a vehicle for transferring and exploiting new knowledge from public or private sources (Audretsch 2009). In the United States, the Kauffman Foundation funds research in entrepreneurship and innovation (Kauffman 2008) and sponsors a social longitudinal survey on young firms (Kauffman 2009).\nOECD Innovation Microdata Project and EU Community Innovation Surveys\nThe OECD innovation microdata project aims at exploiting microdata from the EU Community Innovation Surveys (CIS) for economic analysis. In recent years, research teams from different OECD countries have collaborated in applying similar methodologies to their national CIS. Expected products include analytical studies and new innovation indicators covering, for example, international technology transfer, nontechnological innovation, and intellectual property rights (OECD 2009a).\nThe project is part of a larger OECD Innovation Strategy initiative established in 2007; the objective is to explore strategies to harness the potential of innovation based on a better understanding of innovation. Research is focusing on markets and governance, human capital, global dimensions, and the changing nature of innovation, along with measurement, reporting, and assessment of innovation (OECD 2009b)\n\n\f4-52 \n\nChapter 4.

These data are part of balance-of-payment statistics and complement other fee-based transactions (such as royalties and licensing), as well as performance and funding information from R&D surveys (Moris 2009). U.S. data for total RDT trade have been available since 2001 from BEA's international transaction surveys.46\nIn 2007, total U.S. exports (affiliated and unaffiliated) of RDT services reached a record $14.7 billion, compared with record imports of $11.4 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $3.3 billion. Affiliated trade dominates these U.S. RDT statistics (table 4-21)--which is not surprising, given the large role of MNCs (including U.S. parents and foreign-owned companies) in R&D performance. (See \"R&D by Multinational\n\nCompanies.\") Affiliated trade in RDT has recorded between $4 billion and $4.5 billion in annual trade surpluses since 2001, compared with diminishing balances for unaffiliated trade (table 4-21). With affiliated transactions, U.S. trade surplus in RDT services is driven not by U.S. MNC parents but by the relatively high level of exports from U.S. affiliates of foreign MNCs to their foreign parents and other foreign affiliates of the parent companies (Moris 2009).\nNewly available country detail shows that 62.8% of U.S. RDT exports in 2007 were purchased by European businesses and another 12.2% by Japanese businesses (appendix table 4-41). European countries accounted for virtually the same share of RDT import transactions (62.1%) in 2007, whereas Japan accounted for 5.6%. Several emerging markets appear as sources of U.S. RDT imports, namely Israel (6.2%) and India (5.3%).\nInternational Technology Alliances Interfirm R&D alliances, partnerships, and networks add\nan element of R&D co-production compared with R&D contracts or technology licensing.47 R&D alliances may be defined as domestic or international cooperative arrangements that combine resources aimed at shared R&D objectives (Hagedoorn, Link, and Vonortas 2003).48 U.S. restrictions on multifirm cooperative research were loosened by the 1984 National Cooperative Research Act (Public Law 98462), followed by the 1993 National Cooperative Research and Production Act (NCPRA) (Public Law 103-42), as a way of addressing concerns about the technological leadership and international competitiveness of American firms in the early 1980s (Scott 2008).\nThis section features data from the Cooperative Agreements and Technology Indicators (CATI) database, which collects data on worldwide business technology partnerships.49 It is based on public announcements and includes business alliances with an R&D or technology component, such as joint research or development agreements, R&D contracts, and equity joint ventures. The database contains counts dating back to 1980.50\n\nTable 4-21 U.S. trade in research, development, and testing services: 2001\u00ad07\n(Millions of dollars)\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\nTrade balance\n\nYear\n\nTotal Affiliated Unaffiliated Total Affiliated Unaffiliated Total Affiliated Unaffiliated\n\n2001.......................... 2002.......................... 2003.......................... 2004.......................... 2005.......................... 2006.......................... 2007..........................\n\n7,610 8,678 9,467 9,563 10,431 12,821 14,698\n\n6,564 7,536 8,291 8,275 9,135 11,165 12,686\n\n1,046 1,142 1,176 1,288 1,296 1,655 2,012\n\n3,389 4,063 5,071 5,778 7,239 9,429 11,437\n\n2,664 3,035 3,761 3,816 4,950 6,726 8,364\n\n725 1,028 1,310 1,962 2,289 2,702 3,073\n\n4,221 4,615 4,396 3,785 3,192 3,392 3,261\n\n3,900 4,501 4,530 4,459 4,185 4,439 4,322\n\n321 114 \u00ad134 \u00ad674 \u00ad993 \u00ad1,047 \u00ad1,061\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. International Services, http://www.bea.gov/international/intlserv.htm, accessed 6 May 2009.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-53\n\nAccording to CATI, in 2006 (the latest available year), about 900 new worldwide business technology alliances were formed, approximately two-thirds of which involved at least one U.S.-owned company regardless of location.

Other areas include materials research and engineering, aerospace, automotive, and chemicals. In terms of ownership, the 2006 counts can be grouped into alliances involving only U.S.-owned companies (249), U.S. and foreign-owned companies (356), and only foreign-owned companies (293).\nSince 1999, the proportion of U.S.-foreign alliances annually has surpassed U.S.-only alliances, driven by rapid growth in U.S. alliances with European-owned companies (figure 4-23). The U.S.-Europe alliances increased 141% from 1990 to 2006, compared with about an 80% increase in U.S.-only alliances. The predominance of U.S. and European companies in CATI technology agreements is consistent with rankings of global R&D by major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, software, and automotive MNCs (UK DIUS 2008). At the same time, the number of U.S.-Japan alliances in 2006 (54) effectively reached parity with U.S. alliances with other Asia-Pacific countries (50), (reflecting the rapid growth of the latter since 1990, albeit from relatively low levels (figure 4-23). The 50 U.S. alliances with Asia-Pacific companies, excluding Japan, were driven by collaborative agreements with companies headquartered in India (15), China (12), and South Korea (11). This pattern reflects the increasing if still modest role of these countries as hosts for U.S.-owned R&D discussed earlier in this chapter. Of course, noting simple frequencies of international collaborative agreements is only a first step in tracking the economic and policy relevance for participating companies and their home and host countries (Bozeman and Dietz 2001; Siegel 2003).51\nFederal Technology Transfer and Other Innovation-Related Programs\nThis section reviews two sets of indicators on publicprivate collaboration supporting technology transfer and innovation (for academic patents and related knowledge diffusion indicators, see chapter 5).52 The first set includes federal programs for technology transfer from R&D funded and performed by government agencies and laboratories. The second set includes federal programs that support new or small U.S. companies in R&D or technology deployment activities with R&D funds or technical assistance.\nIn the late 1970s, concerns about the strength of U.S. industries and their ability to be competitive in the global economy intensified. Issues included the question of whether inventions from federally funded academic research were adequately exploited for the benefit of the national economy and the need to create or strengthen public-private R&D partnerships. Since the 1980s, several U.S. policies have facilitated cross-sector R&D collaboration and technology transfer. One major policy thrust was to enhance formal mechanisms for transferring knowledge arising from federally funded and performed R&D (Crow and Bozeman 1998; NRC 2003). Other policies addressed federally funded academic R&D, the transition of early-stage technologies into the marketplace, and R&D and innovation by small or minority-owned businesses. For a brief overview of these\n\n\f4-54 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nMajor Federal Legislation Related to Technology Transfer and Cooperative R&D\n\nTechnology Innovation Act of 1980 (StevensonWydler Act) (Public Law 96-480)--established technology transfer as a federal government mission by directing federal labs to facilitate the transfer of federally-owned and originated technology to nonfederal parties.\nUniversity and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act) (Public Law 96-517)--permitted small businesses, universities, and nonprofits to obtain titles to inventions developed with federal funds. Also permitted government-owned and governmentoperated laboratories to grant exclusive patent rights to commercial organizations.\nSmall Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-219)--established the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which required federal agencies to set aside funds for small businesses to engage in R&D connected to agency missions.\nNational Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-462)--encouraged U.S. firms to collaborate in generic precompetitive research by establishing a rule of reason for evaluating the antitrust implications of research joint ventures.\nPatent and Trademark Clarification Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-620)--provided further amendments to the Stevenson-Wydler Act and the Bayh-Dole Act regarding the use of patents and licenses to implement technology transfer.\nFederal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-502)--enabled federal laboratories to enter cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with outside parties and to negotiate licenses for patented inventions made at the laboratory.\nOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-418)--in addition to measures on trade and intellectual property protection, the act directed attention\n\nto public-private cooperation on R&D, technology transfer, and commercialization. It also established NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program.\nNational Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-189)--amended the Federal Technology Transfer Act to expand the use of CRADAs to include government-owned, contractor-operated federal laboratories and to increase nondisclosure provisions.\nNational Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-42)--relaxed restrictions on cooperative production activities, which enable research joint venture participants to work together in the application of technologies they jointly acquire.\nNational Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113)--amended the StevensonWydler Act to make CRADAs more attractive to federal laboratories, scientists, and private industry.\nTechnology Transfer Commercialization Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-404)--broadened CRADA licensing authority to make such agreements more attractive to private industry and increase the transfer of federal technology. Established procedures for performance reporting and monitoring by federal agencies on technology transfer activities.\nAmerica COMPETES Act of 2007 (America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Sciences [COMPETES] Act) (Public Law 110-69)--increased investment in R&D; strengthened educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school; and further developed the nation's innovation infrastructure. Among other measures, the act established NIST's Technology Innovation Program (TIP) and called for a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness.\n\ninitiatives, see the sidebar \"Major Federal Legislation Related to Technology Transfer and Cooperative R&D.\"\nFederal Technology Transfer Federal technology transfer refers to processes through\nwhich the knowledge and capabilities of federal intramural laboratories and other research facilities can be directed to the R&D needs of outside public or private organizations-- and through which the inventions and other intellectual assets arising from federal laboratory R&D can be conveyed to outside parties for development and commercialization (FLC 2006). Since the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980, all federal labs have been required to have technology transfer offices (Office of Research and Technology Applications [ORTA]) to assist in identifying transfer opportunities\n\nand establishing appropriate arrangements for relationships with external parties.53 Indicators on these activities illustrate a diverse range of mechanisms used in federal technology transfer.54 For background information, see the sidebar \"Federal Technology Transfer: Activities and Metrics.\"\nTable 4-22 shows total technology transfer activity statistics for FY 2007, as well as statistics for six agencies that account for the majority of this activity. In 2007, federal laboratories participated in 7,327 cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with businesses and organizations, compared with 7,271 in 2006 and 5,949 in 2005 (appendix table 4-43). Federal labs also participated in 9,445 non-CRADA collaborative R&D relationships in 2007. Agencies issued more than 1,400 patents in 2007 and held 10,347 active licenses, including just below 4,000\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-55\n\nFederal Technology Transfer: Activities and Metrics\n\nFederal technology transfer can take a variety of forms (FLC 2006), including the following:\n Commercial transfer. Movement of knowledge or technology is developed by a federal lab and transferred to private organizations in the commercial marketplace.\n Scientific dissemination. Publications, conference papers, and working papers are distributed, and other forms of data dissemination are employed.\n Export of resources. Federal lab personnel are made available to outside organizations with R&D needs through collaborative agreements or other service mechanisms.\n Import of resources. The federal lab brings in outside technology or expertise to enhance the lab's existing capabilities.\n Dual use. Technologies, products, or families of products with both commercial and federal applications are developed.\nMost federal labs engage in all of these forms of technology transfer to some extent. The emphases and relative levels of each vary widely across the federal agencies, depending on the parent agency's mission, the lab's main areas of scientific and technological interest, typical clients, prevailing scientific/technical culture, and any special transfer authorities the agency may have been granted. For some agencies and their labs, the principal\n\ntechnology transfer thrust is patents, patent licenses, and material transfer agreements. Others emphasize traditional public dissemination of new scientific or technical knowledge and cooperative R&D relationships with outside organizations--with patenting and licensing activity taking place only when it is determined that private-sector investment in a new technology is needed to achieve development and commercialization goals.\nSeveral metrics illustrate activities and agency priorities among three main classes of mechanisms. The invention disclosure and patenting category involves counts of invention disclosures filed (typically, an inventing scientist or engineer filing a written notice of the invention with the lab's technology transfer office), patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or abroad), and patent awards received. The licensing category covers federal lab licensing of federal intellectual property, such as patents or copyrights, to outside parties to enable further development and commercialization, usually through the technology transfer office. For example, in recent years, DOE's government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories have increasingly used their special authority to transfer software technology through relatively quickly executed copyright license mechanisms. The third main category is collaborative relationships for R&D, including CRADAs.\n\nTable 4-22 Federal laboratory technology transfer activity indicators, by selected U.S. agency: FY 2007\n\nTechnology transfer activity indicator\n\nTotal\n\nDOD\n\nHHS\n\nDOE\n\nNASA\n\nUSDA\n\nDOC\n\nInvention disclosures and patenting Inventions disclosed ..............................

These programs include the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, the Technology Innovation Program (TIP), and the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). The first three programs provide early-stage technology financing, whereas the last one provides technical assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers.\nThe SBIR program was created by the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982. According to the SBIR statute, federal agencies with extramural R&D obligations exceeding $100 million must set aside a fixed percentage of such obligations for projects involving small business (those with 500 or fewer employees). This set-aside has been 2.5% since FY 1997. The program has multiple objectives, namely stimulating technological innovation, fostering the use of small business to meet federal R&D needs, encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing private-sector commercialization of innovation derived from federal R&D. SBIR's sister program, the STTR program, was created in 1992 to stimulate cooperative R&D and technology transfer involving small businesses and nonprofit organizations, including universities and FFRDCs. Both of these programs are coordinated by the Small Business Administration (SBA). In FY 2007, SBIR and STTR combined awarded $2.3 billion (SBA 2009).55\n\nIn FY 2006, 11 federal agencies awarded a total of $1.9 billion to about 5,900 SBIR projects (appendix tables 4-44 and 4-45). Funded technology areas include computers and electronics, information services, materials, energy, and life science applications. DOD represented just below 50% of total SBIR funds, whereas HHS represented 30%, consistent with its large extramural R&D budgets.\nThe SBIR program is structured in three phases. Phase I evaluates the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas. Phase II builds on phase I findings, is subject to further scientific and technical review, and requires a commercialization plan (NRC 2008). During phase III, the results from phase II R&D are further developed and introduced into private markets or federal procurement using private or non-SBIR federal funding.56 Over the life of the program, the share of phase II funding has increased from about twothirds in the mid-1980s to more than three-fourths (figure 4-24). Bridge funding and other support for startups beyond phase II were found to be critical for successful commercialization by a recent NRC study (NRC 2008, p 209). Some agencies have implemented \"phase IIB\" or \"phase II+\" matching funds and/or technical and business support for qualified awardees (NRC 2008, pp 209\u00ad16).\nThe STTR program is also structured in three phases and involves R&D performed jointly by small businesses and nonprofit research organizations. Federal agencies with extramural R&D budgets exceeding $1 billion participate in the STTR program. Starting in FY 2004, the required setaside doubled to 0.3%, compared with the 2.5% set-aside for SBIR. In FY 2006, DHS participated for the first time, along with DOD, NSF, DOE, NASA, and HHS. From FY 1994 to 2006, STTR awarded $1.3 billion to about 6,000 projects, including $226 million to 878 projects in FY 2006 (appendix tables 4-44 and 4-46).\n\nFigure 4-24 :)09 M\\UKPUN I` [`WL!  \u00b6\nDollars (millions)\n\n  \n\n7OHZL 00 7OHZL 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 \n\n      \n\nSBIR = Small Business Innovation Research Program SOURCE: Small Business Administration, Small Business Innovation Research Program Annual Report (various years). See appendix table 4-45.\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-57\n\nAccording to SBA, small businesses interested in participating in the STTR program must find a research institution that meets the program's definition and develop a working agreement before competing for an STTR award. Universities are active as STTR partners. For example, in FY 2004, at least 200 universities, many with multiple awardees, partnered with small companies under STTR; 15 FFRDCs also collaborated with awardees (SBA 2005).\nEstablished by the America COMPETES Act of 2007 and administered by NIST,57 TIP was set up for \"the purpose of assisting U.S. businesses and institutions of higher education or other organizations, such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutions, to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.\"58 The new program replaces the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). From FY 1990 to 2007, ATP awarded funds for 824 projects with a combined funding of $4.6 billion, about equally split between the program and its participants (appendix table 4-47). The first TIP competition focused on advanced sensors to support monitoring and assessment of civil infrastructure, such as water pipelines, roads, bridges, and tunnels (appendix table 4-48).\nA national system of affiliated manufacturing extension centers, MEP is also housed at NIST. It was established by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 to enhance the productivity and technological performance of small and medium-sized U.S. manufacturers (15 U.S.C. 278(k)).\nMEP centers receive federal funding on a competitive basis for their development and operations. Nonfederal funding is required for 50% or more of the centers' capital and annual operating funds. Companies receive technical and managerial assistance, generally on a reimbursable basis, but receive no direct federal funding (Schacht 2008). Federal funding for MEP reached $106.8 million in FY 2007 and $91 million in FY 2008 (appendix table 4-49). Activities included technology deployment and technical services involving advanced manufacturing systems and engineering services, as well as business services such as management and strategy development, marketing, and training. For nontechnical services, MEP centers generally partner with commercial and academic consultants and government agencies (Shapira 2001, pp 983\u00ad84).59\nConclusion\nU.S. spending on R&D reached an estimated $397.6 billion in 2008, a 6.7% increase (or 4.5% in inflation-adjusted dollars) from the 2007 total. This 2008 figure is preliminary, however, and may not fully reflect the effects of the downturn in U.S. and worldwide economic conditions that took place in the latter half of the year.\nIn 2008, businesses performed an estimated $289.1 billion (current dollars), or 73%, of the total U.S. R&D. The academic sector is the second-largest performer of U.S. R&D, with estimated expenditures of $51.2 billion, or just below 13% of the U.S. total. Federal agencies, their laboratories,\n\nand FFRDCs accounted for an estimated $41.7 billion, or about 11% of the total. Nonprofit organizations performed the remainder, $15.6 billion, or about 4%.\nBusiness and the federal government are the two largest sources of R&D funding. The business sector provided an estimated $267.8 billion (current dollars) of funding for R&D in 2008, 67% of the U.S. total. The federal government funded an estimated $103.7 billion of R&D, or 26% of the total. Over the past 5 years, expanded business spending on R&D has accounted for much of the growth (in both current and real-dollar terms) in total U.S. R&D spending. Federal funding overall has been flat or declining on a real-dollar basis. At the time of this writing, the impact of the current economic slowdown in U.S. R&D expenditures remains uncertain.\nHistorically, the federal government has been the prime source of funding for basic research, accounting for an estimated 57% of the nation's total in 2008. Moreover, in the same year, the federal government funded 61% of the basic research performed by universities and colleges, the nation's largest performers of basic research.\nThe budget appropriations for federal spending on R&D in FY 2009 totaled $147.1 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion, or 2.4%, over the FY 2008 spending level. The president's proposed budget for FY 2010 requests federal R&D spending of $147.6 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 0.4%, over the appropriated FY 2009 level. Furthermore, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, enacted in early 2009, provided a one-time increase in funding for federal R&D and R&D infrastructure, estimated to total $18.3 billion in FY 2009.\nGlobally, R&D expenditures totaled an estimated $1,107 billion in 2007, the most recent year for which internationally comparable data are available. R&D is concentrated regionally in North America (35%), Asia (31%), and Europe (28%) and is further concentrated within a relatively few countries. According to OECD statistics, the United States (with 33% of the world total) and Japan (13%) account for almost half of global R&D. That figure increases to two-thirds by adding the next three countries on the list, China (9%), Germany (6%), and France (4%). Adding South Korea, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, Canada, and Italy completes the top 10 countries, accounting for about 80% of global R&D.\nChina, which ranks third globally in R&D spending, continues to exhibit the most dramatic growth pattern. Its real R&D growth over the past decade has averaged just over 19% annually. Both India and Brazil also are among the world's larger and faster-growing R&D performers, according to UNESCO statistics. India performed about $15 billion of R&D in 2004, and Brazil about $13 billion in 2005 (both figures are the most recent available data). The totals reported for both countries are about double the levels of R&D performance each reported in the mid-1990s. Comparability of these figures to the OECD statistics is unclear, but such levels of R&D expenditures would rank both India and Brazil among the world's top 15 R&D-performing nations.\n\n\f4-58 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nAnother dimension of the international character of R&D performance is the activities by U.S. MNCs overseas. More than 85% of annual global R&D expenditures by U.S. MNCs are made in the United States ($187.8 billion of $216.3 billion in 2006); however, the geographic distribution of R&D expenditures outside the United States by the overseas affiliates of U.S. MNCs ($28.5 billion in 2006) is gradually shifting to reflect the role of emerging markets. In particular, major developed economies or regions (Canada, Japan, and Europe) account for a decreasing share of the overseas R&D investments of U.S. MNCs, declining from 90% in 1994 to 80% in 2006. Over the same period, the share of the Asia region (excluding Japan) more than doubled, from 5.4% to 13.5%, driven by the R&D spending of U.S.-owned affiliates in China, Singapore, and South Korea. Among individual countries, R&D performed by U.S.-owned affiliates in China and India increased from less than $10 million in each country in 1994 to $804 million and $310 million, respectively, in 2006. The 2006 levels for China and India represented about 3% and 1%, respectively, of total overseas R&D by U.S. MNCs.\nThe increasing role of services and international collaboration in R&D and innovation is reflected in statistics on trade in R&D services. In 2007, total U.S. exports of research, development, and testing services reached a record $14.7 billion, compared with record imports of $11.4 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $3.3 billion. Trade within MNCs dominates these statistics--which is not surprising, given the significant role of MNCs in R&D performance.\nRapid changes in the collaborative and global nature of R&D and the increasing role of services and nontechnological innovation call for continuous enhancements in the indicators of these activities and their impact. U.S. federal statistical agencies continue to collaborate domestically and internationally to facilitate improved and comparable data. Ongoing U.S. data development projects featured in this chapter include the new Business R&D and Innovation Survey, the R&D NIPA satellite account, exploratory work on intangibles and innovation accounts, and efforts in the area of research data infrastructure by NSF's Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program.\nNotes\n1. As financial input indicators, statistics on expenditures in and of themselves do not indicate the extent to which R&D efforts are effective or successful.\n2. Adjustments for inflation reported in this chapter are based on the GDP implicit price deflator. GDP deflators are calculated on an economy-wide rather than an R&D-specific basis. As such, they should be interpreted as measures of real resources engaged in R&D rather than in other activities, such as consumption or physical investment. They are not a measure of cost changes in performing research. See appendix table 4-1 for GDP deflators used in this chapter.\n\n3. FFRDCs are R&D-performing organizations that are exclusively or substantially financed by the federal government. They operate to provide R&D capability to serve agency mission objectives or, in some cases, to provide major facilities at universities for research and associated training purposes. Each FFRDC is administered by an industrial firm, a university, a nonprofit institution, or a consortium.\n4. The topic of R&D categories is also part of ongoing survey redesign and methodological studies in the United States and internationally.\n5. The OECD notes that in measuring R&D, the greatest source of error often is the difficulty of locating the cutoff point between experimental development and the related activities required to realize an innovation (OECD 2002, paragraph 111). Most definitions of R&D set the cutoff at the point when a particular product or process reaches \"market readiness.\" At this point, the defining characteristics of the product or process are substantially set (at least for manufacturers if not also for services), and further work is primarily aimed at developing markets, engaging in preproduction planning, and streamlining the production or control system.\n6. The latest data available on the distribution of U.S. R&D performance by state are for 2007. All U.S. R&D expenditures that year were estimated at $372.5 billion. Of this total, $359.7 billion could be attributed to expenditures in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The state-attributed totals differ from the U.S. total for a number of reasons: some industry R&D expenditures cannot be allocated to any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia because respondents did not answer the question related to location; nonfederal sources of nonprofit R&D expenditures (an estimated $8.4 billion in 2007) could not be allocated by state; state-level university R&D data have not been adjusted for double-counting of R&D passed from one academic institution to another; state agency intramural R&D (collected by NSF starting in 2006 [see NSF/SRS 2008a]) are not included in the U.S. total; and state-level university and federal R&D performance data are not converted from fiscal to calendar years.\n7. Federal intramural R&D includes costs associated with the administration of intramural and extramural programs by federal personnel, as well as actual intramural R&D performance. This explains the large amount of federal intramural R&D reported for the District of Columbia.\n8. For most manufacturing industries, the Small Business Administration has established a size threshold of 500 employees to define small companies. The NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development does not sample companies with fewer than five employees because of concerns about respondent burden.\n9. These estimates were derived from the NSF-Census Bureau's annual Survey of Industrial Research and Development, which collects financial data related to R&D activities from companies performing R&D in the United States. These data provide a basis for analyzing R&D investment of the business sector and are the official source for U.S. busi-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-59\n\nness R&D estimates. (See sidebar \"New U.S. Business R&D and Innovation Survey.\")\n10. A similar measure of R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D to value-added (gross output minus cost of intermediate inputs). Value-added is often used in studies of productivity because it allows analysts to focus on the economic output attributable to the specific industrial sector in question by subtracting inputs produced in other sectors.\n11. Industry-level analyses are complicated by the fact that each company's R&D is reported in only one industry.\n12. In the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the utility industry comprises establishments engaged in the provision of electric power, natural gas, steam, and water, as well as the removal of sewage. Establishments that provide telephone and other communication services are included in other NAICS industries.\n13. Because federal R&D funding is concentrated among a few companies in a small number of industries, the potential for disclosing information about a particular company is high; therefore, these data are often suppressed. This situation prevents the precise tabulation of total R&D performance and the calculation of R&D-to-net-sales ratios for many industries.\n14. For a recent study on the role of service industries in R&D and innovation, see Gallaher, Link, and Petrusa (2006).\n15. Methodological differences between the PhRMA Annual Membership Survey and the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development make it difficult to directly compare estimates from the two surveys. For example, the PhRMA survey definition of R&D includes phase IV clinical trials (trials conducted after a drug is licensed and available for doctors to prescribe), whereas the NSF survey definition does not. In addition, NSF survey sales data may contain income from sources not related to the production of drugs and medicines.\n16. In NSF's Survey of Industrial Research and Development, companies that predominantly license their technology rather than manufacture finished products are often classified in the scientific R&D service industry. Therefore, a sizable amount of biotechnology R&D that serves the pharmaceutical industry is reported in the R&D service sector. (See \"R&D and Related Services.\")\n17. Data for computer and electronic product manufacturing in this section refer to NAICS 334 except the federally funded R&D component of navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments industry (NAICS 3345), which is included in aerospace and defense manufacturing.\n18. Suppression of federal R&D funding information prohibits the precise tabulation of total R&D performance for some industries. Lower-bound analyst estimates are given in cases where the potential disclosure of company-reported data or classification issues prevents the publication of total estimates from survey data.\n19. The introduction of a more refined industry classification scheme in 1999 allowed more detailed reporting in nonmanufacturing industries. For the cited statistics, the R&D\n\nexpenditures of companies in the software, other information, and computer system design and related service industries were combined. These three industries provided the closest approximation to the broader category cited for earlier years without exceeding the coverage of the broader category.\n20. NAICS-based R&D estimates are available only to 1997. Estimates for 1997 and 1998 were bridged from a different industry classification scheme. Total R&D for this sector has grown from $9.2 billion in 1997 to $16.0 billion in 2007.\n21. Although companies in the R&D and related-services sector and their R&D activities are classified as nonmanufacturing, they serve many manufacturing industries. For example, many biotechnology companies in this sector license their technology to companies in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The R&D of a research firm that is a subsidiary of a manufacturing company rather than an independent contractor would be classified as R&D in a manufacturing industry. Consequently, growth in R&D services may, in part, reflect a more general pattern of industry's increasing reliance on outsourcing and contract R&D. For a related discussion, see \"Technology and Innovation Linkages.\"\n22. Because R&D expenses reported on financial documents differ from the data reported on the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development, direct comparisons of these sources are not possible. For an explanation of the differences between the two, see Shepherd and Payson (1999).\n23. Support for private R&D can be studied along several dimensions, including the immediate effect in stimulating R&D relative to costs (e.g., tax expenditures [forgone public revenues]) and administrative expenses), longer-term impacts (e.g., growth and employment), and relationship to other policy tools. See Atkinson (2007) and Tassey (2007) for recent discussions on the U.S. tax credit, Wilson (forthcoming) and Wu (2004) for empirical studies on state R&D credits, and Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen (2002) and OECD (2003) for country-level empirical studies on the effectiveness of R&D tax credits.\n24. Tax incentives include tax allowances, exemptions, or deductions (reductions in taxable income) and tax credits (reductions in tax liability). Each of these tax incentives may be designed with different features, such as eligibility criteria, allowable expenses, and level versus incremental bases (OECD 2003).\n25. H.R.1424, Public Law No. 110-343 (Division C, Title III, Section 301).\n26. Qualified R&D costs include company-funded expenses for wages paid, supplies used in the conduct of qualified research, and certain contract expenses. For tax purposes, R&D expenses are restricted to the somewhat narrower concept of R&E expenditures. Qualified expenses must satisfy tests involving the experimental and technological nature of activities (26 CFR 1.41-2). Research in the social sciences or humanities is excluded. See NSF/SRS (2006) for details.\n27. One of two forms of alternative credit formulas may be used in lieu of regular credit provisions: an alternative\n\n\f4-60 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nincremental R&E tax credit (AIRC), enacted in 1996, and a simplified alternative credit (ASIC), established in 2006. Companies may select only one of these three credit types on a permanent basis unless the IRS authorizes a change. The 2008 bill extending the overall R&E credit increased the statutory rate for the ASIC from 12% to 14% and repealed the AIRC for the 2009 tax year only (Guenther 2008).\n28. The target population for SOI's corporate statistics consists of returns of active corporations required to file one of nine 1120 IRS tax forms, where corporations refers to for-profit corporations, joint-stock companies, and certain unincorporated associations. Estimates on corporate tax statistics are based on a stratified probability sample of unaudited active returns. Active returns include returns having current income or deductions. IRS data are for tax years, which cover accounting periods ending any month between July of the calendar year of reference through June of the following calendar year. Estimates are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. For SOI statistical methodology, see section 3 in IRS (2009).\n29. Actual credit amounts are lower than claims because of limits on overall or general business credits. Corporations requesting the R&E credit must complete IRS Form 6765 (the latest form is available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/ f6765.pdf). SOI tax credit estimates reported in this section cover only C corporations. In particular, data excludes passthrough entities (those that pay little or no federal income tax at the corporate level but are instead required by law to pass any profits or losses to their shareholders, where they are taxed at the individual rate) such as S corporations (IRS form 1120S), real estate investment trusts (1120-REIT), and regulated investment companies (1120-RIC).\n30. See figure C in http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/ 0,,id=164402,00.html (accessed 19 June 2009). This source also has data by type of R&E credit and related IRS/SOI publications.\n31. See appendix table 4-12. Although both IRS and NSF/ Census statistics use NAICS as the underlying industry classification system, comparisons of R&D-related estimates at the industry level are problematic because of differences in classification and company consolidation procedures. For example, industry codes for tax purposes are based on gross receipts, whereas the classification in the NSF/Census survey is based on dollar payrolls.\n32. Accordingly, the business share of R&D funding for the United States in table 4-14 is overstated--specifically in comparison with the business-sector shares for countries where foreign sources of R&D funding are reported separately from domestic sources. R&D investments by foreign MNCs (discussed later in this chapter) provide an indication of international participation in U.S. business R&D. However, foreign ownership does not necessarily imply foreign funding, given that an affiliate may fund activities through domestic sources.\n33. For discussions of R&D diversity measurement, see Archibugi and Pianta (1992, 1996).\n\n34. Some analysts argue that the low nondefense GBAORD share for economic development in the United States reflects the expectation that businesses will finance industrial R&D activities with their own funds. Moreover, government R&D that may be useful to industry is often funded with other purposes in mind, such as defense and space, and is therefore classified under other socioeconomic objectives.\n35. For international intra-MNC transactions in R&D services, see \"Technology and Innovation Linkages.\" See chapter 3 for MNC R&D employment and chapter 6 for FDI financial flows.\n36. Western Europe and Asia have also attracted the majority of FDI financial flows by U.S. MNCs (Sethi et al. 2003).\n37. For these data, the United States includes the 50 states; Washington, DC; Puerto Rico; and all U.S. territories and possessions.\n38. BEA defines a parent company of a U.S. MNC as an entity (individual, branch, partnership, or corporation), resident in the United States, that owns or controls at least 10% of the voting securities, or equivalent, of a foreign business enterprise. Data are for nonbank U.S. MNC parent companies. Affiliate data cover majority-owned, nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents. For selected NSF data on overseas R&D funded by companies with R&D activities in the 50 states and Washington, DC, see appendix tables 4-37 and 4-38.\n39. Data on parents' R&D for 2004 and later are not fully comparable with earlier data because of improvements in statistical coverage. The improvements resulted from comprehensive information on parent R&D activities obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis 2004 Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad and from new information obtained through an ongoing interagency statistical project (see NSF/SRS [2007b]).\n40. In comparison, the share of value-added (gross product) by affiliates located in Europe was 54.3% in 2006. Affiliates in the United Kingdom and Germany also reported the largest value-added figures over this period (BEA 2009).\n41. See \"International R&D Comparisons.\" 42. See Branstetter and Foley (2007, pp 15\u00ad21), NSF/ SRS (2004), OECD (2008d), and von Zedtwitz, (2004) for FDI R&D and technology alliances in China. For information on India and other emerging markets, see Arora and Gambardella (2004) and NRC (2007a). 43. Outside organizations include independent companies, universities, nonprofit organizations, and government, but the majority of this R&D is performed by companies. See appendix table 4-40 for industry-specific data. 44. Data are for R&D contract expenditures paid by U.S. industrial R&D performers (using company and other nonfederal R&D funds) to other domestic performers. In this section, contract R&D refers to a transaction with external parties involving R&D payments or income, regardless of its legal form. Transactions by companies that do not perform\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 4-61\n\ninternal R&D in the United States are excluded, as are R&D activities contracted out to companies located overseas.\n45. Company-funded is shorthand for \"company and other nonfederal.\"\n46. RDT is part of the larger category of business, professional, and technical services. RDT services include commercial and noncommercial research as well as product development and testing services. The latter component includes non-R&D testing services. RDT covers services by all companies regardless of industry classification, not just activities of companies or establishments classified in NAICS 5417. Starting with 2006 data, new BEA survey forms BE120 (benchmark) and BE-125 (quarterly) collect both affiliated and unaffiliated transactions. For further methodological information, see http://www.bea.gov/surveys/iussurv.htm.\n47. In practice, these activities may be part of a given business arrangement or innovation project. Furthermore, technology alliances may or may not be part of larger agreements involving manufacturing, marketing, and other business functions.\n48. Drivers for R&D collaboration include reduction in costs and/or time to market, sharing of instrumentation and other infrastructure, technology diversification (exploration and experimentation across multiple technology platforms), and long-term learning (Cantwell, Gambardella, and Granstrand 2004; Ozman 2009). The policy environment, especially antitrust regulation and intellectual property protection, is also critical to the incidence of these drivers and their economy-wide impact (Scott 2008).\n49. For data from the Cooperative Research (CORE) database, based on Department of Justice registrations required by NCRPA, see NSF/SRS (2006, p 4-34).\n50. CATI is a literature-based database that draws on sources such as newspapers, journal articles, books, and specialized journals that report on business events. Agreements involving small or startup firms are likely to be underrepresented. Another limitation is that the database draws primarily from English-language materials. Data on alliance structure, size, duration, or outputs are not available. For studies combining CATI and other data sources, see papers and references in Hagedoorn, Link, and Vonortas (2003).\n51. For an overview of indicator development in this area, see Jankowski, Link, and Vonortas (2001) and Hagedoorn, Link, and Vonortas (2003).\n52. Science or research parks, another example of publicprivate collaboration, may facilitate knowledge diffusion, technology development and deployment, and entrepreneurship by involving universities, government laboratories, and business startups. Two recent U.S. workshops focused on science parks. A December 2007 NSF workshop was aimed at fostering a better understanding and measurement of science parks' activities, including the role of science parks in the national innovation system. Participants identified a need for systematic studies on topics such as the social benefits of public investment in science parks, ways in which the university\u00adscience park interaction engenders entrepreneurial\n\nactivity, and lessons that U.S. science parks can learn from comparative studies with European and Asian parks. For material from this workshop, see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ workshop/sciencepark07. A subsequent workshop sponsored by the National Academies explored international models and best practices in science parks (NRC 2009). See also PCAST (2008) and chapters 8 and 9 in Link and Siegel (2007).\n53. Federal agencies frequently cited in government reports on federal technology transfer include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Data include both federal intramural laboratories and FFRDCs.\n54. Notably missing among these indicators are technical articles published in professional journals, conference papers, and other kinds of scientific communications; however, few labs regularly tabulate and report this information.\n55. FY 2007 figures are preliminary. As this volume was going to press, the House and Senate agreed to the latest in a series of short-term extensions of these programs.\n56. To obtain federal funding under this program, a small company applies for a phase I SBIR grant of up to $100,000 for up to 6 months to assess the scientific and technical feasibility of ideas with commercial potential. If the concept shows further potential, the company may receive a phase II grant of up to $750,000 over a period of up to 2 years for further development.\n57. See Section 3012 of the America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110-69), enacted 9 August 2007. Final rules prescribing TIP procedures were released 25 June 2008 (15 C.F.R. Part 296). The first competition was announced in July 2008, and the first awards were made in January 2009.\n58. Public Law 110-69, Section 3012. 59. For example, beginning in 2006, MEP began collaborating to connect small manufacturers with trade promotion specialists of DOC's International Trade Administration and its export assistance centers in specific industry sectors, such as machinery and microelectronics (GAO 2007, p 20). For MEP impact studies, see http://blue.nist.gov/sshome.\nGlossary\nAffiliate: A company or business enterprise located in one country but owned or controlled (in terms of 10% or more of voting securities or equivalent) by a parent company in another country; may be either incorporated or unincorporated.\nApplied research: The objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need. In industry, applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services.\n\n\f4-62 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nBasic research: The objective of basic research is to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without specific applications in mind.

Academic Research and Development\n\nHighlights\n\nFinancial Resources for Academic R&D\nIn 2008, U.S. academic institutions spent $52 billion on R&D, and the higher education sector continues to account for the majority of basic research performed in the United States.\n Academic performers are estimated to account for 55% of U.S. basic research ($69 billion), 31% of total (basic plus applied) research ($157 billion), and 13% of all R&D ($395 billion) estimated to have been conducted in the United States in 2008.\n Higher education's share of total U.S. research expenditures increased by 11 percentage points between 1982 and 2002 (from 24% to 35%), but has since declined to an estimated 31% in 2008.\nSupport from the federal government decreased in recent years with no funding growth for 3 straight years.\n The federal government provided 60% ($31.2 billion) of funding for academic R&D expenditures in 2008. In inflation-adjusted dollars, this represents a 0.2% increase from FY 2007 and follows decreases of 1.6% in FY 2007 and 0.2% in FY 2006.\n According to the federal agencies providing the funding, total federal obligations for academic R&D peaked in 2004 at $22.1 billion (in constant 2000 dollars) and have since declined by almost 7% to an estimated $20.7 billion in FY 2009.\nHigher education R&D funding from all nonfederal sources combined has grown steadily since FY 2004.\n The share of support provided by institutional funds increased steadily between 1972 (12%) and 1991 (19%) but since then has remained fairly stable at roughly one-fifth of total funding.\n After a 3-year decline between 2001 and 2004 (low of $2.1 billion), industry funding of academic R&D increased for the fourth year in a row, to $2.9 billion in 2008.\nThe distribution of academic R&D expenditures across the various broad S&E fields has remained relatively constant since 1990, with the life sciences receiving the most funding.\n In 2008, the life sciences continued to receive the largest share of investment in academic R&D, accounting for roughly 60% of all expenditures.\n Over the past two decades, the broad field of life sciences was the only field to experience any meaningful increase in its share of total academic R&D, rising more than 4 percentage points since 1998.\n\nIn 2008, about $1.9 billion was spent for academic research equipment. This represents a real increase of 1.0% from FY 2007, but a decline of more than 10% from the 2004 level.\n About 80% of FY 2008 equipment expenditures were concentrated in three fields: the life sciences (43%), engineering (23%), and the physical sciences (16%).\n After a period of steady growth between 2001 and 2004, equipment expenditures in the physical sciences, medical and biological sciences, and engineering have all declined since 2005.\nAcademic R&D Infrastructure\nResearch-performing colleges and universities continued to expand their physical resources for conducting research. However, while cyberinfrastructure capabilities continued to expand significantly, the expansion of traditional \"bricks and mortar\" infrastructure slowed.\n A large majority of institutions now have connections to high-speed networks; 25% of institutions have more than one connection.\n By FY 2007, 74% of all institutions had internal network distribution speeds of at least 1 gigabit.\n For the first time in 20 years, almost half of all S&E fields experienced a decline in their research space.\nDoctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia\nThe size of the doctoral academic S&E workforce reached an estimated 272,800 in 2006 but grew more slowly than the number of S&E doctorate holders in other employment sectors from 1973 to 2006. Full-time faculty positions, although still the predominant type of employment, increased more slowly than postdoc and other full- and part-time positions, especially at research universities.\n The share of all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia dropped from 55% in 1973 to 45% in 1991 and has remained at about that level through 2006.\n Among S&E doctorate holders in academia, full-time faculty declined continually from 88% in the early 1970s to 72% in 2006.\n Postdocs and others in full-time nonfaculty positions constitute an increasing percentage of academic S&E employment, having grown from 10% in 1973 to 22% in 2006. This change was especially pronounced in the 1990s.\n The share of part-time positions was roughly 2% to 4% from 1973 through 1999, but has risen since then to 6% in 2006.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-5\n\nThe number of academic S&E doctorate holders reporting research as their primary or secondary work activity showed greater growth from 1973 to 2006 than the number reporting teaching as their primary or secondary activity.\n The number of researchers grew 2.5% per year (from 82,300 to 183,700) between 1973 and 2006, and the number of teachers grew 1.7% per year (from 94,900 to 163,300).\n About two-thirds of doctoral scientists and engineers employed in academic institutions are engaged in research as either a primary or secondary work activity.\nLife scientists accounted for more than one-third of academic doctorate holders reporting research as a primary or secondary work activity in 2006. Life scientists also accounted for most of the growth in academic researchers.\n The number of academic researchers in the physical sciences and mathematics grew more slowly, at average annual growth rates of 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively, from 1973 to 2006. Growth rates for academic researchers in all fields were greatest in the 1980s.\n The number of full-time faculty in the life sciences has risen, but the percentage of full-time faculty in the life sciences who are tenured or on the tenure track has declined because the number of tenured and tenure-track life scientists has remained fairly stable since the late 1980s.\nThe demographic composition of academic researchers changed substantially between 1973 and 2006.\n Women increased from 6% to 29% of full-time doctoral S&E research faculty from 1973 to 2006.\n Underrepresented minorities (blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) increased from about 2% to about 8% of full-time doctoral S&E research faculty.\n The Asian/Pacific Islander share of full-time doctoral S&E research faculty increased substantially, from 4% to 13%.\n The share of whites among full-time doctoral S&E research faculty fell from 92% to 79% during the period.\nIn most fields, the percentage of full-time doctoral S&E faculty with federal support for their work was about the same in 2006 as it was in the late 1980s.\n A little less than half (46%) of full-time doctoral S&E faculty received federal support in both 1987 and in 2006.\n Among full-time faculty, recent doctorate recipients were less likely to receive federal support than their more established colleagues.\n\nOutputs of Academic S&E Research: Articles and Patents\nS&E article output worldwide grew at an average annual rate of 2.5% between 1995 and 2007. The U.S. growth rate was much lower, at 0.7%.\n The United States accounted for 28% of the world total S&E articles in 2007, down from 34% in 1995. The share of the European Union also declined, from 35% in 1995 to 32% in 2007.\n In Asia, average annual growth rates were high--for example, 17% in China and 14% in South Korea. As a result, in 2007 China moved past the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan to rank as the world's 2nd-largest producer, up from 5th place in 2005 and 14th place in 1995.\nThe research portfolios of the top article-producing countries, as indicated by publication of S&E articles, varied widely. China, Japan, and eight other Asian countries (the \"Asia-8\") emphasized the physical sciences more than the United States and the European Union.\n In 2007, S&E research articles in chemistry and physics accounted for just under one-half of China's total article production, 36% of Japan's, and 37% of the Asia8's. These two fields accounted for 17% of the total for the United States and 25% of the total for the European Union.\n Articles in the life sciences (biological, medical, agricultural, and related sciences) accounted for 57% of all U.S. S&E articles, compared with 49% for the European Union, 25% for China, 45% for Japan, and 34% for the Asia-8.\n Country research portfolios also differed in their emphasis on engineering, with the Asian countries more heavily concentrated in this broad field (China at 16%, Japan at 11%, and the Asia-8 at 19%) than the U.S. or the European Union (7%\u00ad8%).\nS&E research articles continue to indicate increasing collaboration across institutions in the United States and internationally.\n Coauthored articles grew from 40% of the world's total S&E articles in 1988 to 64% in 2008. Coauthored articles listing only authors from different institutions in the same country increased from 32% of all articles in 1988 to 42% in 2008. Articles listing authors from institutions in more than one country grew from 8% to 22% over the same period.\n Within-sector coauthorship increased in all U.S. sectors, growing, for example, from 38% of academic S&E article output in 1998 to 45% in 2008. Cross-sector coauthorship increased generally, mainly due to an increase of 7\u00ad10 percentage points in each nonacademic sector's coauthor-\n\n\f5-6 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nship with academia. U.S. sector coauthorship with foreign authors grew in all sectors by 7\u00ad10 percentage points.\nThe U.S. share of world article output and article citations has declined but not the influence of U.S. research articles, as indicated by the percentage of U.S. articles that are among the most highly cited worldwide.\n Between 1998 and 2008, the U.S. share of world articles declined from 34% in 1998 to 29% in 2008, while its share of total citations in S&E articles declined from 47% to 38%. Over the same period, China's share of publications increased from 2% to 6%, and its share of citations from 1% to 4%.\n The percentage of U.S.-authored S&E articles receiving the highest number of citations--an indicator of research quality and high impact on subsequent research--has changed little. Between 1998 and 2008, the U.S. index of highly cited articles declined from 1.83 to 1.78 and remained well above the expected index value of 1. Indexes\n\nof the European Union, China, Japan, and the Asia-8 all increased but remained below 1.\nIndicators of academic patenting are mixed. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data show that patent grants to U.S. universities declined to about 3,000 in 2008. Other indicators relating to academic patenting suggest increasing activity.\n According to USPTO data, patent grants to universities and colleges increased sharply from 1988 to about 1999, when they peaked at just under 3,700 patents, and then fell to about 3,000 in 2008. Three technology areas have dominated these patent awards (chemistry, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals), accounting for 45% of the total patents awarded to U.S. universities in 2008.\n Data from another source show that invention disclosures filed with university technology management offices grew from 13,700 in 2003 to 17,700 in 2007 and that patent applications filed by reporting universities and colleges increased from 7,200 in 2003 to almost 11,000 in 2007.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-7\n\nIntroduction\nAmerica's academic institutions play a pivotal role in the U.S. system for conducting R&D and fostering innovation. They conduct the bulk (55%) of U.S. basic research and in the process train the nation's new researchers. U.S. universities have also become active participants in turning new researchbased knowledge into innovative products and processes and in broader regional economic development activities. This chapter analyzes available data bearing on these points. (For the key output of trained personnel, see chapter 2.)\nChapter Overview\nU.S. universities and colleges carry out the majority of basic research activity (55%) and a substantial portion of all R&D in the United States. The federal government has been and continues to be the major financial supporter of academic R&D, providing more than 60% of the funding in 2007. Other major funding sources are the institutions themselves, industry, and state and local government.\nOver the past two decades, the shares of funding allocated to the various S&E fields1 have changed, with the share going to medical sciences growing substantially and the share going to physical sciences and engineering declining.\nAcademic R&D is conducted largely by doctoral scientists and engineers. Over time, universities and colleges have relied less on full-time tenure-track faculty and more on postdocs and other nonfaculty to conduct research; in addition, a steady percentage of full-time graduate students has been supported by research assistantships. The demographic composition of academic researchers is changing, with increasing numbers of women and minorities, especially among the younger age groups, and increasing numbers of foreign-born scientists and engineers.\nA measure of research output, the number of U.S. S&E articles published in the world's leading S&E journals, recently began to increase after remaining flat for almost a decade, concurrent with strong growth in the European Union and several Asian countries. However, the U.S. share of the world's S&E article output has declined since the early 1970s. The U.S. share of the world's influential--i.e., most highly cited--articles has declined, though U.S. scientific publications remain highly influential relative to those of other countries. Article output by the academic sector, which publishes most U.S. research articles, mirrored the overall U.S. trend, even as research inputs (specifically, academic R&D expenditures and research personnel) continued to increase.\nBoth domestic and international R&D collaboration have increased significantly over the past two decades. U.S. scientists and engineers in all sectors collaborated extensively with colleagues in other U.S. sectors and abroad. The results of academic research increasingly extend beyond articles to patents, which are an indicator of academic institutions' efforts to protect the intellectual property derived from their inventions, and to technology transfer, universityindustry collaboration, and other related activities such as\n\nrevenue-generating licenses and formation of startup companies that emanate from their institution.\nThis chapter addresses key aspects of the academic R&D enterprise, including the level, field allocation, and institutional distribution of academic R&D funds; the state of research equipment and facilities at academic institutions; trends in the number and composition of the academic S&E doctoral labor force; and indicators of research outputs.\nChapter Organization\nThe first section of this chapter discusses the role of academia within the national R&D enterprise. This discussion is followed by an examination of trends in the financial resources provided for academic R&D, including identification of key funders and allocations of funds across both academic institutions and S&E fields. Because the federal government has been the primary source of support for academic R&D for more than half a century, the importance of selected agencies to both overall support and support for individual fields is explored in some detail. This section also presents data on changes in the distribution of funds among academic institutions, on the number of academic institutions that receive federal R&D support, and on equipment.\nThe next section examines the status of the physical infrastructure necessary to conduct university research activities. Data are presented on both the traditional research infrastructure such as research space, and on infrastructure resulting from technological changes such as networking.\nThe third section discusses trends in employment of academic doctoral scientists and engineers, especially those engaged in research. Major trends examined include numbers and characteristics of academic doctoral scientists and engineers, the types of positions they hold, their research activities, and the federal support for their research. The section also examines reported collaboration among researchers.\nThe chapter concludes with an analysis of trends in two types of research outputs: S&E articles, as measured by data from a set of journals covered by the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and patents issued to U.S. universities. (A third major output of academic R&D, educated and trained personnel, is discussed in chapter 2 and in the preceding section of this chapter.) This section looks specifically at the volume of research (article counts), collaboration in the conduct of research (joint authorship), use in subsequent scientific activity (citation patterns), and use beyond science (citations to the literature that are found in patents). It concludes with a discussion of academic patenting and some returns to academic institutions from their patents and licenses.\nFinancial Resources for Academic R&D\nAcademic R&D is a significant part of the national R&D enterprise.2 Academic scientists and engineers conduct the bulk of the nation's basic research, about one-third of its\n\n\f5-8 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nData Sources for Financial Resources for Academic R&D\n\nThe data used to describe financial and infrastructure resources for academic R&D are derived from three National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys. These surveys use similar but not always identical definitions, and the nature of the respondents also differs across the surveys. The three main surveys are as follows:\n Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development\n Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges\n Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities\nThe first survey collects data from federal agencies, whereas the last two collect data from universities and colleges.\nData presented in the first part of this section, \"Academic R&D Within the National R&D Enterprise,\" are derived from the NSF series National Patterns of R&D Resources, which sums results from several NSF surveys of the various sectors of the U.S. economy (for example, universities, businesses, and the federal government) so that the components of the overall R&D effort are placed in a national context. These data are reported on a calendar-year basis, and the data for 2008 are preliminary. Since 1998, the series has also attempted to eliminate double counting in the academic sector by subtracting current fund expenditures for separately budgeted S&E R&D that are passed through to other institutions via subcontracts and similar collaborative research arrangements.\nData in subsequent portions of the section derive from the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges (Academic R&D Expenditures Survey). They are reported on an academic fiscalyear basis (e.g., FY 2008 covers July 2007 to June 2008 for most institutions) and do not net out the funds passed through to other institutions; therefore, they differ from those reported earlier. Data on major funding sources, funding by institution type, distribution of R&D funds across academic institutions, and expenditures by field and funding source are also derived from this survey.\nThe data on \"Top Agency Supporters\" and \"Agency Support by Character of Work\" in the \"Federal Support of Higher Education R&D\" section come from NSF's Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development. This survey collects data on R&D obligations for each federal fiscal year (e.g., FY 2008 covers October 2007 through September 2008) from 30 federal agencies. Data for FY 2008\u00ad09 are preliminary estimates. The amounts reported for FY 2008\u00ad09 are based on administration budget proposals and do not necessarily represent actual appropriations. It should be noted that federal obligation data (e.g., $25.7 billion in federal FY 2008) do not match the federally funded expenditures data reported by academic institutions ($31.2 billion in academic FY 2008)\n\nfor several reasons. First, the period covered by the two\n\nsurveys is slightly different; second, there is necessar-\n\nily a lag between the obligation date and the beginning\n\nof project expenditures and some awards span multiple\n\nyears; and third, some of the expenditures data double\n\ncount federal R&D awards that are reported both by the\n\nprimary institution receiving the funds and again by an\n\nacademic subrecipient to whom funds are passed through\n\n(about $1.5 billion in FY 2008).\n\nData on research equipment are taken from the Survey\n\nof Research and Development Expenditures at Universi-\n\nties and Colleges. Data on research facilities and cyber-\n\ninfrastructure are taken from the Survey of Science and\n\nEngineering Research Facilities and are also reported by\n\nacademic fiscal year. The population for this survey is a\n\nsubset of the population for the Academic R&D Expen-\n\nditures Survey and includes all institutions reporting $1\n\nmillion or more in current fund expenditures for R&D.\n\nThe Facilities survey was broadened starting in FY 2003\n\nto include data on computing and networking capacity.\n\nAlthough terms are defined specifically in each survey,\n\nin general,\n\nare classified as capi-\n\ntal projects, are fixed items such as buildings, often cost\n\nmillions of dollars, and are not included in R&D expen-\n\nditures as reported here. Research equipment, however,\n\nis purchased with current funds (those in the yearly op-\n\nerating budget for ongoing activities) and is included\n\nwithin R&D expenditures. Because the categories are not\n\nmutually exclusive, some large instrument systems could\n\nbe classified as either facilities or equipment. Generally,\n\nacademic institutions account separately for capital proj-\n\nects and current fund expenditures.\n\nRedesign of the Survey of R&D Expenditures at Universities and Colleges\nThe Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges has been conducted annually since 1972. In 2007, NSF began an intensive 3-year effort to evaluate and redesign the survey. The goals of the redesign were to (1) update the survey instrument to reflect current accounting principles in order to obtain more valid and reliable measurements of the amount of academic R&D spending in the United States, (2) expand the current survey items to collect the additional detail most often requested by data users, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of expanding the scope of data collected beyond that of R&D expenditures.\nAs part of the redesign effort, NSF held data user workshops and expert panel meetings, worked with accounting and survey methodology experts, and visited more than 40 institutions to receive input on possible changes to the survey. A pilot test of the redesigned survey was administered\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-9\n\nto 40 institutions during the fall of 2009, and full implementation of the redesigned survey is planned for the fall of 2010.\nThe new survey, now titled the \"Higher Education R&D Survey,\" will continue to capture core information on R&D expenditures by sources of funding and field. In addition, it will include the following data:\n Total R&D expenditures funded by nonprofit institutions (previously included under \"Other sources\")\n Total R&D expenditures funded from all types of foreign sources\n Total R&D expanded to include R&D expenditures in both S&E and non-S&E fields as well as clinical trial expenditures\n Detail by field (both S&E and non-S&E) for R&D expenditures from each source of funding (federal, state/local, institution, industry, nonprofit, and other)\n Total R&D expenditures from projects within university interdisciplinary research centers (test metric on interdisciplinary R&D)\n Total R&D expenditures by direct cost categories (salaries, software, equipment, etc.)\n Counts of proposals submitted during the fiscal year\n Counts and dollar amounts of R&D awards during the fiscal year, with a breakout of stimulus awards\nIn addition to these changes, NSF has also been working with data users and experts to explore the feasibility of collecting systematic data on both R&D personnel and intellectual property and commercialization within universities and colleges. It is expected that additional questions on these topics will be added to the Higher Education R&D Survey in future years.\ntotal (basic plus applied) research, and 13% of its total R&D. To carry out world-class research and advance the scientific knowledge base, U.S. academic researchers require adequate and stable financial resources and the research facilities and instrumentation that facilitate high-quality work. For a discussion of the sources of the data used in this section, see sidebar, \"Data Sources for Financial Resources for Academic R&D.\"\nAcademic R&D Within the National R&D Enterprise\nUniversities and colleges play an important role in the nation's overall R&D effort, especially by contributing to the generation of new knowledge through basic research.3 Since 1998, basic research performed within institutions of higher education has accounted for more than half of the basic research performed in the United States.\n\nIn 2008, U.S. universities and colleges spent $52 billion ($42 billion in constant 2000 dollars) on R&D. Higher education's prominence as an R&D performer increased slightly during the past three decades, rising from about 10% of all R&D performed in the United States in the early 1970s to an estimated 13% in 2008 (figure 5-1). For a comparison with other countries, see \"International R&D Comparisons\" in chapter 4.\nAcademic R&D involves mostly basic and applied research and little development activity.4 In 2008, an estimated 96% of academic R&D expenditures went for research (76% for basic and 21% for applied) and 4% for development (appendix table 5-1). Universities and colleges accounted for an estimated 31% of the U.S. basic and applied research total in 2008, down from a high of 35% in 2002 but still above the levels prevalent until then (figure 5-1). Higher education's share of total U.S. research expenditures had previously increased by 11 percentage points between 1982 and 2002. In terms of basic research alone, the higher education sector is the country's largest performer, currently accounting for an estimated 55% of the national total.\nFederal Support of Higher Education R&D\nHigher education R&D relies heavily on federal support, along with a variety of other funding sources. The federal government has consistently contributed the majority of the funds (figure 5-2).5 It accounted for about 60% of the $51.9 billion of R&D funds expended by universities and colleges in FY 2008 (appendix table 5-2).6 In current dollars, federally funded\n\n-PN\\YL  (JHKLTPJ 9\n+ IHZPJ HUK HWWSPLK YLZLHYJO HUK IHZPJ YLZLHYJO HZ ZOHYL VM <: [V[HS MYVT HSS WLYMVYTPUN ZLJ[VYZ PU LHJO JH[LNVY`!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n)HZPJ YLZLHYJO \n\n\n\n\n\n)HZPJ HUK HWWSPLK YLZLHYJO\n\n\n9\n+ \n\n  \n\n              \n\n56;,:! 7YLSPTPUHY` KH[H MVY  )LJH\\ZL VM JOHUNLZ PU LZ[PTH[PVU WYVJLK\\YLZ JOHYHJ[LY VM ^VYR KH[H ILMVYL -@   UV[ JVTWHYHISL ^P[O SH[LY `LHYZ +H[H IHZLK VU HUU\\HS YLWVY[Z I` WLYMVYTLYZ\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ 5H[PVUHS 7H[[LYUZ VM 9\n+ 9LZV\\YJLZ HUU\\HS ZLYPLZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  (SZV ZLL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ    HUK  MVY KH[H \\UKLYS`PUN WLYJLU[HNLZ\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f5-10 \n\nChapter 5.

After adjustment for inflation, this represents a 0.2% increase from FY 2007 and follows 2 years of slight declines in constant dollars since FY 2005.\nAnother look at recent trends is provided by federal agency-reported inflation-adjusted obligations for academic R&D--funds going to academic institutions in a given fiscal year, to be spent over the current and succeeding years. In constant 2000 dollars, federal academic R&D obligations peaked in FY 2004 at $22.1 billion and have since declined by almost 7% to an estimated $20.7 billion in FY 2009 (appendix table 5-3). Constant dollar federal R&D obligations had grown more than 10% each year between FY 1998 and FY 2001, largely reflecting a commitment to double the R&D budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over 5 years. Consequently, between 1998 and 2004, NIH's share of federal academic R&D funding increased from 57% to 63%.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009, provides an additional $18.3 billion in appropriations for federal R&D and R&D facilities and equipment in FY 2009. (See \"Federal R&D\" in chapter 4.)7\nThe federal government's overall contribution is the combined result of numerous discrete funding decisions made by several R&D-supporting agencies with differing missions and purposes, which in turn affect research priorities in the academic sector. Most of the federal R&D funding to the higher education sector is allocated through competitive peer review (see sidebar, \"Congressional Earmarks\").\nExamining and documenting the funding patterns of the key funding agencies is important to understanding both their roles and that of the federal government overall. For a discussion of a major federal program with the objective of improving the geographical distribution of federal obligations for academic R&D, see sidebar, \"EPSCoR: The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\"\n\nCongressional Earmarks\nAcademic earmarking is the congressional practice of providing federal funds to educational institutions for facilities or projects without merit-based peer review. Obtaining exact figures for either the amount of funds or the number of projects earmarked for universities and colleges, overall or for research, is difficult. There is no accepted definition of an earmark, and funding legislation is often obscure in its description of the earmarked projects. Broad estimates using a consistent approach in compiling these data are as follows.\nAcademic earmarks stood at an estimated $2.3 billion in FY 2008 (Brainard and Hermes 2008), a 15% increase over an estimated $2.0 billion reported last in FY 2003 in the Chronicle of Higher Education (Brainard and Borrego 2003). Approximately two-thirds ($1.6 billion) of the FY 2008 funds and $1.4 billion of FY 2003 funds were for R&D projects, R&D equipment, or construction or renovation of R&D laboratories.\nTop Agency Supporters Six agencies are responsible for most of the federal ob-\nligations for higher education R&D, providing an estimated 97% of the $25.7 billion obligated in FY 2009 (appendix table 5-3).8 NIH was by far the largest funder, providing an estimated 65% of total federal academic R&D obligations in FY 2009. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided an additional 15%, the Department of Defense (DOD) 8%, the Department of Energy (DOE) 4%, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 2%, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2%.\nAgency Support by Character of Work More than 56% of federal obligations from FY 2007\nthrough FY 2009 funded basic research projects (appendix table 5-4). The two agencies funding the majority of academic basic research were NIH and NSF. More than onethird of federal obligations for academic R&D from 2007 through 2009 funded applied research, with NIH providing the vast majority of funds in that category as well. About 5% of R&D obligations went toward development during 2007\u00ad09. DOD and NASA were responsible for more than 80% of the small amount of federal academic R&D funds spent on development.\nOther Sources of Funding\nIn contrast to the recent trend in federal R&D funding, higher education R&D funding from nonfederal sources has grown steadily since FY 2004, and grew by 8% (6% in inflation-adjusted terms) between 2007 and 2008 (figure 5-3).\n Institutional funds. In FY 2008, institutional funds from universities and colleges constituted the second largest source of funding for academic R&D, accounting for\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-11\n\nEPSCoR: The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research\n\nEPSCoR, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, originated as a response to a number of stated federal objectives. Section 3(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, states that \"it shall be an objective of the Foundation to strengthen research and education in the sciences and engineering, including independent research by individuals, throughout the United States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.\"\nIn 1978, Congress authorized NSF to implement EPSCoR in response to broad public concerns about the extent of geographical concentration of federal funding for R&D. Eligibility for EPSCoR participation was limited to those jurisdictions that historically had received lesser amounts of federal R&D funding and had demonstrated a commitment to develop their research bases and to improve the quality of S&E research conducted at their universities and colleges.\nThe success of the NSF EPSCoR programs during the 1980s subsequently prompted the creation of EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs in six other federal agencies: the Departments of Energy, Defense, and Agriculture; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National\n\nInstitutes of Health; and the Environmental Protection Agency. In FY 1992, the EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC) was established by the federal agencies with EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs. The major objectives of the EICC focused on improving coordination among and between the federal agencies in implementing EPSCoR and EPSCoR- like programs consistent with the policies of the participating agencies.\nEPSCoR seeks to increase the R&D competitiveness of an eligible state through the development and utilization of the science and technology (S&T) resources residing in its colleges and universities. It strives to achieve this objective by (1) stimulating sustainable S&T infrastructure improvements at the state and institutional levels that significantly increase the ability of EPSCoR researchers to compete for federal and private sector R&D funding and (2) accelerating the movement of EPSCoR researchers and institutions into the mainstream of federal and private sector R&D support.\nIn FY 2008, the seven ElCC agencies invested a total of $419 million on EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs, up from approximately $97 million in 1999 (see table 5-A). The Environmental Protection Agency discontinued issuing separate EPSCoR program solicitations in FY 2006.\n\nTable 5-A EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like program budgets, by agency: FY 1998\u00ad2008\n(Millions of dollars)\n\nAgency\n\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\n\nAll agencies .......................... 74.1 DOD .................................. 18.0 DOE .................................. 6.8 EPA ................................... 2.5 NASA ................................ 5.0 NIH.................................... 5.0 NSF ................................... 36.8 USDA ................................

Institutional funds encompass (1) institutionally financed research expenditures and (2) unrecovered indirect costs and cost sharing. They exclude departmental research, a more informal type of research that is usually coupled with instructional activities in departmental budget accounts and thus does not meet the Office of Management and Budget definition of organized research. The share of support represented by institutional funds increased steadily from 12% in 1972 to 19% in 1991 and has since\n\nremained at roughly that level. Funds for institutionally financed R&D may derive from general-purpose state or local government appropriations; general-purpose awards from industry, foundations, or other outside sources; endowment income; and gifts. Universities may also use income from patents, licenses, or patient care revenues to support R&D. (See section \"Patent-Related Activities and Income\" later in this chapter for a discussion of patent and licensing income.)\n\n\f5-12 \n\nChapter 5.

State and local governments provided 7% ($3.4 billion) of higher education R&D funding in FY 2008. Even though their absolute funding total continues to rise annually, the nonfederal government share has declined since its peak of 10.2% in the early 1970s. However, these figures are likely to understate the actual contribution of state and local governments to academic R&D, particularly for public institutions, because they only reflect funds that these governments directly target to academic R&D activities.9 They exclude any general-purpose state or local government appropriations that academic institutions designate and use to fund separately budgeted research or pay for unrecovered indirect costs; such funds are categorized as institutional funds.10 (See chapter 8, \"State Indicators,\" for some indicators of academic R&D by state.)\n Industry funds. Industrial support accounts for the smallest share of academic R&D funding (6%), and support of academia has never been a major component of industry-funded R&D. After a 3-year decline between 2001 and 2004, industry funding of academic R&D increased for the fourth year in a row, to $2.9 billion in FY 2008. (See appendix table 4-5 for time-series data on industry-reported R&D funding.)\n Other sources of funds. In FY 2008, other sources of support accounted for 8% ($4.0 billion) of academic R&D funding, a level that has stayed about the same since 1972. This category of funds includes but is not limited to grants and contracts for R&D from nonprofit organizations and voluntary health agencies and all other sources not included in the other categories.\n\nExpenditures by Field and Funding Source\nInvestment in academic R&D historically has been concentrated in a few individual S&E fields. The life sciences have for decades accounted for more than half of all academic R&D expenditures. In FY 2008, they accounted for approximately 60% of both the federal and nonfederal totals (appendix table 5-5). Within the life sciences, the medical sciences accounted for 33% of all academic R&D expenditures and the biological sciences accounted for another 19% (appendix table 5-5).11\nBetween 1998 and 2008, R&D expenditures in the medical sciences almost doubled, from $7.7 billion to $14.1 billion in constant 2000 dollars (figure 5-4), changing the distribution of academic R&D expenditures across the various broad S&E fields. The life sciences gained 4 percentage points over the period, driven by a 4-percentage-point rise in the share of medical sciences, from 29% to 33% of the total (appendix table 5-6). The physical sciences lost 2 percentage points, from 10% to 8% of the total. Figure 5-5 shows share gains and losses in both the 1990\u00ad2000 and 2000\u00ad08 periods.\nOf the $31.2 billion in academic R&D expenditures funded by the federal government, R&D projects in the life sciences accounted for $18.7 billion (60%) in FY 2008 (appendix table 5-7).\n\n-PN\\YL  (JHKLTPJ 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ I` MPLSK! \n\n*VUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ\n\n\n\n4LKPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,U]PYVUTLU[HS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n7Z`JOVSVN`\n\n4H[OLTH[PJHS\n\nZJPLUJLZ \n\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n        \n\n56;,! :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  MVY NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[ PTWSPJP[ WYPJL KLMSH[VYZ \\ZLK [V JVU]LY[ J\\YYLU[ KVSSHYZ [V JVUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ! -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-13\n\n-PN\\YL  *OHUNLZ PU ZOHYL VM HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ PU ZLSLJ[LK :\n, MPLSKZ!  \u00b6 HUK \u00b6\n\n3PML ZJPLUJLZ ,UNPULLYPUN\n4H[OLTH[PJZ\n\n \u00b6 \u00b6\n\n7Z`JOVSVN`\n\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n,U]PYVUTLU[HS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[HNL WVPU[Z\n\n56;,! -PLSKZ YHURLK I` JOHUNL PU ZOHYL K\\YPUN \u00b6 PU KLZJLUKPUN VYKLY\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ! -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), notably NIH, contributes the majority of this life science funding (83%). Although their share of total academic R&D funding is much smaller, DOD, DOE, NASA, and NSF have more diversified funding patterns (figure 5-6). In FY 2008, NSF was the lead federal funding agency for academic research in the physical sciences (29% of federally funded R&D expenditures); mathematical sciences (47%); computer sciences (42%); and environmental sciences (34%). DOD was the lead funding agency in engineering (32%).\nThe proportion of academic R&D expenditures funded by the federal government also varies significantly by field (appendix table 5-8). The field with the largest proportion of federal funding in FY 2008 was atmospheric sciences, at 80%, followed by physics (76%), mathematical sciences (72%), and aeronautical/astronautical engineering (72%). The fields with the smallest percentages of federal funding in FY 2008 were economics (32%), political science (37%), and agricultural sciences, which received less than 30% of their funds from federal sources.\nBetween 1975 and 1990, the federally financed proportion of R&D spending declined in all of the broad S&E fields (appendix table 5-8).12 Since 1990, those declines have either stabilized or reversed, and the federal share reported in FY 2008 was higher than the 1990 share for all fields except mathematical sciences and physical sciences.\n\n-PN\\YL  -LKLYHSS` MPUHUJLK HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ I` HNLUJ` HUK MPLSK! -@ \n*\\YYLU[ KVSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ\n\n\n ,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n\n6[OLY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n:VJPHS ZJPLUJLZ \n7Z`JOVSVN`\n\n\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n4H[OLTH[PJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n3PML ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n,U]PYVUTLU[HS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n\n\n +6+\n\n+6,\n\n//:\n\n5(:(\n\n5:-\n\n<:+(\n\n+6+ $ +LWHY[TLU[ VM +LMLUZL\"\u00b0+6, $ +LWHY[TLU[ VM ,ULYN`\"\u00b0 //: $ +LWHY[TLU[ VM /LHS[O HUK /\\THU :LY]PJLZ\"\u00b05(:( $ 5H[PVUHS (LYVUH\\[PJZ HUK :WHJL (KTPUPZ[YH[PVU\"\u00b05:- $ 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU\" <:+( $ <: +LWHY[TLU[ VM (NYPJ\\S[\\YL\n56;,! :VTL PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ \\UHISL [V WYV]PKL JVTWSL[L HNLUJ` KH[H I` MPLSK +H[H UV[ HKQ\\Z[LK MVY UVUYLZWVUZL\n:6<9*,!\u00b0\u00b05H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nNon-S&E R&D Expenditures\nAcademic institutions spent a total of $2.2 billion on R&D in non-S&E fields in FY 2008 (table 5-1).13 This represents an increase of 9% over the $2.1 billion spent in FY 2007.14 This $2.2 billion is in addition to the $51.9 billion expended on S&E R&D. The largest amounts reported for R&D in non-S&E fields were for education ($880 million), business and management ($325 million), and humanities ($254 million). The federal government funds smaller proportions of R&D in non-S&E than in S&E fields: 37% of the $2.2 billion in non-S&E R&D in FY 2008.\nAcademic R&D by Institution\nThe previous sections examined R&D for the entire academic sector.

In FY 2008, the federal government provided 72% of the R&D funds spent by private institutions, compared with 55% for public institutions. Conversely, public institutions received approximately 9% of their $35.3 billion in R&D expenditures from state and local governments, compared with 2% of private institutions' $16.6 billion.\n\n-PN\\YL  :V\\YJLZ VM HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ M\\UKPUN MVY W\\ISPJ HUK WYP]H[L PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ! \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n7\\ISPJ\n\n7YP]H[L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -LKLYHS :[H[LSVJHS 0UK\\Z[Y`\nNV]LYUTLU[ NV]LYUTLU[\n\n(JHKLTPJ PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ\n\n6[OLY\n\n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ! -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nPublic academic institutions also supported a larger portion of their R&D from their own sources (24% versus 12% at private institutions). Their larger proportion of institutional R&D funds may reflect general-purpose state and local government funds that public institutions have directed toward R&D.15 Private institutions in turn report a larger proportion of unrecovered indirect costs (53% of their institutional total in 2008, versus 42% for public institutions). For both types of institutions, these shares have declined over the past decade, from 64% to 53% for private institutions and from 46% to 42% for public institutions (figure 5-8).\nBoth public and private institutions received approximately 6% of their R&D support from industry in FY 2008.\n\n-PN\\YL  *VTWVULU[Z VM PUZ[P[\\[PVUHS 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ MVY W\\ISPJ HUK WYP]H[L HJHKLTPJ PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n\n\n\n<UYLJV]LYLK PUKPYLJ[ JVZ[Z!

In FY 2008, 679 institutions reported spending at least $150,000 on S&E R&D. Of these, the top-spending 20 accounted for 30% of total academic R&D spending and the top 100 for 80% of all academic R&D expenditures. Appendix table 5-10 presents the detailed distribution among the top 100 institutions. The concentration of academic R&D funds among the top 100 institutions has stayed constant over the past two decades (figure 5-9), as have the shares held by both the top 10 and the top 20 institutions.\nIt should be noted that the composition of the universities in each of these groups varies over time as universities increase or decrease their R&D activities. For example, 5 of the top 20 institutions in FY 1988 were no longer in the top 20 in FY 2008.\nA similar concentration of funds is found among university performers of non-S&E R&D. The top 20 performers accounted for 36% of the total non-S&E R&D expenditures in FY 2008 (appendix table 5-11).\nR&D Collaboration Between Higher Education Institutions\nOne way to measure the extent of collaboration among academic institutions is to examine how much of their total R&D expenditures was passed through to other academic institutions or received by institutions as subrecipient funding. R&D funds for joint projects that were passed through universities to other university subrecipients more than doubled from FY 2000 to FY 2008, from $699 million to $1.7 billion (figure\n-PN\\YL  (JHKLTPJ 9\n+ I` YHUR VM \\UP]LYZP[` HUK JVSSLNL HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n;VW  \n\n ;VW \n ;VW \n                 \n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n5-10; appendix table 5-12). This amount represents 3.3% of total academic R&D expenditures in FY 2008, compared with 2.3% of the total in FY 2000. In FY 2008, 90% ($1.5 billion) of these pass-through funds came from federal sources.\nNot coincidentally, universities receiving pass-through funds from other universities likewise reported a rapid increase in subrecipient R&D expenditures between FY 2000 and FY 2008, from $669 million to $1.7 billion. More than 90% ($1.6 billion) of these subrecipient funds originated from federal sources.16\nOverall, $3.5 billion was passed through institutions to all types of subrecipients in FY 2008 (including both academic and nonacademic institutions), and $3.9 billion was received as subrecipient funding from all types of pass-through entities (appendix table 5-12). Again, the majority of these funds were from federal sources (87% of pass-through funds and 90% of subrecipient expenditures).\nAcademic R&D Equipment\nResearch equipment is an integral component of the academic R&D enterprise. This section examines expenditures for moveable research equipment necessary for the conduct of organized research projects (e.g., computers, telescopes) and the federal role in funding these expenditures.\n-PN\\YL  ;V[HS HUK MLKLYHSS` M\\UKLK HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ WHZZ [OYV\\NOZ! -@ \u00b6\n+VSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ \n\n\n\n(SS HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ WHZZLK\n\n[V V[OLY \\UP]LYZP[PLZ\n\n (SS HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ YLJLP]LK MYVT V[OLY \\UP]LYZP[PLZ\n\n-LKLYHS HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ WHZZLK [V V[OLY \\UP]LYZP[PLZ \n\n -LKLYHS HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ YLJLP]LK MYVT V[OLY \\UP]LYZP[PLZ\n\n\n\n\n         \n:6<9*,! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ! -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f5-16 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nIn FY 2008, about $1.9 billion in current funds was spent for academic research equipment (appendix table 5-13).17 In constant dollars, this represents an increase of 1.0% from FY 2007 but a decline of more than 10% from the 2004 level. Overall, expenditures for R&D equipment have risen 61% in real dollars since 1985. About 80% of FY 2008 expenditures were concentrated in three fields: the life sciences (43%), engineering (23%), and the physical sciences (16%) (appendix table 5-13). After a period of steady growth between 2001 and 2004, equipment expenditures in the physical sciences, medical and biological sciences, and engineering have declined since FY 2005 (figure 5-11).\nFederal funds for research equipment are generally received as part of research grants or as separate equipment grants. The share of federal funding for research equipment varies significantly by field (appendix table 5-14). The field of atmospheric sciences had the largest proportion of federally funded R&D equipment (85%) in FY 2008. The overall share of research equipment funded by the federal government fluctuated between 56% and 64% over the past two decades.\n\n-PN\\YL  *\\YYLU[ M\\UK L_WLUKP[\\YLZ MVY YLZLHYJO LX\\PWTLU[ H[ HJHKLTPJ PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ I` MPLSK!  \u00b6\n*VUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ TPSSPVUZ\n\n,UNPULLYPUN\n\n\n\n4LKPJHS\n\n\n\nZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n7O`ZPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n)PVSVNPJHS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n\n\n ,U]PYVUTLU[HS ZJPLUJLZ\n\n*VTW\\[LY ZJPLUJLZ \n\n  \n\n        \n\n56;,! :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  MVY NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[ PTWSPJP[ WYPJL KLMSH[VYZ \\ZLK [V JVU]LY[ J\\YYLU[ KVSSHYZ [V JVUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ\n:6<9*,!\u00b05H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ -@  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nAcademic R&D Infrastructure\nPhysical infrastructure is an essential resource for the conduct of R&D. Not long ago, R&D capital infrastructure primarily consisted of instruments and research space such as laboratories and computer rooms. Consequently, the principal indicators of the state of research infrastructure have been square footage of designated research space and counts of instruments.\nOver the past two decades, technological advances have brought fundamental changes not only in the methods of scientific research but also in the infrastructure necessary to conduct R&D. The infrastructure resulting from these technological innovations is often called cyberinfrastructure. Cyberinfrastructure may involve single resources such as a network used to transfer data, or it may involve a complex interaction of numerous resources resulting in sophisticated capabilities such as high-performance computation or remote use of scientific instrumentation. Regardless of how simple or complex this infrastructure may be, cyberinfrastructure has become an essential resource for science.\nCyberinfrastructure: Networking\nNetworking is a critical component of academic cyberinfrastructure that facilitates many research-related activities such as communication, data transfer, high-performance computation, and remote use of instrumentation.18 In FY 2007, networking infrastructure was pervasive on many academic campuses and rapidly expanding in capability and coverage. Researchperforming institutions19 had greater numbers of connections, bandwidth, and campus coverage compared with earlier in the decade. Colleges and universities reported external network connections with greater bandwidth, faster internal network distribution speeds, more connections to high-speed networks, and greater wireless coverage on campus.\nExternal Bandwidth Early in the decade, some institutions reported no Internet1\nconnections of any kind, but by mid-decade, all institutions had connections and their bandwidths significantly increased. Between FY 2005 and FY 2007, the number of institutions with total Internet1 and Internet2 bandwidth of more than 100 megabits increased almost 30% (table 5-2). At the same time, the number of institutions with the fastest bandwidth speeds also continued to expand. The percentage of institutions with total Internet1 and Internet2 bandwidth of 1 gigabit or faster rose by more than 50% in FY 2007, reaching 34% of all institutions. If institutional estimates are realized, the percent of institutions with total bandwidth of 1 gigabit or faster will double between FY 2005 and FY 2008 to 42%.\nBandwidth capability increased across different types of academic institutions. However, the colleges and universities with the fastest bandwidths were dominated by doctorategranting institutions. In FY 2007, all but one institution with total Internet1 and Internet2 bandwidth greater than 2.4 gigabits granted doctorates. Of all institutions with bandwidth of at least 1 gigabit, 83% were doctorate granting. This trend is likely to continue into FY 2008 and beyond.

All but two will be doctorate granting.\nPart of the increase in total bandwidth speed can be at least partially attributed to an increase in the number of connections to high-performance networks. The number of connections to Internet2 grew gradually over the decade, and by the end of FY 2007, a large majority (70%) of institutions had Internet2 connections. Between FY 2005 and FY 2007, the percentage of institutions with connections to the National Lambda Rail (NLR) increased 150% to approximately 25% of all institutions. After holding steady since the beginning of the decade, the number of institutions anticipating connections to federal government high-performance networks such as the Department of Energy's ESnet increased in FY 2007. Institutions have also begun connecting to more than one high-performance network. For example, in FY 2007, 25% had connections to both Internet2 and NLR.\nInternal Institutional Networks Similar to the trend of increased external bandwidth speed,\ninternal network distribution speeds at academic institutions increased considerably. Since early in the decade, the percentage of institutions with slower bandwidth has rapidly decreased while the percentage with faster bandwidths has rapidly increased. In FY 2003, 66% of institutions had bandwidth of less than 1 gigabit; by the end of FY 2007, only 25% did (table 5-3).

The rate of increase peaked in FY 2001\u00ad03 at 11%. Since then, the rate of increase has gradually declined.\nAlthough the stock of research space increased overall in FY 2005\u00ad07, for the first time in 20 years, almost half of the S&E fields21 experienced a decline in their research NASF. Particularly notable is that for the first time since FY 1988, the health and clinical sciences experienced an actual loss in research space of 7%. This decrease followed some of the largest increases in research space in any S&E field since the beginning of decade.\nEven with the decline in FY 2007 though, the health and clinical sciences still had the second largest amount of research NASF (37 million) of all S&E fields. Only the biological and biomedical sciences had a greater amount of square footage (46 million), having increased 18% from the amount reported in FY 2005. In addition to the health and clinical sciences, the social sciences; the physical science subfields of earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences and astronomy, chemistry, and physics; and the fields classified as \"other\" experienced losses in research space. Only the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences had experienced a loss in the previous biennial period.\nContinuing a trend that began in FY 2001, research space in the computer sciences once again experienced the largest rate of increase when compared with all other fields. In FY 2007, research space in the computer sciences increased 20% to approximately 5 million NASF.\n\nNew Construction In conjunction with the slowdown in the increase in re-\nsearch space, the total amount of newly constructed research space also began to slow at the beginning of the decade (table 5-5). Since FY 2002\u00ad03, the total amount of new research space constructed declined by approximately 45%. However, within this overall broad decline, the amount and direction of change in new construction varied significantly by S&E field.\nDuring FY 2006\u00ad07, initiation of construction of new research space was greatest in the biological and biomedical sciences (3 million NASF), the health and clinical sciences (2 million NASF), and engineering (1 million NASF). Relative to previous years, however, these three fields experienced a decline in the amount of new construction. The amount of newly constructed research space in engineering and in the biological and biomedical sciences declined from FY 2002\u00ad03 to FY 2004\u00ad05 and again, to a lesser extent, in FY 2006\u00ad07. In the health and clinical sciences, the amount of newly constructed research space declined 34% from FY 2002\u00ad03 to FY 2004\u00ad05. From FY 2004\u00ad05 to FY 2006\u00ad07, it declined another 48%.\nThree fields of science reversed the decline in the amount of newly constructed space from earlier in the decade: the physical, computer, and agricultural sciences. The amount of newly constructed research space in the physical sciences increased 25% between FY 2004\u00ad05 and FY 2006\u00ad07, with the majority of new space located in astronomy, chemistry, and physics.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-19\n\nTable 5-5 New construction of S&E research space in academic institutions, by field and time of construction: FY 2002\u00ad07\n(Millions of net assignable square feet)\n\nField\nAll fields ..................................................................................................\nAgricultural and natural resources ......................................................

Institutions use one or more sources to fund their capital projects, including the federal government, state or local governments, and the institutions' own funds. In the previous biennial period, the proportion of new construction costs funded by state and local governments dropped significantly relative to other funding sources, to 22%. Concurrently, funding by the institutions' own sources rose to 70% of all new construction funds ($5.8 billion).22 In FY 2006\u00ad07, state and local governments returned to funding about onethird of new construction, while institutional internal sources funded about 60%. The remaining funding came from the federal government. The federal proportion of funding has remained relatively stable and small over time.\nDoctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia\nThe role of research in U.S. universities is both to create new knowledge and to educate students who will become the future generations of researchers and teachers (Association of American Universities 2006). Doctoral scientists and engineers in academia, and in particular faculty in U.S. colleges and universities, are an important aspect of academic R&D, as they generally engage in both research and teaching. The focus of this section is on the research aspects of doctoral scientists and engineers in academia.\n\nThis section examines trends in employment and labor market conditions of doctoral scientists and engineers in U.S. universities and colleges, with a particular focus on research activity. Trends in and characteristics of S&E doctoral researchers, including young investigators, are discussed as well as trends in government support for research. Chapter 3 provides more information on the workforce as a whole, and chapter 2 provides information on the output of students and degrees.\nTrends in Academic Employment of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers\nAcademic employment of doctoral scientists and engineers grew over the past three decades, although growth was slower than in the business or government sectors. As a result, the share of all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia dropped from about 55% to 45% during the 1973\u00ad 2006 period (NSB 2008).23 The number of S&E doctorate holders employed in academia grew from 118,000 in 1973 to 272,800 in 2006 (table 5-6). Mirroring trends in R&D funding, life scientists accounted for much of the growth in academic employment. In engineering and many science fields, growth in academic employment slowed in the early 1990s but increased in recent years (figure 5-12).\nAlthough full-time faculty positions continue to be the norm in academic employment, S&E doctorate holders increasingly are employed in part-time, postdoc, or full-time nonfaculty positions. From 1973 to 2006, the share of S&E doctorate holders employed in full-time faculty positions\n\n\f5-20 \n\nTable 5-6 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, by position: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nPosition\n\n1973 1983 1993 2006\n\nAll positions (number in thousands) .......................\nFull-time professors .......

The full-time faculty share was 72% of all academic employment in 2006, down from 88% in the early 1970s. The full-time nonfaculty share rose from 6% in 1973 to 13% in 2006. Part-time positions accounted for only a small share (between 2% and 4%) of all academic S&E doctoral employment throughout most of the period before rising to almost 6% in 2006. Postdocs rose from 4% in 1973 to 9% of all academically employed S&E doctorate holders in 2006.\nThe lack of growth in the number of tenured and tenuretrack positions in the life sciences, concurrent with increasing numbers of new doctorate holders, has been a subject of much focus in recent years (Benderly 2004, NRC 2005, Check 2007, Garrison and McGuire, 2008). Although the number of tenured full-time faculty in all fields increased from 90,700 in 1979 to 122,500 in 2006, their percentage of the academic workforce decreased from 69% to 62% (appendix table 5-15).

From 1973 to 2006, the number of academic S&E doctorate holders reporting research as a primary or secondary work activity showed greater growth than the number reporting teaching as a primary or secondary activity (table 5-7). On average, the\n\nnumber of researchers grew 2.5% per year and the number of teachers grew 1.7% per year.\nThe life sciences accounted for much of this trend, with the number of life science researchers growing from 26,000 to 66,700, an average annual growth rate of 2.9% (table 5-8 and appendix table 5-16). Life scientists accounted for more than one-third of academic doctorate holders reporting research as a primary or secondary work activity in 2006. The number of researchers in computer sciences grew the fastest, at 16.3% from 1979 to 2006, although from a small base. The number of academic researchers in the physical sciences and mathematics grew more slowly, at average annual growth rates of 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively, from 1973 to 2006.

As women, minorities, and foreignborn researchers became an increasing share of academic researchers over the past two decades, men, and particularly white men, became a decreasing share.\nWomen in the Doctoral S&E Workforce. In 2006, 33% of all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia were women, up from 9% in 1973 (table 5-9). This rise reflects the increase in the proportion of women among recent S&E doctorate holders. Women hold a larger share of junior faculty positions than positions at either the associate or full professor rank (figure 5-14). In 2006, women constituted 25% of full-time senior faculty (full and associate professors) and 42% of full-time junior faculty (assistant professors and lecturers), the latter slightly higher than their share of recently earned S&E doctorates (table 5-9; see also \"Doctoral Degrees by Sex\" in chapter 2). However, their share of both junior and senior faculty positions rose substantially between 1973 and 2006. Although women are growing numbers of full-time faculty, they constitute more than half of academic S&E doctorate holders employed part time.\n\nThe percentage of women among full-time doctoral S&E research faculty is similar to the percentage of women among all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia. Women increased from 6% to 29% of full-time doctoral S&E research faculty from 1973 to 2006 (appendix table 5-16). Women's representation in some fields is higher than in others. Women make up almost half of full-time faculty researchers in psychology, about one-third of those in life sciences and social sciences,24 and 11% of those in engineering (figure 5-15 and table 5-9).\nWomen are also a growing percentage of faculty at research institutions--up from 8% in 1977 to 23% in 2003-- yet they remain less well represented at these institutions than at freestanding medical schools or at master's granting institutions (NSF/SRS 2008). (See sidebar \"Women Faculty at Research Universities.\") For a more complete discussion of the role of women, see Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2009 (NSF/\nSRS 2009b).\nRacial/Ethnic Groups in the Academic Doctoral Workforce. Asians and underrepresented minorities (blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) constitute increasing shares of the academic doctoral workforce (table 5-10 and figure 5-16).25 Between 1973 and 2006, the percentages of Asians and underrepresented minorities in the S&E academic doctoral workforce increased from 4% to 14% and 2% to 8%, respectively. These changes reflect increases in these groups' shares of recently earned doctorates. See \"Doctoral Degrees by Race/Ethnicity\" in chapter 2 for trends in doctoral degrees.\n\nTable 5-9 Women as percentage of S&E doctorate holders, by position: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n\nPosition and degree field\n\n1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nAll positions ...............................................................................\n\n9.1\n\n15.0\n\n21.9\n\n33.0\n\nFull-time senior faculty...........................................................\n\n5.8\n\n9.3\n\n14.2\n\n25.0\n\nFull-time junior faculty ...........................................................\n\n11.3\n\n23.5\n\n32.2\n\n42.3\n\nFull-time faculty researchers..................................................\n\n6.3\n\n11.4\n\n17.7\n\n28.6\n\nPhysical sciences ...............................................................\n\n3.0\n\n4.6\n\n7.7\n\n15.2\n\nMathematics .......................................................................\n\n4.7\n\n7.4\n\n9.0\n\n18.8\n\nComputer sciences ............................................................\n\nNA\n\n9.2\n\n15.8\n\n22.9\n\nLife sciences ......................................................................\n\n7.9\n\n12.6\n\n21.5\n\n32.9\n\nPsychology .........................................................................\n\n13.1\n\n23.8\n\n35.4\n\n48.9\n\nSocial sciences ..................................................................\n\n8.2\n\n16.3\n\n21.5\n\n33.7\n\nEngineering ........................................................................\n\n0.3\n\n2.0\n\n4.1\n\n11.2\n\nFull-time nonfaculty ...............................................................\n\n14.5\n\n23.1\n\n30.2\n\n36.2\n\nPostdocs ................................................................................\n\n14.3\n\n30.1\n\n30.8\n\n40.8\n\nPart-time positions ................................................................\n\n48.3\n\n41.7\n\n61.0\n\n51.5\n\nNA = not available\n\nNOTES: Academic employment limited to U.S. doctorate holders employed at 2- or 4-year colleges or universities.

Academic Research and Development\n\nWomen Faculty at Research Universities\n\nIn a congressionally mandated study of women faculty in research universities, the National Research Council (2009) found that women faculty do as well as or better than men in hiring, promotions, and access to university resources. The study focused on tenured or tenure-track faculty in 6 disciplines (biology, chemistry, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics) at 89 research universities. Women constituted 12% of the faculty in the disciplines and universities studied. The study found that in these research universities, women were a lower percentage of applicants for tenured or tenure-track positions than they were of recent doctorates, especially in chemistry and biology. However, women were a higher percentage of interviewees than of applicants and a higher percentage of those hired than of interviewees. The study also found that women constituted a lower percentage of tenure candidates than of assistant professors, but that among those up for tenure\n\nreview, women were more likely than men to receive tenure. The study found little difference in lab space, equipment, or percentage of time teaching or doing research and little difference in outcomes (e.g., honors, funding, salaries) of tenured or tenure-track faculty, with a few exceptions, including salaries of full professors and publications. Because of its specific mandate, the report did not address women who did not apply to research universities or those who left research universities, but noted the need for further research in these areas. By necessity, it did not address other types of academic employment, other types of academic institutions, or other issues affecting women's employment in academia, including dual careers, effects of children and family obligations, or institutional climate. Many other studies of women in academia address some of these issues (e.g., Long 2001; COSEPUP 2007; NSF 2004; Ginther 2001; Hosek et al. 2005; Rosser, Daniels, and Wu 2006; Fox 2005).\n\nTable 5-10 Minorities as percentage of S&E doctorate holders, by position: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n\n1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nPosition and degree field\n\nUnderrepresented\nminority\n\nUnderrepresented Asian minority\n\nUnderrepresented Asian minority\n\nUnderrepresented Asian minority\n\nAsian\n\nAll positions ...........................................\n\n2.0\n\n4.2\n\n3.7\n\n6.7\n\n5.0\n\n9.8\n\n8.2\n\n14.1\n\nFull-time faculty .................................\n\n1.9\n\n3.9\n\n3.6\n\n6.1\n\n5.0\n\n8.6\n\n7.9\n\n11.7\n\nFull-time faculty researchers..............\n\n1.7\n\n4.3\n\n3.2\n\n7.4\n\n4.8\n\n10.1\n\n7.6\n\n13.5\n\nPhysical sciences ...........................\n\n1.8\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n7.7\n\n4.5\n\n10.9\n\n4.6\n\n11.5\n\nMathematics ...................................\n\n1.8\n\n4.4\n\n2.8\n\n10.0\n\n3.3\n\n14.0\n\n7.5\n\n19.3\n\nComputer sciences ........................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n20.7\n\n7.3\n\n36.3\n\n6.6\n\n36.8\n\nLife sciences ..................................\n\n2.0\n\n3.6\n\n2.8\n\n6.5\n\n3.7\n\n8.2\n\n7.3\n\n13.2\n\nPsychology .....................................\n\n1.7\n\nS\n\n3.1\n\n1.9\n\n5.7\n\n2.2\n\n8.5\n\n4.3\n\nSocial sciences ..............................\n\n1.7\n\n4.3\n\n4.8\n\n5.4\n\n7.0\n\n6.2\n\n9.9\n\n8.1\n\nEngineering ....................................\n\n0.9\n\n9.5\n\n2.7\n\n14.8\n\n3.9\n\n21.6\n\n7.3\n\n25.7\n\nPostdocs ............................................\n\n2.4\n\n11.9\n\n4.8\n\n13.3\n\n4.5\n\n27.1\n\n7.5\n\n35.4\n\nOther positions ..................................\n\n2.9\n\n5.7\n\n4.1\n\n8.2\n\n5.3\n\n8.9\n\n9.3\n\n13.7\n\nNA = not available; S = data suppressed for reasons of confidentiality and/or reliability\nNOTES: Underrepresented minority includes blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives.

Foreign-born S&E doctorate holders contribute substantially to academic R&D in the United States. Reliance by U.S. colleges and universities on foreign talent increased during the 1990s. Chapter 3 discusses more fully trends in immigration and employment characteristics of foreign-born scientists and engineers.\n\nApproximately 31,400 noncitizens (permanent residents and temporary visa holders) and 31,300 naturalized U.S. citizens with a U.S. S&E doctorate were employed in academia in 2006 (appendix table 5-19). In addition, U.S. universities and colleges employ an unknown but probably large number of foreign-born S&E doctorate holders with doctorates from foreign universities.27 (Chapter 3 of Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 [NSB 2008] estimated that about 36% of foreign-born S&E doctorate holders had foreign-earned doctorates.) The discussion in this section is limited to U.S. doctorate holders.\nForeign-born S&E doctorate holders (both noncitizens and naturalized citizens) with U.S. S&E doctorates were 23% of the total academic doctoral S&E workforce in 2006 and close to half (47%) of academic postdocs (appendix table 5-19). Foreign-born S&E doctorate holders constitute a higher percentage of researchers than of all academically employed S&E doctorate holders. In 2006, they represented 27% of all academic researchers, regardless of rank or type of position, 24% of full-time faculty researchers, and 20% of all full-time faculty. U.S. S&E doctorate holders with temporary or permanent visas increased from about 4% of fulltime faculty researchers with U.S. doctorates in 1973 to 10% in 2006 (appendix table 5-17).\nForeign-born S&E doctorate holders with U.S. doctorates are more heavily concentrated in computer sciences, mathematics, and engineering than in other fields. These foreign-born doctorate holders account for more than half of all academic researchers and of full-time faculty researchers in computer sciences and for 39%\u00ad48% of all academic researchers and full-time faculty researchers in mathematics and engineering. In contrast, they represent 27% or less of all academic researchers and 21% or less of full-time faculty researchers in the life sciences, the physical sciences, psychology, and the social sciences (appendix table 5-19).\nRecent S&E Doctorate Holders\nMany doctoral candidates aspire to an academic, tenured faculty position, even though nonacademic employment has for many years exceeded that in universities and colleges, and the composition of academic hiring has changed as relatively fewer full-time faculty and relatively more part-time and nonfaculty are hired. Nevertheless, the relative availability of faculty positions is thought to have provided market signals to aspiring graduate students.\nOver the past three decades, the share of recent doctorate holders (i.e., those with doctorates earned within 3 years of the survey) in full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty positions decreased and the prevalence of postdoc positions increased (figure 5-17). Between 1979 and 2006, the share of recent doctorate holders hired into full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty positions fell from 42% to 29%. Conversely, the overall share of recent S&E doctorate holders who reported being in postdoc positions rose from 25% to 45% during that period.

The share employed in part-time positions also rose in the 1970s and early 1980s but remained at roughly 5% from 1985 through 2006. The share employed in other full-time positions (e.g., adjunct faculty, lecturers, research associates, administrators) remained fairly stable over the period except for decreases from 1979 to 1981 and from 2003 to 2006.\nThe percentage of recent S&E doctorate holders and recent full-time S&E doctoral faculty engaged in research is higher than is the case for those who have had their doctorate for 12 or more years (table 5-11).28 In some fields (e.g., computer sciences and engineering), research is a more prevalent activity among those who have had their doctorate for less than 8 years. In the life sciences, although research is most prevalent within 1 to 3 years of award of the doctorate, a relatively high percentage of doctorate holders remain in research, even among those with more experience.\nYoung Doctorate Holders With a Track Record For those employed in academia 4\u00ad7 years after earning\ntheir doctorate, the trends are quite similar to those for doctorate holders who have had their degree for 1\u00ad3 years, although the former group's percentage employed in postdoc positions is much smaller and their percentage employed in faculty positions much larger. About half of S&E doctorate\n\nholders who have had their degree for 4\u00ad7 years had fulltime tenured or tenure-track faculty positions in 2006, down from 64% in 1979 (figure 5-18). The percentage in postdoc positions rose from 6% to 15%, and the percentage in parttime positions rose from 3% to 6%. The percentage employed in full-time, non-tenure-track, nonfaculty positions changed little over time.\nGovernment Support of Academic Doctoral Researchers\nAcademic researchers rely on the federal government for a majority of their overall research support. This section presents data from reports by S&E doctorate holders in academia about the presence or absence of federal support for their work.29 However, nothing is known about the amount of funds received by individual researchers.\nIn 2006, 46% of full-time S&E doctoral faculty reported federal government support, about the same percentage as was the case in the late 1980s and only slightly higher than in 1973 (figure 5-19). As appendix table 5-20 shows, the percentage of S&E doctorate holders in academia who received federal support and the percentage of full-time S&E faculty who received federal support differed greatly across the S&E fields. In 2006, more than half of full-time S&E doctoral faculty in the physical sciences, the life sciences, and engineering and less than half of those in mathematics, computer sciences, psychology, and the social sciences received federal support. The percentage receiving federal support was lowest in social sciences (24%).\nThe percentage with federal support was higher among S&E doctorate holders in research universities (64%) and medical schools (70%) and lower among those employed in doctoral/research universities (28%), master's-granting universities (21%), and baccalaureate colleges (22%) (appendix table 5-20).\nFederal Support of Young S&E Doctorate Holders in Academia\nEarly receipt of federal support is viewed as critical to launching a promising academic research career, yet federal support is less available to young S&E faculty with doctorates than to more established faculty, and the percentage of young S&E faculty with federal support is declining. Among full-time faculty, the percentage reporting federal support in 2006 was lower for those with recently earned doctorates than for all full-time faculty. Moreover, for younger faculty as well as all faculty, the percentage reporting federal support was lower in 2006 than in 1991 (a peak year) (figure 5-19). It should be pointed out that these data provide no information about whether an individual reporting federal support is being supported as a principal investigator on a research project or is participating in a more dependent status rather than as an independent researcher.\nAmong S&E doctorate holders with recently earned doctorates, those in full-time faculty positions were less likely to receive federal support than those in postdoc or other\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-27\n\nTable 5-11 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia and full-time S&E faculty reporting research as primary or secondary work activity, by field and years since doctorate: 2006\n(Percent)\n\nGroup and years since doctorate\n\nAll fields\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nMathematics and statistics\n\nComputer and\ninformation sciences\n\nLife sciences Psychology\n\nSocial sciences Engineering\n\nS&E doctorate holders employed\n\nin academia\n\nAll .................................................. 67.3\n\n68.0\n\n65.7\n\n1\u00ad3............................................. 78.9\n\n84.5\n\n78.9\n\n4\u00ad7............................................. 72.0\n\n76.2\n\n78.2\n\n8\u00ad11........................................... 69.3\n\n69.9\n\n73.5\n\n12 ............................................ 63.2\n\n62.7\n\n59.6\n\nFull-time S&E faculty\n\nAll .................................................. 68.6\n\n66.5\n\n68.4\n\n1\u00ad3............................................. 73.5\n\n64.4\n\n71.1\n\n4\u00ad7............................................. 74.0\n\n73.9\n\n81.5\n\n8\u00ad11........................................... 73.4\n\n74.7\n\n80.3\n\n12 ............................................ 66.0\n\n64.0\n\n63.4\n\n70.5\n\n69.8\n\n58.5\n\n65.4\n\n72.4\n\n79.6\n\n80.0\n\n67.8\n\n71.5\n\n88.3\n\n79.7\n\n73.0\n\n59.7\n\n68.4\n\n80.7\n\n63.5\n\n72.7\n\n56.8\n\n69.1\n\n73.1\n\n65.0\n\n65.8\n\n56.6\n\n62.9\n\n65.5\n\n74.0\n\n69.9\n\n63.6\n\n68.8\n\n70.9\n\n83.9\n\n66.6\n\n69.0\n\n79.9\n\n82.0\n\n85.1\n\n70.1\n\n68.1\n\n73.1\n\n85.6\n\n68.1\n\n75.1\n\n64.0\n\n74.1\n\n73.3\n\n68.0\n\n69.1\n\n61.8\n\n65.4\n\n66.3\n\nNOTES: Academic employment limited to U.S. doctorate holders employed at 2- or 4-year colleges or universities and excludes those employed part time because they are students or retired.

Almost half of those with recently earned doctorates reported receiving federal support, with 30% of those in full-time faculty positions, 49% in other full-time positions, and 69% in postdoc positions receiving federal support. Over the past three decades, the percentage of recent S&E doctorate holders in full-time faculty positions who have federal support remained fairly constant (except in the life sciences, where it declined), but the percentage in postdocs and in full-time nonfaculty positions with federal support declined (NSB 2008). The share of recent doctorate holders with federal support was relatively low in the social sciences and higher in the life and physical sciences and in engineering (table 5-12).\nAmong full-time faculty and postdocs in 2006, those who had received their doctorate 4\u00ad7 years earlier were more likely to receive federal support than those with recently earned doctorates (table 5-12). However, those who had received their doctorate 4\u00ad7 years earlier were also less likely to receive support in 2006 than in 1991 (figure 5-19 and table 5-13).\nCollaborative Research\nResearch in many fields has increasingly involved collaboration of researchers, whether on large or small projects. Funding entities often encourage collaborative research, which can bring together people of different disciplines, different types of institutions, different economic sectors, and different countries. As noted in the section \"R&D Collaborations Between Higher Education Institutions,\" R&D funds for joint projects that were passed through academic\n\ninstitutions to other institutions increased from FY 2000 to FY 2008, and most of the funds were from federal sources.

Team work is most common among life scientists, physical scientists, and engineers (80%, 72%, and 77%, respectively) and least common among mathematicians (49%) and social scientists (50%). The percentage of full-time research faculty engaged in international collaboration was higher among those who were born outside the United States (34%) than among those born in the United States (28%). Differences between foreign and native-born researchers were even more pronounced in some fields, such as mathematics (36% compared with 21%), psychology (39% compared with 24%), and social sciences (41% compared with 28%). Although the differences in computer sciences appear large, they are not statistically significant.\nAmong full-time S&E research faculty, much of the international collaboration was by e-mail or telephone (98%), 52% involved travel abroad, 54% involved travel to the United States, and 38% involved Web-based or virtual technology (appendix table 5-22). Web-based or virtual technology was used far more by computer scientists (56%) than by other scientists and engineers engaged in international collaboration (38% overall). In many fields, a higher percentage of foreign-born than of U.S.-born research faculty travelled abroad for collaboration. More information on collaboration in scientific articles can be found in the next section.\nOutputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents\nChapter 2 of this volume discusses the human capital outputs of higher education in S&E. The present chapter focuses on the S&E functions of U.S. colleges and universities, including funding and performance, physical infrastructure, and human capital devoted to R&D. This section examines the intellectual output of academic S&E research using indicators derived from formal research articles and U.S. patent data.\nResearchers have traditionally published the results of their work in the world's peer-reviewed S&E journals,31 and article-level data from these journals are used here to explore total S&E research output by countries and--within the United States--by sectors of the economy.32 These socalled bibliometric data are also useful for tracking trends in S&E research collaboration using coauthorship measures between and among departments, institutions, sectors, and countries. (See sidebar \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology.\") Finally, citations in more current research articles\n\nto previous research offer insight into the importance and impact of previous research.\nThe 2008 edition of Indicators (NSB 2008) focused attention throughout these bibliometric indicators on three large geographic units: the United States, the 27 members of the European Union, and a group of 10 fast-growing countries in Asia. This edition adjusts that particular organization of the data to focus instead on five S&E article-producing countries/regions that together account for more than four-fifths of the world total: the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, and eight countries/economies together referred to as the \"Asia-8\" (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand).\nS&E researchers publish the results of their work in the peer-reviewed literature, and symbolic payment for their work is a citation to their article when it is used by future researchers (see Merton 1973). This recognition is uniquely valuable inside the scientific community, where it can be critical to career advancement, and does not necessarily reflect the value society might place on particular scientific findings.\nIn contrast, when researchers file for patent protection for a practical advance over \"prior art\" and the claim is granted in a successful patent, the patent owner obtains certain rights to the potential value of the advance. This chapter uses the patenting activities of U.S. academic institutions as another type of indicator of the outputs of academic S&E research. (Chapter 6, \"Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace,\" discusses patenting by other sectors in \"Global Trends in Patenting.\") Because citations to the S&E literature in successful patents indicate the use of past research in practical advances, literature/patent linkage data illuminate patterns of the impacts of academic S&E research on potential technological development.\nS&E Article Output\nBetween 1995 and 2007, the total world S&E article output as contained in the journals tracked by the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), which are analyzed in this chapter, grew at an average annual rate of 2.5% (table 5-14). Scientists and engineers in institutions in the member countries of the European Union authored or coauthored 32% of the world total in 2007,33 followed by the United States with 28%. China, Japan, and the Asia-8 accounted for another 22% of the world total (appendix table 5-25).34\nGrowth in S&E article output across these five countries/ regions has been uneven. Twelve-year growth rates in the mature economies of the U.S. (0.7%), Japan (1.0%), and the European Union (1.9%) have been lower than in the rapidly growing economies of the Asia-8 (9.0%) and China (16.5%) (appendix table 5-25; figure 5-20).\nExactly 200 countries or other entities35 receive credit for publishing S&E articles (appendix table 5-23). A small number account for most of the publications.36 Thus, table 5-14 shows that five countries (the U.S., China, Germany,\n\n\f5-30 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nBibliometric Data and Terminology\n\nThe article counts, coauthorship data, and citations discussed in this section are derived from S&E articles, notes, and reviews published in a set of scientific and technical journals tracked by Thomson Reuters in the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) (http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/). The data exclude letters to the editor, news stories, editorials, and other material whose purpose is not the presentation or discussion of scientific data, theory, methods, apparatus, or experiments. The data are refined in a database prepared for NSF by The Patent BoardTM, formerly CHI Research, Inc., under a license agreement between The Patent BoardTM and Thomson Reuters.\nJournal Selection. Since Science and Engineering Indicators 2004, this section has used a changing set of journals that reflects the current mix of journals and articles in the world, rather than a fixed journals set. Thomson Reuters selects journals each year as described at http://www. thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/free/essays/journal_selection_process/, and the selected journals become part of the SCI and SSCI portions of the Web of Science, a digital data product. Using citation data, Thomson Reuters then creates subsets of the SCI and SSCI that are available on CD-ROM and in print. These published data files are notable for the relatively high citation rank of the journals within their corresponding S&E subfields and the exclusion of journals of only regional interest, especially in the social sciences. Likewise, a declining citation rank can result in the removal of a journal from these highly selective data products.\nUsing the CD-ROM data, the Patent BoardTM updates the NSF master file of journals; the number of journals analyzed by NSF from SCI/SSCI was 4,093 in 1988 and 5,266 in 2008. These journals give good coverage of a core set of internationally recognized peer-reviewed scientific journals. The coverage extends to electronic-only journals and print journals with electronic versions. In the period 1995\u00ad2008, the database contained 9,358,420 S&E notes, reviews, and articles.\nArticle Data. Except where noted, author means departmental or institutional author. Articles are attributed\n\nto countries or sectors by the country or sector of the institutional address(es) given in the articles. If no institutional affiliation is listed, the article is excluded from the counts in this chapter. Likewise, coauthorship refers to institutional coauthorship. An article is considered coauthored only if it shows different institutional affiliations or different departments of the same institution; multiple listings of the same department of an institution are considered as one institutional author. The same logic applies to cross-sector and international collaboration.\nTwo methods of counting articles are used: fractional and whole counts. Fractional counting is used for article and citation counts. In fractional counting, credit for multiauthor articles is divided among the collaborating institutions or countries based on the proportion of their participating departments or institutions. Whole counting is used for coauthorship data. In whole counting, each institution or country receives one credit for its participation in the article.\nSeveral changes introduced in this edition of Indicators inhibit comparison with data from the same source used in previous editions.\n Previous editions reported data based on the year an article entered the database (tape year), not on the year it was published (publication year). NSF analysis has shown that, for the U.S. data, each new tape year file fails to capture from 10% to 11% of articles that will eventually be reported for the most current publication year; for some countries, the discrepancy is much larger. Here, data in the first section only (\"S&E Article Output\") are reported by publication year through 2007, which contains virtually complete data for this and prior publication years.\n Publication data in the remaining bibliometrics sections (\"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors,\" \"Coauthorship and Collaboration,\" and \"Trends in Citation of S&E Articles\") are reported by tape year through 2008.\nThe regions and countries/economies included in the bibliometric data are listed in appendix table 5-23. Data reported in this section are grouped into 13 broad S&E fields and 125 subfields, which are listed in appendix table 5-24.\n\nJapan, and the United Kingdom) accounted for more than 50% of the total world S&E article output in 2007. The 45 countries in table 5-14--less than one-quarter of the countries in the data--produced 98% of the world total of S&E articles. Nevertheless, the data are constantly evolving to reflect changes in the makeup of nations around the world or the sudden appearance of an author from a heretofore nonpublishing country.37\n\nTrends in Country and Regional Authorship Steadily increasing investments in S&E education and\nresearch infrastructure in many countries, especially in Asia, have led to increased R&D in those countries and laid the groundwork for increased research productivity. As a result, scientists and engineers in those countries are increasingly prominent contributors to international peerreviewed journals.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-31\n\nTable 5-14 S&E articles in all fields, by country/economy: 1995 and 2007\n\nRank Country\n\n1995\n\n2007\n\nAverage annual change (%)\n\nPercent of total (2007)\n\n2007 cumulative world total (%)\n\nna World ...........................\n\n564,645\n\n758,142\n\n2.5\n\nna\n\nna\n\n1 United States ...........\n\n193,337\n\n209,695\n\n0.7\n\n27.7\n\n27.7\n\n2 China........................\n\n9,061\n\n56,806\n\n16.5\n\n7.5\n\n35.2\n\n3 Japan .......................\n\n47,068\n\n52,896\n\n1.0\n\n7.0\n\n42.1\n\n4 United Kingdom.......\n\n45,498\n\n47,121\n\n0.3\n\n6.2\n\n48.3\n\n5 Germany ..................\n\n37,645\n\n44,408\n\n1.4\n\n5.9\n\n54.2\n\n6 France......................\n\n28,847\n\n30,740\n\n0.5\n\n4.1\n\n58.3\n\n7 Canada ....................\n\n23,740\n\n27,799\n\n1.3\n\n3.7\n\n61.9\n\n8 Italy ..........................\n\n17,880\n\n26,544\n\n3.3\n\n3.5\n\n65.4\n\n9 Spain........................\n\n11,316\n\n20,981\n\n5.3\n\n2.8\n\n68.2\n\n10 South Korea .............\n\n3,803\n\n18,467\n\n14.1\n\n2.4\n\n70.6\n\n11 India .........................\n\n9,370\n\n18,194\n\n5.7\n\n2.4\n\n73.0\n\n12 Australia ...................\n\n13,125\n\n17,831\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n75.4\n\n13 Netherlands .............\n\n12,089\n\n14,210\n\n1.4\n\n1.9\n\n77.3\n\n14 Russia ......................\n\n18,603\n\n13,953\n\n-2.4\n\n1.8\n\n79.1\n\n15 Taiwan......................\n\n4,759\n\n12,742\n\n8.6\n\n1.7\n\n80.8\n\n16 Brazil ........................\n\n3,436\n\n11,885\n\n10.9\n\n1.6\n\n82.3\n\n17 Sweden....................\n\n9,287\n\n9,914\n\n0.5\n\n1.3\n\n83.6\n\n18 Switzerland ..............\n\n7,220\n\n9,190\n\n2.0\n\n1.2\n\n84.9\n\n19 Turkey ......................\n\n1,715\n\n8,638\n\n14.4\n\n1.1\n\n86.0\n\n20 Poland......................\n\n4,549\n\n7,136\n\n3.8\n\n0.9\n\n86.9\n\n21 Belgium....................\n\n5,172\n\n7,071\n\n2.6\n\n0.9\n\n87.9\n\n22 Israel ........................\n\n5,741\n\n6,622\n\n1.2\n\n0.9\n\n88.7\n\n23 Denmark ..................\n\n4,330\n\n5,236\n\n1.6\n\n0.7\n\n89.4\n\n24 Finland .....................\n\n4,077\n\n4,989\n\n1.7\n\n0.7\n\n90.1\n\n25 Greece .....................\n\n2,058\n\n4,980\n\n7.6\n\n0.7\n\n90.8\n\n26 Austria......................\n\n3,425\n\n4,825\n\n2.9\n\n0.6\n\n91.4\n\n27 Iran...........................\n\n279\n\n4,366\n\n25.7\n\n0.6\n\n92.0\n\n28 Mexico .....................\n\n1,937\n\n4,223\n\n6.7\n\n0.6\n\n92.5\n\n29 Norway.....................\n\n2,920\n\n4,079\n\n2.8\n\n0.5\n\n93.1\n\n30 Singapore.................\n\n1,141\n\n3,792\n\n10.5\n\n0.5\n\n93.6\n\n31 Czech Republic........\n\n1,955\n\n3,689\n\n5.4\n\n0.5\n\n94.0\n\n32 Portugal ...................\n\n990\n\n3,424\n\n10.9\n\n0.5\n\n94.5\n\n33 Argentina..................\n\n1,967\n\n3,362\n\n4.6\n\n0.4\n\n94.9\n\n34 New Zealand............\n\n2,442\n\n3,173\n\n2.2\n\n0.4\n\n95.4\n\n35 South Africa .............\n\n2,351\n\n2,805\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n\n95.7\n\n36 Ireland ......................\n\n1,218\n\n2,487\n\n6.1\n\n0.3\n\n96.1\n\n37 Hungary ...................\n\n1,764\n\n2,452\n\n2.8\n\n0.3\n\n96.4\n\n38 Egypt........................\n\n1,388\n\n1,934\n\n2.8\n\n0.3\n\n96.6\n\n39 Ukraine.....................\n\n2,516\n\n1,847\n\n-2.5\n\n0.2\n\n96.9\n\n40 Chile.........................\n\n889\n\n1,740\n\n5.8\n\n0.2\n\n97.1\n\n41 Thailand ...................\n\n340\n\n1,728\n\n14.5\n\n0.2\n\n97.3\n\n42 Slovenia ...................\n\n434\n\n1,280\n\n9.4\n\n0.2\n\n97.5\n\n43 Romania...................\n\n678\n\n1,252\n\n5.2\n\n0.2\n\n97.7\n\n44 Croatia .....................\n\n600\n\n1,102\n\n5.2\n\n0.1\n\n97.8\n\n45 Serbia.......................\n\nNA\n\n1,057\n\nNA\n\n0.1\n\n98.0\n\nna = not applicable; NA = not available\nNOTES: Countries shown produced >1,000 articles in 2007.

In the major Asian countries, average annual growth rates between 1995 and 2007 were highest in China, at 17%. Across the Asia-8 countries, growth rates have been 9% annually for the same period (appendix table 5-25), led by Thailand (15%), South Korea (14%), Singapore (11%), and Taiwan (9%) (table 5-14). These growth rates mirror those in R&D expenditures and number of researchers. Japan's growth in article output averaged a modest 1% annually between 1995 and 2007. China's rapid growth rate in S&E article output propelled it in 2007 past the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan to rank as the world's secondlargest producer, up from 5th place in 2005 and 14th place in 1995 (appendix table 5-25).38 During the same period, South Korea went from 22nd to 10th place.\nThese high rates of growth in S&E article authorship in Asia contrast with much slower rates for the world as a whole (2.5%), for countries with mature S&E infrastructures such as the United States (0.7%), and for the European Union (1.9%) (appendix table 5-25). Russia's article output decreased over the period, from 18,600 in 1995 to 14,000 in 2007, as did Ukraine's, from 2,500 to 1,800. Many of the other former republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) experienced negative growth on this indicator as well.\n\nCountries within the European Union showed different trends in S&E article output between 1995 and 2007. Growth rates below 3% were common, for example, in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. Among the lowest rates of growth on this indicator were the United Kingdom (0.3%), France (0.5%), and Sweden (0.5%). Relatively high growth was experienced by the Czech Republic (5.4%), Greece (7.6%), Ireland (6.1%), Portugal (10.9%), and Spain (5.3%). Although not a member of the European Union, Turkey experienced one of the fastest growth rates in S&E article output in the world: 14.4% annually (from 1,700 articles in 1995 to 8,600 in 2007 (appendix table 5-25).\nThe countries in Central and South America together increased their S&E article output between 1995 and 2007 at an annual rate of 7.8%. Among the Central and South American countries that had more than 1,000 articles in 2007, Brazil had the highest growth rate (10.9%), followed by Mexico (6.7%), Chile (5.8%), and Argentina (4.6%). Brazil is also steadily increasing in rank among the world's S&E article producers: it was 23rd in 1995 and 16th in 2007 (table 5-14).\nAcross North Africa and the Middle East, only Egypt (2.8% annual growth since 1995), Israel (1.2%), and Iran (25.7%) produced substantial numbers of S&E articles in 2007. Iran's growth rate was the fastest of all nations (see sidebar \"S&E Publishing Trends in Iran\").\nResearch Portfolios of Top Article-Producing Countries/Regions\nThe S&E article output of the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, and the Asia-8 together accounted for 82% of the world total in 2007 (appendix table 5-25). A field-by-field comparison across these five countries/regions provides a snapshot of their research portfolios, and strong differences are evident. China, Japan, and the Asia-8 emphasize the physical sciences more than the United States and the European Union. China's S&E research articles in chemistry and physics accounted for almost one-half of its total article production in 2007 (table 5-15). In Japan, these two fields accounted for 36%, and in the Asia-8, 37%, compared with 17% for the United States and 25% for the European Union. The proportions of all five portfolios in astronomy ()1.5%) and the geosciences (4.0%\u00ad5.5%) were similar.\nThese portfolios also vary in their emphasis on the life sciences (the biological, medical, agricultural, and other life sciences): the U.S. output in these fields accounted for 57% of its total, compared with 49% for the European Union, 25% for China, 45% for Japan, and 34% for the Asia-8 (table 5-15).\nA third strong contrast across the five countries/regions is the emphasis on engineering: S&E research publications with authors in Asia are relatively more heavily concentrated in engineering (China at 16%, Japan at 11%, and the Asia-8 at 19%) than those with authors in the United States (7%) or the European Union (8%).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-33\n\nS&E Publishing Trends in Iran\n\nIran-based authors produced 4,400 articles in 2007, and Iran's S&E publication growth rate has been the fastest in the world. Growth in publications has been strong across many fields, resulting in a 2007 publication portfolio weighted toward chemistry (30% of the total), engineering (15%), the medical sciences (14%), the biological sciences (14%), and physics (14%) (appendix tables 5-25 through 5-38).\nIran has an evolving science policy framework and a growing number of research institutions to carry out the framework (UNCTAD 2005).

Current policy envisions a more diversified economy and a transition to development and production of petrochemicals and other high-technology products.\nIran's pattern of international coauthorship has mirrored that of other countries with immature S&E capabilities: they coauthor internationally at very high rates, but these rates decline as domestic capacity builds. Iran's rate of international coauthorship was 42% in 1988 but had declined to 25% in 2008, near the world average of 22% (figure 5-A; see also figure 5-21).\nDespite a declining rate of international coauthorship Iran's total number of international coauthorships has been growing steadily, and coauthorships with each of its main foreign coauthor countries have also been growing.

(Indicators of cross-sector coauthorship, which are available only for the United States, are examined below in the section \"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors.\"\n\nIndicators of collaboration using different data are discussed earlier in this chapter under \"Collaborative Research\" in the \"Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia\" section.

The average number of authors per paper was more than five in astronomy, physics, the biological sciences, and the medical sciences. Growth in the average number of coauthors was slowest in the social sciences (from 1.4 authors per paper in 1988 to 1.9 in 2008) and in mathematics (from 1.5 in 1988 to 2.0 in 2008). Unpublished NSF analyses show that in 2008, 90% of all S&E articles had at least two author names.\nA closely related indicator, coauthored articles (i.e., articles with authors in different departments or institutions), has also increased steadily. Coauthored articles grew from 40% of the world's total S&E articles in 1988 to 64% in 2008 (figure 5-21). This growth has two parts. Coauthored articles that list only domestic institutions in the byline grew from 32% of all articles in 1988 to 42% in 2008. Articles that list institutions from more than one country, that is, internationally coauthored articles (which also may have multiple domestic institutional authors) grew from 8% to 22% over the same period. The remainder of this section focuses on these internationally coauthored articles.\nInternational Coauthorship From a Regional Perspective\nFrom the perspective of large article-producing countries/ regions, interregional coauthorship has increased steadily.41 From 1998 to 2008, interregional coauthorship increased as a percentage of the total article output of the United States (from 20% to 30%), the European Union (from 21% to 29%), Japan (17% to 26%), and the Asia-8 (22% to 27%) (table 5-17). Notably, China failed to increase on this indicator: as\n\nTable 5-16 Authors per S&E article, by field: 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008\n\nField\n\n1988 1993 1998 2003 2008\n\nAll fields ............................. 3.1 3.4 3.8 4.2 4.7 Engineering .................... 2.5 2.8 3.1 3.4 3.8 Astronomy...................... 2.5 3.2 3.6 4.5 5.9 Chemistry....................... 3.1 3.3 3.6 3.9 4.3 Physics .......................... 3.3 3.8 4.2 4.7 5.3 Geosciences .................. 2.4 2.7 3.2 3.5 4.0 Mathematics .................. 1.5 1.6 1.8 1.9 2.0 Computer sciences........ 1.9 2.0 2.3 2.6 3.0 Agricultural sciences...... 2.7 2.9 3.3 3.8 4.3 Biological sciences ........ 3.3 3.7 4.2 4.6 5.3 Medical sciences ........... 3.6 4.1 4.5 5.0 5.6 Other life sciences ......... 2.0 2.1 2.4 2.9 3.2 Psychology .................... 2.0 2.2 2.5 2.8 3.2 Social sciences .............. 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.8 1.9\n\nNOTE: Articles classified by year they entered database rather than year of publication.\nSOURCES: Thomson Reuters, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, http://thomsonreuters.com/products_ services/science/; The Patent BoardTM; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-35\n\nCan Bibliometric Data Provide Accurate Indicators of Interdisciplinary Research?\n\nTo address the need for indicators of interdisciplinary research (IDR), NSF/SRS commissioned a panel of researchers* to review recent attempts to measure the growth of interdisciplinary S&E research. The panel reviewed 74 publications dealing with IDR. It concluded that, despite increased study of IDR in the literature, existing indicators of IDR based solely on bibliometric data were unsatisfactory for management and policy purposes and relied on an overly simplistic concept of IDR (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009; Wagner et al. 2009). The panel also found that problems with current data sources and analytical techniques raise questions about the validity of these measures.\nThe panel concluded that conceptualization of IDR involves both the outputs of research and research processes: it stressed that both social developments (e.g., new S&E working relationships, new career trajectories, new institutions) and cognitive developments (e.g., new theory, new ways of using existing data, new problem frameworks) are essential markers of IDR. Bibliometric data alone do not capture these dimensions of IDR.\nThe panel identified an emerging consensus that studies of IDR need measures of knowledge integration that could be applied to the work of either a team of researchers or an individual. However, they found limited agreement on what such integration entails and even less agreement on what would count as evidence of it.\nThe panel also assessed the limitations of current attempts at measurement of IDR, most of which use Thomson Reuters data products. These are organized into a structure based on the discipline of the journal in which articles are published. Studies then measure the \"cognitive distance\" reflected by the diversity of citations in their target data (authors, articles, journals) from the Thomson\n\nReuters journal structure and treat this distance as the measure of IDR.\nAlternative analytical techniques are under development. These use statistical and visualization techniques that seek to detect certain hidden structures in the data that may indicate IDR. However, these techniques still require validation. Bibliometric measures will also need to be supplemented by survey data, ethnographic studies, expert review, and other evidence to confirm the degree of interdisciplinarity in research output. Indicators of IDR may also vary depending on user needs. For example, measurements of IDR appropriate for projects, programs, and nations are likely to be different. The panel summarized its conclusions as follows (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009, p 9-10, 16):\n The Panel's consensus...is that it is premature to identify one or a small set of indicators or measures of interdisciplinary research...in part, because of a lack of understanding of how current attempts to measure IDR conform to the actual process and practice of interdisciplinary research, and the outcomes resulting from that practice.\n The literature is rich and maturing, but has not reached a point that permits meaningful assessment of IDR, especially for public policy and research management purposes. ____________________\n*The assessment was performed by three researchers at SRI International, Caroline S. Wagner, J. David Roessner, and Kamau Bobb, working with the following experts on interdisciplinarity and visualization: Katy B\u00f6rner, Indiana University; Kevin W. Boyack, SciTech Strategies, Inc.; Joann Keyton, North Carolina State University; Julie Thompson Klein, Wayne State University; and Ismael Rafols, University of Sussex. These eight researchers are referred to as the \"panel\" in this sidebar.\n\na percentage of its total S&E article output, China's interregionally coauthored articles declined from 26% in 1998 to 25% in 2008.\nAs a percentage of the world's interregionally coauthored articles, the shares of articles with a U.S., European Union, or Japanese institutional author declined slightly, giving way to a rise in the share of articles with an institutional author from China (from 6% to 13%) or the Asia-8 (from 9% to 14%). These changes in share of the world's interregional articles are similar to the changes in each region's share of all the world's articles.\nThe other regions identified in table 5-17 tend to have a less-developed S&E infrastructure, and scientists and engineers in those regions tend more often to coauthor articles with colleagues in the more scientifically advanced regions/ countries. For example, in 2008, 41% of all S&E articles with an institutional author from the Near East/North Africa\n\n(which includes Israel) had an author from another region, as did 61% of S&E articles with an institutional author from Sub-Saharan Africa (which includes South Africa). The following sections look more closely at coauthorship patterns of specific countries and country pairs.\nInternational Coauthorship Patterns From a Country Perspective\nWhen the region-level data discussed in the previous section are disaggregated to the country level, a richer picture of international S&E article coauthorship emerges. Table 5-18 displays the international coauthorship rates of countries that had institutional authors on at least 5% or more of the world's internationally coauthored S&E articles in 2008 (see also appendix tables 5-39 and 5-40).\nThe sheer volume of U.S. internationally coauthored articles dominates these measures: 30% of U.S. articles in 2008\n\n\f5-36 \n\nChapter 5.

The next highest percentages of the world's coauthored articles were held by Germany and the United Kingdom, each at 19% of the world total.\nEven higher rates of international coauthorship are evident among the countries of the European Union and in Switzerland. Both Japan's and the Asia-8's international coauthorship rates have increased over the past 10 years.\nWhat accounts for specific coauthorship relationships? Narin and colleagues (1991) concluded that \"the direction of international coauthorship is heavily dependent on linguistic and historical factors.\" Coauthorship data suggest that geography, cultural relations, and the language of particular pairs or sets of countries play a role (Gl\u00e4nzel and Schubert 2005; Schubert and Gl\u00e4nzel 2006), and these preferences have been evolving over time (Gl\u00e4nzel 2001). In more recent years, European Union policies and incentives that foster intra-European Union, cross-border collaboration are also partly responsible for some high rates of coauthorship. The discussion below in the section \"International Collaboration in S&E\" identifies strong coauthorship relations in specific country pairs across the world, based on the strength of their coauthorship rates.\n\nTable 5-17 Interregional collaboration on S&E articles: 1998 and 2008\n(Percent)\n\nShare of region's/ country's total article output\n\nShare of world's interregional articles\n\nRegion/country\n\n1998 2008\n\n1998 2008\n\nUnited States.............. 20\n\n30\n\nEU............................... 21\n\n29\n\nOther Western\n\nEurope....................... 43\n\n48\n\nAsia............................. 18\n\n23\n\nChina....................... 26\n\n25\n\nJapan ...................... 17\n\n26\n\nAsia-8...................... 22\n\n27\n\nOther Asia ............... 62\n\n65\n\nOther former USSR .... 31\n\n42\n\nNear East/\n\nNorth Africa ............... 39\n\n41\n\nCentral/\n\nSouth America .......... 39\n\n40\n\nSub-Saharan Africa .... 47\n\n61\n\nOther........................... 31\n\n43\n\n57\n\n55\n\n66\n\n61\n\n12\n\n12\n\n25\n\n34\n\n6\n\n13\n\n13\n\n11\n\n9\n\n14\n\n1\n\n1\n\n11\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n9\n\n9\n\n3\n\n4\n\n20\n\n21\n\nEU = European Union; USSR = Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nNOTES: Interregionally coauthored articles have at least one collaborating institution from indicated region/country and an institution from outside that region/country.

U.S. authors are most likely to coauthor with colleagues from the United Kingdom (13.9%), Germany (12.7%), Canada (12.0%), and China (10.4%--up from 3.5% in 1998).\nTable 5-18 shows that the rate at which U.S. researchers participate in international collaboration is below that of many countries with smaller science establishments. However, because of the size of the S&E establishment in the United States, the share of U.S. internationally coauthored articles that were coauthored with any other country is lower than the share of the other country's internationally coauthored articles that were coauthored with U.S. researchers (table 5-19).

Again, 51% of scientists and engineers in Canada who coauthored internationally collaborated with U.S. colleagues, but only 12% of U.S. international coauthorship was with colleagues at Canadian institutions;42 linguistic, geographic, and other ties combine to facilitate these collaborations.\nNotable changes in these patterns of U.S. international coauthorship parallel changes in other indicators discussed in this section. As China's total S&E article output grew rapidly, so did its coauthorship with U.S. authors: the U.S. share of China's internationally coauthored articles increased about 6 percentage points over the past decade, and China's share of U.S. internationally coauthored articles increased almost 7 percentage points (table 5-19). U.S. scientists and engineers lost relative share of international coauthorship with some countries/\n\neconomies, notably India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, as their counterparts in those countries/economies broadened the geographic scope of their collaborative relations.\nInternational Collaboration in S&E In developing indicators of international collaboration\nbetween countries and across regions, researchers have developed statistical techniques that account for unequal sizes in countries' S&E article output and coauthorship patterns (Gl\u00e4nzel and Schubert 2004). One of the simplest is the index of international collaboration (table 5-20), which is defined as the ratio of country A's rate of collaboration with country B divided by country B's rate of total international coauthorship (Narin, Stevens, and Whitlow 1991). Indexes above 1 represent rates of coauthorship that are higher than expected, and indexes below 1 indicate rates of coauthorship that are lower than expected. For example, if country B produces 12% of internationally coauthored articles, and 12% of country A's coauthored articles are with country B, the index of international collaboration is 12%/12% = 1.0. The indexes for all pairs of countries that produced more than 1% of all internationally coauthored articles in 2008 are shown in appendix table 5-41.\nTable 5-20 lists the international collaboration index for selected pairs of countries. In North America, the Canada-United States index shows a rate of collaboration that is slightly greater than would be expected based solely on the number of internationally coauthored articles shared by these two countries, and the index has changed little over the past decade. The Mexico-United States index is just about as would be predicted and is also stable.\nCollaboration indexes between pairs of countries on opposite sides of the North Atlantic are all low and have changed little over the decade. In Europe, collaboration patterns are mixed, but most have increased over the decade, indicating growing integration across the European Union in terms of S&E article publishing. Among the large publishing countries of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, collaboration was less than expected but grew in all three countries over the decade.\nThe Scandinavian countries43 increased their coauthorship indexes with many countries in Europe (appendix table 5-41), and within Scandinavia, the indexes are among the highest in the world and, overall, have been growing stronger (table 5-20).\nCross-Pacific collaboration patterns are mixed. JapanUnited States collaboration fell below the expected value over the decade, while the China-United States index rose to near 1. U.S. collaboration indexes with South Korea and Taiwan declined but remained higher than expected in both cases. Canadian scientists and engineers were less likely than their U.S. neighbors to have coauthored with colleagues in Asia. Mexico's collaboration with Argentina is almost four times higher than expected, at 3.74 in 2008. In South America, the collaboration index of Argentina-Brazil, at 5.32, is one of the highest in the world.\n\n\f5-38 \n\nChapter 5.

The number of articles produced by scientists and engineers in the federal government and in industry was more than 15,000 in 1995 but slowly declined to range between 13,000 and 14,000 each through 2008 (figure 5-22). State and local government authorship, dominated by articles in the medical and biological sciences, remained constant across the decade. Between 1995 and 2008, scientists and engineers in the private nonprofit sector increased their output from about 15,000 to about 18,000.\nFederally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) are research institutions sponsored by federal agencies and administered by universities, industry, or other nonprofit institutions. FFRDCs have specialized research agendas closely related to the mission of the sponsoring agency and may house large and unique research\n\n-PN\\YL  :\n, HY[PJSL V\\[W\\[ VM <: UVUHJHKLTPJ ZLJ[VYZ!  \u00b6\n;OV\\ZHUKZ\n\n7YP]H[L UVUWYVMP[\n\n-LKLYHS\n\n\n\nNV]LYUTLU[\n\n0UK\\Z[Y` \n\n--9+*Z \n:[H[LSVJHS NV]LYUTLU[\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--9+* $ MLKLYHSS` M\\UKLK YLZLHYJO HUK KL]LSVWTLU[ JLU[LY\n56;,:!

Academic Research and Development\n\ninstruments not otherwise available in other research venues. Although authors at FFRDCs published articles in all of the broad S&E fields considered in this chapter, articles in physics, chemistry, and engineering together represented 69% of publication by this sector in 2008, reflecting its specialized research programs. Physics articles accounted for 39% of the FFRDC total (9% of the total for all sectors); engineering articles for 15% (7% of the total for all sectors); and chemistry articles for 16% (8% of the total for all sectors (appendix table 5-42).\nThe 16 FFRDCs sponsored by the Department of Energy dominated S&E publishing by this sector. Across all fields of S&E, DOE-sponsored labs accounted for 83% of the total for the sector in 2005 (NSB 2008). Scientists and engineers at DOE-sponsored FFRDCs published 96% of the sector's articles in chemistry, 95% in physics, and 90% in engineering (see \"S&E Articles From Federally Funded Research and Development Centers,\" NSB 2008, p 5-47). Nine other federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Transportation, and Treasury; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and National Science Foundation also sponsor another 23 FFRDCs (NSF/SRS 2009a).\nIn contrast, articles published by authors in the private nonprofit sector are primarily in the medical sciences (55% of the sector's articles in 2008) and biological sciences (25%) (appendix table 5-42). Federal government authors show a similar pattern, with 30% in the biological sciences and 27% in the medical sciences.\nTrends in Sector Coauthorship This section considers coauthorship data as an indicator\nof collaboration at the sectoral level between U.S. institutional authors and between U.S. sectors and foreign institutions.45 These data show that the growing integration of R&D activities, as measured by coauthorship, is occurring across the full range of R&D-performing institutions internationally as well as domestically.\nBetween 1998 and 2008, coauthorship within sectors increased for all U.S. sectors.46 Coauthorship within academia rose from 38% in 1998 to 45% in 2008. FFRDC-FFRDC coauthorship increased 5 percentage points (table 5-21).\nU.S. cross-sectoral coauthorships show a mixed pattern between 1998 and 2008. Coauthorship between FFRDCs and industry decreased. (Articles authored by industry physicists have been declining gradually across the period. Since a strong emphasis of FFRDC-authored articles is in physics (39%), it may be that fewer and fewer physicists are available in industry for potential coauthorship with physicists in FFRDCs.)47 The largest gains in all sectors (6.8\u00ad9.8 percentage points) were with coauthors in academia, by far the largest sector with the largest pool of potential S&E coauthors. Cross-sector coauthorship with academic authors was higher in 2008 (54%\u00ad74%) than intrasector coauthorship within academia (45%), and cross-sector coauthorship with academia\n\nwas higher in all sectors than any intrasector coauthorship (table 5-21).\nExcept for the decline in coauthorship between FFRDCs and industry, the indicators presented in this section hint at increasing integration between and among the different types of U.S. institutions that publish the results of R&D in the scientific and technical literature. Growth in coauthorship has been particularly strong between U.S. authors in academia and in all other sectors. Because of the predominance of the academic sector in S&E article publishing in the United States, academic scientists and engineers have been on the forefront of the integration of S&E research across institutions, both nationally and internationally.\nInternational collaboration increased rapidly in the United States. International coauthorship rates rose by 7\u00ad10 percentage points between 1998 and 2008 (table 5-21). Authors at FFRDCs reached the highest rate of collaboration with foreign authors, at 42%, followed by industry and academia at 29% each. Astronomers in most U.S. sectors increased their rates of international coauthorship the most rapidly, and geoscientists, mathematicians, and physicists in most U.S. sectors also increased their collaboration with international colleagues at a higher-than-average pace (NSB 2008, 08-01A, p A5-66).\nTrends in Citation of S&E Articles\nCitations indicate influence. When scientists and engineers cite the published papers resulting from prior S&E research, they are formally crediting the influence of that research on their own work. Like the indicators of international coauthorship discussed above, cross-national citations are evidence that S&E research is increasingly international in scope. Between 1992 and 2008, international citations grew faster than total citations: 5.8% annually versus 4.6% (figure 5-23). By 2008, international citations were two-thirds of all citations.48\nTwo other trends accompanied the steady growth of international citations in the world's S&E literature: changing shares of total citations across countries and changing shares of highly cited S&E literature. These are discussed in the following sections.\nCitation Trends in a Global Context Shares of the world total of citations to S&E research ar-\nticles have changed concurrently with shares of the world total of these articles. Appendix table 5-43 shows, for example, that between 1994\u00ad96 and 2004\u00ad06, the U.S. share of world S&E articles declined from 34% to 29% across all fields;49 the U.S. share declined in every broad field, although the decline varied in size. Table 5-22 shows the parallel trends for the U.S. share of citations and indicates an even larger decline, from 47% to 38%.\nChina's share of both total world S&E articles and citations increased over the same period. However, in contrast to the global trend of increasing international citations, China's pattern has been different. Unlike the United States and other large article-producing countries, China's share of international citations decreased between 1998 and 2008, from\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-41\n\nTable 5-21 U.S. article coauthorship, by sector, foreign coauthorship, and U.S. coauthor sector: 1998 and 2008\n(Percent)\n\nU.S. coauthor sector\n\nYear/sector\n\nForeign\n\nFederal State/local Academic\n\nPrivate\n\ncoauthor FFRDCs government government institutions Industry nonprofit\n\n1998\n\nFederal government....................................... 19.7\n\n3.2\n\n17.4\n\nIndustry .......................................................... 19.7\n\n3.3\n\n9.6\n\nAcademic....................................................... 19.6\n\n2.6\n\n7.8\n\nFFRDCs ......................................................... 32.9\n\n12.6\n\n8.6\n\nPrivate nonprofit ............................................ 17.8\n\n1.2\n\n8.0\n\nState/local government.................................. 10.9\n\n0.5\n\n13.9\n\n2008\n\nFederal government....................................... 27.4\n\n4.0\n\n20.5\n\nIndustry .......................................................... 29.2\n\n3.5\n\n10.5\n\nAcademic....................................................... 28.8\n\n3.2\n\n8.1\n\nFFRDCs ......................................................... 41.6\n\n17.6\n\n9.7\n\nPrivate nonprofit ............................................ 27.6\n\n1.6\n\n10.3\n\nState/local government.................................. 17.8\n\n0.6\n\n18.3\n\n1998\u00ad2008 change (percentage points)\n\nFederal government.......................................\n\n7.8\n\n0.8\n\n3.1\n\nIndustry ..........................................................\n\n9.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\nAcademic .......................................................\n\n9.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\nFFRDCs .........................................................\n\n8.7\n\n5.0\n\n1.1\n\nPrivate nonprofit ............................................\n\n9.7\n\n0.4\n\n2.2\n\nState/local government..................................\n\n6.9\n\n0.1\n\n4.4\n\n2.0 1.4 1.4 0.2 2.3 13.5\n2.9 1.9 1.5 0.2 2.7 15.6\n0.9 0.5 0.2\n* 0.5 2.1\n\n54.4\n\n9.0\n\n8.5\n\n44.8\n\n14.1\n\n8.9\n\n37.7\n\n6.0\n\n8.6\n\n48.5\n\n8.4\n\n3.4\n\n57.1\n\n8.0 24.3\n\n64.2\n\n8.8 16.2\n\n62.0\n\n9.5 12.9\n\n53.8\n\n17.9 13.5\n\n45.2\n\n6.4 10.5\n\n58.3\n\n7.6\n\n5.0\n\n63.9\n\n9.7 28.8\n\n74.0\n\n10.8 21.7\n\n7.6\n\n0.5\n\n4.5\n\n9.0\n\n3.8\n\n4.6\n\n7.5\n\n0.3\n\n1.9\n\n9.8\n\n-0.7\n\n1.6\n\n6.8\n\n1.8\n\n4.5\n\n9.8\n\n2.1\n\n5.5\n\n* = rounds to zero\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

High citation rates can indicate that an article has a greater impact on subsequent research than articles with lower citation rates.\nAppendix table 5-43 shows citation percentiles for 1998 and 2008 by field for the top five S&E article-producing countries/regions.50 In that table, a country whose research influence was disproportionate to its output would have higher numbers of articles in higher citation percentiles, whereas a country whose influence was less than its output would suggest would have higher numbers of articles in lower citation percentiles. In other words, a country whose research is highly influential would have higher shares of articles in higher citation percentiles.\n\nThis is the case in every field for U.S. articles. In both 1998 and 2008, as displayed in appendix table 5-43, the U.S. share of articles in the 99th percentile was higher than its share in the 95th percentile, and these were higher than its share in the 90th percentile, and so forth, even while U.S. shares of all articles and all citations were decreasing. In 2008, U.S. articles represented 29% of the world total of 2 million articles in the cited period shown; the U.S. authored 52% of the rare 19,500 articles in the 99th percentile and 25% of the 1.2 million articles below the 50th percentile. This broad pattern was unchanged from the 1998 pattern.\nCitations to the European Union's S&E articles displayed a different pattern: it had higher percentages of articles in the lower percentiles across all fields of S&E except in the agricultural sciences (appendix table 5-43). Figure 5-24 displays these relationships for all five countries/regions. Only U.S. publications display the preferred relationship of strongly higher proportions of articles in the higher percentiles of article citations; when cited, articles with authors from the European Union, China, Japan, and the Asia-8 are more\n\n\f5-42 \n\nChapter 5.

These data are summarized in appendix table 5-44. As the U.S. share of all articles produced declined between 1998 and 2008, its share\n\nof articles in the 99th percentile (i.e., the top 1%) of cited articles also declined, particularly in some fields. Shares in the top percentile increased for the European Union, China, Japan, and the Asia-8.\nWhen citation rates are normalized by the share of world articles during the citation period to produce an index of highly cited articles, the influence of U.S. articles is seen to have changed little over the past 10 years. Between 1998 and 2008, the U.S. index of highly cited articles barely changed (from 1.83 to 1.78) (figure 5-25; appendix table 5-44) and remained well above the expected index value of 1. During the same period, the European Union increased its index from 0.73 to 0.89, and China, Japan, and the Asia-8 increased their index values but remained below their expected values. In other words, the United States had 78% more articles than expected in the 99th percentile of cited articles in 2008, and the European Union had 11% fewer than expected. China had 58% fewer articles in the 99th percentile than expected in 2008, and Japan 42% fewer.\nThe United States experienced notable gains on the index of highly cited articles in engineering and computer sciences (although with relatively low counts in the latter) and a decline in chemistry (appendix table 5-44). The European Union reached its expected value in chemistry, physics, and the agricultural sciences. China achieved an index value of 1 in engineering and mathematics. Japan did not achieve its expected value in any broad field.\nAcademic Patents, Licenses, Royalties, and Startups\nOther indicators of academic R&D outputs reflect universities' efforts to capitalize on their intellectual property in the form of patents and associated activities.

To facilitate the conversion of new knowledge produced in their laboratories to patent-protected public knowledge that can be potentially licensed by others or form the basis for a startup firm, more and more research institutions established technology management/transfer offices (AUTM 2009).\nEfforts to encourage links between university-based research and commercial exploitation of the results of that research have been widely studied by researchers. Mowery (2002) notes the strong growth in funding by NIH and the predominance of biomedically related patenting by universities in the 1990s. Branstetter and Ogura (2005) identify a \"bio-nexus\" in patent-to-paper citations, and Owen-Smith and Powell (2003) explore the effects of an academic medical center as part of the \"scientific capacity\" of a research university. In a qualitative study of two research universities that would appear to have similar capacities, Owen-Smith and Powell (2001) examine the very different rates of invention disclosure of the two campuses. Stephan and colleagues (2007) found strong differences in patenting activity among university scientists by field of science; a strong relationship between publication activity and patenting by individual researchers; and patenting by university researchers in only a small proportion of the potential population.\nThe following sections discuss overall trends in university patenting and related indicators through 2007\u00ad08.\nUniversity Patenting Trends U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data show\nthat annual patent grants to universities and colleges ranged from 2,950 to 3,700 between 1998 and 2008 (appendix table 5-45). In 2008, just over 3,000 patents were awarded to colleges and universities in the United States.52 (Data in the next section on invention disclosures and applications suggest that patent grants to academic institutions may increase in the coming years.)\nThe top 200 R&D-performing institutions, with 96% of the total patents granted to U.S. universities during the 1998\u00ad2008 period, dominate among universities and university systems receiving patent protection.53 College and university patents as a percentage of U.S. nongovernmental patents fell from 5.2% in 1998 to 4.3% in 2008. Among the top R&D-performing institutions that received patents between 1998 and 2008, 19 accounted for more than 50% of all patents granted to these institutions (although these included a few multicampus systems, including the Universities of California and North Carolina).\nBetween 1998 and 2008, three technology areas dominated U.S. university patenting: chemicals (19%), biotechnology (15%), and pharmaceuticals (14%) (appendix table 5-46). In\n\n\f5-44 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nnumbers of patents, all three of these technology areas have declined from previous highs (figure 5-26). The next three highest technology areas over the period were semiconductors and electronics (6%), measurement and control equipment (5%), and computers and peripherals (5%), each accounting for about 200 patents in 2008 (appendix table 5-46).\nPatent-Related Activities and Income Data from the Association of University Technology\nManagers (AUTM) indicate continuing growth in a number of patent-related activities. Invention disclosures filed with university technology management offices describe prospective inventions and are submitted before a patent application is filed. These grew from 13,700 in 2003 to 17,700 in 2007 (notwithstanding a small decline in institutions responding\n\nto the AUTM survey over the same period) (appendix table 5-47). Likewise, new U.S. patent applications filed by AUTM respondents also increased, from 7,200 in 2003 to 10,900 in 2007. The AUTM survey respondents reported 348 startup companies formed in 2003 and 510 in 2007. The AUTM 2007 survey also found 3,148 cumulative, operational startup firms associated with U.S. university patenting and licensing activities (AUTM 2009).\nMost royalties from licensing agreements accrue to relatively few patents and the universities that hold them, and many of the AUTM respondent offices report negative income. (Thursby and colleagues [2001] note that the objectives of university technology management offices include more than royalty income.) At the same time, large onetime payments to a university can affect the overall trend\n\n-PN\\YL  0UKL_ VM OPNOS` JP[LK HY[PJSLZ I` ZLSLJ[LK MPLSK HUK YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`!

In 2007, the 161 institutions that responded to the AUTM survey reported a total of $1.9 billion in net royalties from their patent holdings (appendix table 5-47).\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the inventory of revenue-generating licenses and options across all AUTM respondent institutions increased from 9,000 to 12,500 (appendix table 5-47). New licenses and options executed grew over the period from about 3,900 in 2003 to 4,400 in 2007.\nPatent-to-Literature Citations\nCitations to the S&E literature on the cover pages of issued patents are one indicator of the contribution of research to the development of practical innovation.54 This indicator of science linkage to practical advance increased sharply in the late 1980's and early 1990's (Narin, Hamilton, and Olivastro 1997), due at least in part to developments in U.S. policy, industry growth and maturation, and court interpretation. At the same time, patenting activity by academic institutions was\n\nincreasing rapidly, as were patent citations to S&E literature produced across all sectors (NSB 2008, pp. 5-49 to 5-54).\nBetween 1998 and 2008, growth on this indicator was much slower. Of utility patents awarded to both U.S. and foreign assignees, the number citing S&E articles (11% of total utility patents awarded in 2008) grew 1.4% annually over the 10-year period, compared with 0.7% annually for all utility patents (appendix table 5-48). Much of the growth in S&E citing patents was in patents awarded to non-U.S. assignees: these grew 3.1% annually.\nFive broad S&E fields (the biological sciences, the medical sciences, chemistry, physics, and engineering) accounted for 97% of the total citations in these patents (appendix table 5-49 and figure 5-27). Citations to the biological sciences have decreased from their high of 58,000 in 1998 and 1999 but have more recently stabilized at around 50,000 per year. Citations to the medical sciences have increased since 2005 to about 26,000 in 2008.\nThe data discussed in the previous three paragraphs were heavily influenced by U.S. patents awarded to foreign assignees and references in those patents to non-U.S. S&E articles. Considering only citations to U.S. articles, overall growth in citations has been flat over the past 10 years (appendix table 5-48).

Growth in citations to academic papers (0.9% annually) and to FFRDC papers (4.6% annually) shows that citations to papers in these two sectors have been replacing declining citations to articles in other sectors. Citations to academic articles account for most of this replacement, despite the slower rate of growth in these citations. Of total citations to U.S. articles in 2008, 64% were to academic articles, compared with 2% to FFRDC articles.\nFigure 5-28 summarizes the increasing role of citations to U.S. academic articles in the science linkage to U.S. patents. Across all fields, academic articles made up 58% of total citations to U.S. articles in 1998 and 64% in 2008. Of the five broad fields of S&E that accounted for 97% of all patent citations to U.S. academic articles, increased shares of academic citations were notable in engineering (from 46% to 59%) and physics (from 43% to 65%). These increasing shares of patent citations to U.S. academic S&E articles are parallel to the increasing shares of academic S&E articles as compared with other sectors, as discussed above in the section \"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors.\"\nConclusion\nU.S. universities and colleges continue to be important performers of U.S. R&D, and particularly basic research. Both the overall academic S&E doctoral workforce and the academic research workforce have continued to increase. Citation data indicate that U.S. scientific publications remain\n\nhighly influential relative to those of other countries. While the United States continues to produce more S&E articles than any other country, its share of total world articles has declined due to high publication growth rates elsewhere, notably China.\nAlthough funding for academic R&D has been increasing, a number of shifts in funding sources have occurred. After increasing between 2000 and 2004, the federal government's share of funding for academic R&D decreased from 2005 through 2008. In addition, federal funding for academic R&D has either declined in constant dollars or remained flat since 2005. Industry support for academic R&D declined from 2002 to 2004 but rose again through 2008. The state and local government share of support for academic R&D has been generally declining since 1972, and the university share of support for academic R&D has been generally increasing.\nThe structure and organization of academic R&D have also changed. (See sidebar \"Publications and Resource Inputs.\") Research-performing colleges and universities continued to expand their stock of research space, particularly in the biological and medical sciences. The number of academic S&E doctoral researchers has grown over the past couple of decades, with the life sciences accounting for much of the trend. Life scientists accounted for more than a third of academic S&E doctoral researchers in 2006. Increasingly, these researchers are employed in postdoc or other nonfaculty positions. Particularly among life scientists, the number of new doctorate holders has increased greatly while the numbered\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-47\n\nPublications and Resource Inputs\n\nThe publication of research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals is a key output of scientific research. In the early 1990s, the number of S&E articles published by U.S. academic scientists and engineers in the world's major peer-reviewed journals plateaued while resource inputs--funds and personnel--kept increasing (figure 5-B). With some variations, this trend occurred across different types of institutions and different fields, despite increases in research inputs such as funds and personnel (NSF/SRS 2007).\nAn examination of relationships among publications, resource inputs, and institutional characteristics in the top 200 academic R&D institutions found that, with the possible exception of S&E faculty and the number of S&E doctoral recipients, inflation-adjusted resources for publications have increased faster than the number of publications. From 1990 to 2001, resource inputs increased per publication, with about 29% more resources consumed per fractional count publication in 2001 than in 1990. This pattern of increasing inputs required to yield the same quantity of publication outputs occurred across the entire U.S. academic system. Possible reasons for the increasing inputs per article include a rise in the complexity of research required for publication; costs for faculty, postdocs, S&E doctoral recipients, and research materials and equipment that are increasing faster than the gross domestic product implicit price deflator; and increased communication costs for collaboration (NSF/ SRS 2010, forthcoming). In figure 5-B, the steadily rising number of total author names on articles with at least one academic author is another indicator of the strong growth in research collaboration and article coauthorship noted elsewhere in this chapter.\n\n-PN\\YL ) <: HJHKLTPJ :\n, HY[PJSL V\\[W\\[ :\n, HY[PJSL H\\[OVY UHTLZ HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ HUK HJHKLTPJ 9\n+ ^VYRMVYJL!  \u00b6\n0UKL_   $ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(JHKLTPJ 9\n+ L_WLUKP[\\YLZ JVUZ[HU[  KVSSHYZ\n\n(\\[OVY UHTLZ\n\n\n\n(JHKLTPJ 9\n+\n\n\n\n^VYRMVYJL\n\n\n\n:\n, HY[PJSL V\\[W\\[\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n   \n\n56;,:! +H[H MVY HJHKLTPJ ^VYRMVYJL H]HPSHISL MVY VKK `LHYZ HUK \"   IHZL `LHY PZ H]LYHNL VM   HUK   KH[H (Y[PJSL HUK H\\[OVY JV\\U[Z HYL [^V`LHY TV]PUN H]LYHNL MYVT ZL[ VM QV\\YUHSZ JV]LYLK I` :JPLUJL *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ :*0 HUK :VJPHS :JPLUJLZ *P[H[PVU 0UKL_ ::*0 (\\[OVY JV\\U[Z PUJS\\KL HSS H\\[OVYZ VU HU` HY[PJSL ^P[O VUL VY TVYL <: HJHKLTPJ PUZ[P[\\[PVUHS HKKYLZZLZ\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 9LZLHYJO HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ ,_WLUKP[\\YLZ H[ <UP]LYZP[PLZ HUK *VSSLNLZ -@ \" :\\Y]L` VM +VJ[VYH[L 9LJPWPLU[Z ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ\" ;OVTZVU 9L\\[LYZ :*0 HUK ::*0 O[[W![OVTZVUYL\\[LYZJVTWYVK\\J[ZFZLY]PJLZZJPLUJL\" ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK;4\" 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nof tenured or tenure-track positions has remained relatively constant since the late 1980s.\nAcademic R&D is also becoming more international in a number of ways. U.S. academic scientists and engineers are collaborating extensively with colleagues in other countries: In 2008, 29% of journal articles with a U.S. academic author also had at least one coauthor from abroad. The intimate linkage between research and U.S. graduate education, regarded as a model by other countries, helps to bring large numbers of foreign students to the United States, many of whom stay after graduation. Academia has also been able to attract many talented foreign-born scientists and engineers into its workforce, with the percentage of foreign-born fulltime doctoral S&E faculty in research institutions approaching half the total in some fields.\n\nNotes\n1. See appendix table 5-6 for the fields and subfields included in science and engineering in this section.\n2. The academic R&D totals presented here exclude expenditures at federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) associated with universities. Those expenditures are tallied separately and are examined in greater detail in chapter 4. FFRDCs and other national laboratories (including federal intramural laboratories) also play an important role in academic research and education, providing research opportunities for both students and faculty at academic institutions and highly specialized shared research facilities.\n3. For this discussion, the terms universities and colleges, higher education, and academic institutions are used interchangeably and include only those schools that grant a\n\n\f5-48 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nbachelor's or higher degree in science or engineering and spend at least $150,000 for separately budgeted R&D in S&E.\n4. For the definitions used in NSF surveys and a fuller discussion of these concepts, see chapter 4 sidebar, \"Definitions of R&D.\"\n5. The discussion of federal support for academic R&D includes both obligation data from the funding source (federal agencies) and expenditures data from the performer (universities and colleges).\n6. The academic R&D reported here includes separately budgeted R&D and related recovered indirect costs as well as institutional estimates of unrecovered indirect costs associated with externally funded R&D projects, including mandatory and voluntary cost sharing.\n7. This funding was required to be obligated by the end of FY 2009; however, the expenditures for these projects will span several years.\n8. Performing and funding series may differ for many reasons. For a more detailed discussion of the differences between these two sources, see chapter 4 sidebar, \"Tracking R&D: Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures.\"\n9. Federal grants and contracts and awards from other sources that are passed through state and local governments to academic institutions are credited to the original provider of the funds.\n10. This follows a standard of reporting that assigns funds to the entity that determines how they are to be used rather than to the one that necessarily disburses the funds.\n11. The medical sciences include fields such as pharmacy, neuroscience, oncology, and pediatrics. The biological sciences include fields such as microbiology, genetics, epidemiology, and pathology. These distinctions may be blurred at times because boundaries between fields often are not well defined.\n12. In this section of the chapter and the section \"Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia,\" the broad S&E fields refer to the computer sciences, environmental sciences (sometimes referred to as \"earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences\"), life sciences, mathematical sciences, physical sciences, psychology, social sciences, other sciences (those not elsewhere classified), and engineering. The more disaggregated S&E fields are referred to as \"subfields.\" The fourth section of the chapter, \"Outputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents,\" groups the broad fields and subfields slightly differently (see sidebar \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology\" and appendix table 5-24).\n13. Data reported on non-S&E R&D expenditures are slightly lower-bound estimates for the national totals because NSF did not attempt to estimate for the 2.7% nonresponse rate on this item. Also, only institutions that conducted at least $150,000 of S&E R&D were surveyed. The activities of institutions that do not perform S&E R&D (but may conduct substantial amounts of non-S&E R&D) are not reflected here.\n\n14. Data on non-S&E R&D expenditures have only been collected since FY 2003, and response rates for years prior to 2006 make trend data unreliable.\n15. Another hypothesis is that some of the difference may be due to many public universities not having the incentive to negotiate full recovery of indirect costs of research because such funds are frequently returned to the state treasury rather than the institution.\n16. Amounts reported as passed through to higher education subrecipients do not precisely equal amounts reported as received by those subrecipients due to differences in timing and in the item response rates for these two survey questions each year.\n17. Because of rising capitalization thresholds, the dollar threshold for inclusion in the equipment category has likely changed over time. Generally, university equipment costing less than $5,000 would be classified under the cost category of \"supplies.\"\n18. The \"bricks and mortar\" section of the Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities asks institutions to report their research space only. The reported figures therefore do not include space used for other purposes such as instruction or administration. In the cyberinfrastructure section of the survey, however, respondents are asked to identify all of their cyberinfrastructure resources, regardless of whether these resources were used for research or other functions.\n19. Research-performing academic institutions are defined as colleges and universities that grant degrees in science or engineering and expend at least $1 million in R&D funds. Each institution's R&D expenditures are determined through the NSF Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\n20. Research space here is defined as the space used for sponsored R&D activities at academic institutions that is separately budgeted and accounted for. Research space is measured in net assignable square feet (NASF), the sum of all areas on all floors of a building assigned to, or available to be assigned to, an occupant for a specific use, such as research or instruction. NASF is measured from the inside faces of walls. Multipurpose space that is at least partially used for research is prorated to reflect the proportion of time and use devoted to research.\n21. The S&E fields used in the NSF Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities are based on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP). NCES updates CIP every 10 years. The S&E fields used in the FY 2007 Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities reflect the NCES 2000 CIP update. For a comparison of the subfields in the FY 2005 and FY 2007 surveys, see the S&E Research Facilities: FY 2007 detailed statistical tables.\n22. Institutional funds may include operating funds, endowments, tax-exempt bonds and other debt financing, indirect costs recovered from federal grants/contracts, and private donations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-49\n\n23. The United States is unlike many other countries in the fraction of doctorate holders who are employed in academia. A comparison of 1990\u00ad2006 doctorate recipients in 14 countries for which data are available found that in most of these countries, more than half of doctorate holders were employed in academia, compared with 47% for the United States. Only the United States, Austria, and Belgium had substantial fractions employed in the business sector, and the United States had one of the smallest fractions employed in government (OECD 2009).\n24. Psychology (also called a behavioral science) is discussed and broken out separately in tables from the social sciences because trends over time and characteristics of doctorate holders in psychology and social sciences differ.\n25. The inclusion or exclusion of those on temporary and permanent visas has little impact on the analysis. Data on Pacific Islanders were not collected separately from Asians before 2001. From 1975 to 1999, the Asian category includes Pacific Islanders, but from 2001 to 2006 it does not. In 2006, approximately 200 Pacific Islander doctoral S&E researchers were employed in academia. If combined with Asians, they would constitute less than 1% of the combined category.\n26. The Carnegie classification used in that report was the 1994 version.\n27. The switch to the American Community Survey as the sampling frame for the National Survey of College Graduates in 2010 and beyond may improve estimates of nonU.S.-trained doctorate holders in future years.\n28. Among all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, this is the case both in fields in which postdocs are prevalent (such as physical sciences and life sciences) and fields in which postdocs are less prevalent (such as computer sciences and mathematics).\n29. Interpretation of the data on federal support of academic researchers is complicated by a technical difficulty. Between 1993 and 1997, respondents to the Survey of Doctorate Recipients were asked whether work performed during the week of April 15 was supported by the federal government; in most other survey years, the reference was to the entire preceding year, and in 1985, it was to 1 month. However, the volume of academic research activity is not uniform over the entire academic year. A 1-week (or 1-month) reference period seriously understates the number of researchers supported at some time during an entire year. Thus, the numbers for 1985 and 1993\u00ad97 cannot be compared directly with results for the earlier years or with those from the 1999 through 2006 surveys, which again used an entire reference year.\nThe discussion in this edition of Indicators generally compares data for 2006 with data for 1991. All calculations express the proportion of those with federal support relative to the number responding to this question. The reader is cautioned that, given the nature of these data, the trends discussed are broadly suggestive rather than definitive. The reader also is reminded that the trends in the proportion of all\n\nacademic researchers supported by federal funds occurred against a background of rising overall numbers of academic researchers.\n30. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they \"Work with an immediate work group or team?\"; \"Work with others in the same organization (company, university, agency, etc.), but not the same group or team?\"; \"Work with individuals in other organizations in the U.S.?\"; and \"Work with individuals located in other countries?\"\n31. Publication traditions in broad S&E fields differ somewhat. For example, computer scientists often publish their findings in conference proceedings, and social scientists often write books as well as publish in journals. Proceedings and books are poorly covered in the data currently used in this chapter.\n32. The U.S. sector identification in this chapter is quite precise; to date, sector identification has not been possible for other countries.\n33. European Union data include all member states as of 2007 (see appendix table 5-23 for a list of member countries).\n34. The Asia-8 includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan.\n35. For example, Vatican City is not strictly a country; the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Hong Kong are contained in the data in earlier years, but the USSR no longer exists and Hong Kong data are now reported as part of China. See appendix table 5-23 for a list of the countries represented in the data.\n36. Distributions of data in which a small percentage of cases accounts for a significant amount of the total value across all cases belong to a group of statistical distributions collectively referred to as power law distributions (Adamic 2000). Other phenomena with such distributions include, e.g., earthquakes (among a large number of earthquakes only a few have great power) and Internet traffic (visits to a relatively small number of sites account for a very large proportion of visits to all sites).\n37. For example, Montenegro appeared in the data in 2006 for the first time as an independent country; the tiny Pacific island nation of Niue appeared in 2007 for the first time because a coauthor from that country appeared in the data.\n38. See also NSB 2008, table 5-21, for detail on field level ranks and changes in rank since 1995.\n39. Coauthorship data are a broad, though limited indicator of collaboration among scientists. Previous editions of Indicators discussed possible underlying drivers for increased collaboration, including scientific advantages of knowledge- and instrument-sharing, decreasing costs of travel and communication, national policies, and so forth (NSB 2006). Katz and Martin (1997), Bordons and G\u00f3mez (2000), and Laudel (2002) analyze limitations of coauthorship as an indicator of research collaboration. Other researchers have continued using these data (Adams et al. 2005; G\u00f3mez, Fern\u00e1ndez, and Sebasti\u00e1n 1999; Lundberg et al. 2006; Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007; Zitt, Bassecoulard, and Okubo 2000).\n\n\f5-50 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\n40. The reader is reminded that the data on which these indicators are based give the nationality of the institutional addresses listed on the article. Authors themselves are not associated with a particular institution and may be of any nationality. Therefore the discussion in this section is based on the nationality of institutions, not authors, and makes no distinction between nationality of institutions and nationality of authors.\n41. The coauthorship data discussed in this paragraph are restricted to coauthorship across the regions/countries identified in table 5-17; that is, collaboration between or among countries of the European Union, e.g., is ignored. Intraregional coauthorship is discussed in the following sections.\n42. Readers are reminded that the number of coauthored articles between any pair of countries is the same; each country is counted once per article in these data. However, countries other than the pairs discussed here may also appear on the article.\n43. Finland is included here as one of the Scandinavian countries; Iceland is not.\n44. Article counts in this section are based on the year in which the article appeared in the database, not on the year of publication, and therefore are not the same counts as in the earlier discussion of total world article output.\n45. Identification of the sector of the non-U.S. institution is not possible with the current data set.\n46. Readers are reminded that coauthors from different departments in an institution are coded as different institutions.\n47. Referring to the declining share of industry's basic research articles in physics, the National Science Board (NSB) noted, \"Most of this decline is accounted for by widespread restructuring of a few large corporations during this period, including closure, downsizing, or reorientation of large central research laboratories. Increased globalization, intensified competition, and commercial priorities may have contributed to the decline in publishing by companies and their researchers\" (NSB 2008, p 6-36).\n48. This chapter uses the convention of a 3-year citation window with a 2-year lag, e.g., 2008 citation rates are from references in articles contained in the tape for 2008 to articles contained in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 tapes of the Thomson Reuters Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. Analysis of the citation data shows that, in general, the 2-year citing lag captures the 3 peak citation years for most fields, with the following exceptions: in astronomy and physics, the peak citation years are generally captured with a 1-year lag, and in computer sciences, psychology, and the social sciences with a 3-year lag.\n49. The reader is reminded that articles in this section are counted by the year they entered the database, not by year of publication. Therefore article counts, and percentages based on them, are different from the data presented earlier in this section.\n50. Percentiles are specified percentages below which falls the remainder of the articles, e.g., the 99th percentile identifies the number of citations 99% of the articles failed\n\nto receive. For example, across all fields of science, 99% of articles from 2004 to 2006 failed to receive at least 22 citations in 2008. Matching numbers of citations with a citation percentile is not precise because all articles with a specified number of citations must be counted the same. Therefore, the citation percentiles discussed in this section and used in appendix tables 5-43 and 5-44 have all been counted conservatively, and the identified percentile is in every case higher than specified, i.e., the 99th percentile is always greater than 99%, the 95th percentile is always greater than 95%, and so forth. Actual citations/percentiles per field vary widely because counts were cut off to remain in the identified percentile. For example, using this method of counting, the 75th percentile for engineering contained articles with three to four citations in 2004 through 2006, whereas the 75th percentile for the biological sciences contained articles with five to eight citations.\n51. For an overview of these developments in the 20th century, see Mowery (2002).\n52. It is unclear whether the recent downturn in patents granted to universities/colleges is a result of changes in USPTO processing. For example, in its Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2008, USPTO reported an increase in average processing time (\"patent average total pendency\") from 29.1 months in 2005 to 32.2 months in 2008 (USPTO 2008).\n53. The institutions listed in appendix table 5-45 are slightly different from those listed in past volumes, and data for individual institutions may be different. In appendix table 5-46, an institution is credited with a patent even if it is not the first assignee, and therefore, some patents may be double counted. Several university systems are counted as one institution, and medical schools may be counted with their home institution. Universities also vary in how they assign patents, e.g., to boards of regents, individual campuses, or entities with or without affiliation with the university.\n54. Patent-based data must be interpreted with caution. Year-to-year changes in the data may reflect changes in USPTO processing times (so-called patent pendency rates). Likewise, industries and companies have different tactics and strategies for pursuing patents, and these may also change over time.\nPatent citations to S&E research discussed in this section are limited to the citations found on the cover pages of successful patent applications. These citations are entered by the patent examiner, and may or may not reflect citations given by the applicant in the body of the application. Patent cover pages also contain references to scientific and technical materials not contained in the article data used in this chapter, e.g., other patents, conference proceedings, industry standards, etc. Analyses of the data referred to in this section found that nonjournal references on patent cover pages accounted for 19% of total references in 2008. The journals/articles in the SCI/SSCI database used in this chapter--a set of relatively high-impact journals--accounted for 83% of the journal references, or 67% of the total science references, on the patent covers.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 5-51\n\nGlossary\nAcademic doctoral S&E workforce: Includes those with a U.S. doctorate in an S&E field employed in 2- or 4-year colleges or universities in the following positions: full and associate professors (referred to as senior faculty); assistant professors and instructors (referred to as junior faculty); postdocs; other full-time positions such as lecturers, adjunct faculty, research associates, and administrators; and part-time positions of all kinds.\nAcademic institution: In the \"Financial Resources for Academic R&D\" section of this chapter, an academic institution is generally defined as an institution that grants a bachelors' or higher degree in science or engineering and that has spent at least $150,000 for separately budgeted R&D in S&E within the fiscal year being measured. Elsewhere in the chapter, this term encompasses any accredited institution of higher education.\nUnderrepresented minority: Demographic category including blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives, groups considered to be underrepresented in academic institutions.\nReferences\nAdamic L. 2000.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nHighlights\n\nKnowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries in the World Economy\nThe U.S. economy had the highest concentration among major economies of knowledge- and technologyintensive (KTI) industries, a key part of the global economy.\n KTI industries, including knowledge-intensive (KI) service and high-technology (HT) manufacturing industries, have become a major part of the global economy, providing almost 30% of global economic output in 2007.\n The U.S. economy had the highest concentration of KTI industries among major economies. These industries accounted for 38% of U.S. gross national product (GDP) in 2007. China's KTI industries created 23% of GDP in 2007, up from 21% in 1992.\n Labor productivity growth has been higher in China and the Asia-9 than in the developed economies. (The Asia-9 includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.) Despite China's 8% annual growth over the past 15 years and 4% growth in the countries and economies of the Asia-9, their absolute productivity levels remain far below those of their developed counterparts.\n U.S. per capita income in 2007 was about 25% higher than that of Japan and 40% higher than the European Union (EU) average. The per capita income of China and the Asia-9 has grown far faster than that of the three developed economies--the United States, the EU, and Japan.\nTrends in Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries\nThe United States is the largest producer of privately provided KTI service and manufacturing industries.\n KTI industries contributed $15.7 trillion to the world economy: $5.0 trillion in largely location-bound education and health services, $9.5 trillion in tradable services, and $1.2 trillion in HT manufacturing.\n The United States is the largest provider of commercial KI service industries (business, financial, and communications). The U.S. world share edged up from 32% in 1995 to 34% in 2007.\n China's share of global commercial KI service industries rose from 2% in 1995 to 5% in 2007, led by nearly 20% average annual growth of its communications industry. India's communications industry also grew rapidly.\n In HT manufacturing industries, 90% of global value added was accounted for by the United States (30%), the EU (25%), China (14%), and Japan and the Asia-9 (about 10% each).\n\n China's share of HT manufacturing industries more than quadrupled, rising from 3% in 1997 to 14% in 2007, surpassing the Asia-9 in 2006 and Japan in 2007.\nInformation and Communications Services and Manufacturing\nThe United States is the largest provider of information and communications technology (ICT) service and manufacturing industries.\n The United States and the EU are the largest producers of ICT service and manufacturing industries (27% share each of global value added).\n China's share of ICT global value added rose sharply from 4% to 12% between 1995 and 2007. Japan's share declined steeply from 22% to 9% over the decade.\nU.S. and Global Trade in Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Goods and Services\nThe United States lost market share in global HT exports, whereas China became the largest single country exporting HT goods.\n The U.S. share of global HT exports declined from 21% in 1995 to 14% in 2008, largely because of a fall in ICT goods exports.\n China's share of global HT goods exports more than tripled, from 6% in 1995 to 20% in 2008, making it the single largest exporting country for HT products.\n The U.S. trade balance of HT products shifted from surplus to deficit, starting in the late 1990s. In 2000, the deficit was $32 billion in current dollars; in 2008, the deficit widened to $80 billion. The deficit in ICT goods alone was almost $120 billion in 2008.\n China's trade position in HT products moved from balance to surplus, starting in 2001, and rapidly increased from less than $13 billion in 2003 to almost $130 billion in 2008, driven by trade in ICT goods. The Asia-9's trade surplus also increased over the past decade from less than $50 billion to more than $220 billion, an increase entirely due to an expansion of its surplus in information technology (IT) goods.\n China's rise as the world's major assembler and exporter of many electronic goods is reflected by a sharp increase in China's share of imports of ICT goods from the United States, the European Union, and Japan.\n Trade data indicate that assembly of ICT goods has shifted to China and that the Asia-9 has become a major supplier of components and inputs. Its share of China's ICT imports jumped from 40% to 70% in a decade; China's share of the Asia-9's exports nearly quadrupled,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-5\n\nintra-Asia trade is up, and Japan's export data also show a pronounced shift toward China.\nU.S. Trade Positions\nThe United States has maintained a surplus in trade of commercial KI services, but its surplus in advanced technology products turned into a deficit earlier in this decade.\n U.S. trade in commercial KI service industries has been in surplus for the past decade and grew from $21 billion in 1997 to $47 billion in 2007.\n U.S. trade in advanced technology products generated an initial deficit in 2002 that widened to $56 billion by 2008. The deficit in the manufacturing component of ICT alone reached more than $100 billion, with smaller deficits in the life sciences and optoelectronics. Aerospace and electronics generated surpluses of $55 billion and $25 billion, respectively.\n The largest U.S. trade deficit in advanced technology products was $66 billion with China, its largest trading partner country, followed by $19 billion with the Asia-9 and $8 billion with Japan. ICT deficits were higher: $75 billion with China, $44 billion with the Asia-9, and $9 billion with Japan.\n The United States had a $7-billion surplus with the EU in 2008; aerospace, the life sciences, and ICT manufacturing constituted the largest share of advanced technologies trade with this region.\nForeign Direct Investment\nU.S. overseas investment in KTI industries was more than $900 billion, and direct investment in the United States in these industries was almost $600 billion.\n U.S. overseas investment in commercial KI service industries stood at $834 billion and HT manufacturing industries at $121 billion by 2008.\n Financial services had the largest share of commercial KI service industries by far (76%), followed by business services (22%) and communications (2%). Among HT manufacturing industries, communications and semiconductors (44%) and pharmaceuticals (30%) had the largest shares.\n Direct investments in the United States in commercial KI service industries stood at $390 billion in 2008; direct investment in U.S. HT manufacturing industries stood at $187 billion.\n Financial services had the largest share (64%) of foreign direct investment in commercial KI service industries, followed by business services (23%) and communications (13%). Among HT manufactures, the largest shares were in pharmaceuticals and in communications and semiconductors.\n\nTrade in Intangible Assets\nThe United States runs a surplus with the rest of the world in trade of intangible assets, including patent licensing fees and use of trade secrets.\n Investment and trade in intangible assets such as copyrights, trademarks, and patents is sizeable. In 2007, the United States had a surplus of nearly $60 billion in trade of intangible assets, which has grown steadily over the past two decades.\n An important component of the surplus in U.S. intangible assets is generated by industrial processes ($19 billion), which include licensing fees for patents and use of trade secrets. U.S. exports in this category were $37 billion in 2007.\n The EU is the United States' largest trading partner for industrial processes (nearly 50% share), followed by Japan (19%). More than half of the U.S. surplus is with the EU ($10 billion), and it has smaller surpluses with the Asia9, China, and Latin America. The U.S. has a deficit of $3 billion with Japan.\nPatents\nThe United States, the EU, and Japan have similar shares of economically valuable patents, accounting for a combined 90% share of the total.\n Inventions for which patent protection is sought in three of the world's largest markets--the United States, the EU, and Japan--are presumed to be of higher-than-average value. The United States, the EU, and Japan have similar shares of high-value patents, accounting for nearly 90% of the total. The Asia-9's share increased from 1% in 1997 to 6% in 2006, accounted for almost entirely by South Korea.\n The United States is the leading source of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent applications; however, foreign-based inventors, attracted by the size and openness of the U.S. market, have traditionally provided almost half of these applications.\n In 2008 the U.S. share of patent applications declined to 51%, with gains for second- and third-ranked Japan and the EU. The Asia-9's share in 2008 was flat at 10% compared to 2007, but double its level of a decade ago, driven by growth in applications from South Korea and Taiwan. India's and China's patent applications grew but remained modest, with India's share below and China's share barely above 1%. Trends are similar in patents granted.\nAngel and Venture Capital Funding in the United States\nInvestment in angel and venture capital, an important source of financing for HT small businesses, fell in 2008 after several years of increases.\n\n\f6-6 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\n Angel investors provided $19 billion in financing in 2008, compared with $26 billion in 2007--the first decline since 2002. Health services received the largest share of investment (16%), followed by software (13%), retail (12%), and biotechnology (11%).\n\n U.S. venture capitalists invested $28.1 billion in 2008--an 8% decline, compared with the level in 2007. Computer software had the largest share of investment from 2007 to 2008 (18%), followed by biotechnology (16%) and industrial/energy (13%), possibly reflecting opportunities in green and renewable energy.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-7\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nEconomists increasingly emphasize the central role of knowledge, particularly R&D and other activities to promote science and technology, in a country's economic success. Information and communications technology (ICT), for example, is widely regarded as a transformative technology that has altered lifestyles and the way business is conducted across a wide range of sectors.\nThis chapter examines some of the downstream effects of R&D on the United States and the global marketplace. One key area is the creation of knowledge- and technology-intensive (KTI) industries and the diffusion and application of new technologies throughout other industries. Technologyintensive manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service industries have become an important and growing part of the United States' and other economies.\nThe globalization of the world economy and the vigorous pursuit of national innovation policies by developing countries have led to the rise of new centers of high-technology manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service industries. The United States continues to be a world leader in both, but Asian and other developing countries have become major producers and exporters and are building up their indigenous capability. The rise of these new centers of activity and the increasing fragmentation of production across borders and firms have stimulated foreign investment and trade.\nInnovation is closely associated with technologically led economic growth, and observers regard it as important for advancing living standards. The measurement of innovation is an emerging field, and current data and indicators are limited. However, activities related to the commercialization of inventions and new technologies are regarded as important components of innovation indicators. Such activities include patenting, the creation and financing of new high-technology firms, and investment in intangible goods and services.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter is organized into four sections. The first section discusses the increasingly prominent role of KTI industries in regional/national economies around the world. The focus is on the United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, China, and a set of emerging Asian countries/economies (the Asia-9).1 The time span starts in the early 1990s, roughly from the end of the Cold War, to the present.\nThe second section describes the global spread of KTI industries and analyzes regional and national shares of worldwide production. It discusses shares for the KTI industry groups as a whole and for particular services and manufacturing industries within them. Because technology is increasingly essential for non-high-technology industries, some data on the latter are presented as well.\nThe third section examines indicators of increased interconnection of KTI industries in the global economy. Data on\n\npatterns and trends in global trade in KTI industries make up the bulk of this section. It presents bilateral trade data to provide a rough indication of the internationalization of the supply chains of high-technology manufacturing industries, with a special focus on the Asian region. The section also presents data on U.S. trade in advanced technology products, examining trends in U.S. trade with major economies and in key technologies. Domestic and foreign production and employment of U.S. multinationals in KTI industries are presented as indicators of the increasing involvement of these economically important firms in cross-border activities. To further illustrate the effects of globalization on the United States, the section presents data on U.S. and foreign direct investment abroad, showing trends by region and by KTI industries.\nThe last section presents innovation indicators and examines U.S. trade in intangible goods. It next examines patterns in country shares of high-value patents. A discussion of U.S. high-technology small businesses includes data on the number of high-technology small business startups and existing firms, employment, and venture and angel capital investment by industry. The last section also presents World Bank indicators of the knowledge capability of the United States and other major economies, which may have bearing on their current ability and future capacity to innovate.\nData Sources, Definitions, and Methodology\nThis chapter uses a variety of data sources. Although several are thematically related, they have different classification systems. The sidebar, \"Comparison of Data Classification Systems Used,\" shows the classification systems used in this chapter in tabular format.\nKnowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries in the World Economy\nScience and technology are widely regarded as important for the growth and competitiveness of all industries and for national economic growth. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2001 and 2007) has identified 10 categories of service and manufacturing industries--collectively referred to as KTI industries--that have a particularly strong link to science and technology.2 Although a number of other taxonomies exist, they do not allow examination of worldwide production and trade data.\n Five knowledge-intensive service industries incorporate high technologies either in their services or in the delivery of their services. They include financial, business, and communications services (including computer software development and R&D), which are generally commercially traded. They also include education and health services, which are primarily government provided and location bound.\n The five high-technology manufacturing industries include aerospace, pharmaceuticals, computers and office\n\n\f6-8 \n\nChapter 6.

Aerospace comparisons will reflect, in part, government funding for military aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft and differences in national commercial and civilian flight regulations. Global comparisons of pharmaceuticals gross domestic product (GDP) shares or market revenues may be influenced by differing national regulations covering foreign pharmaceuticals.\n Information and communications technology (ICT) is a subset of KTI industries. It consists of two high-technology manufacturing industries--(1) computers and office machinery and (2) communications equipment and semiconductors--and two knowledge-intensive service industries--(1) communications and (2) computer services--that are classified under business services. ICT is used in a wide variety of economic sectors and is considered an important driver of economic growth.\n\nThe OECD classification of knowledge-intensive service and high-technology manufacturing industries is an imprecise measure for a number of reasons. For example, hightechnology manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service industries may produce non-high-technology products or non-knowledge-intensive services, and technologically advanced manufacturing industries are excluded if they do not spend a high proportion of their revenues on R&D.\nThis section examines the prominence of KTI industries in the global economy. The value added of these industries as a share of GDP is presented as an indicator of their relative importance in the major and world economies (see sidebar, \"Industry Data and Terminology,\" for a discussion of value added and other measures). Selected data are presented on the economic wealth and productivity growth of these economies, with particular focus on the United States and other economies that are knowledge and technology intensive.\nKTI industries have become a major part of the global economy. Value added of these industries was almost $16 trillion in 2007, representing 29% of world GDP compared with a 26% share 15 years ago (figure 6-1; appendix tables\n\nIndustry Data and Terminology\n\nThe industry production and trade data used in this chapter come from a proprietary data set developed by IHS Global Insight that covers a consistent set of industries across 70 countries. IHS Global Insight's data set uses data from the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and other sources, combined with IHS Global Insight's proprietary forecasting and estimation for missing data in some developing countries.\nTwo measures of industry activity are used in this chapter: value added and exports and imports. Value added and exports and imports are expressed in current (not adjusted for inflation) dollars. These measures are not compatible with past editions of this chapter, which expressed value added and exports and imports in constant (adjusted for inflation) dollars.\nValue added, a measure of industry production, is the amount contributed by the country, firm, or other entity to the value of the good or service. It excludes the country, industry, firm, or other entity's purchases of domestic and imported supplies and inputs from other countries, industries, firms, and other entities.\nValue added is credited to regions or countries on the basis of where the company reported the activity. This is likely to be an imperfect measure because globalization and fragmentation of production may mean that the activity occurred in a different region or country than was reported by the company. In addition, companies have different reporting and accounting conventions for crediting and allocating production performed by their subsidiaries or companies in foreign countries.\n\nValue added of a company's activity is assigned to a single manufacturing or service industry on the basis of the largest share of the company's shipment of goods or delivery of services. This method of categorizing company activity is imperfect because an industry classified as manufacturing may include services, and a company classified as being within a service industry may include manufacturing or directly serve a manufacturing company. Furthermore, the single-industry classification is not a good measure for companies that have diversified activities in many categories of industry.\nExports and imports are valued as the sum (gross) of value added contributed by all countries, firms, or other entities involved in production. This measure is not compatible with the value-added measure of industry production. Exports and imports are credited to the country where the product was \"substantially transformed\" into final form. This is an imperfect measure for exports produced in multiple countries because the assigned country may not be the same location where the most value added took place.\nExports and imports are assigned to a single product category by the exporter or customs agent on the basis of the primary content of the good. This method is imperfect because the product may contain other products. The trade product classification is not directly compatible with the industry classification of company production. For example, exports classified as semiconductor products may have originated from a company classified as being in the computer industry.\n\n\f6-10 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\n6-1 and 6-2). The share increased during the past decade before leveling off in 2002. The increase in the worldwide share of KTI industries was concentrated in five regional/ national economies, which conduct nearly 90% of global R&D--the United States, the EU, Japan, the Asia-9, and China.4\nThe United States had the highest concentration of KTI industries (38% of GDP in 2007), 4 percentage points higher compared with its level in 1992 (figure 6-2; appendix tables 6-1 and 6-2). The percentage point increase in the corresponding shares of the EU and Japan was similar, reaching 30% and 28%, respectively, in 2007.\nChina's KTI industries increased their share of GDP from 21% to 23% (figure 6-2; appendix tables 6-1 and 6-2). The Asia-9's share climbed from 19% to 22% during this period.\n\nFigure 6-1 Global output of knowledge- and technologyintensive industries as a share of global GDP: 1992\u00ad2007\nPercent\n35\n\n30\n\nAll knowledge- and technology-\n\n25\n\nintensive industries\n\n20 Commercial knowledge-intensive services\n\n15\n\nPublic knowledge-intensive services 10\n\nInformation and communications technology 5\n\nHigh-technology manufacturing industries\n\n0\n\n1992\n\n1995\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2007\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\nNOTES: Output of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries on value-added basis. Value added is amount contributed by country, firm, or other entity to value of good or service and excludes purchases of domestic and imported materials and inputs. Knowledge- and technology-intensive industries include knowledgeintensive services and high-technology manufacturing industries classified by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Knowledge-intensive services include business, financial, communications, education, and health. Commercial knowledge-intensive services include business, financial, and communications services.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nshare of its GDP doubled, climbing from 5% in 1992 to 9% in 2007. The Asia-9's share was steady at 5% during this period. A major factor in the rise of China's ICT intensity is that it became a major world exporter of ICT goods. The trend of the high-technology manufactures' share in the five economies was similar to that for ICT (figure 6-4; appendix table 6-5).\nThe relatively high and growing intensity of KTI industries in the United States, the EU, Japan, China, and the Asia9 coincided with elevated living standards, as measured by GDP per capita. The United States, the EU, and Japan account for about half of the world's economic activity and also have the highest living standards (figure 6-5; appendix table 6-6). The United States has the highest per capita income among these economies ($31,260 in 1990 purchasing power parity [PPP]5), 26% higher than Japan and 40% higher than the EU. The Asia-9 and China, each with economic production approximately the size of Japan's, have far lower per capita incomes. However, per capita income varies widely in the Asia-9. The per capita income of India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam is less than $4,500 (1990 PPP), whereas South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan have standards of living similar to that of the EU.\nChina and the Asia-9 have made remarkable progress in raising their living standards over the past decade and a half.\n\nChina's per capita income grew at an annual average rate of almost 8%, resulting in per capita income more than tripling since 1992 (figure 6-6; appendix table 6-6). The Asia-9 economies grew at an annual average rate of 4%, resulting in almost a doubling of per capita income. Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan grew slightly faster than the Asia-9 average, resulting in living standards rising from middle to high income. India's per capita income doubled from $1,300 to $2,800, propelled by 5% growth during this period. The per capita income of other developing economies has grown at half the rate (or less) of the Asia-9.\nMany economists and policymakers regard productivity growth as the single most important factor in maintaining and advancing living standards. Standard productivity measures, such as labor or multifactor output per hour, are not available for many countries. A proxy measure--GDP per employed person--is used here, spanning 1992 to 2007 (appendix table 6-7).6\nLabor productivity growth was much lower for the developed economies than the developing economies, but productivity levels were much higher (appendix table 6-7). Labor productivity growth rates for the United States, the EU, and Japan averaged less than 2% annually (1.7%, 1.8%, and 1.3%, respectively) (figure 6-5). In contrast, China's labor productivity grew at an estimated 8% annual rate.\n\n-PN\\YL  4HJYVLJVUVTPJ PUKPJH[VYZ I` YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`! \n .+7 WLY JHWP[H   777 KVSSHYZ\n\n\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n<:\n\n.SVIHS .+7 I` YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`! \n\n7LYJLU[  777 KVSSHYZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1HWHU\n\n\n\n  \n  \u00b6\n\n4PKKSL ,HZ[ \n\n,<\n\n3H[PU (TLYPJH\n\n(MYPJH\n\n\n\n\n\n   <: ,<\n*LU[YHS ,\\YVWL(ZPH (ZPH\n\n1HWHU *OPUH (ZPH\n\n(MYPJH *LU[YHS 3H[PU 4PKKSL ,\\YVWL (TLYPJH ,HZ[ (ZPH\n*OPUH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.YV^[O PU .+7 WLY LTWSV`LK WLYZVU  \u00b6 HUU\\HSPaLK H]LYHNL\n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\" .+7 $ NYVZZ KVTLZ[PJ WYVK\\J[\" 777 $ W\\YJOHZPUN WV^LY WHYP[`\n56;,:!

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\n National share of global ICT spending: a measure of the scale of the economy's demand for global ICT products and services.\nThe United States ranks highest in the share of global ICT spending, scores highest in the KEI index, and ties with China in having the highest ratio of ICT spending to GDP (figure 6-8). The EU and Japan score nearly as high in the KEI index but have a lower intensity of ICT spending than the United States. China and the Asia-9 have greater ICT intensity and a higher share of global ICT spending than other developing regional/national economies. However, China and the Asia-9 score lower in the KEI index compared with Latin America, the Middle East, and Central Europe/Asia. ICT index scores vary widely within the Asia-9: The developed economies score at the same level as the United States, but India and other developing economies score at only half the Asia-9 average.\n\nThe relatively low standing of China and the Asia-9 in the KEI index, despite their relatively high share of global ICT spending, may be due to China's and India's very large populations and because China and some Asia-9 countries/ economies are net exporters of ICT goods. The benefit that China and some of the Asia-9 derive from ICT exports may come at the cost of not using cheaper and more powerful ICT products throughout their domestic economy and populace.10\nWorldwide Distribution of Knowledgeand Technology-Intensive Industries\nAs national and regional economies change, the worldwide centers of KTI industries shift in importance.

The total for tradable knowledge-intensive services and high-technology manufactures amounted to $10.7 trillion--$9.5 trillion for services and $1.2 trillion for manufacturing--out of an estimated total world economic output of $54.8 trillion (IMF 2009).\nHealth and Education Services\nThe health and education sectors generated an estimated global value added of $2.8 and $2.2 trillion, respectively, in 2007 (appendix tables 6-8 and 6-9). International comparison of these two sectors is complicated by variations in the size and distribution of each country's population and the degree of government involvement and regulation.

Japan's world share fell from 12% in 1995 to 7% in 2007. China's share was stable and the Asia-9's share rose from 3% to 4% during this period.\nThe United States is also the second largest provider of education at a 32% share, placing it behind the EU's 34% share, with little change in these shares over the period (figure 6-10; appendix table 6-8). Third-ranked Japan's share declined from 15% in 1995 to 6% in 2007, China's share rose from 2% to 5%, and the Asia-9's share rose from 4% to 5%, largely because of strong growth in education spending in India, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Gains by China, India, and other Asian countries coincided with the rapid expansion of university enrollments and graduation of new degree holders. (See \"Global Trends in Higher Education in S&E\" in chapter 2 for a discussion of trends in S&E higher education in Asia and other regions/countries/economies.)\nCommercial Knowledge-Intensive Service Industries\nBusiness services is the largest of the three commercial knowledge-intensive service industries ($5.1 trillion value added); it includes computer and data processing services and commercial R&D services (appendix table 6-10). Financial services, the next largest industry, generated $3.2 trillion (appendix table 6-11). Communications ($1.3 trillion), the smallest of the knowledge-intensive industries, is arguably the most technology driven of the commercial knowledgeintensive services (appendix table 6-12).\nWorldwide, the volume of commercial knowledge-intensive services more than doubled over a decade, from $4.5 trillion in 1995 to $9.5 trillion in 2007 (appendix table 6-3). The United States remains the largest provider of commercial knowledge-intensive services, with $3.3 trillion of the value added globally in 2007 (figure 6-11). The EU maintained second place at $2.9 trillion, trailed by Japan with $0.8 trillion. The volume of value added for commercial knowledge-intensive services in China and the Asia-9 is growing but remains low, at half a trillion dollars each.\nThree distinct growth patterns marked the commercial knowledge-intensive service industries of these regions. However, trends in these services are probably influenced by the level and growth of per capita income and changing consumption patterns of these economies rather than by advances in technology. The United States, the EU, and the Asia-9 grew at a pace similar to the world average (appendix table 6-3). (Fluctuations in growth for the U.S. and the EU during the past decade may partially reflect fluctuations in the dollar/euro exchange rate.11) Japan's output stagnated over the decade, causing its world share to drop from 17% in 1995 to 8% in 2007 (figure 6-11). China's output expanded more than two times the world's average growth rate but began from a low base, reaching 5% of the 2007 world total.\nThe same patterns can be seen in the individual service industries, with the shares for the United States and the EU consistently near 25% of global value added, steeply\n\nChapter 6.

Within the EU, the Eastern European countries and Ireland generally grew at least twice as fast as the EU average in all three industries. Among the Asia-9 countries/ economies, India was the second largest producer behind South Korea; its share rose from 0.8% to 1.4% as a result of strong growth in all three industries.\nIn other developing regions, Central Europe/Asia's commercial knowledge-intensive services expanded more than twice as fast as the world's average growth rate, led by growth in Russia and Turkey (appendix table 6-3). Its share of global value added increased from 1% to 3% because of strong growth in business and financial service industries. The Middle East expanded slightly faster than the world average rate, led by very rapid growth by Iran. Although Latin America grew at the world average, Mexico's output expanded 50% faster than the world average and Brazil's output more than doubled between 2003 and 2007 because of strong growth in business services and communications (appendix tables 6-10 through 6-12).\nHigh-Technology Manufacturing Industries\nFive manufacturing industries constitute the high-technology manufacturing sector, as defined by the OECD. In decreasing order of 2007 global value added, they are communications and semiconductors ($445 billion), pharmaceuticals ($319 billion), scientific instruments ($189 billion), aerospace ($153 billion), and computers and office machinery ($114 billion) (appendix tables 6-13 through 6-17).\nThe United States, the EU, Japan, China, and the Asia9 dominate high-technology manufacturing industries. In 2007, their collective shares accounted for 90% of the $1.2 trillion global total (figure 6-13; appendix table 6-5). U.S. high-technology manufacturers continued to rank first with $374 billion value added, followed by the EU at $306 billion and China at $167 billion. However, the EU ranks first in domestic consumption of high-technology manufactured goods, followed by the United States (see sidebar, \"Consumption of High-Technology Manufactured Goods\"). Since 1995, the high-technology share of total U.S. manufacturing has increased modestly from 17% to 21% (appendix tables 6-5 and 6-18). In contrast, for all manufacturing industries, the EU is the global leader (29% of value added) and the United States ranks second (20%).\nFrom 1995 to 2007, high-technology manufacturing output rose faster (69%) than total manufacturing (59%) (appendix tables 6-5 and 6-18).

A broad measure of domestic use is provided by adding domestic sales to imports and subtracting exports. However, use so defined encompasses two different concepts: consumption of final goods and capital investment for further production (intermediate goods). Available data series do not permit the examination of these two concepts separately.\nPatterns of the world's use of high-technology manufactures have changed considerably over the past decade. The U.S. share of domestic use, so defined, fell from 28% in 1995 to 25% in 2004 and has largely stayed at that level (figure 6-A). The EU's share stayed broadly the same at 26%\u00ad27% over the decade; it overtook the United States in 2003 to become the leading consumer of high-technology goods. Japan's share declined by more than half, from 21% to 8%; the Asia-9's share stayed essentially stable at 10% during this period.\nChina's share surged from 4% in 1995 to 16% in 2007. The Chinese trend underscores the difficulty of teasing out final consumption from use as intermediate goods. The strong rise in the Chinese trend is considered by many observers to reflect the rising flow of intermediate goods--often previously produced in China--from other Asian manufacturing centers into China for further assembly and ultimate export.\nbillion, and its world share more than quadrupled from 3% to 14%. The high-technology share of the Chinese manufacturing sector jumped from 7% to 13% during this period. These country patterns were broadly similar to the output growth trends in domestic consumption of high-technology manufactured goods and knowledge-intensive services (figures 6-11 and 6-A).\nIn 2007, the United States was the world leader in global value added in three high-technology manufacturing industries: communications and semiconductors (29%), pharmaceuticals (32%), and aerospace (52%) (figure 6-14; appendix tables 6-13, 6-14, and 6-16). The United States ranked behind the EU in scientific instruments (19% vs. 44%) and well behind China in computers and office machinery (25% vs. 39%) (appendix tables 6-15 and 6-17).\nThe U.S. share of global value-added in high-technology manufacturing remained roughly stable over the decade (figure 6-13; appendix tables 6-5 and 6-18). (Fluctuations in U.S. growth may be partially due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar.) The U.S. share of global value added was relatively stable in the aerospace, communications and\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-19\n\n-PN\\YL ( .SVIHS HWWHYLU[ JVUZ\\TW[PVU VM OPNO[LJOUVSVN` THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN PUK\\Z[Y` V\\[W\\[ I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n<: \n,< \n\n\n1HWHU \n(ZPH \n\n\n\n*OPUH\n\n   \n\n   \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n56;,:!

The U.S. share in scientific instruments, however, fell significantly from 29% to 19% during this period.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that assembly of computers and semiconductors shifted from the United States to China and other Asian countries, contributing to China's vigorous expansion of its output in these industries. However, U.S.based firms such as Dell and Apple continued to grow and to be highly profitable, deriving much of their profits from high-value activities such as logistics, design, and marketing that remained in the United States (see Dedrick, Kraemer, and Linden 2008, and sidebar, \"Tracing the Geography of the Value Chain of Products\").\nThe EU's share stayed roughly stable in three industries: pharmaceuticals (31%), communications and semiconductors (15%), and aerospace (27%) (figure 6-14; appendix tables 6-13, 6-14, and 6-16). The EU increased its share of scientific instruments by 6 percentage points to 44% over the decade but experienced a significant decline in computers and office machinery (appendix tables 6-15 and 6-17).\n\nOutput of several Eastern European member countries--the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic--grew much more rapidly in these industries than output of other member countries. This is consistent with evidence that these countries have become assembly centers for hightechnology industries based in more developed EU economies (Kaminski and Ng 2001).\nThe communications and semiconductors and computers and office machinery industries drove China's rapid expansion of high-technology manufacturing, coinciding with China becoming the world's low-cost assembler and exporter of these goods. China's communications and semiconductors industry grew nearly sixfold over the decade, its world share climbing from 4% to 15% (figure 6-14 and appendix table 6-13). Its computer industry grew at 45% annually between 1995 and 2007; its world share jumped from 1% to almost 40% over the same period (appendix table 6-17).\nChina's growth in other high-technology industries was also rapid--China at least quadrupled its world share in pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and aerospace (figure 6-14 and appendix tables 6-14, 6-15, and 6-16).\nJapan's share loss, driven primarily by the communications and semiconductors and the computers and office machinery industries, also extended to the other three hightechnology industries (figure 6-14 and appendix tables 6-13 through 6-17). This broad downward trend may reflect its lengthy economic stagnation and the shift of production to China and other Asian economies. The Asia-9's share of global value added edged up from 9% to 10%, reaching parity with Japan in 2007 (figure 6-13; appendix table 6-5). South Korea had very strong growth in communications and semiconductors, moving its share of global value added from 4% to 10% (appendix table 6-13).\nIndia has a very limited high-technology manufacturing industry, but its value added grew more than twice as fast as the Asia-9's average (appendix table 6-5). India's growth was concentrated in pharmaceuticals, with gains in scientific instruments--industries in which the United States and other multinationals have established a presence in India (appendix tables 6-14 and 6-15).\nIn other developing regions, high-technology manufacturing output in Central Europe/Asia grew more than twice the world average over the 1995\u00ad2007 period, led by growth in Russia and Turkey (appendix table 6-5). The Middle East also gained, driven by Israel and Iran. Growth in both of these regions was led by scientific instruments and pharmaceuticals; communications and semiconductors also contributed to the Middle East's gain (appendix tables 6-13, 6-14, and 6-15). Latin America grew at a rate near the world average, the second slowest of the developing regions. However, Mexico, an important assembly center for high-technology goods, grew two times faster than the world average during this period, led by pharmaceuticals and communications and semiconductors. Brazil's growth was stagnant between 1995 and 2003; however, it has grown rapidly since 2003, surpassing Mexico in 2005 to become the\n\n\f6-20 \n\nChapter 6.

These studies essentially show that the big returns accrue to the firms and countries that harbor special design, engineering, and marketing expertise.\nBecause value-added data are not readily available at the product or firm level, these studies estimate the value capture of these goods. Value capture does not count the cost of direct labor (figure 6-B) which, when included, could raise a country's share (if direct labor was performed in the country) or lower it (if direct labor was performed in another country). Thus, the estimates shown must be regarded as broadly indicative only.\nThe Apple iPod study estimates that the United States receives the largest share of value capture based on the factory price (39%), largely reflecting Apple's gross profit (36%) (table 6-A). The study sorts iPod components into key and low-cost generic items. Key inputs account for 37% of the wholesale price, and value capture is estimated for their manufacturers. The estimated U.S.\nFigure 6-B Components of value added and value capture\n\nshare is 3%, raising the total U.S. share to 39%. Asia's key inputs share is estimated at 14%, with Japan capturing 12% because of the expensive hard drive manufactured by Toshiba. (If direct labor costs were available, Japan's share of value added would be arguably lower because Toshiba manufactures its hard drives in China and the Philippines.) The value capture of the generic inputs is estimated at 10%, of which 3% is estimated as the value capture from manufacture of these components.\nChina, the location of final assembly, receives an estimated 2% share of the Apple iPod's value capture (table 6-A). The study estimates that China's value capture is very small because final assembly of an iPod requires about 10 minutes and the minimum monthly wage for a worker is about $100. Because final assembly of the iPod and other electronic goods yields little value for China, the authors claim that trade statistics are misleading because the U.S. trade deficit with China increases by about $150 plus the cost of shipping for every iPod sold in the United States, whereas the value added by China is estimated at only a few dollars. Table 6-A summarizes similar data for the Hewlett-Packard laptop computer.\n(continued on next page)\n\nCost of goods sold\n\nPurchased inputs Direct labor\n\nSales price\n\nSelling, general, and administrative Research & development Depreciation\n\nValue added\n\nValue capture\n\nNet profit\n\nNOTES: Value added is amount contributed by country, firm, or other entity to value of good or service and excludes purchases of domestic and imported materials and inputs.

Brazil's aerospace industry grew by sevenfold and its computer industry registered strong gains.\nInformation and Communications Technology Industries\nICT as discussed here comprises both the communications and computer services industries and the computer, communications, and semiconductors manufacturing industries. In 2007, ICT generated an estimated total of $2.6 trillion in global value--$2.0 trillion in communications and computer services, and $0.6 trillion in the manufacturing industries (appendix table 6-4).\n\nIn 2007, the United States and the EU tied as the largest ICT producers (about $700 billion), followed by secondranked China ($315 billion). Japan and the Asia-9 converged in a range of approximately $205\u00ad$230 billion (figure 6-15; appendix table 6-4).\nThe U.S. and EU shares fluctuated over the decade but showed little change in 2007 compared with a decade ago (figure 6-15; appendix table 6-4). Japan's share fell steeply during this period, mirroring its downward trends in share in both high-technology and knowledge-intensive industries. China's share tripled from 4% to 12% because of strong gains across all ICT industries. The Asia-9's share was flat during this period, although India's share rose\n\n\f6-22 \n\nChapter 6.

Services not classified as knowledge intensive incorporate technology in their services or in the delivery of their services but at a lower intensity compared with the knowledge-intensive services discussed above. Manufacturing industries not classified as high technology by the OECD use advanced manufacturing techniques, incorporate technologically advanced inputs in manufacture, and/or perform or rely on R&D in applicable scientific fields. In addition, some industries not classified as either manufacturing or services use or incorporate science and technology to varying degrees in their products and processes (see sidebar, \"Trends in Industries Not Classified as Services or Manufacturing\").\n\nNon-Knowledge-Intensive Commercial Services Commercial services not classified as knowledge inten-\nsive include the wholesale and retail, restaurant and hotel, transportation and storage, and real estate industries. The United States leads the EU by a slim margin, as measured by share of global value added (29%) in the wholesale and retail industry--the largest of these industries ($5.9 trillion)--and is the second-ranked provider in the other three industries (table 6-1). Allowing for fluctuations, the national/regional shares remained stable or showed slight upward trends except for Japan, whose shares fell in all of these industries.\nNon-High-Technology Manufacturing Industries Non-high-technology manufacturing industries are di-\nvided into three categories, as classified by the OECD: medium-high technology, medium-low technology, and low technology. These industries include motor vehicle manufacturing and chemicals production, excluding pharmaceuticals (medium-high technology), rubber and plastic production and basic metals (medium-low technology), and paper and food product production (low technology).\nThe share trends in all of these industry segments are the same as for high technology--share losses for the United States and larger share losses for Japan, stable or slight declines for the EU, stable or slight increases for the Asia-9, and strong share gains across all segments for China.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL  =HS\\L HKKLK VM 0*; PUK\\Z[YPLZ I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVU JV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`!  \u00b6\n\n*\\YYLU[ KVSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ \n\n=HS\\L HKKLK\n\n\n\n <:\n,< \n\n (ZPH\n\n \n\n\n\n1HWHU\n\n*OPUH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7LYJLU[ \n\n:OHYL NSVIHS ]HS\\L HKKLK\n\n <:\n\n,< \n\n 1HWHU\n\n\n (ZPH\n *OPUH\n   \n\n   \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\" 0*; $ PUMVYTH[PVU HUK JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ [LJOUVSVN`\n56;,:! =HS\\L HKKLK PZ HTV\\U[ JVU[YPI\\[LK I` JV\\U[Y` MPYT VY V[OLY LU[P[` [V ]HS\\L VM NVVK VY ZLY]PJL HUK L_JS\\KLZ W\\YJOHZLZ VM KVTLZ[PJ HUK PTWVY[LK TH[LYPHSZ HUK PUW\\[Z 0UMVYTH[PVU HUK JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ [LJOUVSVN` JSHZZPMPLK I` 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ HUK PUJS\\KLZ JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ ZLY]PJLZ JVTW\\[LY HUK YLSH[LK ZLY]PJLZ JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ HUK ZLTPJVUK\\J[VYZ HUK JVTW\\[LYZ HUK VMMPJL THJOPULY` (ZPH PUJS\\KLZ 0UKPH 0UKVULZPH 4HSH`ZPH 7OPSPWWPULZ :PUNHWVYL :V\\[O 2VYLH ;HP^HU ;OHPSHUK HUK =PL[UHT *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< L_JS\\KLZ *`WY\\Z ,Z[VUPH 3H[]PH 3P[O\\HUPH 3\\_LTIV\\YN 4HS[H HUK :SV]LUPH\n:6<9*,! 0/: .SVIHS 0UZPNO[ >VYSK 0UK\\Z[Y` :LY]PJL KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n 6-23\n Medium-high-technology industries: These industries produced $2.1 trillion in global value added in 2007. The U.S. share fell from 23% to 17% between 1995 and 2007 (table 6-2), and the EU share remained roughly stable (32%). Japan's share fell from 24% to 13%, China's more than quadrupled from 3% to 13%, and the Asia-9's share rose from 7% to 9%.\n Medium-low-technology industries: The U.S. and EU shares of these industries ($2.5 trillion global value added) fell 3 percentage points each over the decade, reaching 16% and 28%, respectively (table 6-2).

The U.S. and EU shares fell slightly (table 6-2). The Asia-9's share remained stable, as opposed to its small gains in the other two segments.\nTrade and Other Globalization Indicators\nIn the modern world economy, production is more often globalized (i.e., value is added to a product in more than one nation) than in the past and less often vertically integrated (i.e., conducted under the auspices of a single company and its subsidiaries). These trends have affected all industries, but their impact has been particularly strong in electronic, ICT, and other KTI manufacturing and service industries. The broader context is the rapid expansion of these industrial and services capabilities in many developing countries, both for export and internal consumption.\nGlobal high-technology trade volume has risen faster than global production, indicating the growing importance of international suppliers of intermediate goods that are then used in the assembly of the final products purchased by the consumer. Data on multinational companies and cross-border investment likewise indicate growing interconnection among the world's economies.\nThis discussion of trade trends in high-technology manufactured products focuses on the United States, the EU, Japan, the Asia-9, and China. Europe and East Asia have a substantial volume of intraregional trade that is treated differentially in this section. Intra-EU exports are excluded because the EU is an integrated trading bloc with common external trade tariffs and few restrictions on intra-EU trade. Trade between China and Hong Kong is excluded because it is essentially intracountry trade. The substantial intra-Asia-9 trade is included because the group is not an integrated economy. Analytically, this allows delineation of a developing Asia-9/China supplier and manufacturing zone of high-technology goods that are largely destined for export to the EU, the United States, and Japan.\nTrade data are an imperfect indicator of where value is added to a product.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nTrends in Industries Not Classified as Services or Manufacturing\n\nAgriculture, construction, mining, and utilities are not classified as either manufacturing or service industries and are not categorized by their level of technology or knowledge intensity. However, these industries are dependent on or use science and technology. For example, agriculture relies on breakthroughs in biotechnology, construction uses knowledge from materials science, mining is dependent on earth sciences, and utilities rely on advances in energy science.\nThe United States ranks first in mining, second in construction and utilities behind the EU, and fourth in\n\nagriculture as measured by share of global value added among the five major economies (table 6-B). The U.S. share rose from 18% to 22% in construction over the decade, and its share in the other three industries remained stable. The EU's share rose or was steady in construction and utilities but fell substantially in mining and agriculture. Japan's share fell sharply in all of these industries. China had gains across all industries, particularly agriculture and utilities. The Asia-9's shares were stable or slightly higher.\n\nTable 6-B Share of global value added for selected industries, by region/country/economy: Selected years, 1995\u00ad2007\n(Percent distribution)\n\nIndustry and region/country/economy\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005 2007\n\nAgriculture Global value added (current $billions) ..................

Much of the value added may originate from Asian, EU, or U.S. firms that manufactured the components or conducted design, marketing, software development, and other activities. The factory price and shipping cost of the good, however, would be fully credited to China's exports and U.S. imports. Accurately apportioning value added is fraught with difficulties (see sidebar, \"Tracing the Geography of the Value Chain of Products\").\n\nTrade of High-Technology Goods\nA country's success in exporting its goods to other countries is one measure of its comparative economic advantage-- the goods it produces are provided not just to its local market but are also competitive in a world market.\nThe gross value of global exports of high-technology products--communications and semiconductors, computers and office machinery, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and aerospace--reached $2.9 trillion in 2008, up from $915 billion in 1995 (appendix table 6-19).12 (See sidebar, \"Product Classification and Determination of Country of Origin of Trade Goods\" for discussion on how trade goods\n\n\f6-26 \n\nChapter 6.

Removing intrabloc (within the EU) and intracountry (China to Hong Kong) exports reduces these totals to $732 billion in 1995 and an estimated $2.3 trillion in 2008-- base figures for the analyses that follow (figure 6-16). Among the five high-technology products, the world export value was greatest in communications and semiconductors (45% of the total) followed by computers (20%), giving the ICT products about two-thirds of the total (figure 6-17; appendix tables 6-20 through 6-24).\nThe threefold increase in exports was greater than the rise in global production of these industries over the period, from $2.0 trillion to $4.0 trillion (figure 6-16). This probably reflects the broadened geographic base of high-technology manufacturing overall, the expansion of multinational firms' production to overseas venues, and the shift of production from vertically integrated firms to greater reliance on international external suppliers.\n\nGlobal Trade Balance Trends in High-Technology Manufactures\nThe expansion of high-technology trade has led to changes in the relative positions of the developed and developing countries (figure 6-18; appendix table 6-19). Measured in relative volume of exports, the U.S. position has declined from 21% in 1995 to 14% in 2008, reflecting broad drops in exports of U.S. ICT goods (communications and semiconductors and computers and office machinery), which account for nearly 45% of the nation's high-technology exports (figure 6-19; appendix tables 6-19 through 6-21). (See sidebar, \"Product Classification and Determination of Country of Origin of Trade Goods,\" for discussion of how exports are credited to countries.) Japan's share declined steadily over the period, from 18% to 8%, again largely because of declining exports of ICT goods. The EU's high-technology export share remained approximately stable at 16%\u00ad18%.\nAmidst a great increase in world exports, China's share surged from 6% to 20% over little more than a decade,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-27\n\nProduct Classification and Determination of Country\nof Origin of Trade Goods\nThe characteristics of goods in international trade are determined from a product perspective. Data on product trade are first recorded at the country's ports of entry. Each type of product is assigned a product trade code by the customs agent according to the harmonized system.* Exporters generally identify the product being shipped and include its proper code. Because many imported products are assessed an import duty and these duties vary by product category, a customs agent for the receiving country inspects or reviews the shipment to make the final determination of the proper product code and country of origin. The value of products entering or exiting U.S. ports may include the value of components, inputs, or services classified in different product categories or originating from other countries than the country of origin.\nData on international product trade assign products to a single country of origin. For goods manufactured with international components, the country of origin is determined by where the product was \"substantially transformed\" into its final form. For example, a General Motors car that was assembled in the United States with components imported from Germany and Japan and that is destined for export to Canada will be labeled \"Made in the USA.\" The country where the product was \"substantially transformed\" may not be the location where the most value was added.\n*The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, or Harmonized System (HS), is a system for classifying goods traded internationally that was developed under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council. Beginning on 1 January 1989, HS numbers replaced previously adhered-to schedules in more than 50 countries, including the United States.\nmaking it the largest single exporting country for high-technology manufactured goods (figure 6-18; appendix table 6-19). The Asia-9 region has maintained its position at more than a quarter of the total. However, this largely reflects the rise of a manufacturing supplier zone around China that is focused on ICT goods (see \"Trends in the Geographic Distribution of Bilateral High-Technology Trade,\" later in this chapter).\nNotable differences are apparent in the export performance of these countries and regions for the five products (figure 6-19; appendix tables 6-20 through 6-25). The United States and Japan have been losing export shares in most industries, with the exception of the U.S. aerospace share, which has fluctuated at about 50%.

The Asia-9 region accounts for large shares of semiconductor and computer exports and, together with China, captured more than 60% of the world export market share in these industries.\nThroughout the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, the United States consistently exported more high-technology products than it imported, in contrast to deficits recorded for other U.S. manufacturing products.13 A growing U.S. import volume in the late 1990s shifted the U.S. high-technology trade balance from surplus to deficit (figure 6-20 and appendix table 6-19). In 2000, the deficit was $32 billion in current dollars; by 2008, the deficit had widened to $80 billion.\nICT goods are driving the U.S. high-technology trade deficit: In 2008, the ICT industries ran a deficit of almost $120 billion in current dollars (figure 6-20; appendix table 6-26). The emergence of large deficits in these products reflected rising domestic demand, which coincided with a broad shift in location of the production of ICT goods to developing countries, largely in Asia. This, in turn, stimulated imports of ICT goods from these countries. Pharmaceuticals\n\ncontributed a further $21 billion to the overall 2008 deficit (appendix table 6-23).\nU.S. trade in aerospace products registered a trade surplus of $50 billion in 2008, continuing its trend of surpluses for the past two decades; trade in scientific instruments added a smaller surplus of $9 billion (appendix tables 6-22 and 6-24).\nThe EU high-technology trade balance remained roughly stable, with a deficit of about $20 to $50 billion over this period (figure 6-20; appendix table 6-19). However, the EU ICT deficit grew from $38 billion in 1995 to $117 billion in 2008, reflecting the same underlying structural shift (appendix table 6-26). Rising surpluses in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and scientific instruments offset the increasing ICT deficit (appendix tables 6-22 through 6-24).\nThe trade positions of China and the Asia-9 also changed substantially. China's trade position, which had been in balance for much of the 1980s and 1990s, moved to a surplus after 2001 (figure 6-20; appendix table 6-19) and rapidly increased from less than $13 billion in 2003 to almost $130 billion in 2008, driven by the ICT goods trade (appendix table 6-26). The Asia-9's trade surplus grew from about $50 billion to more than $220 billion over the past decade, entirely due to an expansion of its surplus in ICT goods (however, see the next section). Japan's surplus showed little change, despite its loss of market share in production of high-technology industries.\nGeographic Distribution of Bilateral HighTechnology Trade\nThe shift in trade in global high-technology manufactures over the past decades (i.e., the shift away from the developed regional/national economies to China and the Asia-9) was accompanied by a pronounced shift in the distribution of bilateral trade among these and the three other economies--the United States, the EU, and Japan. Trade in ICT goods, the largest single category of high-technology industry goods, illustrates these shifting patterns.\nFinal assembly of ICT goods and components shifted-- from the United States, the EU, Japan, and developed economies among the Asia-9--toward China early in this decade, and some assembly work has subsequently shifted from China to the less-developed Asia-9 economies (Athukorala and Yamashita 2006, Ng and Yeats 2003, Rosen and Wing 2005). This discussion examines trends in bilateral trade distribution of ICT goods.\nThe rise of China as the world's major assembler and exporter of many electronic goods is reflected by a sharp increase in China's share of ICT imports in the United States, the European Union, and Japan (figure 6-21; appendix tables 6-27 through 6-29). China's share of these economies' ICT imports was 40%\u00ad50% in 2008, compared with 10% or less in 1995. Data on China's bilateral exports show that about 65% of its ICT exports were shipped to the United States, Japan, and the EU, suggesting that most of China's exports are finished products destined primarily for developed countries (figure 6-22; appendix table 6-30).

These patterns are consistent with reports that Japanese (and Taiwanese) manufacturers began exporting components for assembly in plants they established in China. U.S. purchases of ICT goods from Japan may have been supplanted by goods assembled in and shipped from China for Japanese and Taiwanese firms.\nThe Asia-9's bilateral export data are consistent with China's import data showing the rise of the Asia-9 as a major supplier to China's ICT manufacturing industries. China's share of the Asia-9's exports nearly quadrupled from 8% to 31% over the decade (figure 6-24; appendix table 6-31). China's share growth was strongest in the exports of South Korea (from 8% to 30%), Taiwan (from 12% to 43%), Singapore (from 10% to 29%), and the Philippines (from 5% to 38%) (figures 6-24 and 6-25; appendix tables 6-32 through 6-35). The share of Asia-9's ICT exports going directly to the United States or the EU fell sharply during this period (appendix tables 6-27 and 6-28).\nThe data indicate that the Asia-9 countries/economies have come to be assemblers and exporters of both intermediate and finished ICT goods, the former going to China and other Asia-9 destinations, the latter largely to the United States, the EU, and other developed nations. The intraAsia-9 share of Asia-9 ICT imports rose from 36% to 46% over the past decade (figure 6-26; appendix table 6-31), coinciding with a sharp increase (from 7% to 26%) in imports from China. This is consistent with the Asia-9 countries/ economies importing components from China for final or intermediate assembly and re-exporting them back to China for final assembly and export.\nThe Asia-9 countries/economies--particularly Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore--remain substantial suppliers of ICT goods to the EU and the United States (about 30% each) and to Japan (39%) (figure 6-24; appendix tables 6-31 and 6-33 through 6-36).\nExports of Medium- and Low-Technology Manufactured Products\nThe U.S. export performance in products associated with less knowledge intensity and less use of R&D provides a context for its high-technology status. In these industries, the United States has historically had lower world export shares, although some convergence, which largely reflects declines in the U.S. high-technology share, has been evident since the late 1990s.\nThe U.S. share of world exports in medium-high-technology products (i.e., motor vehicles, chemicals, railroad equipment) was 14% in 2008, which was equal to its share in high-technology industries (table 6-3) and which placed it fourth behind the EU (24%, excluding intra-EU trade) and Japan and the Asia-9 (15% each). The U.S. and EU shares have remained stable over the past decade, whereas Japan's share has fallen from 22% to 15%. China, ranked fifth, has rapidly expanded its share of global exports from 4% to 13% (excluding trade between China and Hong Kong).\n\nChapter 6.

U.S. export share in low-technology products in 2008 (at 12%) also placed it fourth behind China (22%), the EU (18%), and the Asia-9 (16%). In both of these industry groups, China's world export share expanded greatly since the mid-1990s but not to the same degree as for hightechnology exports.\nU.S. Trade in Advanced Technology Products\nThe Census Bureau has developed a classification system for internationally traded products that embody new or leading-edge technologies. This classification system has significant advantages for determining whether an industry and its products are high technology and may be a more precise and comprehensive measure than the industry-based OECD classification.\n\nThis system allows a highly disaggregated, focused examination of technologies embodied in U.S. imports and exports. It categorizes trade into 10 major technology areas:\n Advanced materials--the development of materials, including semiconductor materials, optical fiber cable, and videodisks, that enhance the application of other advanced technologies.\n Aerospace--the development of aircraft technologies, such as most new military and civil airplanes, helicopters, spacecraft (excluding communications satellites), turbojet aircraft engines, flight simulators, and automatic pilots.\n Biotechnology--the medical and industrial application of advanced genetic research to the creation of drugs, hormones, and other therapeutic items for both agricultural and human uses.\n Electronics--the development of electronic components (other than optoelectronic components), including\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-35\n\nintegrated circuits, multilayer printed circuit boards, and surface-mounted components (such as capacitors and resistors) that improve performance and capacity and, in many cases, reduce product size.\n Flexible manufacturing--the development of products for industrial automation, including robots, numerically controlled machine tools, and automated guided vehicles, that permit greater flexibility in the manufacturing process and reduce human intervention.\n Information and communications--the development of products that process increasing amounts of information in shorter periods of time, including computers, video conferencing, routers, radar apparatus, communications satellites, central processing units, and peripheral units such as disk drives, control units, modems, and computer software.\n Life sciences--the application of nonbiological scientific advances to medicine. For example, advances such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and novel chemistry, coupled with new drug manufacturing techniques, have led to new products that help control or eradicate disease.\n Optoelectronics--the development of electronics and electronic components that emit or detect light, including optical scanners, optical disk players, solar cells, photosensitive semiconductors, and laser printers.\n Nuclear--the development of nuclear production apparatus (other than nuclear medical equipment), including nuclear reactors and parts, isotopic separation equipment, and fuel cartridges. (Nuclear medical apparatus is included in the life sciences rather than this category.)\n Weapons--the development of technologies with military applications, including guided missiles, bombs, torpedoes, mines, missile and rocket launchers, and some firearms.\nU.S. trade in advanced technology products is an important component of overall U.S. trade, accounting for about one-fifth of total trade volume for the past two decades. In 2008, U.S. exports of advanced technology products were $276 billion (nearly 21% of goods exports) and imports were $331 billion (16% of total goods imports) (figures 6-27 and 6-28 and appendix table 6-37). As with high-technology industries trade accounts, imports of advanced technology products grew faster than exports since the early 1990s, sending the U.S. trade balance in these products into deficit in 2002 (figure 6-28). By 2008, the deficit reached $56 billion, comprising 7% of the total U.S. goods trade deficit ($816 billion).\nChanges in exchange rates may have been a contributing factor to these trends because the U.S. dollar's value against a basket of its major trading partners' currencies appreciated more than 60% between the early 1990s and 2002, coinciding with the shift from surplus to deficit (figure 6-28). However, the dollar depreciated about 20% through 2008, and the deficit continued to widen.\n\n-PN\\YL  <: HK]HUJLK [LJOUVSVN` WYVK\\J[ [YHKL!  \u00b6\n*\\YYLU[ <: KVSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ\n\n\n 0TWVY[Z\n\n\n ,_WVY[Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;YHKL IHSHUJL\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6             \n56;,! <: HK]HUJLK [LJOUVSVN` WYVK\\J[ [YHKL JSHZZPMPLK I` *LUZ\\Z )\\YLH\\ HUK JVUZPZ[Z VM HK]HUJLK TH[LYPHSZ HLYVZWHJL IPV[LJOUVSVN` LSLJ[YVUPJZ MSL_PISL THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN PUMVYTH[PVU HUK JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ SPML ZJPLUJLZ VW[VLSLJ[YVUPJZ U\\JSLHY HUK ^LHWVUZ\n:6<9*,! *LUZ\\Z )\\YLH\\ -VYLPNU ;YHKL :[H[PZ[PJZ *V\\U[Y` HUK 7YVK\\J[ ;YHKL +H[H (K]HUJLK ;LJOUVSVN` 7YVK\\J[Z O[[W!^^^JLUZ\\ZNV]MVYLPNU[YHKLZ[H[PZ[PJZWYVK\\J[PUKL_O[TS HJJLZZLK  :LW[LTILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nIt is likely that the growing deficit was affected by changing world production and trade patterns, adoption of new business and production processes, establishment of productive capacity abroad, and the emergence of export-oriented high-technology industries in Asia and other regions and countries.\nU.S. Advanced Technology Product Trade, by Technology\nFive technology areas--information and communications, aerospace, electronics, the life sciences, and optoelectronics--accounted for a combined share of about 90% of U.S. advanced technology product trade in 2008 (figure 6-29; appendix tables 6-38 through 6-47). Information and communications had the largest single share (43%), followed by aerospace (21%), electronics (13%), the life sciences (11%), and optoelectronics (5%). Three of these technologies have generated substantial trade deficits: information and communications ($104 billion), optoelectronics ($21 billion), and the life sciences ($15 billion) (figure 6-30). The rapid rise in the overall deficit between 2002 and 2008 was driven by the deficit in ICT, widening from $48 billion to more than\n\n\f6-36 \n\nChapter 6.

U.S. merchandise trade with Asia also contains a higher-than-average share of advanced technology goods. This share in 2008 was twice the U.S. average for exports to the Asia-9 (35%) and 27% for China. Japan's 22% share equaled that of the EU (figure 6-31).\nChina and Japan. China exported $92 billion of advanced technology products to the United States (about onefourth of U.S. imports) and imported $26 billion in 2008. The United States has the largest deficit with China, which is its third largest trading partner among the six regions/countries\n\n-PN\\YL  (K]HUJLK [LJOUVSVN` WYVK\\J[ ZOHYL VM <: TLYJOHUKPZL [YHKL I` YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`! \n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n >VYSK (ZPH *OPUH\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\n\n,< 1HWHU 3H[PU *HUHKH (SS\n\n(TLYPJH\n\nV[OLY\n\nJV\\U[YPLZ\n\n56;,:! <: HK]HUJLK [LJOUVSVN` WYVK\\J[ [YHKL JSHZZPMPLK I` *LUZ\\Z )\\YLH\\ HUK JVUZPZ[Z VM HK]HUJLK TH[LYPHSZ HLYVZWHJL IPV[LJOUVSVN` LSLJ[YVUPJZ MSL_PISL THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN PUMVYTH[PVU HUK JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ SPML ZJPLUJLZ VW[VLSLJ[YVUPJZ U\\JSLHY HUK ^LHWVUZ (ZPH PUJS\\KLZ 0UKPH 0UKVULZPH 4HSH`ZPH 7OPSPWWPULZ :PUNHWVYL :V\\[O 2VYLH ;HP^HU ;OHPSHUK HUK =PL[UHT *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN 3H[PU (TLYPJH PUJS\\KLZ (UNPSSH (U[PN\\H HUK )HYI\\KH (YNLU[PUH (Y\\IH )HOHTHZ )HYIHKVZ )LSPaL )LYT\\KH )VSP]PH )YHaPS *OPSL *VSVTIPH *VZ[H 9PJH *\\IH +VTPUPJH +VTPUPJHU 9LW\\ISPJ ,J\\HKVY ,S :HS]HKVY ,X\\H[VYPHS .\\PULH -YLUJO .\\PHUH .\\H[LTHSH .\\`HUH /HP[P /VUK\\YHZ 1HTHPJH 4HY[PUPX\\L 4L_PJV 5PJHYHN\\H 7HUHTH 7HYHN\\H` 7LY\\ :[ 2P[[Z HUK 5L]PZ :[ 3\\JPH :[ =PUJLU[ HUK [OL .YLUHKPULZ :\\YPUHTL ;YPUPKHK HUK ;VIHNV =LULa\\LSH HUK <Y\\N\\H`\n\n:6<9*,:! *LUZ\\Z )\\YLH\\ -VYLPNU ;YHKL :[H[PZ[PJZ *V\\U[Y` HUK 7YVK\\J[ ;YHKL +H[H (K]HUJLK ;LJOUVSVN` 7YVK\\J[Z O[[W!^^^ JLUZ\\ZNV]MVYLPNU[YHKLZ[H[PZ[PJZWYVK\\J[PUKL_O[TS\" HUK <: 0U[LYUH[PVUHS ;YHKL PU .VVKZ O[[W!^^^ JLUZ\\ZNV]MVYLPNU[YHKL Z[H[PZ[PJZOPZ[VYPJHSPUKL_O[TS HJJLZZLK  :LW[LTILY  \n\n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f6-38 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nand the largest single country (figure 6-30; appendix table 6-37). ICT goods account for nearly 90% of U.S. imports of advanced technology products from China (appendix table 6-40). U.S. exports of advanced technology goods include aerospace, electronics, and information and communications (appendix tables 6-38 through 6-40).\nThe volume of U.S.-China advanced technology trade more than quadrupled over this decade, and in 2003 China surpassed Japan as the United States' single largest country partner in these goods (appendix table 6-37). U.S. imports from China have increased much faster than its exports to China, pushed by a rising trade volume in ICT technologies. The steep rise in imports and flat export growth widened the U.S. deficit with China in information and communications from $6 billion to $75 billion (figure 6-30; appendix table 6-40).\nJapan was the largest trading country partner with the United States until it was overtaken by China in 2003 (appendix table 6-37). Information and communications technology constituted nearly half of all U.S. imports from Japan in 2008, similar to its prevalence in imports from China (appendix table 6-40). Among advanced technology exports to Japan, aerospace accounted for the largest share (42%); information and communications products ranked second (18%) (appendix table 6-38).\nThe Asia-9. The Asia-9's trade was one-fifth of total advanced technology trade volume in 2008 (figure 6-29), with exports of $73 billion to the United States and imports of $54 billion (figure 6-30; appendix table 6-37). Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan are the Asia-9's major U.S. trading partners. The $19-billion U.S. deficit with the Asia-9 consists of a $12-billion deficit with Malaysia and smaller deficits with South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand (and a small surplus with Singapore).\nAs with China, ICT products constituted the largest share of total U.S. advanced technology trade with the Asia-9. Important suppliers are Malaysia ($17 billion), South Korea ($13 billion), and Taiwan ($8 billion) (appendix table 6-40). U.S. imports of $52 billion and exports of $9 billion produced a deficit of more than $40 billion in ICT products in 2008.\nThe Asia-9 ICT deficit in information and communications was partly offset by a $24-billion combined surplus in aerospace, electronics, and flexible manufacturing products (appendix tables 6-38, 6-39, and 6-45). Combined U.S. exports of these technologies were $41 billion in 2008, 76% of total U.S. exports to the Asia-9. Important customers of these three technologies were South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan (in all three categories), India (aerospace), and Malaysia and the Philippines (electronics).\nThe U.S. trade position in advanced technology goods with the Asia-9 has been relatively stable over this decade. This may reflect the migration of final assembly of many ICT goods from the Asia-9 to China, coinciding with a widening deficit of ICT trade with China.\n\nThe European Union. Trade with the EU accounts for nearly one-fourth of U.S. advanced technology product trade (figure 6-29; appendix table 6-37). The EU exported $69 billion and imported $76 billion, resulting in a $7-billion surplus in 2008 (figure 6-30). Five EU members--France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom--accounted for nearly 80% of total U.S.-EU trade in these goods. Aerospace, the life sciences, and ICT had a combined 77% share of the volume of U.S.-EU advanced technology product trade in 2008 (appendix tables 6-38, 6-40, and 6-41).\nThe United States had substantial surpluses with the EU in aerospace ($13 billion) and ICT goods ($9 billion) (appendix tables 6-38 and 6-40). Important EU customers of aerospace and ICT are France, Germany, and the UK; the Netherlands purchases the most U.S. ICT goods of the EU countries.\nThe life sciences produced a $15-billion deficit (appendix table 6-41). Ireland was by far the largest EU supplier of life sciences products, accounting for more than half of the EU's $27 billion in exports to the United States in 2008. Other substantial suppliers were Belgium, France, Germany, and the UK.\nThe U.S. trade surplus with the EU narrowed from $22 billion in 2000 to $7 billion in 2008 (figure 6-30), reflecting the deficit in life sciences rising from $6 billion to $16 billion due to much more rapid growth of imports (appendix tables 6-37 and 6-41).\nLatin America and Canada. U.S. advanced technology trade with Latin America amounted to 15% of total U.S. advanced trade in 2008 (figure 6-29; appendix table 6-37). Mexico is by far the largest trading partner in Latin America (10% share of U.S. advanced technology trade), followed by distant-second Brazil (2%). ICT products accounted for half of Latin America's total U.S. trade in these products (appendix table 6-40).\nStrong growth in U.S. aerospace and ICT exports was more than offset by large import increases in optoelectronics and ICT (appendix tables 6-38, 6-40, and 6-42). Mexico was the main supplier of optoelectronic imports, which rose from $0.5 billion to $15 billion. The United States also had a substantial deficit with Mexico in ICT goods ($10 billion). The U.S.-Mexico trade deficit in these goods reflects, in part, Mexico's duty-free imports of U.S. components and their assembly and re-export to the United States.\nU.S. advanced technology trade with Canada amounted to 7% of total trade in 2008 (figure 6-29; appendix table 6-37). Canada exported $17 billion and imported $28 billion, resulting in a surplus of $11 billion (figure 6-30; appendix table 6-37). ICT and aerospace constituted three-quarters of this bilateral trade (appendix tables 6-38 and 6-40). The United States had a $9-billion surplus with Canada in ICT goods and a $2-billion deficit in aerospace products.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-39\n\nGlobalization of Knowledge-Intensive Service Industries\nServices have historically been more local and insulated from global competition than manufactured goods because they were less easily traded and often had to be located near the consumer. However, rapid growth of new international markets, increased competition, and advances in communications and other enabling technologies have ushered in the globalization of services. Tradable knowledge-intensive services include three commercial services: business, financial, and communications. Education and health have also become globalized but to a much lesser extent than the commercial knowledge-intensive services. Overall, the current extent of globalization of knowledge-intensive services is less than that of high-technology manufacturing industries.\nThe volume of U.S. trade in commercial knowledgeintensive services is lower than trade in high-technology manufactured goods but is producing increased surpluses. Commercial knowledge-intensive service industries are a key component of the overall U.S. trade in private services, accounting for 40% of the total (appendix table 6-49). U.S. exports of (receipts for) commercial knowledge-intensive service industries were $185 billion in 2007 (nearly 40% of total private services exports), and imports (payments) were $138 billion (again, 40% of the total) (figure 6-32). The resulting surplus, $47 billion, accounted for one-third of the overall surplus in private services trade ($139 billion) in 2007.\nBusiness, professional, and technical services, the category that includes R&D and computer services, is the largest component of trade in commercial knowledge-intensive service industries (55%) (table 6-4; appendix table 6-49) (See \"Business to Business Linkages, Exports, and Imports of R&D Services\" in chapter 4 for discussion of trends in U.S. trade in R&D services, a component of business services). Finance is the second-largest component (40%), with communications being much smaller (5%).\nU.S. trade in commercial knowledge-intensive services has been in surplus for the past 10 years (figure 6-33), in contrast to deficits in U.S. trade of high-technology goods. Business services produced a $39-billion surplus in 2007, out of a total of $47 billion (table 6-4; appendix table 6-49). Financial services gained a small surplus, and telecommunications services trade is balanced.\nThe bulk of U.S. trade in commercial knowledge-intensive service industries was with the EU (42%), with business services as the largest component (table 6-4). The next-largest trade partner was Latin America (21%), with a relatively large share in financial services that may, in part, reflect offshore banking in the Caribbean. The Asia-9's share of trade in commercial knowledge-intensive services was much smaller than in high-technology products.\n\n-PN\\YL  <: [YHKL PU JVTTLYJPHS RUV^SLKNLPU[LUZP]L ZLY]PJLZ!  \u00b6\n*\\YYLU[ KVSSHYZ IPSSPVUZ\n\n\n ,_WVY[Z\n 0TWVY[Z\n\n ;YHKL IHSHUJL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! 2UV^SLKNLPU[LUZP]L ZLY]PJLZ JSHZZPMPLK I` 6YNHUPZH[PVU MVY ,JVUVTPJ *VVWLYH[PVU HUK +L]LSVWTLU[ HUK PUJS\\KL I\\ZPULZZ MPUHUJPHS JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ LK\\JH[PVU HUK OLHS[O *VTTLYJPHS RUV^SLKNLPU[LUZP]L ZLY]PJLZ L_JS\\KL LK\\JH[PVU HUK OLHS[O\n:6<9*,! )\\YLH\\ VM ,JVUVTPJ (UHS`ZPZ 0U[LYUH[PVUHS ,JVUVTPJ (JJV\\U[Z <: 0U[LYUH[PVUHS :LY]PJLZ! *YVZZ)VYKLY ;YHKL  \u00b6  HUK :LY]PJLZ :\\WWSPLK ;OYV\\NO (MMPSPH[LZ  \u00b6 O[[W! ^^^ILHNV]PU[LYUH[PVUHSPU[SZLY]O[T HJJLZZLK  :LW[LTILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nU.S. Multinationals in Knowledgeand Technology-Intensive Industries\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) conducts an annual survey of U.S. multinationals that includes firms in KTI industries.

The distribution between U.S. and foreign employment showed little change in pharmaceuticals and computers from 1999 to 2006. However, the U.S.\n\n\f6-42 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nemployment share in scientific instruments fell from 72% to 66% over this period (figure 6-35).\nInformation and Communications Technology Services and Manufacturing\nU.S. multinationals in the ICT industries generated more than $400 billion worldwide in value added in 2006, of which 70% was attributable to ICT services and 30% to ICT manufacturing (appendix table 6-50). U.S. ICT multinationals generated most (75%) of their production from their headquarters and other U.S. locations, and the remainder from their foreign affiliates (figure 6-36).\nHowever, the distribution of value added between U.S. and foreign affiliates varies widely by industry. The U.S. share of value added in ICT services was highest in telecommunications (97%), about average in information and data processing services (77%), and considerably lower in computer systems design (58%) (figure 6-36; appendix table 6-50). In the two ICT manufacturing industries, the domestic value-added portion is below the overall ICT average: 64% in communications and semiconductors and 48% in computers and office machinery.\nGlobalization of ICT, as measured by the U.S. and foreign shares of value added, has increased in this decade. The U.S. share dropped from 81% of value added to 75% because of substantial declines in the two ICT manufacturing industries, whereas the U.S. share of value added remained stable in the ICT service industries (figure 6-36; appendix table 6-50). (Employment data for foreign affiliates for 2006 are not available for four of the five ICT industries.)\n\nU.S. and Foreign Direct Investment in Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries\nForeign direct investment (FDI) has the potential to generate employment, raise productivity, transfer skills and technology, enhance exports, and contribute to long-term economic development (Kumar 2009). Receipt of FDI may indicate a developing country's emerging capability and integration with countries that have more established industries. FDI in specific industries may suggest the potential for their evolution and the creation of new technologies.\nThis section uses data from the BEA on U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States in KTI industries. The rising volume of trade by U.S.-based KTI firms has been accompanied by increases in U.S. direct investment abroad and FDI in the United States.\nU.S. Direct Investment Abroad in Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries\nAccording to data from the BEA, the stock of U.S. direct investment abroad had reached $121 billion in hightechnology manufactures and $834 billion in commercial knowledge-intensive service industries by 2008 (table 6-5; appendix table 6-51).15 This represented one-quarter of the stock of all U.S. direct overseas investment in all manufacturing industries ($0.5 trillion) and about one-third of U.S. direct overseas investment in all services ($2.5 trillion).\nThe stock of U.S. foreign direct investment abroad in high-technology manufacturing industries increased from $87 billion in 2000 to $121 billion in 2008 (table 6-5; appendix table 6-51).

However, the investment stock of the computer industry dropped by 36%, from $14 billion to $9 billion, and its share of all high-technology manufacturing industries fell by half, from 16% to 7%.\nThe stock of U.S. direct investment abroad in commercial knowledge-intensive service industries was $834 billion in 2008, one-third of the stock of total U.S. direct investment abroad in all services (table 6-5; appendix table 6-51). Financial services dominated commercial knowledge-intensive services investments at $634 billion (76%), up from $217 billion in 2000. Business services grew from $61 billion in 2000 to $185 billion in 2008. However, the stock of U.S. FDI in communications fell from $27 billion to $15 billion.\nGeographic data on U.S. FDI investments in high-technology industries is limited to computer and electronic products, which includes computers, communications and semiconductors, and scientific instruments. For these products, the EU was the largest recipient with $27 billion (35% share in 2008), followed by $23 billion in the Asia-9 (30%) (table 6-6). Investments in Canada, China, and Japan were 4%\u00ad13% of the total. There was little change in these shares from 2000 to 2008.\nThe largest foreign destinations for U.S. direct investment in financial services are the EU ($314 billion in 2008) and Latin America ($195 billion), for a combined 80% of the total (table 6-6). The Asia-9, Canada, China, and Japan have 5% or less of the total. The EU was the largest recipient at $78\n\nbillion (64% share) of investment in information services, which includes communications. Investments in Asia were smaller, with 2% in China and 5% each in the Asia-9 and Japan.\nData on professional, scientific, and technical services, a component of business services, show that the EU had $53 billion of the $81 billion in stock of worldwide U.S. FDI in this industry in 2008 (table 6-6). The Asia-9, Canada, and China were the next-largest recipients with shares of 5%\u00ad 10%. The shares of these regions/countries shifted between 2000 and 2008. Canada's share increased from 6% to 10% and China's share increased from 2% to 5%. Japan's share fell sharply from 16% to 3%.\nForeign Direct Investment in U.S. Knowledge- and Technology-Intensive Industries\nAccording to BEA data, the stock of FDI in U.S. hightechnology manufacturing industries stood at $187 billion in 2008, up from $133 billion in 2000 and above the stock of $128 billion in U.S. investment abroad (table 6-5; appendix table 6-51). The FDI stock in the U.S. pharmaceuticals industry was about $125 billion in 2008, and the stock in communications and semiconductors was $25 billion, for a combined share of 80% of FDI stock in U.S. high-technology industries. The share of pharmaceuticals doubled, from 34% to 67%, and the share of communications and semiconductors fell from 47% to 13%.\nFDI stock in U.S. commercial knowledge-intensive service industries was $390 billion in 2008, compared with\n\nTable 6-5 Stock of U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in United States, by selected industry/ service: 2000 and 2008\n(Billions of dollars)\n\nU.S. direct investment abroad Foreign direct investment in U.S.\n\nIndustry/service\n\n2000\n\n2008\n\n2000\n\n2008\n\nAll industries ....................................................................................

FDI stock in U.S. financial services increased by nearly 50% (from $167 to $249 billion) and nearly doubled\n\nin business services (from $47 billion to $91 billion). (Data for communications services are not available for 2000.)\nLimited data on geographic origin show that the EU and Japan are the largest sources of foreign direct investment in U.S. computer and electronic products industries, which comprised more than 90% of the stock of worldwide\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-45\n\ninvestment in these U.S. industries ($63 billion) in 2008 (table 6-6). The EU's investment stayed constant at about $40 billion between 2000 and 2008. However, its share increased from 44% to 63% because of a $30-billion decline in the stock of total inward investment in this industry during this period. Japan's investment rose from $17 billion in 2000 to $19 billion in 2008. Canada's investment fell sharply from $27 billion (29% share) to a slight negative position ($0.3 billion).16\nIn commercial knowledge-intensive service industries, the two largest sources of FDI in U.S. financial services are the EU and Canada, which provided more than 80% of the $264 billion in stock of worldwide investment in this industry in 2008 (table 6-6). The EU had the largest share (80%) of the $146 billion in investment stock in the U.S. information services industry in 2008. Its share increased 13 percentage points between 2000 and 2008. Latin America's share fell from 9% to less than 1%. The EU was also the largest investor in professional, scientific, and technical services, with a share of 73% ($45 billion of inward investment in 2008). The EU's share, however, fell almost 20 percentage points between 2000 and 2008. Japan's share of investment in this industry more than doubled, from 3% to 8%.\nInnovation-Related Indicators of U.S. and Other Major Economies\nInnovation--the creation of new or significantly improved products or processes, along with novel marketing activities and organizational methods--is widely recognized as instrumental to the realization of commercial value in the marketplace and as a driver of economic growth.17 ICT technologies, for example, have stimulated innovation of new products, services, and industries that have transformed the world economy over the past several decades. However, direct measures of innovation for the United States and many other regional/national economies remain limited. (See the section on intangible assets in this chapter and sidebar, \"Developments in Innovation-Related Metrics,\" in chapter 4.)\nU.S. Trade in Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are those that embody knowledge content, for example, patents, trademarks, and licensing of computer software (Idris 2003). These can be traded (licensed for use). The United States has a longstanding surplus in trade of intangible assets with the rest of the world (figure 6-37).\nU.S. receipts for exports of intangible assets were $83 billion in 2007, 14% higher than in 2006 (figure 6-37; appendix table 6-52).18 U.S. imports (payments) were $25 billion (up by 5%), producing a $58-billion surplus. U.S. exports and imports of intangible assets have grown every year but one between 1992 and 2007, and the surplus has widened over the period.\nAbout three-quarters of the intangible assets trade involved exchanges between multinationals and their\n\naffiliates, either with U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates or with foreign parents and their U.S. affiliates (appendix table 6-52).19 Firms with marketable industrial processes may prefer affiliated over unaffiliated transactions to exercise greater control over the distribution and use of this property, especially when the intellectual property is instrumental to the firm's competitive position in the marketplace (Branstetter, Fishman, and Foley 2006). Differential tax policies may also affect a firm's choice of transaction mechanisms.\nDespite the greater value of transactions among affiliated companies, both affiliated and unaffiliated transactions have grown at the same pace over the past two decades. These trends suggest a greater internationalization of U.S. business activity and a growing reliance on intellectual property and other intangible assets developed overseas.20\nU.S. Trade in Industrial Processes\nA major component of U.S. intangible assets trade is industrial processes--the use of patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights.

These data include the combined transactions among affiliated firms (i.e., among firms that are tied to one another by ownership rights) and unaffiliated ones.\nU.S. exports of industrial processes were $37 billion in 2007, 45% of total intellectual property exports; U.S. imports were $18 billion, 72% of total intangible assets imports (figure 6-38). The resulting surplus, $19 billion, accounted for one-third of the overall surplus in U.S. trade in intangible assets.\nThe EU had the largest share of any economy (45%) in U.S. trade in industrial processes, followed by Japan (19%).

More than half of the U.S. surplus in 2007 was with the EU ($10.2 billion). The United States ran a surplus of $3\u00ad$4 billion with the Asia-9 and Latin America, and nearly a $1-billion surplus with China. These surpluses were partially offset by a $2.8-billion deficit with Japan.\nGlobal Trends in Patenting\nTo foster inventiveness, nations assign property rights to inventors in the form of patents. These rights allow the inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention for a limited period in exchange for publicly disclosing details and licensing the use of the invention.21 Inventors obtain patents from government-authorized agencies for inventions judged to be \"new...useful...and... nonobvious.\"22\nPatenting is an intermediate step toward innovation, and patent data provide indirect and partial indicators of innovation. Not all inventions are patented, and the propensity to patent differs by industry and technology area. Not all patents are of equal value; patents may be obtained to block rivals, negotiate with competitors, or help in infringement lawsuits (Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000).\nIndeed, the vast majority of patents are never commercialized. However, the smaller number of patents that are commercialized result in new or improved products or processes or even entirely new industries. In addition, their licensing may provide an important source of revenue, and patents may provide important information for subsequent inventions and technological advances.\nThis discussion focuses largely on patent activity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It is one of the largest patent offices in the world and has a significant share of applications and grants from foreign inventors because of the size and openness of the U.S. market.23 These market attributes make U.S. patenting data useful for identifying trends in global inventiveness.\nThis section also deals with a subset of patents that their owners presume to be of sufficient economic value to warrant the high costs associated with patent filing and maintenance in three of the world's largest markets: the United States, the EU, and Japan.24\nTrends in Applications for USPTO Patents Data on patent filings provide a more current look at in-\nventiveness trends than do data on patents granted because of the long lead times.25 As it turns out, trends in patent applications are a reasonable proxy for later trends in patents granted.\nInventors filed 456,000 patent applications with USPTO in 2008, unchanged from 2007, but nearly double the number a decade ago (figure 6-39; appendix tables 6-53 and 6-54). The strong growth of U.S. patent applications between the mid-1990s and 2007 coincided with a strengthening of the patent system and the extension of patent protection into new technology areas through policy changes and judicial decisions during the 1980s and 1990s (NRC 2004).

Most USPTO patents credited to the United States are owned by corporations (see sidebar, \"U.S. Patents Granted, by Type of Ownership\").27\nJapan, the EU, and the Asia-9 are the main sources of inventors outside of the United States who file U.S. patent applications (figure 6-39; appendix table 6-54). Japan-based inventors filed 82,000 applications (18%) in 2008, followed by 65,000 by EU inventors (14%) and 46,000 (10%) by Asia-9 inventors, mostly from South Korea and Taiwan. China is ranked a distant fifth with a 1% share. The majority of applications from other regions originate from advanced countries, including Australia, Canada, and Switzerland.\nThe number of patent applications from Japan and the EU grew more slowly from 1995 to 2008 than those originating elsewhere (appendix tables 6-53 and 6-54). The Asia-9's number of applications rose at more than twice the average rate, driven by increases in South Korea and Taiwan, and increased the Asia-9 share from 5% to 10% (figure 6-39). Growth in the number of applications from India and China accelerated during this period but from very low levels. The location of China-based inventors shifted from Hong Kong (64% of China's patent applications in 1997) to mainland China (81% of China's patent applications in 2008).\nUSPTO patents granted among these five major world regions/countries reveal trends very similar to those observed for patent applications through 2008 (figure 6-39; appendix tables 6-56 and 6-57). However, the U.S. share edged down from 50% in 2007 to 49% in 2008, the first time the U.S. share has been less than half for the past four decades (USPTO 2008). The Asia-9's share rose from 9% to 10% and the shares of the EU, Japan, and China remained steady.\nUSPTO Patents Granted, by Technology Area This section discusses trends in several technology areas.\nThe biggest--information and communications technologies--accounts for nearly 40% of all USPTO patents (figure 6-40 and appendix table 6-60). Two smaller technology areas, aerospace and pharmaceuticals, are closely associated with their respective high-technology industries. Measurement and control equipment is linked with scientific instruments industries. Biotechnology, medical equipment, and medical electronics are important technologies for health care.\nICT Patenting. Patents in the largest single patent group, ICT--computers, semiconductors, and telecommunications--have risen rapidly and accounted for 65,000\n\n\f6-48 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nU.S. Patents Granted, by Type of Ownership\n\nCorporations own the majority of patents granted to U.S. entities, and their share has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s (figure 6-C). In 2008, U.S. corporations owned 88% of patents issued to U.S. inventors, with individuals owning 11%; in 1992, the respective shares were 74% and 24%. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office defines the corporate sector as including U.S. corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions. U.S. universities and colleges owned about 4% of U.S. utility patents granted to corporations in 2005.\n\n(For a further discussion of academic patenting, see \"Academic Patents, Licenses, Royalties, and Startups\" in chapter 5.)\nCorporations also own the majority of U.S. patents issued to the rest of the world; that share has also been increasing over the past decade. The individual ownership share of patents issued to the rest of the world (which is about half the level in the United States) has fallen since the early 1990s.\n\n-PN\\YL * <:7;6 WH[LU[Z NYHU[LK I` V^ULYZOPW [`WL!   \n7LYJLU[\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n HUK \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n *VYWVYH[PVUZ\n\n0UKP]PK\\HSZ <: PU]LU[VYZ\n\n.V]LYUTLU[\n\n*VYWVYH[PVUZ\n\n0UKP]PK\\HSZ 5VU<: PU]LU[VYZ\n\n .V]LYUTLU[\n\n $ # <:7;6 $ <: 7H[LU[ HUK ;YHKLTHYR 6MMPJL 56;,:! *VYWVYH[PVUZ YLMLY [V WYP]H[L UVUWYVMP[ HUK LK\\JH[PVUHS PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ )\\SR VM JVYWVYH[L WH[LU[Z VYPNPUH[L MYVT WYP]H[L JVTWHUPLZ :6<9*,! <:7;6 (SS ;LJOUVSVNPLZ <[PSP[` 7H[LU[Z 9LWVY[ O[[W!^^^\\ZW[VNV]^LIVMMPJLZHJPKVVLPW[HMHSSF[LJOO[T HJJLZZLK  6J[VILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n(41% share) of the 158,000 patents granted in 2008, up from 22,000 (21%) in 1995 (figure 6-40 and appendix tables 6-58 and 6-60). The U.S. share of ICT patents (48%) was identical to its total share of patents; it was higher in computers (55%) and substantially lower in semiconductors (37%) (figures 6-39 and 6-41).\nJapan ranked second in ICT patents (23% in 2008) (figure 6-41; appendix table 6-59). This area of strength, relative to its average share of 21%, reflects a higher-than-average share in semiconductors (29%) (figure 6-39; appendix table 6-62). Nevertheless, Japan's overall ICT share declined steeply during the decade, from 36% in 1995 to 23% in 2008, reflecting declining shares in all three ICT technologies (appendix tables 6-61 through 6-63).\nThe EU, fourth-ranked in ICT, was relatively weaker in these technologies compared with its overall share (figures 6-39 and 6-41; appendix tables 6-59 and 6-61 through 6-63).\n\nIts share has been roughly flat in all three ICT technology areas.\nThe Asia-9's share of ICT patents more than doubled, from 5% in 1995 to 13% in 2008, because of strong growth in all three technology areas (figure 6-41; appendix tables 6-59, 6-61, 6-62, 6-63). The Asia-9 surpassed the EU in 2007 and ranked third in ICT patents. The majority of patents fueling this growth originated from South Korea and Taiwan. China's share of USPTO ICT patents was small (1%), but strong growth from a low base in computer and semiconductor patents was evident over the decade.\nPatents in Other Technology Areas. The United States has a comparatively higher-than-average share of patents in aerospace and four technology areas connected with health: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical equipment, and medical electronics (figures 6-39 and 6-42; appendix tables 6-64 through 6-68). Its share of aerospace patents fluctuated\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-49\n\n-PN\\YL  <:7;6 WH[LU[ NYHU[Z I` ZLSLJ[LK [LJOUVSVN` HYLH!  \u00b6\n\n0*; [LJOUVSVNPLZ HUK TLHZ\\YLTLU[ HUK JVU[YVS LX\\PWTLU[ 7LYJLU[ \n\n0*;\n\n*VTW\\[LYZ\n\n\n\n;LSLJVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ\n\n:LTPJVUK\\J[VYZ\n\n4LHZ\\YLTLU[ HUK\n\n\n\nJVU[YVS LX\\PWTLU[\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n(LYVZWHJL HUK TLKPJHSYLSH[LK [LJOUVSVNPLZ \n\n 4LKPJHS LX\\PWTLU[\n\n 7OHYTHJL\\[PJHSZ\n)PV[LJOUVSVN`\n\n 4LKPJHS LSLJ[YVUPJZ\n (LYVZWHJL\n\n \n\n      \n\n0*; $ PUMVYTH[PVU HUK JVTT\\UPJH[PVUZ [LJOUVSVN`\" <:7;6 $ <: 7H[LU[ HUK ;YHKLTHYR 6MMPJL\n56;,! ;LJOUVSVNPLZ JSHZZPMPLK I` ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK\n:6<9*,! ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK 7YVWYPL[HY` 7H[LU[ KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nbroadly above 60%. In the health-related areas, the U.S. share stayed above 60% in medical equipment and medical electronics, and was just below 60% in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents.\nThe EU's patents position is relatively strong in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, measurement and control equipment, and medical electronics (figure 6-42; appendix tables 6-64, 6-66, 6-68, and 6-69). Its share of patents in these technologies is about 20% compared with its 14%\n\noverall share (figure 6-39). Its share in medical equipment patents is close to its overall share.\nAs a group, the Asia-9 is relatively weaker in these technologies, as indicated by its patent shares in each technology area, which are half or less of the overall Asia-9 share; the exception is measurement and control equipment, which is near the average (7%) (figures 6-39 and 6-42; appendix tables 6-64 through 6-69). The Asia-9 share has risen over the past decade in measurement and control equipment, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. Its share has remained roughly stable in the other technologies.\nChina's share in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and measurement and control equipment is the same as its overall share (figures 6-39 and 6-42; appendix tables 6-65, 6-66, and 6-69). Its shares in aerospace, medical equipment, and medical electronics are 0.5%, significantly below its overall share (1%) (appendix tables 6-64, 6-67, and 6-68).\nPatenting of Valuable Inventions: Triadic Patents Using patent counts as an indicator of national inventive\nactivity does not differentiate between inventions of minor and substantial economic potential. Inventions for which patent protection is sought in three of the world's largest markets--the United States, the EU, and Japan--are likely to be viewed by their owners as justifying the high costs of filing and maintaining these patents in three markets. That is, they are deemed to be substantially economically valuable.\nThe number of such \"triadic\" patents was estimated at about 51,600 in 2006 (the last year for which these data are available), up from 41,500 in 1997, and showing little growth after 2004. The United States, the EU, and Japan held basically equal shares (figure 6-43; appendix table 6-70),28 and their nearly identical positions in triadic patents contrast with a far greater gap between them in USPTO patent applications and grants.\nThe United States, the EU, and Japan together accounted for more than 93% of triadic patents in 1997, but that share dropped to 87% by 2006 (figure 6-43; appendix table 6-70). The Asia-9's corresponding share increase from 1% in 1997 to 6% in 2006 was almost entirely driven by increasing South Korean high-value filings. Taiwan had much lower activity in triadic patent filings than in total USPTO applications and grants, and high-value patent filings by China and India, though increasing, remain minuscule.\nU.S. High-Technology Small Businesses\nMany of the new technologies and industries seen as critical to U.S. economic growth are also closely identified with small businesses, that is, those employing fewer than 500 people. Biotechnology, the Internet, and computer software are examples of industries built around new technologies in whose initial commercialization small businesses played an essential role.\nThis section covers patterns and trends that characterize small businesses operating in high-technology industries. It is based on data from the Census Bureau. Two sources of financing for high-technology small businesses are examined, using\n\n\f6-50 \n\nChapter 6.

In contrast, small firms accounted for slightly more than half of total employment in all industries29 in 2006 (table 6-7). About one-half million small businesses operating in hightechnology industries employed 5 million workers in 2006 (appendix table 6-71).30\nIn 2006, most workers in these high-technology small businesses (68%) were in the service sector (table 6-8; appendix table 6-71), concentrated in six BLS high-technology\n\ncategories: architecture, computer systems design, consulting, management, commercial equipment and services, and R&D. These service industries collectively employed more than 85% of workers employed by all small businesses in high-technology service industries in 2006. The manufacturing sector employs most of the remaining workers in hightechnology small businesses (30% in 2006).\nSmall business employment in high-technology manufacturing is similarly concentrated within a relatively small number of industries: motor vehicle parts, metal working, semiconductors, other machinery, fabricated metals, and navigational and measurement tools (table 6-8; appendix table 6-71). These six industries collectively employed more than half of all workers in all manufacturing high-technology small businesses and 15% of the entire high-technology small business labor force in 2006.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-51\n\n-PN\\YL  <:7;6 WH[LU[Z NYHU[LK PU ZLSLJ[LK [LJOUVSVNPLZ I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`!  \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[        \n \n       \n \n\n(LYVZWHJL WYVK\\J[Z\n<: ,< 1HWHU *OPUH (ZPH\n\n\n\n   7OHYTHJL\\[PJHSZ\n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n       \n \n\n\n\n       \n \n\n4LHZ\\YLTLU[ HUK JVU[YVS LX\\PWTLU[\n\n\n\n   )PV[LJOUVSVN`\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n       \n \n\n\n\n4LKPJHS LX\\PWTLU[   \n\n\n\n\n\n       \n \n\n4LKPJHS LSLJ[YVUPJZ       \n\n,< $ ,\\YVWLHU <UPVU\" <:7;6 $ <: 7H[LU[ HUK ;YHKLTHYR 6MMPJL\n56;,:! ;LJOUVSVNPLZ JSHZZPMPLK I` ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK 7H[LU[ NYHU[Z MYHJ[PVUHSS` HSSVJH[LK HTVUN YLNPVUZJV\\U[YPLZLJVUVTPLZ VU IHZPZ VM WYVWVY[PVU VM YLZPKLUJLZ VM HSS UHTLK PU]LU[VYZ (ZPH PUJS\\KLZ 0UKPH 0UKVULZPH 4HSH`ZPH 7OPSPWWPULZ :PUNHWVYL :V\\[O 2VYLH ;HP^HU ;OHPSHUK HUK =PL[UHT *OPUH PUJS\\KLZ /VUN 2VUN ,< PUJS\\KLZ HSS  TLTILY Z[H[LZ\n:6<9*,! ;OL 7H[LU[ )VHYK 7YVWYPL[HY` 7H[LU[ KH[HIHZL ZWLJPHS [HI\\SH[PVUZ  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f6-52 \n\nChapter 6.

Venture capitalists manage the pooled investments of others (typically wealthy investors, investment banks, and other financial institutions) in a professionally managed fund. In return, venture capitalists receive ownership equity and almost always get to participate in managerial decisions.\nVenture capital firms have categorized their investments into four broad financing stages, which are also relevant for discussion of angel investment:\n Seed and startup supports proof-of-concept development (seed) and initial product development and marketing (startup).\n Early funds support the initiation of commercial manufacturing and sales.\n Expansion financing provides working capital for company expansion, funds for major growth (including plant expansion, marketing, or development of an improved product), and financing to prepare for an initial public offering (IPO).\n Later-stage funds include acquisition financing and management and leveraged buyouts. Acquisition financing provides resources for the purchase of another company, and a management and leveraged buyout provides funds to enable operating management to acquire a product line or business from either a public or a private company.\nAngel investor funds are concentrated in the seed-startup and early stages. During the 2007\u00ad08 period, they provided 80% of investment for these stages, compared with 20% in\n\nTable 6-7 Firms and employment in U.S. small businesses versus all businesses: 2006\n\nAll technologies\n\nHigh technology\n\nBusiness\n\nFirms\n\nEmployment\n\n(thousands)\n\n(millions)\n\nFirms (thousands)\n\nEmployment (millions)\n\nAll businesses..................................................................................

Venture capital, however, is provided primarily for expansion and later-stage funding (figure 6-45; appendix table 6-72).\nThis section examines angel and venture capital investment patterns in the United States, focusing on the period from 2001 to 2008. The section examines (1) changes in the overall level of investment, (2) investment by stage of financing, and (3) the technology areas that U.S. angel and venture capitalists find attractive.\nU.S. Angel Investment. According to data from the Center for Venture Research, angel investors provided $19 billion in financing in 2008, a sharp drop from $26 billion in 2007 following 5 consecutive years of increases (figure 6-46; appendix table 6-73).31 An estimated 55,000 businesses received financing from angel investors in 2008, 1,600 fewer than in 2007 but 4,500 more than in 2006 (table 6-9). The average investment per business fell from about $455,000 in 2007 to $346,000 in 2008.\nAlthough angel investors continue to concentrate on the riskiest stage of business development, they have become more conservative in their investment patterns. The share of angel funding going to seed-startup was 42% in the 2007\u00ad08 period compared with 47% in the 2002\u00ad04 period (figure 6-44).\n\n-PN\\YL  +PZ[YPI\\[PVU VM <: HUNLS JHWP[HS PU]LZ[TLU[ I` MPUHUJPUN Z[HNL! \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[\n\n :LLKZ[HY[\\W\n\n,HYS`\n\n3H[LY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n\u00b6\n\n56;,:! :LLKZ[HY[\\W PUJS\\KLZ WYVVM VM JVUJLW[ YLZLHYJO HUK WYVK\\J[ KL]LSVWTLU[ ,HYS` PUJS\\KLZ MPUHUJPUN MVY HJ[P]P[PLZ Z\\JO HZ PUP[PHS L_WHUZPVU JVTTLYJPHS THU\\MHJ[\\YPUN HUK THYRL[PUN 3H[LY PUJS\\KLZ THQVY L_WHUZPVU VM HJ[P]P[PLZ WYLWHYH[PVU MVY HU PUP[PHS W\\ISPJ VMMLYPUN HJX\\PZP[PVU MPUHUJPUN HUK THUHNLTLU[ HUK SL]LYHNLK I\\`V\\[\n:6<9*,! 1LMMYL` :VOS (UHS`ZPZ 9LWVY[Z *LU[LY MVY =LU[\\YL 9LZLHYJO <UP]LYZP[` VM 5L^ /HTWZOPYL O[[W!^ZIL\\UOLK\\ HUHS`ZPZYLWVY[Z HJJLZZLK  5V]LTILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f6-54 \n\nChapter 6.

Healthcare services received the largest share of angel investment in 2008 (16%), 5 percentage points lower than its 2006 share (figure 6-47). Software received 13% of total angel investment in 2008, 5 percentage points lower than its 2006 share. Biotechnology received 11% of total investment in 2008, 7 percentage points lower than its 2006 share. The share of industrial/\n\nenergy increased from 6% in 2006 to 8% in 2008, possibly reflecting opportunities that angel investors see in green and clean energy technologies.\nBusinesses receiving angel investment in 2007 employed about 200,000 workers (table 6-10). This figure is about the same as employment in the 2005\u00ad06 period. Each business employed an average of 3.5 workers in 2007, slightly lower than the average in 2005\u00ad06.\nU.S. Venture Capital Investment. U.S. venture capitalists invested $28.1 billion in 2008, an 8% decline compared with the level in 2007 and the first decline since 2003 (figure 6-46; appendix table 6-72). The amounts of angel and venture capital investment have been very similar for the past 5 years. Since declining sharply in 2001 following the end of the dot.com boom, angel and venture capital investments have generally been strengthening, but in 2008 they remained well below their previous peaks.\nVenture capitalists financed 3,300 firms in 2007, far fewer than the number of businesses financed by angel investors in the same year (57,000) (table 6-9; appendix table 6-72). Average venture capital investment has been about $8.5 million per firm for the past several years, much larger than the corresponding figure for angel investment.\nThe number of businesses funded by venture capital and the average amount of investment have been increasing during the past several years. The number of businesses was about 3,300 in 2007\u00ad08, one-quarter higher than the average for the 2002\u00ad05 period (table 6-9; appendix table 6-72). The average investment per business in 2008 ($8.6 million) was about $675,000 lower (not inflation adjusted) than that in 2007 but approximately $650,000 higher than the average for the 2002\u00ad03 period.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-55\n\nTable 6-9 Average investment of angel and venture capital per business: 2002\u00ad08\n\nAngel capital\n\nVenture capital\n\nAverage\n\nAverage\n\nTotal\n\ninvestment/\n\nTotal\n\ninvestment/\n\nBusinesses\n\ninvestment\n\nbusiness\n\nBusinesses\n\ninvestment\n\nbusiness\n\nYear\n\n(n)\n\n($billions)\n\n($thousands)\n\n(n)\n\n($billions)\n\n($thousands)\n\n2002............................\n\n36,000\n\n15.7\n\n2003............................\n\n42,000\n\n18.1\n\n2004............................\n\n48,000\n\n22.5\n\n2005............................\n\n49,500\n\n23.1\n\n2006............................\n\n51,000\n\n25.6\n\n2007............................\n\n57,120\n\n26.0\n\n2008............................\n\n55,480\n\n19.2\n\n436\n\n2,634\n\n21.3\n\n8,087\n\n431\n\n2,461\n\n19.3\n\n7,842\n\n469\n\n2,625\n\n22.1\n\n8,419\n\n467\n\n2,708\n\n22.9\n\n8,456\n\n502\n\n3,089\n\n26.3\n\n8,514\n\n455\n\n3,301\n\n30.6\n\n9,270\n\n346\n\n3,262\n\n28.1\n\n8,614\n\nNOTE: Business includes anything from an entrepreneur with an idea to a legally established operating company.\n\nSOURCES: Jeffrey Sohl, Analysis Reports, Center for Venture Research, University of New Hampshire, http://wsbe.unh.edu/analysis-reports-0; and National Venture Capital Association and Price Waterhouse Coopers, Money Tree Report, https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/MTPublic/ns/index.jsp, accessed 15 March 2009.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nVenture capital investment has become generally more conservative than angel investment, and venture capital investments have more often been made in the later stages of business development. Capital provided for expansion and later-stage financing accounted for a combined share of 75% or more from 2002 to 2008 (figure 6-44; appendix table 6-72). Expansion financing accounted for half or more of all venture capital investment from 1996 through 2004, after which its share declined to 37% in 2007\u00ad08 as later-stage investments rose to 39%.\nVenture capitalists have largely abandoned the seedstartup stage, which was 9% in the 1996\u00ad98 period, declined to 2% in the 2002\u00ad04 period, and recently recovered to a modest 5% (figure 6-44; appendix table 6-72). The factors behind the downturn are thought to be the desire for lowered investment risk, a shorter time horizon for realizing gains, and an increase in venture capital companies' base level for investment, which has come to exceed the amounts typically required for the earliest stages. The recent increase is thought to reflect the emergence of promising new investment opportunities after the closeout of holdings in mature companies (NVCA 2007a).\nVenture Capital Financing, by Industry. Computer software had the largest share of venture capital funding of any industry in 2007\u00ad08 (18%) but registered a 5-percentagepoint decline from 1999\u00ad2001 levels (figure 6-48; appendix table 6-72). Likewise, the share of telecommunications declined to 7% in 2007\u00ad08, about half of its 1999\u00ad2001 level.\nBiotechnology received the second highest share of venture capital funding in 2007\u00ad08 (16%), slightly below the 2002\u00ad06 level but more than triple its share during the 1999\u00ad 2001 period (figure 6-48; appendix table 6-72).

Knowledge is regarded as an important factor of innovation, given the shift of economic activity toward KTI industries and the growing importance of intangible assets.\nThe KEI is a simple average of four indicator scores that measure countries' relative standing in ICT, innovation, education, and economic incentive and institutional regime. In turn, the four component indicators are composed of several variables each. Countries are ranked in order of\n\ntheir scores on each variable, and scores are normalized on a scale of 0 to 10 compared with all countries: The top 10% of performers get a normalized score between 9 and 10, the next decile receives normalized scores between 8 and 9, and so on.\nThe 2005 KEI scores of the United States, Japan, and the EU were the highest among the major regions/countries/ economies, followed by those of Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea (figure 6-49; appendix table 6-74). Over a decade (1995\u00ad2005), the KEI scores of the United States, the EU, and Japan declined somewhat (figure 6-49; appendix table 6-74). The U.S. score fell largely because of a decline in the ICT sector, whose index value dropped from 9.8 to 8.9, and also because of weakness in the education sector. Japan's lowered KEI score reflected a decline in Japan's economic incentive regime; the EU's score was reduced because of a lowered education sector score.\nAmong the developing countries/economies, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam showed considerable improvement over the decade, albeit from very different levels (figure 6-49; appendix table 6-74). China improved its scores in all four component indicators, with the largest gains in the ICT and innovation scores. Although China's gap with the developed economies narrowed, its KEI score remains well below those of the developed economies.\nAmong the Asia-9, Taiwan and Vietnam showed solid increases (figure 6-49; appendix table 6-74). India's KEI index remained unchanged, thus widening the gap with China. India's modest score gains in innovation and economic incentive regime values were offset by weaknesses in ICT and education indicators, which remained in the 20% percentile range.\nAmong other developing countries, Brazil, Croatia, and Sri Lanka showed solid gains (appendix table 6-74). The improvement in Brazil's score reflected a large increase in its education score and a rise in its ICT score.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-57\n\n-PN\\YL  >VYSK )HUR 2UV^SLKNL ,JVUVTPJ 0UKL_ I` ZLSLJ[LK YLNPVUJV\\U[Y`LJVUVT`!

The U.S. economy has grown relatively rapidly and become more productive while sustaining a high and rising per capita income.\nThe strong competitive position of the U.S. economy is tied to continued U.S. global leadership in many KTI industries. The United States continues to hold the dominant market position in commercial knowledge-intensive service industries, which account for nearly one-fifth of global economic activity. The U.S. trading position in\n\ntechnology-oriented services remains strong, as evidenced by the continued U.S. surplus in commercial knowledgeintensive services and licensing of patents and trade secrets.\nAlthough the United States remains a leader in many KTI industries, its market position in most of these industries has either flattened or slipped. The historically strong U.S. trade position in advanced technology products has shifted to deficit because of the faster growth of imports. This shift is due in part to U.S. companies moving assembly and other routine activities to China and other East Asian countries. However, the U.S. deficit also reflects the development of indigenous capability of East Asian countries in high-technology manufacturing industries.\nChina and other emerging Asian economies are showing rapid progress in their overall economic progress and\n\n\f6-58 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\ntechnological capabilities. Their market positions in KTI industries--particularly high-technology manufacturing industries--have strengthened, and their shares of U.S. and economically valuable patents have risen, led by South Korea and Taiwan. World Bank indicators of innovative capacity also show that these emerging Asian economies are converging with the United States or are making rapid progress.\nChina has become a leading global producer and exporter of high-technology manufacturing goods by becoming the world's major assembly center, supplied by components and inputs from East Asian economies. However, China's rapid progress in other indicators of technological capability and the nascent rise of globally competitive Chinese companies suggest that China is moving to more technologically challenging and higher end manufacturing activities.\nThe EU's position is similar to that of the United States-- relatively strong economic performance with flat or slight declines in its market position of KTI industries. Japan's economy has shown less dynamism compared with the United States and the EU, and its market position has declined steeply in many KTI industries. Japan's loss of market position in high-technology manufacturing industries is due, in part, to Japanese companies shifting production to China and other Asian economies.\nThe severe downturn of the global economy, starting in 2008, has interrupted these trends observed over the past decade. The United States, the EU, and other developed economies have experienced sharp declines in their commercial knowledge-intensive service industries. The steep drop in exports of high-technology manufacturing goods has adversely affected many Asian economies and slowed China's growth. Whether the global downturn will lead to fundamental changes in the market positions of the United States and other major economies in the production and trade of KTI industries remains uncertain.\nNotes\n1. The Asia-9 includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n2. See OECD (2001) for a discussion of classifying economic activities according to degree of \"knowledge intensity.\" A different, product-based classification of the Census Bureau is used in part of the discussion on trade.\n3. In designating these high-technology manufacturing industries, OECD took into account both the R&D done directly by firms and R&D embedded in purchased inputs (indirect R&D) for 13 countries: the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Ireland. Direct intensities were calculated as the ratio of R&D expenditure to output (production) in 22 industrial sectors. Each sector was weighted according to its share of the total output among the 13 countries, using purchasing power parities as exchange\n\nrates. Indirect intensities were calculated using the technical coefficients of industries on the basis of input-output matrices. OECD then assumed that, for a given type of input and for all groups of products, the proportions of R&D expenditure embodied in value added remained constant. The inputoutput coefficients were then multiplied by the direct R&D intensities. For further details concerning the methodology used, see OECD (2001). It should be noted that several nonmanufacturing industries have equal or greater R&D intensities. For additional perspectives on OECD's methodology, see Godin (2004).\n4. The combined estimated R&D expenditures of these regions/countries were $969 billion (2007 purchasing power parity) of an estimated $1.1 trillion in global R&D expenditures in 2007.\n5. Purchasing power parity is the exchange rate required to purchase an equivalent market basket of goods.\n6. This is an imprecise measure for comparing productivity growth, especially between developed and developing economies. One reason is that productivity is more difficult to measure in the service sector, and services typically have a far larger part of GDP in developed compared with developing economies.\n7. See Atkinson and McKay (2007:16\u00ad17), for a discussion and references to the impact of IT on economic growth and productivity.\n8. See Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995) and DeLong and Summers (2001) for a discussion of ICT and generalpurpose technologies.\n9. This index is composed of three measures: telephones per 1,000 people, computers per 1,000 people, and Internet users per 10,000 people. Country scores on measures are normalized on a scale of 1\u00ad10, with 10 being equivalent to the highest score received by a country.\n10. See Mann (2006:90\u00ad92), for a discussion of the economic benefits of importing versus exporting ICT.\n11. The U.S. dollar strengthened about 30% in value between 1995 and 2001 against a trade-weighted basket of European currencies (1995\u00ad98) and the euro (1999\u00ad2001) and subsequently lost more than 50% in value against the euro between 2001 and 2007. This exchange-rate movement lowered European industry output measured in U.S. current dollars between 1995 and 2001 and raised it between 2001 and 2007.\n12. IHS Global Insight data as of July 2009. 13. The U.S. trade balance is affected by many other factors, including currency fluctuations, differing fiscal and monetary policies, and export subsidies between the United States and its trading partners. 14. U.S. multinational financial services data for 1999 and 2006 do not include banks and depository institutions, which are included in the global industry data on financial services. 15. U.S. direct investment abroad by industry and country is a lower-bound estimate because an increasing share of U.S. direct investment (36% in 2008) is through holding companies that invest in other industries that may be in\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 6-59\n\na different country. For more information, see Ibarra and Koncz (2008).\n16. In these data, BEA values foreign direct investment (FDI) at historical cost. According to BEA, a negative FDI position in the United States occurs when total claims of U.S. subsidiaries on their foreign multinational parent companies (MNCs) exceed the foreign MNCs' investment in the United States, which typically results when U.S. affiliates are net lenders to their foreign parents.\n17. There are widely different definitions of innovation, but common to these definitions is the commercialization of something that did not previously exist.\n18. Earlier data are not comparable because of a change in the data collected.\n19. An affiliate is a business enterprise located in one country that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by an entity in another country. The controlling interest for an incorporated business is 10% or more of its voting stock; for an unincorporated business, it is an interest equal to 10% of voting stock.\n20. In addition, data on the destination of multinational corporate sales to foreign affiliates also suggest that market access is an important factor in the firms' decisions to locate production abroad. See Borga and Mann (2004).\n21. Rather than granting property rights to the inventor, as is the practice in the United States and many other countries, some countries grant property rights to the applicant, which may be a corporation or other organization.\n22. U.S. patent law states that any person who \"invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent.\" The law defines nonobvious as \"sufficiently different from what has been used or described before [so] that it may be said to be nonobvious to a person having ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention.\" These terms are part of the criteria in U.S. patent law. For more information, see USPTO, \"What Is a Patent?,\" at http://www.uspto.gov/web/ offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent. Accessed 19 June 2009.\n23. The Japan Patent Office (JPO) is also a major patent office but has a much smaller share of foreign patents compared with the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO).\n24. Although the USPTO grants several types of patents, this discussion is limited to utility patents, commonly known as patents for inventions. They include any new, useful, or improved-on method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound.\n25. USPTO reports that average time to process an application (pendancy) was 31.1 months for utility, plant, and reissue patent applications in FY 2006, compared with 18.3 months in FY 2003. Applications for utility patents account for the overwhelming majority of these requests. EPO reports that the average pendancy was 45.3 months in 2005.\n\n26. Unless otherwise noted, USPTO patents are assigned to countries on the basis of the residence of the first-named inventor.\n27. U.S. patenting data by type of ownership and by state are available only for U.S. patents granted.\n28. Triadic patent families with co-inventors residing in different countries are assigned to their respective countries/ economies on a fractional count basis (i.e., each country/ economy receives fractional credit on the basis of the proportion of its inventors listed on the patent). Patents are listed by priority year, which is the year of the first patent filing. Data for 1998\u00ad2003 are estimated by the OECD.\n29. The high-technology definition used here is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and differs from that used in earlier sections.\n30. See Hecker (2005) for a definition and methodology for determining high-technology industries. Several industries identified by BLS as high technology before 2003 are not covered in the Census Bureau's data.\n31. Comparable data on angel capital investment before 2001 are not available.\nGlossary\nAffiliate: A company or business enterprise located in one country but owned or controlled (10% or more of voting securities or equivalent) by a parent company in another country; may be either incorporated or unincorporated.\nAngel investment: Financing from affluent individuals for business startups, usually in exchange for ownership equity.

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nHighlights\n\nInformation Sources, Interest, and Involvement\nTelevision and the Internet are the primary sources Americans use for science and technology (S&T) information. The Internet is the main source of information for learning about specific scientific issues such as global climate change or biotechnology.\n More Americans select television as their primary source of S&T information than any other medium.\n The Internet ranks second among sources of S&T information, and its margin over other sources is large and has been growing.\n Internet users do not always assume that online S&T information is accurate. About four out of five have checked on the reliability of information at least once.\nContinuing a long-standing pattern, Americans consistently express high levels of interest in S&T in surveys. However, other indicators, such as the types of news they follow closely, suggest a lower level of interest.\n High levels of interest in S&T are part of a long-standing trend, with more than 80% of Americans reporting they were \"very\" or \"moderately\" interested in new scientific discoveries. But relative to other news topics, interest in S&T is not particularly high.\n As with many news topics, the percentage of Americans who say they follow \"science and technology\" news \"closely\" has declined over the last 10 years.\n Recent surveys in other countries, including South Korea, China, and much of Europe, indicate that the overall level of public interest in \"new scientific discoveries\" and \"use of new inventions and technologies\" tends to be higher in the United States.\n Interest in \"environmental pollution\" or \"the environment\" is similarly high in the U.S., Europe, South Korea, and Brazil. About 9 in 10 respondents in each country expressed interest in this topic.\nIn 2008, a majority of Americans said they had visited an informal science institution such as a zoo or a natural history museum within the past year. This proportion is generally consistent with results from surveys conducted since 1979, but slightly lower than the proportion recorded in 2001.\n Americans with more formal education are much more likely to engage in informal science activities.\n Compared with the United States, visits to informal science institutions tend to be less common in Europe, Japan, China, Russia, and Brazil.\n\nPublic Knowledge About S&T\nMany Americans do not give correct answers to questions about basic factual knowledge of science or the scientific inquiry process.\n Americans' factual knowledge about science is positively related to their formal education level, income level, the number of science and math courses they have taken, and their verbal ability.\n People who score well on long-standing knowledge measures that test for information typically learned in school also appear to know more about new science related topics such as nanotechnology.\nLevels of factual knowledge of science in the United States are comparable to those in Europe and appear to be higher than in Japan, China, or Russia.\n In the United States, levels of factual knowledge of science have been stable; Europe shows evidence of recent improvement in factual knowledge of science.\n In European countries, China, and Korea demographic variations in factual knowledge are similar to those in the United States.\nCompared to the mid-1990s, Americans show a modest improvement in understanding the process of scientific inquiry in recent years.\n Americans' understanding of scientific inquiry is strongly associated with their factual knowledge of science and level of education.\n Americans' scores on questions measuring their understanding of the logic of experimentation and controlling variables do not differ by sex. In contrast, men tend to score higher than women on factual knowledge questions in the physical sciences.\nPublic Attitudes About S&T in General\nAmericans in all demographic groups consistently endorse the past achievements and future promise of S&T.\n In 2008, 68% of Americans said that the benefits of scientific research have strongly outweighed the harmful results, and only 10% said harmful results slightly or strongly outweighed the benefits.\n Nearly 9 in 10 Americans agree with the statement \"because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation.\"\n Americans also express some reservations about science. Nearly half of Americans agree that \"science makes our way of life change too fast.\"\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-5\n\n Americans tend to have more favorable attitudes about the promise of S&T than Europeans, Russians, and the Japanese. Attitudes about the promise of S&T in China and South Korea are as positive as those in the United States and in some instances even more favorable. However, residents of China and Korea are more likely than Americans to think that \"science makes our way of life change too fast.\"\nSupport for government funding of scientific research is strong.\n In 2008, 84% of Americans expressed support for government funding of basic research.\n More than one-third of Americans (38%) said in 2008 that the government spends too little on scientific research and 11% said the government spends too much. Other kinds of federal spending such as health care and education generate stronger public support.\nThe public expresses confidence in science leaders.\n In 2008, more Americans expressed a \"great deal\" of confidence in scientific leaders than in the leaders of any other institution except the military.\n Despite a general decline in confidence in institutional leaders that has spanned more than three decades, confidence in science leaders has remained relatively stable. The proportion of Americans indicating \"a great deal of confidence\" in the scientific community oscillated between 35% and 45% in surveys conducted since 1973. In every survey, the scientific community has ranked either second or third among institutional leaders.\n On science-related public policy issues (including global climate change, stem cell research, and genetically modified foods), Americans believe that science leaders, compared with leaders in other sectors, are relatively knowledgeable and impartial and should be relatively influential. However, they also perceive a considerable lack of consensus among scientists on these issues.\nOver half of Americans (56%) accord scientists \"very great prestige.\" Ratings for engineers are lower (40% indicate \"very great prestige\"), but nonetheless better than those of most other occupations.\n In 2008, scientists ranked higher in prestige than 23 other occupations surveyed, a ranking similar to that of firefighters.\n Between 2007 and 2008, engineers' rating of \"very high prestige\" increased from 30% of survey respondents to 40%.\n\nPublic Attitudes About Specific S&T Issues\nAmericans have recently become more concerned about environmental quality. However, concern about the environment is outranked by concern about the economy, unemployment, and the war in Iraq.\n Between 2004 and 2008, the proportion of Americans expressing \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of worry about the quality of the environment increased from 62% to 74%. Nonetheless, when asked to name the country's top problem in early 2009, only about 2% mentioned environmental issues.\n In 2008, 67% of Americans believed that the government was spending too little to reduce pollution and 7% thought it was spending too much.\n The trend in support for environmental protection is less evident when Americans are asked about trade-offs between environmental protection and economic growth. In March 2009, 51% of all Americans indicated that economic growth should take precedence over the environment.\nAmericans support the development of alternative sources of energy.\n A majority of Americans favor government spending to develop alternate sources of fuel for cars (86%), to develop solar and wind power (79%), and to enforce environmentally friendly regulations such as setting higher emissions and pollution standards for business and industry (84%).\n Since the mid-1990s, American public opinion on nuclear energy has been evenly divided, but the proportion of Americans favoring the use of nuclear power as one of the ways to provide electricity for the U.S. increased from 53% in 2007 to 59% in 2009.\n Europeans are divided on nuclear energy, but support is on the rise. The proportion of Europeans who said they favored energy production by nuclear power stations increased from 37% in 2005 to 44% in 2008, while the proportion opposing it decreased from 54% in 2005 to 45% in 2008. Support for nuclear energy varies a great deal among countries in this region. Citizens in countries that have operational nuclear power plants are more likely to support nuclear energy than those in other countries.\nDespite the increased funding of nanotechnology and growing numbers of nanotechnology products in the market, Americans remain largely unfamiliar with this technology.\n Even among respondents who had heard of nanotechnology, knowledge levels were not high.\n When nanotechnology is defined in surveys, Americans express favorable attitudes overall.\n\n\f7-6 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nA majority of Americans favor medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos. However, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to reproductive cloning and wary of innovations using \"cloning technology.\"\n Support for embryonic stem cell research is similar to previous years. In 2008, 57% of Americans favored\n\nembryonic stem cell research while 36% opposed it. A higher proportion (70%) favors stem cell research when it does not involve human embryos.\n More than three-quarters of Americans oppose human cloning.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-7\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nScience and technology (S&T) affect all aspects of American life. As workers, Americans use technology to improve productivity in ways that could not even be imagined a generation ago, applying recently invented tools and applications. As consumers, they entertain themselves with high technology electronic products; make friends, communicate, and keep informed about the world through the Internet; and benefit from advances in medical technologies. As citizens, they may engage in discussions on climate change, stem cell research, and deficit spending--issues about which atmospheric scientists, microbiologists, and macroeconomists have formal training and expertise.\nIt is increasingly difficult for Americans to be competent as workers, consumers, and citizens without some degree of competence in S&T. Because competence begins with understanding, this chapter presents indicators about news, information, and knowledge of S&T. How the American citizenry collectively deals with public issues that involve S&T may, in turn, affect what kinds of S&T development America will support. Thus the chapter includes indicators of people's attitudes about S&T-related issues. To put U.S. data in context, this chapter examines trend indicators for past years and comparative indicators for other countries.\nChapter Organization\nThe chapter is divided into four major sections. The first section includes indicators of the public's sources of information about, level of interest in, and active involvement with S&T. The second section reports indicators of public knowledge, including measures of factual knowledge of science and engineering and people's understanding of the scientific process. When possible, it compares American adults' understanding of science to that of American students. The third and fourth sections of the chapter describe public attitudes toward S&T. The third section contains data on attitudes about S&T in general, including support for government funding of basic research, confidence in the leadership of the scientific community, perceptions of the prestige of S&E occupations, and opinions about how much influence science and scientists should have in public affairs. The fourth section addresses public attitudes on issues in which S&T plays an important role, such as the environment, the quality of science and math education, and the use of animals in scientific research. It also includes indicators of public opinion about several emerging lines of research and new technologies, including nuclear power, biotechnology, genetically modified (GM) food, nanotechnology, stem cell research, and cloning.\n\nA Note About the Data and the Terminology\nThis chapter emphasizes trends over time, patterns of variation within the U.S. population, and international patterns. It gives less weight to the specific percentages of survey respondents who gave particular answers to the questions posed to them. Although, inevitably, the chapter reports these percentages, they are subject to numerous sources of error and should be treated with caution. Caution is especially warranted for data from surveys that omit significant portions of the target population, have low response rates, or have topics that are particularly sensitive to subtle differences in question wording. In contrast to specific percentages, consistent and substantial trends and patterns warrant greater confidence (see sidebar, \"Survey Data Sources\").\nMost of the international comparisons involve identical questions asked in different countries. However, language and cultural differences can affect how respondents interpret questions and can introduce numerous complexities, so international comparisons require careful consideration.\nThroughout the chapter, the terminology used in the text reflects the wording in the corresponding survey question. In general, survey questions asking respondents about their primary sources of information, interest in issues in the news, and general attitudes use the phrase \"science and technology.\" Thus the term \"S&T\" is used in the parts of the chapter discussing these data. Survey questions asking about confidence in institutional leaders, prestige of occupations, and views of different disciplines use terms such as \"scientific community,\" \"scientists,\" \"researchers,\" or \"engineers,\" so \"S&E\" is used in sections examining issues related to occupations, careers, and fields of research. Although science and engineering are distinct fields, national data that make this distinction are scarce.\nInformation Sources, Interest, and Involvement\nBecause S&T are relevant to so many aspects of daily life, information about S&T can help Americans make informed decisions and more easily navigate the world around them. Interest in and involvement with S&T can lead Americans to acquire more information and achieve greater understanding.\nS&T Information Sources\nU.S. Patterns and Trends More Americans get most of their information about cur-\nrent news events from television than from any other source. When asked \"Where do you get most of your information about current news events?,\" 47% say television, with substantial percentages also reporting the Internet (22%) and newspapers (20%) as their main source (figure 7-1; appendix table 7-1). Since the 1990s, the proportion of Americans getting information about current news events from the\n\n\f7-8 \n\nChapter 7.

For both kinds of information, more Americans select television as their primary source than any other medium, followed by the Internet. The Internet, magazines, and books or other printed material are more widely used as primary information sources for S&T than for current news; the opposite is true for television, newspapers, and radio (figure 7-3). The proportion of Americans who said the Internet was their primary source for S&T news grew from 22% in 2006 to 28% in 2008. Since 2001, this proportion has more than tripled (figure 7-2).\nWhen asked, \"If you wanted to learn about scientific issues such as global warming or biotechnology, where would you get information?,\" 54% of Americans choose the Internet even though almost one out of five Americans cannot access the Internet at home, work, schools, libraries, and other locations (Harris Interactive 2008a). Television (21%) ranked as a distant second (figure 7-1; appendix table 7-3). Reliance on the Internet, which grew substantially over the past decade, is still growing but shows signs of leveling off (figure 7-2).\nIn general, use of the Internet for news and information, including S&T information, is higher among younger audiences and increases with education and income. (Access to high-speed Internet connections is also associated with more time online and more extensive reliance on the Internet for news and information [Cole 2007; Horrigan 2006].) Conversely, the use of television decreases with education and income and increases with age (appendix tables 7-1 and 7-2). Analyses that examine age differences in patterns of media use through repeated cross-sectional surveys hide considerable generational effects, because they only show a snapshot of a single point in time (Losh 2009). Younger generations that grow up relying more exclusively on the Internet are not likely to shift to traditional media as they age.\nNational data that address the processes through which Americans acquire and sort through S&T information are scarce. A Pew Internet and American Life Project survey (Horrigan 2006) examined how Americans use the Internet to acquire information about science. It found that a clear majority of Internet users had engaged in some information search activities, including \"look[ing] up the meaning of a particular scientific term or concept\" (70%), \"look[ing] for an answer to a question you have about a scientific concept or theory\" (68%), and \"learn[ing] more about a science story or scientific discovery you first heard or read about offline\" (65%). In addition, just over half had used the Internet to \"complete a science assignment for school, either for\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n-PN\\YL  7YPTHY` ZV\\YJL VM PUMVYTH[PVU HIV\\[ J\\YYLU[ L]LU[Z ZJPLUJL HUK [LJOUVSVN` HUK ZWLJPMPJ ZJPLU[PMPJ PZZ\\LZ! \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[ \n;LSL]PZPVU \n\n*\\YYLU[ UL^Z\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n\n5L^ZWHWLYZ\n\n0U[LYUL[ 4HNHaPULZ\n\n\n\n\n\n:JPLUJL HUK [LJOUVSVN`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n:WLJPMPJ ZJPLU[PMPJ PZZ\\LZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 7\\ISPJ ([[P[\\KLZ ;V^HYK HUK <UKLYZ[HUKPUN VM :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN` \" <UP]LYZP[` VM 4PJOPNHU :\\Y]L` VM *VUZ\\TLY ([[P[\\KLZ \" HUK <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`   :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ   HUK \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n 7-11\nyourself or for a child\" (55%) or to \"check the accuracy of a scientific fact or statistic\" (52%). Fewer had used the Internet to \"download scientific data, graphs, or charts\" (43%) or \"compare different or opposing scientific theories\" (37%). How skillfully or how often Americans engage in the search for scientific information, whether on the Internet or elsewhere, remains unknown.\nUsing information effectively involves more than finding it. In an information-saturated society, people often need to assess the quality of the information they encounter and determine its credibility. Survey data provide some indication of how Americans assess the credibility of public information. For the past ten years, Americans have become more skeptical of the information they encounter in major broadcast and print media, but recently this trend has leveled off. Americans' judgments of media credibility are shaped by factors other than critical thinking skills and the quality of the information provided. For example, judgments of the credibility of particular mass media information sources are associated with political party affiliations (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2008).\nEvidence about how Americans judge the credibility of S&T information in the media is scant. Pew's study of how Americans acquire science information indicates that Internet users who seek science information online do not always assume that the information they find there is accurate. The vast majority (80%) reported they have checked information at least once in different ways, either by comparing it to other information they found online, comparing it to offline sources (science journals, encyclopedia), or looking up the original source of the information (Horrigan 2006; for additional details see NSB 2008).\n\n-PN\\YL  7YPTHY` ZV\\YJL VM J\\YYLU[ UL^Z L]LU[Z HUK ZJPLUJL HUK [LJOUVSVN` PUMVYTH[PVU! \n\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n\n*\\YYLU[ UL^Z L]LU[Z\n\n:JPLUJL HUK [LJOUVSVN` PUMVYTH[PVU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;LSL]PZPVU 5L^Z WHWLYZ\n\n9HKPV\n\n0U[LYUL[ 4HNHaPULZ )VVRZ\n\n:6<9*,! <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f7-12 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nInternational Comparisons As in the United States, data collected between 2001 and\n2008 in other countries, including the European Union (EU) states, Japan, Russia, and China, uniformly identify television as the leading source of S&T news and information. In a 2008 South Korean survey, more respondents named the Internet (28%) as their primary source of S&T information than named newspapers (16%) (KOFAC 2009). In most other countries, however, newspapers generally ranked second and relatively few survey respondents cited the Internet as an important source of S&T information. This may be due to differences in the availability of Internet access across countries (Internet World Statistics 2009). National differences in how questions were asked make precise comparisons among different countries impossible.\nMore recent data on S&T for the other countries do not exist; further details on these older data are presented in the 2006 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators (NSB 2006). Television is also the dominant source of S&T information in India, where about two-thirds of survey respondents in 2004 said it was their main information source (Shukla 2005). Radio (13%) and friends/relatives (12%) ranked ahead of print sources such as newspapers, books, and magazines, which together accounted for 9% of responses. India's relatively low literacy rate (144th of 176 countries in a 2005 ranking) may contribute to this reliance on nonprinted sources.\nPublic Interest in S&T\nU.S. Patterns and Trends High levels of self-reported interest in S&T are part of\na long-standing pattern, as shown in the results of 12 surveys funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). More than 80% of Americans report they are interested in new scientific discoveries (figure 7-4). When asked in the General Social Survey (GSS) in 2008 about their interest in new scientific discoveries, 86% reported that they are either \"very\" or \"moderately\" interested (appendix table 7-4). The proportion of respondents expressing interest in new scientific discoveries decreased slightly between 2001 and 2008 (figure 7-5), but this decline might have resulted from a difference in the surveys' data collection over that period.2 Comparable data from the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) show a stable trend in public interest in new scientific discoveries between 2001 and 2006--during this period the proportion of Americans who said they had \"a lot\" or \"some\" interest in new scientific discoveries fluctuated between 83% and 87% (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006; see NSB 2008). Interest in new scientific discoveries increases with education and the number of mathematics and science courses people have taken (appendix table 7-5).\nRelative to interest in other topics, however, interest in S&T in the GSS was not particularly high (figure 7-4). Interest in \"new scientific discoveries\" and \"use of new inventions and technologies\" ranked in the middle among the 10 areas\n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ PU[LYLZ[ PU ZLSLJ[LK PZZ\\LZ! \n=LY` PU[LYLZ[LK 4VKLYH[LS` PU[LYLZ[LK 5V[ H[ HSS PU[LYLZ[LK\n5L^ TLKPJHS KPZJV]LYPLZ\n,U]PYVUTLU[HS WVSS\\[PVU\n,JVUVTPJ PZZ\\LZ HUK I\\ZPULZZ JVUKP[PVUZ\n3VJHS ZJOVVS PZZ\\LZ <ZL VM UL^ PU]LU[PVUZ\nHUK [LJOUVSVNPLZ 4PSP[HY` HUK\nKLMLUZL WVSPJ` 5L^ ZJPLU[PMPJ\nKPZJV]LYPLZ 0U[LYUH[PVUHS HUK MVYLPNU WVSPJ` PZZ\\LZ\n(NYPJ\\S[\\YHS HUK MHYT PZZ\\LZ :WHJL L_WSVYH[PVU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n*\\T\\SH[P]L WLYJLU[\n\n:6<9*,! <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ PU[LYLZ[ PU ZLSLJ[LK ZJPLUJLYLSH[LK PZZ\\LZ!   \u00b6\n\n7LYJLU[ ]LY`TVKLYH[LS` PU[LYLZ[LK\n\n\n\n5L^ TLKPJHS KPZJV]LYPLZ\n\n\n\n<ZL VM UL^\n\nPU]LU[PVUZ HUK\n\n\n\n[LJOUVSVNPLZ\n\n 5L^ ZJPLU[PMPJ\n\n\n\nKPZJV]LYPLZ\n\n\n\n\n\n:WHJL L_WSVYH[PVU\n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! ;HISL PUJS\\KLZ HSS `LHYZ MVY ^OPJO KH[H JVSSLJ[LK\" V[OLY `LHYZ L_[YHWVSH[LK\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 7\\ISPJ ([[P[\\KLZ ;V^HYK HUK <UKLYZ[HUKPUN VM :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN`  \u00b6\" HUK <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-13\n\nmost frequently listed in the surveys: above space exploration, agriculture and farming, and international and foreign policy; below new medical discoveries, environmental pollution, economic issues and business conditions, and about the same as military and defense policy and local schools. Of course, a more inclusive concept of S&T might treat several of the topics in this list, such as space exploration and new medical discoveries, as part of the S&T category; furthermore, other topics often include substantial S&T content.3\nSurvey responses about the types of news Americans follow raise questions about how interested Americans really are in S&T. For more than 10 years, Pew (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2008) has collected data on categories of news that Americans follow \"very closely.\" In 2008, 13% of the public followed S&T news closely. S&T news ranked 13th among 18 topics, tied with consumer news and ahead of entertainment, culture and the arts, celebrity news, and travel (table 7-1). As is the case for many other news topics, the percentage of Americans who say they follow S&T closely has declined between 1996 and 2008. S&T's relative standing in the list of topics has also slipped; it ranked ahead of seven topics in 1996, but ahead of only two of the same topics in 2008.\nSince 1986, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press has maintained a news interest index that tracks individual stories that make headlines. The index is based\n\non frequent surveys that record the proportion of Americans who, when asked about a news story, say they are following it \"very closely.\" Stories that attract considerable public interest are often included in several surveys, and the same story may appear several times in the news interest index. In 2007, stories that dominated the list of the public's top news stories included the rising price of gasoline, the war in Iraq, and human and natural disasters (such as the Virginia Tech University shootings, the Minneapolis bridge collapse, and the California wildfires) (PEJ 2008). In 2008, stories about the condition of the U.S. economy, rising gas prices, the debate over a Wall Street bailout, the 2008 presidential election, major drops in the U.S. stock market, and the impact of Hurricane Ike appeared near the top of the list (PEJ 2009). Interest in S&T does not appear to have been the central factor motivating the public's interest in these stories rather than others.\nA different kind of news indicator is the amount of coverage news organizations devote to S&T. This indicator can involve either sheer quantity (e.g., broadcast time) or prominence (e.g., lead stories). For 20 years, the Tyndall Report has tracked the time that the three major broadcast networks devoted to 18 categories of news on their nightly newscasts (Tyndall Report 2009). Two categories with large science, engineering, and technology components are \"science, space, and technology,\" and \"biotechnology and basic\n\nTable 7-1 News followed \"very closely\" by American public: 1996\u00ad2008\n(Percent)\n\nType of news\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\nWeather ..........................................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n53\n\n50\n\n48\n\nCrime ..............................................\n\n41\n\n36\n\n30\n\n30\n\n32\n\n29\n\n28\n\nEducation .......................................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n23\n\nCommunity .....................................\n\n35\n\n34\n\n26\n\n31\n\n28\n\n26\n\n22\n\nEnvironment ...................................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n21\n\nPolitics/Washington news ..............\n\n16\n\n19\n\n17\n\n21\n\n24\n\n17\n\n21\n\nLocal government...........................\n\n24\n\n23\n\n20\n\n22\n\n22\n\n20\n\n20\n\nHealth news....................................\n\n34\n\n34\n\n29\n\n26\n\n26\n\n24\n\n20\n\nSports .............................................\n\n26\n\n27\n\n27\n\n25\n\n25\n\n23\n\n20\n\nReligion ...........................................\n\n17\n\n18\n\n21\n\n19\n\n20\n\n16\n\n17\n\nInternational affairs .........................\n\n16\n\n16\n\n14\n\n21\n\n24\n\n17\n\n16\n\nBusiness and finance .....................\n\n13\n\n17\n\n14\n\n15\n\n14\n\n14\n\n16\n\nConsumer news .............................\n\n14\n\n15\n\n12\n\n12\n\n13\n\n12\n\n13\n\nScience and technology .................\n\n20\n\n22\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\n13\n\nCulture and arts ..............................\n\n9\n\n12\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n9\n\n11\n\nEntertainment .................................\n\n15\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n15\n\n12\n\n10\n\nCelebrity news................................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n7\n\nTravel ..............................................\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n6\n\nNA = not available, question not asked\n\nNOTES: Data reflect respondents who said they followed type of news \"very closely.\" Table includes all years for which data collected.\n\nSOURCES: Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, Online papers modestly boost newspaper readership: Maturing Internet news audience broader than deep (30 July 2006), Biennial News Consumption Survey (27 April\u00ad22 May 2006), http://people-press.org/reports/display. php3?ReportID=282, accessed 26 April 2007 (1996\u00ad2006); Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, Audience segments in a changing news environment: Key news audiences now blend online and traditional sources (17 August 2008), p. 39, Biennial News Consumption Survey (30 April\u00ad01 June 2008), http://people-press.org/reports/pdf/444.pdf, accessed 21 September 2009.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\f7-14 \n\nChapter 7.

Between 75% and 80% of survey respondents in South Korea, China, and Europe said they were \"very\" or \"moderately\" interested in \"new scientific discoveries\" and \"use of new inventions and technologies\" compared to 86% and 88% respectively of Americans in the 2008 GSS, respectively (appendix table 7-4) (KOFAC 2009; CRISP 2008; EC 2005). Using slightly different questions, about three-quarters of Brazilians said they were \"very interested\" or \"a little interested\" in \"science and technology\" (MCT of Brazil 2006). In Malaysia, 58% of the respondents said they were \"interested\" or \"very interested\" in the \"latest inventions in new technology\" and 51% in the \"latest inventions in science\" (MASTIC 2004).\nIn the 2005 European survey (called the 2005 \"Eurobarometer\"), there was considerable variation among different countries in self-reported interest in S&T-related issues, and the overall level of interest was down from the most recent survey in 1992. In both the United States and in Europe, men showed more interest in S&T than women. For more recent European data on interest in scientific research in general, see sidebar \"Scientific Research in the Media in Europe.\"5\n\nInterest in environmental issues is similarly high in the United States, Europe, South Korea, and Brazil--about 9 in 10 respondents in each country or region expressed interest in this topic, although slight variations in survey terminology should be taken into account.6 In Malaysia, interest in \"environmental pollution\" was lower (61% said they were \"interested\" or \"very interested\" in this issue).\nLike Americans, Europeans and Brazilians are more interested in medicine than in S&T in general. In the United States, nearly everyone was interested in new medical discoveries (94%); in Brazil, most people (91%) were interested in \"medicine and health\" issues. In Europe, South Korea, and China, interest in new medical discoveries seemed to be lower--between 77% and 83% said they were \"very\" or \"moderately\" interested in this issue. In Malaysia, 59% indicated they were \"interested\" or \"very interested\" in the \"latest inventions in the field of medicine.\"7\nInvolvement\nInvolvement with S&T outside the classroom in informal, voluntary, and self-directed settings--such as museums, science centers, zoos, and aquariums--is an indicator of interest in S&T.8 By offering visitors the flexibility to pursue individual curiosity, such institutions provide a kind of exposure to S&T that is well suited to helping people develop further interest.\nIn the 2008 GSS, 59% of Americans indicated that they had visited an informal science venue during the previous\n\nScientific Research in the Media in Europe\n\nIn 2007, the European Commission conducted a survey to learn how to motivate European citizens to become more involved in science, research, and innovation. Faceto-face interviews were conducted in people's homes, in their national language, in the European Union's (EU) 27 member states (EC 2007).\nThe survey shows that the majority of Europeans (57%) are \"very\" and \"fairly\" interested in scientific research. Interest is much higher in the EU-15 (62%) than in the 12 countries that recently joined (38%). The countries most interested in scientific research were Sweden, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Finland. Men and more highly educated individuals expressed more interest in this subject. Medicine attracted the highest degree of public interest (62%), followed by the environment (43%).\nTelevision is the most popular medium for information and also the medium with the widest reach. The majority of EU citizens (61%) watch television programs about scientific research regularly or occasionally, nearly half read scientific articles in general newspapers and magazines, and 28% look at information on scientific issues on the Internet. Television is also the most trusted\n\nmedium for obtaining science information, ranking first in trustworthiness in 25 out of the 27 EU member states.\nOverall, EU-27 citizens are satisfied with media coverage of scientific research, in particular those who are interested in this subject. The majority believe the coverage devoted to scientific research in the media is sufficient, but about one-third believes that it is not given enough importance. Most European citizens view science media coverage as reliable, objective, useful, varied, and sufficiently visual. However, they also express that science media coverage is difficult to understand, removed from their actual concerns, and not entertaining. More highly educated respondents are more likely to view media coverage of scientific information as more useful, understandable, entertaining, and not too far removed from citizen concerns.\nEuropeans tend to prefer to receive short news reports about scientific research on a regular basis (43%) rather than occasional in-depth information (34%). In addition, they prefer to restrict public scientific debates to scientists and experts rather than to actively participate themselves, and they would prefer that scientists rather than journalists present scientific information.\n\n\f7-16 \n\nChapter 7.

Half said they had visited a zoo or aquarium and over one-quarter had visited a \"natural history museum\" (27%) or a \"science and technology museum\" (26%). One in three Americans had visited an art museum and 64% had visited a public library. These data are generally consistent with data collected by the Pew Internet and American Life Project and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (for more detail on these surveys, see NSB 2008). Among those who visited each of these institutions, the number of annual visits was highest for public libraries, which averaged about 15 visits per year.\nThe proportion of respondents who reported attending the three institutions (zoo/aquarium, S&T museum, and public library) is down slightly from the last time these questions were asked in 2001. However, these differences may be due to changes in the data collection methods over this period discussed earlier in the chapter, rather than to actual changes in attendance.\nRespondents in households with children 18 or younger were more likely to visit a zoo or aquarium, a public library, and also a natural history museum. Minors in the household did not make a difference in the proportion of adults who visited an art museum or an S&T museum (appendix table 7-7).\nAmericans with more years of formal education are more likely than others to engage in these informal science activities (figure 7-7; appendix table 7-7). Those in higher income brackets are more likely to have attended a zoo or an aquarium, a natural history or an S&T museum, or an art museum, but just as likely as those in the lowest income bracket to have visited a public library. In general, visits to informal science institutions are lower among Americans who are 65 or older.\nIn addition, respondents who get most of their information about S&T from the Internet or use this medium to learn about scientific issues are more likely to have visited any informal science institution, even after controlling for expressed interest in scientific issues. This suggests that use of these different sources of exposure to science information complement, rather than replace, one another.\nFewer Europeans report visits to informal science institutions (EC 2005). In the EU-25, about 27% of adults said they had visited a zoo or aquarium, 16% said they had visited a \"science museum or technology museum or science centre,\" and 8% said they had attended a \"science exhibition or science `week.'\" As in the United States, older and less-educated Europeans reported less involvement in these activities. In addition, European adults in households with more inhabitants more often reported informal science activities. Insofar as household size indicates the presence of minor children, this probably indicates another parallel with the United States. One demographic pattern is notably different between Europe and the United States: where European men (19%) are much more likely than women (13%) to visit informal science or technology museums and centers, these gender differences do not exist in the United States (appen-\n\n-PN\\YL  ([[LUKHUJL H[ PUMVYTHS ZJPLUJL HUK V[OLY J\\S[\\YHS PUZ[P[\\[PVUZ I` PUZ[P[\\[PVU [`WL HUK LK\\JH[PVU SL]LS! \n7\\ISPJ SPIYHY`\n\nAVV VY HX\\HYP\\T\n\n(Y[ T\\ZL\\T\n\n5H[\\YHS OPZ[VY` T\\ZL\\T\n:JPLUJL VY [LJOUVSVN`\nT\\ZL\\T\n\n.YHK\\H[L WYVMLZZPVUHS KLNYLL\n)HJJHSH\\YLH[L\n/PNO ZJOVVS NYHK\\H[L\n#/PNO ZJOVVS\n\n          7LYJLU[\n56;,! 7LYJLU[ PUKPJH[LZ YLZWVUKLU[Z ^OV OHK H[[LUKLK [OL UV[LK PUZ[P[\\[PVU H[ SLHZ[ VUJL :6<9*,! <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISL \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\ndix table 7-7).

The proportion of respondents who indicated they had visited a zoo/aquarium is similar in the U.S., China, and Japan. Unmeasured differences in the prevalence and accessibility of informal science learning opportunities across countries make it difficult to attribute different visit patterns to differences in interest.\nPublic Knowledge About S&T\nScientific literacy can be relevant to the public policy and personal choices that people make. In developing measures for scientific literacy across nations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2003) noted that literacy had several components:\nCurrent thinking about the desired outcomes of science education for all citizens emphasizes the development of a general understanding of important concepts and\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-17\n\nTable 7-3 Visits to informal science and other cultural institutions, by country/region: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nInstitution\n\nUnited States, 2008\n\nSouth Korea, 2008\n\nChina, 2007\n\nBrazil, 2006\n\nEU, 2005\n\nRussia, 2003\n\nJapan, 2001\n\nZoo/aquariuma...................................... 50\n\n36\n\n52\n\n28\n\n27\n\n9\n\n43\n\nNatural history museum ....................... 27\n\nNA\n\n14\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n20\n\nScience/technology museumb.............. 26\n\n11\n\n17\n\n4\n\n16\n\n1\n\n13\n\nPublic library......................................... 64\n\n34\n\n41\n\n25\n\n34\n\n16\n\n47\n\nArt museum .......................................... 32\n\n34\n\n18\n\n12\n\n23\n\n7\n\n35\n\nNA = not available, question not asked\n\nEU = European Union\n\na \"Zoo, botanic garden, or environmental park\" for Brazil, \"Zoo, aquarium, or botanic garden\" for China, \"Zoo\" for Russia. b \"Science museums or technology museums or science centers\" for EU.\n\nNOTES: Responses to (United States, Japan, Korea) I am going to read you a short list of places and ask you to tell me how many times you visited each type of place during the last year, that is, the last 12 months (Percentage includes those who visited each institution one or more times); (EU, Russia, China, Brazil) Which of the following have you visited in the last twelve months (Multiple answers possible).\n\nSOURCES: (United States) University of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center, General Social Survey (2008); Korea Foundation for the Advancement of Science and Creativity (formerly Korea Science Foundation), Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology (2008); Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Public Understanding of Science and Attitudes towards Science and Technology, 2007 (2008); (Brazil) Ministry of Science and Technology, Public Perceptions of Science and Technology (2007); (EU) Eurobarometer 224/ Wave 63.1: Europeans, Science and Technology (2005); (Russia) British Council, Russian Public Opinion of the Knowledge Economy (2004); Japan National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, The 2001 Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science & Technology in Japan (2001).

It values the ability to apply this understanding to real situations involving science in which claims need to be assessed and decisions made...\nScientific literacy is the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidencebased conclusions in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity. (pp. 132\u00ad33)\nAs the reference to changes made through human activity makes clear, the OECD definition implies an understanding of technology. The OECD takes the view that literacy is a matter of degree and that people cannot simply be classified as either literate or not literate.\nA good understanding of basic scientific terms, concepts, and facts; an ability to comprehend how science generates and assesses evidence; and a capacity to distinguish science from pseudoscience are widely used indicators of scientific literacy. (For a different perspective on scientific literacy, see sidebar, \"Asset-Based Models of Knowledge.\")\nU.S. survey data indicate that many Americans cannot provide correct answers to basic questions about scientific facts and do not apply appropriate reasoning strategies to questions about selected scientific issues. Residents of other countries, including highly developed ones, perform no better, on balance, when asked similar questions. However,\n\ncompared to middle-school students, American adults perform relatively well. In light of the limitations of using a small number of questions largely keyed to knowledge taught in school, generalizations about American's knowledge of science should be made cautiously.\nUnderstanding Scientific Terms and Concepts\nU.S. Patterns and Trends U.S. data show that the public's level of factual knowl-\nedge about science has not changed much over time. Figure 7-8 shows average numbers of correct answers to a series of mostly true-false science questions in different years for which fully comparable data were collected (appendix table 7-8).10 Although performance on individual questions varies somewhat over time (appendix table 7-9), overall scores are relatively similar.\nFactual knowledge of science is positively related to people's level of formal schooling, income level, and the number of science and math courses they have taken. Factual knowledge is also positively related to scores on a 10-item vocabulary test included in the GSS, which scholars in many disciplines have often used to assess verbal skills (Malhotra, Krosnick, and Haertel 2007).11 In the factual questions included in NSF surveys since 1979, which allow for the observation of trends over time (referred to as \"trend factual questions\" below), men score higher on the questions in the physical sciences and women score higher on those in the biological sciences (table 7-4).12\n\n\f7-18 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nRespondents 65 and older are less likely than others to answer the questions correctly (appendix tables 7-8 and 7-10). An analysis of surveys conducted between 1979 and 2006 concluded that generational experiences are more important than cognitive declines associated with aging in explaining these differences (Losh 2009, 2010).\nThe factual knowledge questions that have been repeatedly asked in U.S. surveys involve information that was being taught in grades K\u00ad12 when most respondents were young. Because science continually generates new knowledge that reshapes how people understand the world, scientific\nAsset-Based Models of Knowledge\nMany researchers and educators interested in the public's understanding of science advocate studying the skills people bring to bear on scientific issues that they deal with in their daily lives (e.g., gardening, bird-watching). Because individuals encounter S&T in different ways, they acquire different S&T knowledge \"assets,\" which they then can use to make sense of unfamiliar issues (National Research Council 2009). For researchers and educators who favor an asset-based model of scientific literacy, public understanding of science is less a \"generalized body of knowledge and skills that every citizen should have by a certain age\" than \"a series of specific sets of only moderately overlapping knowledge and abilities that individuals construct over their lifetimes\" (Falk, Storksdieck, and Dierking 2007). In education, assetbased perspectives on knowledge have been useful in helping teachers build on children's existing strengths to improve their performance.\nGeneralized assessments of S&T knowledge may underestimate the assets available to individuals when they deal with S&T matters of greater interest and consequence to them, because these types of assessments ask questions on topics of little interest to many respondents. In contrast, a knowledge assessment that is tailored to an S&T domain with which an individual is familiar might yield very different results. In addition, because people often use their knowledge assets in group interactions, such as a nature outing, some researchers question the value of individual assessments in a test or survey (Roth and Lee 2002).\nResearchers have developed measures of adult science understanding to assess how people make sense of specific experiences or scientific materials (Friedman 2008). National indicators that evaluate domainspecific knowledge or group problem-solving are not practical, but a perspective on scientific literacy that stresses domain-specific or group assets is useful, because it points to a significant limitation of generalized indicators of individual scientific literacy.\n\nliteracy requires lifelong learning so that citizens become familiar with terms, concepts, and facts that emerged after they completed their schooling.\nIn 2008, the GSS asked Americans questions that tested their knowledge of a topic that has not been central to the standardized content of American science education: nanotechnology. Survey respondents who scored relatively well overall on the questions that were asked repeatedly over the years also exhibited greater knowledge of this topic (figure 7-9).13 Likewise, the educational and demographic characteristics associated with higher scores on the trend factual knowledge questions are also associated with higher scores for this new topic (appendix table 7-11). These data suggest that the knowledge items used to measure trends, although focused on the kind of factual knowledge learned in school, are a reasonable indicator of factual science knowledge in general, including knowledge that is acquired later in life.\nSimilarly, national standards for what students should know reflect new science concepts beyond those covered by the long-standing questions that measure trends in public knowledge of science. In 2008, the GSS included questions on science and mathematics knowledge that were more closely aligned with national standards for what students should know. The questions were selected from three national exams administered to students and Project 2061, an initiative by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) that develops assessment materials aligned\n\n-PN\\YL  *VYYLJ[ HUZ^LYZ [V MHJ[\\HS RUV^SLKNL VM ZJPLUJL X\\LZ[PVUZ!  \u00b6\n4LHU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n56;,:! 4LHU U\\TILY VM JVYYLJ[ YLZWVUZLZ [V X\\LZ[PVUZ PUJS\\KLK PU \u00b8MHJ[\\HS RUV^SLKNL VM ZJPLUJL ZJHSL \u00b9\" ZLL HWWLUKP_ [HISL  MVY L_WSHUH[PVU HUK SPZ[ VM X\\LZ[PVUZ :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK  MVY YLZWVUZLZ [V PUKP]PK\\HS X\\LZ[PVUZ 0UJS\\KLZ HSS `LHYZ MVY ^OPJO KH[H JVSSLJ[LK\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 7\\ISPJ ([[P[\\KLZ ;V^HYK HUK <UKLYZ[HUKPUN VM :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN`  \u00b6\" HUK <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-19\n\nTable 7-4 Correct answers to scientific literacy questions, by sex: 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008\n(Percent)\n\nQuestion\nPhysical science The center of the Earth is very hot.

Two out of the 16 questions were open-ended and the rest were multiple-choice (see sidebar, \"New Science Knowledge Questions\").15\nThe results show that survey respondents who answered the additional factual knowledge questions correctly also tended to provide correct answers to the trend factual knowledge questions (figure 7-10; appendix tables 7-10 and 7-12). This suggests again that the trend factual questions are a reasonable indicator of the type of knowledge students are tested on in national assessments.\nOut of seven factual science knowledge questions where comparison scores with fourth and eighth grade students were possible, adult Americans received a higher or similar score in five of them (table 7-5). Comparisons should be made cautiously because of the differences in circumstances in which students and adults responded to these science knowledge questions. Students' tests were on paper and self-administered, whereas the majority of respondents in the GSS answered orally to an interviewer. Elementary and middle school students had an advantage over adults in that classroom preparation preceded their tests.\n\nNew Science Knowledge Questions\nThese questions were included in the 2008 General Social Survey to assess different aspects of science and technology knowledge. Answers are bold. The factual knowledge questions (questions 1, 3\u00ad5, and 7\u00ad11) are combined into scale 2 in some figures and appendix tables. Other questions test a person's knowledge of charts and statistics (questions 12 and 13), reasoning/ life sciences (questions 2 and 14), and experiment/ controlling variables (questions 6 and 14\u00ad16). Note that the correct answer for question 14 can be reached by using reasoning skills, knowledge in the life sciences, or understanding of the experiment/controlling variables concept.\nOpening script: Now, we are going to do some more detailed questions on science and technology.

For the questions reported in figure 7-11, knowledge scores are relatively low in China, Russia, and Malaysia. Compared with the United States and the highly developed countries in Europe, Japanese scores are also relatively low.16\nScience knowledge scores vary considerably across the EU-25 countries, with northern European countries, led by Sweden, recording the highest total scores on a set of 13 questions. For a smaller set of 4 items that were administered in both 1992 and 2005 in 12 European countries, each country performed better in 2005. In contrast, the U.S. data on science knowledge do not show upward trends over the same period. In Europe, as in the United States, men, younger adults, and more highly educated people tend to score higher on these questions. (For more details on scientific literacy in individual countries in Europe, see NSB 2008.)\nReasoning and Understanding the Scientific Process\nPast NSF surveys have used questions on three general topics--probability, experimental design, and the scientific method--to assess trends in Americans' understanding of the process of scientific inquiry.

The data appear to indicate that Americans understand this topic better than their counterparts in other countries. The true-false question asked in the United States is \"It is the father's gene that decides whether the baby is a boy or a girl.\" (True.) Europeans and Chinese have been asked the same question about the mother's gene. (False.) Although a knowledgeable survey respondent would treat these questions as equivalent, research on how people answer surveys suggests that they may not be. Survey methodologists have found that many respondents exhibit an acquiescence bias--a tendency to give a positive answer (e.g.,\n\ntrue, yes, agree) to questions, independent of their content (Holbrook, Green, and Krosnick 2003; Krosnick 2000). Accordingly, respondents will seem more knowledgeable when the correct answer to a question is \"true.\"\nThe 2008 GSS included an experiment to test whether observed national differences on this topic are real knowledge differences or are products of acquiescence bias. Some respondents were asked the usual U.S. question, while others got the international variant. The experiment indicated that the national differences result from knowledge differences and not from acquiescence bias. A larger proportion of respondents (71%) answered correctly when the right answer was false than when it was true (62%) (appendix tables 7-9 and 7-10).\n\nhave a one-in-four chance of suffering from an inherited disease.17 A second set of questions deals with the logic of experimental design, asking respondents about the best way to design a test of a new drug for high blood pressure. An open-ended question probes what respondents think it means to \"study something scientifically.\" Because probability, experimental design, and the scientific method are all central to scientific research, these questions are relevant to how respondents evaluate scientific evidence.\nIn 2008, 65% of Americans responded correctly to the two questions about probability, 38% to the questions testing the concept of experiment, and 22% to the questions testing the concept of scientific study. Scores on the probability questions fluctuate each year but are relatively stable over time; however, between 2006 and 2008 the combined scores of the two probability questions slightly declined. Scores in the other scientific process questions were generally higher than they were in the mid-1990s, but decreased somewhat in 2008 (appendix table 7-13). Performance on these questions is strongly associated with the different measures of science knowledge and education (appendix table 7-14). Older Americans and those with lower incomes, two groups that tend to have less education in the sciences, also score lower on the inquiry measures. Men and women obtain similar scores on these questions (tables 7-4 and 7-6).\nThe 2008 GSS included several additional questions on the scientific process that provide an opportunity to examine Americans' understanding of experimental design in more detail and benchmark their scores to national results of middle school students. From 29% to 57% of Americans responded correctly to questions measuring the concepts of scientific experiment and controlling variables (appendix tables 7-13 and 7-15). However, only 12% of Americans responded correctly to all the questions on this topic and nearly 20% of Americans did not respond correctly to any of them (figure 7-12).18 These data suggest that relatively few\n\nAmericans have a generalized understanding of experimental design that they can reliably apply to different situations.\nThe proportion of Americans with a strong grasp of experimental design does not vary by sex. However, Americans who answered at least three of four experimental knowledge questions correctly were more likely to have a college education or higher, have taken more courses in math and science, and have a clear understanding of the scientific method. They are also more likely to be in the top income bracket and to respond correctly to factual science knowledge and probability questions.\nAdults' scores in the experimental knowledge questions are similar to middle school students in one question (question 2 in table 7-7) but lower in two others, out of the three questions where the comparison was possible.\nUnderstanding of Statistics and Charts\nAmericans encounter basic statistics and charts in everyday life. Many media reports cite studies in health, social, economic, and political trends. Understanding statistical concepts is important to understanding the meaning of these studies and consequently to scientific literacy (Crettaz von Roten 2006). The results from the 2008 GSS show that 77% of Americans can read a simple chart correctly and 66% understand the concept of \"mean\" in statistics. Understanding these two concepts is associated with formal education, the number of math and science courses taken, income, and verbal ability. Older respondents were less likely to respond correctly to these two questions (appendix table 7-15).\nPseudoscience\nThe results of 13 NSF-funded surveys conducted between 1979 and 2008 show a trend toward fewer Americans seeing astrology as scientific. In the 2008 GSS 63% of Americans indicated they believed that astrology was \"not at all\n\n\f7-26 \n\nChapter 7.

In 2008, 78% of college graduates indicated that astrology was \"not at all scientific,\" compared with 60% of high school graduates. Those who scored highest on the factual knowledge measures were less likely to perceive astrology to be at all scientific (78%) than those who scored lowest (45%). Respondents who correctly understood the concept of scientific inquiry were more likely to say that astrology was not at all scientific (74%) than those who did not understand the concept (57%). However, the youngest age group (18\u00ad24) was less likely to say astrology is \"not at all scientific\" (49%) and more likely to say it was \"sort of scientific\" (44%) (appendix table 7-16).19\nPublic Attitudes About S&T in General\nGeneralized public support for S&T can make a difference in many ways. Public openness to technological change gives U.S. businesses opportunities to build a domestic\n\ncustomer base, create a foundation for worldwide technical competitiveness, and foster the national advantages that flow from pioneering innovations. Broad public and political support for long-term commitments to S&T research, especially in the face of pressing immediate needs, enables ambitious proposals for sustained federal S&T investments to reach fruition. Public confidence that S&E community leaders are trustworthy, S&E research findings are reliable, and S&E experts bring valuable judgment and knowledge to bear on public issues permits scientific knowledge to have influence over practical affairs. In addition, positive public perceptions of S&E occupations encourage young people to pursue S&E careers.\nTo be sure, claims of scientific and technological progress should be evaluated critically. But widespread public skepticism about S&T, going beyond the reasoned examination of particular cases, would represent a consequential change in American public opinion. Changing public opinion could affect national strategies that link progress in S&T to overall national progress.\n\n\f7-28 \n\nChapter 7.

It covers views of the promise of S&T and reservations about science, overall support for government funding of research, confidence in the leadership of the scientific community, perceptions of the proper influence of scientists over controversial public issues about which the research community claims expertise, perceptions about what it means to be scientific and which disciplines and practices are scientific, and views of S&E as occupations.\nPromise and Reservations\nNSF surveys dating back to 1979 show that Americans endorse the past achievements and future promise of S&T. In practically any major American social grouping, few individuals express serious doubt about the promise of science. In 2008, 43% of GSS respondents said that the benefits of scientific research strongly outweighed the harmful results and substantial percentages said that benefits either slightly outweighed harms (25%) or volunteered that the two were about equal (16%). Only 10% of respondents said that the harms either slightly or strongly outweighed benefits and the remainder said that they did not know. These numbers were generally consistent with those from earlier surveys (figure 7-13; appendix tables 7-17 and 7-18). Americans overwhelmingly agree that S&T will foster \"more opportunities\n\nTable 7-7 Adult and student correct answers to scientific process questions\n(Percent correct)\n\nU.S. adult\n\nStudent\n\nProcess question\n\n2008 General\n\nQuestion\n\nField of study Social Survey United States International source\n\n1.

During the same period, between 88% and 92% agreed that \"new technology used in medicine allows people to live longer and better.\"\n\nFigure 7-13 7\\ISPJ HZZLZZTLU[ VM ZJPLU[PMPJ YLZLHYJO!   \u00b6\nBenefits of scientific research strongly outweigh harmful results Benefits of scientific research slightly outweigh harmful results Benefits of scientific research are about equal to harmful results Harmful results of scientific research slightly outweigh benefits Harmful results of scientific research strongly outweigh benefits Don't know\n\n               \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCumulative percent\n\nNOTE: Includes all years for which data collected.\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology (1979\u00ad2001); University of Michigan, Survey of Consumer Attitudes (2004); and University of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center, General Social Survey (2006, 2008).

A review of numerous surveys from around the world found, other things being equal, a weak but consistent relationship between greater knowledge of science and more favorable attitudes toward science. This relationship was stronger in the United States than in any of the other countries in the study (Allum et al. 2008; for more details see NSB 2008). Optimism about science among the most interested and knowledgeable public, however, may not necessarily correspond with accurate expectations about the speed of scientific progress (see sidebar, \"Public Expectations About Technological Advances\").\nAlthough data from other countries are not entirely comparable, they appear to indicate that Americans have somewhat more positive attitudes about the benefits of S&T than Europeans, Russians, and Japanese. Attitudes in China and South Korea are comparable with the U.S., and on some questions attitudes are even more favorable, but their reservations about science are somewhat higher (appendix table 7-18). In all of the countries and regions where survey data exist, statements about the achievements and promise of science elicit substantially more agreement than disagreement.\nBoth in the United States and abroad, respondents also express reservations about S&T. For eight years (2001\u00ad08), VCU Life Sciences Surveys have asked respondents whether they agree that \"scientific research these days doesn't pay enough attention to the moral values of society.\" Each year, a majority has agreed; however, the percentage that agreed has dropped substantially, from 73% in 2001 to 56% in 2008. In the 2008 GSS, large minorities of survey respondents registered agreement with other statements expressing reservations about science, such as \"science makes our way of life change too fast\" (47% agree, 51% disagree). The proportion that agrees with this statement decreases with education, family income, and factual knowledge of science (appendix table 7-20). The question has been asked in numerous other countries (appendix table 7-18). Although levels of agreement with this statement in the United States appear to be similar to those in Russia, surveys in other countries record much higher levels of agreement.21\nFederal Funding of Scientific Research\nU.S. public opinion consistently and strongly supports federal spending on basic research. NSF surveys have repeatedly asked Americans whether \"even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the Federal Government.\" Agreement with this statement has increased slightly since the early 1990s, with 84% favoring federal support in 2008 and only 12% opposing it (appendix tables 7-21 and 7-22).\nResponses to a GSS question about federal spending on scientific research provide further evidence of increasing public support for federal spending on scientific research. Since 1981, the proportion of Americans who thought the\n\n\f7-30 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nPublic Expectations About Technological Advances\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jon Miller surveyed Americans about the technological breakthroughs they did and did not expect in the next 25 years and looked at the differences in the expectations of three different segments of the public with regard to S&T: the attentive, the interested, and the nonattentive (Miller 1983).\nThe attentive public included those citizens who were at least moderately interested and knowledgeable about S&T issues and remained informed in these areas. The interested public included individuals who were interested in S&T matters and perceived themselves to be at least moderately well informed, but were not very knowledgeable and did not keep up with information in these areas. The nonattentive public had little interest in, or knowledge about, S&T issues.\nThe findings showed that majorities of the attentive public, and to a large extent the interested public, thought it was \"very likely\" that within 25 years science would\n\ndiscover ways to accurately predict earthquakes, to economically desalinate seawater for human consumption, and to find more efficient cheap energy sources and a cure for common forms of cancer. In contrast, Americans who were not attentive to S&T issues leaned toward the \"possible but not likely\" answer (see table 7-A below).\nAt present seismologists can provide broad forecasts, but cannot yet accurately predict when and where earthquakes will happen. The cost of seawater desalination has become more competitive than in the past, but it is still not economically viable on a broad scale. Early detection, innovative surgery techniques, and new therapies have improved the prognosis for many types of cancers, but no cure has been found. Miller's survey data suggest that the attentive and interested publics were more optimistic than the nonattentive, but also, in these instances, less accurate in their expectations about the speed of scientific progress.\n\nTable 7-A Public expectations for future scientific achievements within next 25 years: 1979 and 1981\n(Percent)\n\nAttentive public\n\nInterested public\n\nNonattentive public\n\nHow likely do you think it is that researchers will achieve... in the next 25 years or so?\n\n1979\n\n1981\n\n1979\n\n1981\n\n1979\n\n1981\n\n(n = 289) (n = 637) (n = 292) (n = 617) (n = 839) (n = 1,940)\n\nPercent responding \"very likely\"\n\nA way to predict when and where earthquakes will occur ......\n\n72\n\n63\n\n54\n\n63\n\n46\n\nNA\n\nMore efficient sources of cheap energy ..................................\n\n81\n\n74\n\n60\n\n65\n\n50\n\nNA\n\nA cure for the common forms of cancer .................................\n\n58\n\n59\n\n48\n\n61\n\n43\n\nNA\n\nA way to put communities in outer space ...............................\n\n28\n\n21\n\n18\n\n23\n\n13\n\nNA\n\nNew ways of effectively reducing the crime rate.....................\n\n14\n\nNA\n\n17\n\nNA\n\n14\n\nNA\n\nA way to economically desalinate seawater for human\n\nconsumption ..........................................................................\n\n64\n\n63\n\n47\n\n63\n\n39\n\nNA\n\nAn economic theory to control inflation and reduce\n\nunemployment.......................................................................

In 2006 and 2008, only about 11% said that the government was spending too much in this area, the lowest levels registered since 1981 (figure 7-14; appendix tables 7-23 and 7-24).\nAlthough support for federal research investment is at historically high levels, other kinds of federal spending generate even stronger public support. Support for increased spending is greater in numerous program areas, including health care (75%), education (74%), assistance to the poor (69%), environmental protection (66%), social security (59%), and mass transportation (46%). Still, based on the\n\nproportion of the U.S. population favoring increased spending, scientific research (38%) ranks well ahead of spending in national defense (24%), space exploration (14%), and assistance to foreign countries (11%).22\nIn other countries where similar though not precisely comparable questions have been asked, respondents also express strong support for government spending on basic scientific research. In 2005, 76% of Europeans agreed that \"even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research which adds to knowledge should be supported by government,\" and only 7% disagreed. In 2007, 74% of Chinese agreed to a similar statement. Because both the European and the Chinese survey offered a middle option (\"neither agree nor disagree\"), these percentages are lower than figures for the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-31\n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ H[[P[\\KLZ [V^HYK NV]LYUTLU[ M\\UKPUN VM ZJPLU[PMPJ YLZLHYJO! :LSLJ[LK `LHYZ  \u00b6\n.V]LYUTLU[ ZOV\\SK M\\UK IHZPJ YLZLHYJO!  \u00b6 7LYJLU[ \n(NYLL \n\n\n\n +PZHNYLL\n\n\n             \n\n   \n\n(ZZLZZTLU[ VM NV]LYUTLU[ ZWLUKPUN MVY ZJPLU[PMPJ YLZLHYJO!  \u00b6\n\n\n ;VV SP[[SL\n\n\n ;VV T\\JO\n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! ;VW WHULS!

Agreement in South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, and Brazil reaches levels comparable to those in the United States and Europe.\nSupport for increased government spending on scientific research is relatively common in Europe as well. Over half of Europeans agreed in 2005 that their \"government should spend more money on scientific research and less on other things.\" Although this proportion is nominally higher than the percentage of Americans who support more government spending, numerous context and wording differences between the questions leave responses open to substantially\n\ndiffering interpretations.23 Public support for increased spending on scientific research was substantially greater in South Korea (67% in 2004) than in the United States (Korea Science Foundation 2004).\nConfidence in the Science Community's Leadership\nFor the science-related decisions that citizens face, a comprehensive understanding of the relevant scientific research would require mastery and evaluation of a great deal of evidence. In addition to relying on direct evidence from scientific studies, citizens who want to draw on scientific evidence must consult the judgments of leaders and other experts whom they believe can speak authoritatively about the scientific knowledge that is relevant to an issue.\nPublic confidence in the leaders of the scientific community is one indicator of public willingness to rely on science. Since 1973, the GSS has tracked public confidence in the leadership of various institutions, including the scientific community. The GSS asks respondents whether they have \"a great deal of confidence, only some confidence, or hardly any confidence at all\" in the leaders of different institutions. In 2008, the percentage of Americans expressing \"a great deal of confidence\" in leaders of the scientific community (39%) was the same as those expressing \"a great deal of confidence\" in leaders of the medical community (39%) and higher than for all other institutions except the military (51%).\nConversely, the percentage expressing \"hardly any confidence at all\" was lower for scientific leaders than for leaders of any other institution about which this question was asked (table 7-8). Throughout the entire period in which this question has been asked, the percentage of Americans expressing a great deal of confidence in the leaders of the scientific community has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, hovering between 35% and 45% (appendix table 7-25). In contrast, for some other institutions (e.g., the military), confidence has shown more variability over the past three decades.\nScience usually ranks second or third in the public confidence surveys, with medicine or the military ranking first. The consistently high confidence in the leadership of the scientific community contrasts with a general decline in confidence in other institutional leaders over the years. The medical community, for example, has seen a long-term decline in confidence. Over half of Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in medical leaders in the mid-1970s, compared with about 40% in recent years. Thirty years ago confidence in the medical community was higher than confidence in scientific leaders. However, since 2002 science has scored as well as or better than medicine on this indicator, although the scores for the two fields remain very close.\nInfluence on Public Issues\nGovernment support for scientific research derives partly from the notion that science can support policymakers in\n\n\f7-32 \n\nChapter 7.

Science can play this role more effectively if the general public supports the use of scientific knowledge in such decisions and shares the view that science is relevant.\nIn 2006, the GSS asked about the appropriate influence of science on four public policy issues to which scientific research might be considered relevant--global climate change, research using human embryonic stem cells, federal income taxes, and genetically modified (GM) foods. Survey respondents were asked how much influence a group of scientists with relevant expertise (e.g., medical researchers, economists) should have in deciding about each issue, how well the scientists understood the issue, and to what extent the scientists would \"support what is best for the country as a whole versus what serves their own narrow interests.\" The same questions were asked about elected officials and either religious leaders (for stem cell research) or business leaders (for the other issues). Respondents were also asked a question about their perception of the level of consensus among the scientists regarding a largely factual aspect of the issue (e.g., \"the existence and causes of global warming\" or \"the importance of stem cell research\") and a question that probed their attitude regarding each issue.\nThe GSS data indicate that Americans believe that scientists should have a relatively large amount of influence on public decisions concerning these issues (table 7-9). For the four issues, the percentage who said that scientists should have either \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of influence ranged from 85% (\"global warming\") to 72% (\"income taxes\"). For each issue, the percentage was greater for scientists than for either of the other leadership groups. The contrast among the groups was more pronounced for the three issues\n\nthat dealt with biological or geophysical phenomena than for income taxes, where elected officials ranked closely behind economists.\nAmericans also give scientists relatively high marks for understanding the four issues (table 7-10). The GSS asked respondents to rate each leadership group's understanding of a largely factual aspect of each issue on a five-point scale ranging from \"very well\" to \"not at all.\" For the three issues dealing with biological or geophysical phenomena, the differences in perceived understanding were large: between 64% and 74% of the public placed the relevant scientists in one of the top two categories, whereas only 9% to 14% placed any of the other groups in those categories. The contrast among groups was smaller for the tax issue, with economists (52%) ranking ahead of business leaders (44%) and elected officials (28%).\nPatterns for the question about which groups would \"support what is best for the country as a whole versus what serves their own narrow interests\" were similar. For each issue, Americans placed the scientific group in one of the top two categories much more often than they placed either of the other leadership groups in those categories.\nOne factor that may limit the influence of scientific knowledge and the scientific community over public issues is the perception that significant scientific disagreement exists, making scientific knowledge uncertain (Krosnick et al. 2006). GSS respondents were asked to rate the degree of scientific consensus on a largely factual aspect of each of the four issues using a five-point scale ranging from \"near complete agreement\" to \"no agreement at all.\" The degree of perceived consensus of medical researchers on \"the importance of stem cells for research\" was the only item for\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-33\n\nTable 7-9 Preferred groups for influencing decisions about public issues: 2006\n(Percent)\n\nPreferred degree of influence\n\nPublic issue/group\n\nA great deal A fair amount\n\nA little\n\nNone at all Don't know\n\nGlobal warming\n\nEnvironmental scientists .........................................\n\n47\n\n38\n\n7\n\n3\n\n4\n\nElected officials.......................................................\n\n17\n\n33\n\n33\n\n13\n\n4\n\nBusiness leaders.....................................................\n\n10\n\n22\n\n38\n\n25\n\n5\n\nStem cell research\n\nMedical researchers................................................\n\n39\n\n41\n\n11\n\n4\n\n5\n\nElected officials.......................................................\n\n11\n\n35\n\n32\n\n15\n\n6\n\nReligious leaders.....................................................\n\n8\n\n21\n\n36\n\n29\n\n6\n\nFederal income taxes\n\nEconomists .............................................................\n\n21\n\n51\n\n18\n\n4\n\n6\n\nElected officials.......................................................\n\n21\n\n40\n\n24\n\n11\n\n4\n\nBusiness leaders.....................................................\n\n9\n\n37\n\n36\n\n13\n\n4\n\nGenetically modified foods\n\nMedical researchers................................................\n\n41\n\n40\n\n10\n\n3\n\n5\n\nElected officials.......................................................\n\n7\n\n30\n\n37\n\n21\n\n5\n\nBusiness leaders.....................................................\n\n3\n\n16\n\n41\n\n35\n\n5\n\nNOTES: Responses to: How much influence should each of the following groups have in deciding: global warming policy; government funding for stem cell research; reducing federal income taxes; restricting sale of genetically modified foods?

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nwhich more than half of respondents (52%) chose one of the two points near the \"complete agreement\" end of the scale (table 7-11). In the case of the perceived consensus of environmental scientists on \"the existence and causes of global warming,\" 42% chose one of these two points denoting a high degree of consensus. Lower proportions of respondents chose one of these two points when asked about the extent to which medical researchers agree on \"the risks and benefits of genetically modified foods\" (28%) or economists on \"the effects of reducing federal income taxes\" (20%).\nWith a few exceptions, responses to these questions do not differ markedly among demographic groups. Americans with higher incomes, more education, and more science knowledge tend to have more favorable perceptions of the knowledge, impartiality, and level of agreement among scientists. For a more detailed presentation of these data and further discussion of this subject, see NSB 2008.\nWhat Makes an Activity Scientific\nThe label \"scientific\" is usually considered a favorable one. When research studies claim to be scientific, they claim to produce valid knowledge; when occupations claim to be scientific, they claim their practitioners have systematic expertise. It is important for the public to be able to scrutinize these claims critically and use reasonable criteria to judge them, because not all claims that an activity is scientific are equally warranted.\nIn 2006, the GSS included two batteries of questions that probed what characteristics Americans associate with scientific studies and what disciplines and practices Americans consider scientific. These indicators provide insight into how Americans discriminate between more and less scientific endeavors. (Data from these questions are reported in greater detail in NSB 2008.)\n\nAttributes That Make Something Scientific One group of questions asked how important each of\neight characteristics is in \"making something scientific.\" These characteristics can be divided into three groups:\n Features of the research process:\ns The conclusions are based on solid evidence.\ns The researchers carefully examine different interpretations of the results, even ones they disagree with.\ns Other scientists repeat the experiment and find similar results.\n Aspects of the credentials and institutional settings that lend credibility to the research:\ns The people who do the research have advanced degrees in their field.\ns The research is done by scientists employed in a university setting.\ns The research takes place in a laboratory.\n External validation by other belief systems:\ns The results of the research are consistent with common sense.\ns The results of the research are consistent with religious beliefs.\nAmericans were most likely to consider features of the research process to be very important. Over two-thirds said that \"conclusions based on solid evidence\" (80%), \"carefully examin[ing] different interpretations of the results\" (73%), and \"replication of results by other scientists\" (67%) were very important in making something scientific.\nAmericans thought that researcher qualifications were almost as important, with 62% classifying \"the people who do it have advanced degrees in their field\" as very important.\n\nTable 7-11 Perceived scientific consensus on public issues: 2006\n(Percent)\n\nDegree of consensus (on scale of 1 to 5)\n\nGroup/public issue\n\nNear\n\nNo\n\ncomplete\n\nagreement\n\nagreement\n\nat all\n\nDon't\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nknow\n\nMedical researchers on importance\n\nof stem cells for research ..................................... 19\n\n33\n\n29\n\n4\n\n5\n\n9\n\nEnvironmental scientists on existence\n\nand causes of global warming.............................. 14\n\n28\n\n35\n\n9\n\n6\n\n9\n\nMedical researchers on risks and benefits\n\nof genetically modified foods ...............................\n\n9\n\n19\n\n41\n\n11\n\n7\n\n13\n\nEconomists on effects of reducing federal\n\nincome taxes ........................................................\n\n5\n\n15\n\n40\n\n14\n\n13\n\n13\n\nNOTES: Responses to: To what extent do [people in group] agree on [public issue]?

See appendix table 7-24, National Science Board, Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 (NSB 08-01A) (2008).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-35\n\nInstitutional settings often associated with research, such as laboratories (41%) and universities (33%), ranked lower. Respondents viewed these settings as similar in importance to having results that were \"consistent with common sense.\" Most Americans viewed consistency with religion as either not at all important (39%) or not too important (31%) to making something scientific.\nResponse patterns for this group of questions are related to the respondent's education level (figure 7-15). Although Americans at all levels of education rated research process characteristics as most important, more highly educated Americans gave these characteristics the highest ratings. In contrast, individual credentials, institutional auspices, and consistency with other beliefs were seen as less important among more highly educated respondents than among others. As a result of these divergent patterns, the gap in importance between process characteristics and other attributes is wide at higher levels of education but relatively narrow for people with less schooling (figure 7-15). (For more details, see NSB 2008.)\nWhich Fields Are Scientific The 2006 GSS asked Americans about eight fields of re-\nsearch or practice and whether they were \"very scientific, pretty scientific, not too scientific, or not scientific at all.\"\nPractically all Americans (98%) perceived medicine as \"very\" or \"pretty\" scientific, even though it is focused more on practical service delivery and less on research than other listed fields, including biology and physics. Nonetheless, both of these disciplines were also overwhelmingly seen as either \"very\" or \"pretty\" scientific (94% for biology and 90% for physics). Americans with more years of education and more classroom exposure to science and mathematics were more likely to believe that these two fields were relatively scientific, particularly physics.\nEngineering, a discipline which like medicine involves the application of science and mathematics to develop solutions to practical problems, ranked below the other three fields on this measure; 77% perceived engineering as \"very\" or \"pretty\" scientific.\nAbout 50% of Americans said that the two social science disciplines on the list (economics and sociology) were \"very\" or \"pretty\" scientific. Accounting and history were less likely to be placed at the scientific end of the scale; respondents with less education were more likely than others to classify history as relatively scientific. A similar question on the 2005 Eurobarometer about an overlapping set of fields produced generally similar results (EC 2005).\nViews of S&E Occupations\nData on public esteem for S&E occupations are an indicator of the attractiveness of these occupations and their ability to recruit talented people into their ranks. Such data may also have a bearing on the public's sense that S&E affects the nation's well-being in the future.\n\n-PN\\YL  0TWVY[HUJL VM ZJPLU[PMPJ WYVJLZZ YLZLHYJO JYLKLU[PHSZ HUK L_[LYUHS ]HSPKH[PVU [V W\\ISPJ\u00bbZ ILSPLM [OH[ ZVTL[OPUN PZ ZJPLU[PMPJ I` LK\\JH[PVU SL]LS! \n4LHU ZJVYL \n:JPLU[PMPJ 7YVJLZZ\n 9LZLHYJO *YLKLU[PHSZ\n\n,_[LYUHS ]HSPKH[PVU \n\n\n\n #/PNO ZJOVVS\n\n/PNO ZJOVVS :VTL NYHK\\H[L VY JVSSLNL LX\\P]HSLU[\n\n(ZZVJPH[L\u00bbZ )HJOLSVY\u00bbZ .YHK\\H[L KLNYLL KLNYLL KLNYLL\n\n56;,:! 9LZWVUZLZ [V OV^ PTWVY[HU[ LHJO VM LPNO[ Z[H[LTLU[Z PZ [V THRPUN ZVTL[OPUN ZJPLU[PMPJ\u00b7]LY` PTWVY[HU[ WYL[[` PTWVY[HU[ UV[ [VV PTWVY[HU[ UV[ PTWVY[HU[ H[ HSS ^OLYL  $ ]LY` PTWVY[HU[ HUK  $ UV[ PTWVY[HU[ H[ HSS 4LHU PTWVY[HUJL ZJVYLZ MVY WYVJLZZ JYLKLU[PHSZ HUK L_[LYUHS ]HSPKH[PVU HYL JVTW\\[LK H]LYHNLZ VM YLZWVUZLZ [V HSS Z[H[LTLU[Z PU JH[LNVY` 7YVJLZZ Z[H[LTLU[Z!  ;OL JVUJS\\ZPVUZ HYL IHZLK VU ZVSPK L]PKLUJL\"  ;OL YLZLHYJOLYZ JHYLM\\SS` L_HTPUL KPMMLYLU[ PU[LYWYL[H[PVUZ VM [OL YLZ\\S[Z L]LU VULZ [OL` KPZHNYLL ^P[O\"  6[OLY ZJPLU[PZ[Z YLWLH[ [OL L_WLYPTLU[ HUK MPUK ZPTPSHY YLZ\\S[Z *YLKLU[PHSZ Z[H[LTLU[Z!  ;OL WLVWSL ^OV KV P[ OH]L HK]HUJLK KLNYLLZ PU [OLPY MPLSK\"  0[ PZ KVUL I` ZJPLU[PZ[Z LTWSV`LK PU H \\UP]LYZP[` ZL[[PUN\"  ;OL YLZLHYJO [HRLZ WSHJL PU H SHIVYH[VY` ,_[LYUHS ]HSPKH[PVU Z[H[LTLU[Z!  ;OL YLZ\\S[Z VM [OL YLZLHYJO HYL JVUZPZ[LU[ ^P[O JVTTVU ZLUZL\"  ;OL YLZ\\S[Z VM [OL YLZLHYJO HYL JVUZPZ[LU[ ^P[O YLSPNPV\\Z ILSPLMZ\n:6<9*,! <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L`  :LL HWWLUKP_ [HISLZ  HUK  PU 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL )VHYK :JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ  5:) ( \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nFor over 30 years, the Harris Poll (Harris Interactive 2008b) has asked about the prestige of a large number of occupations, including scientists and engineers (table 7-12). In 2008, 56% of Americans said that scientists had \"very great prestige,\" and 40% expressed this view about engineers. Most occupations in the surveys ranked well below engineers.24\nBetween 1977 and 2008, the percentage of survey respondents attributing \"very great prestige\" to scientists has fluctuated between 51% and 66%. There has not been a clear trend over the years. The comparable score for engineers increased from 30% in 2007 to 40% in 2008, the highest level in thirteen surveys since the question was first asked in 1977.\nScientists ranked higher in prestige than almost all occupations in the Harris surveys. In recent years, their ranking was comparable with that of nurses, doctors, firefighters, and teachers and ahead of military and police officers. Engineers' standing is high and comparable to occupations\n\n\f7-36 \n\nChapter 7.

For each, would you tell me if you feel it is an occupation of very great prestige, considerable prestige, some prestige, or hardly any prestige at all? Data reflect responses of \"very great prestige.\"\n\nSOURCE: Prestige Paradox: High Pay Doesn't Necessarily Equal High Prestige: Teachers' Prestige Increases the Most Over 30 Years, Harris Poll, Harris Interactive (5 August 2008), http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=939, accessed 22 September 2009.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nclustered just below the top group (including clergy, military officers, and police officers).\nPrestige appears to reflect perceived service orientation and public benefit more than high income or celebrity; for instance, the proportions of respondents who attributed \"very great prestige\" to entertainers or actors were 15% and 16%, respectively (table 7-12). Americans are more likely to trust people in prestigious occupations (including scientists) to tell the truth (Harris Interactive 2006).\nSome evidence suggests that Americans rate scientific careers more positively than is the case in at least some other countries. In 2004, a little over 50% of South Koreans said they would feel happy if their son or daughter wanted to become a scientist. Among Chinese, science (40%) ranked close to medicine (41%) and teaching (43%) as an occupation that survey respondents hoped their children will pursue (CRISP 2008). In the United States, 80% of those surveyed in 2001 expressed positive views regarding their children becoming scientists.\nIn 2006, the majority of Israelis said they would be pleased if their children became scientists (77%), engineers (78%), or physicians (78%) (Yaar 2006).\n\nPublic Attitudes About Specific S&T-Related Issues\nPublic attitudes can affect the speed and direction of S&T development. When science plays a substantial role in a national policy controversy, more than the specific policies under debate may be at stake. The policy debate may also shape public opinion and government decisions about investments in general categories of research. Less directly, a highly visible debate involving science may shape overall public impressions of either the credibility of science or the proper role of science in other, less visible public decisions.\nLikewise, public attitudes about emerging areas of research and new technologies may have an impact on innovation. The climate of opinion concerning new research areas could influence levels of public and private investment in related technological innovations and, eventually, the adoption of new technologies and the growth of industries based on these technologies.\nFor these reasons, survey responses about policy controversies involving science, specific research areas, and emerging technologies are relevant. In addition, responses about relatively specific matters provide a window into the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-37\n\npractical decisions through which citizens translate more general attitudes into actions, although, like all survey responses, how these responses relate to actual behavior remains uncertain. More generally, even in democratic societies, public opinion about new scientific and technological developments does not translate directly into actions or policy. Instead, it filters through institutions that selectively measure what the public believes and either magnify or minimize the effects of divisions in public opinion on public discourse and government policy (Jasanoff 2005).\nAttitudes toward policy issues always involve a multitude of factors and not just knowledge or understanding of relevant science. Values, morals, judgments of prudence, and numerous other factors can come strongly into play. Judgments about scientific fact are often secondary. In assessing the same issue, different people may find different considerations relevant.\nThis section begins with data on environmental issues, including global climate change and nuclear power. It then covers attitudes toward recent and novel technologies, including medical biotechnology, agricultural biotechnology (i.e., GM food), and nanotechnology. Data on cloning and stem cell research follow, and the section concludes with recent data on attitudes toward science and mathematics education and toward scientific research on animals.\nEnvironment and Climate Change\nThe Gallup Organization's annual survey on environmental issues indicates that Americans have become somewhat more concerned about environmental quality in the last 4 years (figure 7-16). Between 2004 and 2008, the percentage of Americans expressing \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of worry about the \"quality of the environment\" rose from 62% to 74%, returning approximately to its 2001 level (Saad 2008b).\nDespite the rise in \"worry\" about the environment, concern about this issue barely registers when surveys ask Americans to name the country's top problem. In surveys conducted in the first quarter of 2009, only about 2% of Americans mentioned the environment or pollution in an open-ended question asking \"What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?\" (The Gallup Organization 2009a, 2009b). In close-ended questions, worry about the environment ranked lower than worry about the economy (90%), the availability and affordability of either energy (82%) or healthcare (81%), and crime and violence (80%). The proportion of Americans worried about the quality of the environment was similar to the proportion worried about Social Security (75%), future terrorist attacks (73%), and hunger and homelessness (73%) and higher than the percentage worried about illegal immigration (70%), unemployment (68%), drug use (67%), and race relations (45%).\nIn the 2008 GSS, the majority of Americans (66%) believed that the government is spending too little to reduce pollution and only a handful thought it spent too much (8%, appendix table 7-23).

The trend in support for environmental protection was less evident when Americans were asked about tradeoffs between environmental protection and economic growth (figure 7-17). In March 2009, only 42% of Americans indicated that the protection of the environment should take precedence over economic growth (down from about 70% in 1990\u00ad91 and in 2000).\nHowever, when asked about various proposals to protect the environment in Gallup surveys conducted between 2001 and 2007 (table 7-13), strong majorities endorsed government spending to develop alternate sources of fuel for automobiles and to develop solar and wind power. Majorities also favored different environmentally friendly measures such as setting higher emissions and pollution standards for business and industry and enforcing federal environmental regulations more strongly. Lower proportions favored expanding the use of nuclear energy and opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration (The Gallup Organization 2009a).\nNational data on the use of biofuels for energy consumption is scarce, but one survey found that 70% of Americans thought using ethanol was \"mostly a good idea\" (Broder and Connelly 2007).\nClimate change, sometimes referred to as global warming (see sidebar \"`Climate Change' Versus `Global Warming'\"),\n\n\f7-38 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nhas recently become more prominent among environmental issues for the American public. Since 2000, Gallup has asked Americans how much they personally worry about eight environmental issues. The percentage of Americans who said they worried \"a great deal\" about \"global warming\" decreased from 40% in 2000 to 26% in 2004, but increased to 34% in 2008 (Saad 2009). Even with this increase, \"global warming\" still ranked eighth among these issues. The percentage of Americans worrying \"a great deal\"\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ WYPVYP[PLZ MVY LU]PYVUTLU[HS WYV[LJ[PVU ]LYZ\\Z LJVUVTPJ NYV^[O!  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[ \n,U]PYVUTLU[HS WYV[LJ[PVU\n\n\n ,JVUVTPJ NYV^[O\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n     \n\n56;,:! 9LZWVUZLZ [V >P[O ^OPJO VUL VM [OLZL Z[H[LTLU[Z HIV\\[ [OL LU]PYVUTLU[ HUK [OL LJVUVT` KV `V\\ TVZ[ HNYLL\u00b7WYV[LJ[PVU VM [OL LU]PYVUTLU[ ZOV\\SK IL NP]LU WYPVYP[` L]LU H[ [OL YPZR VM J\\YIPUN LJVUVTPJ NYV^[O VY LJVUVTPJ NYV^[O ZOV\\SK IL NP]LU WYPVYP[` L]LU PM [OL LU]PYVUTLU[ Z\\MMLYZ [V ZVTL L_[LU[& 7VSS JVUK\\J[LK PU    \u00b6     \u00b6 \" V[OLY `LHYZ L_[YHWVSH[LK\n:6<9*,! 5L^WVY[ - (TLYPJHUZ! ,JVUVT` ;HRLZ 7YLJLKLUJL 6]LY ,U]PYVUTLU[  4HYJO   O[[W!^^^NHSS\\WJVTWVSS  (TLYPJHUZ,JVUVT`;HRLZ7YLJLKLUJL6]LY,U]PYVUTLU[HZW_& ]LYZPVU$WYPU[ HJJLZZLK  :LW[LTILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nabout this issue was lower than the percentage of Americans worrying \"a great deal\" about water-related environmental issues such as \"pollution of drinking water\" (59%), \"pollution of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs\" (52%), \"contamination of soil and water by toxic waste\" (52%), \"maintenance of the\n\"Climate Change\" Versus \"Global Warming\"\nThe terms \"climate change\" and \"global warming\" are often used interchangeably. Scientists increasingly prefer the term \"climate change,\" which conveys the idea that more than a rise in temperatures is occurring (National Academies 2008b). However, most survey data registers opinion about global warming, not about climate change.\nLimited research in the United States and Europe suggests that variations in terminology do not significantly affect survey responses on this issue. A large sample of voluntary survey respondents in the United States, randomly divided into two groups, was asked \"If nothing is done to reduce climate change/global warming in the future, how serious a problem do you think it will be?\" The two groups responded similarly, regardless of which term was used (Villar and Krosnick 2009).\nTwo similar European experiments also showed that the two terms made little or no difference in perceptions of the problem. In one, respondents were asked to identify \"the most serious problem currently facing the world as a whole\" from a list that included either \"global warming\" or \"climate change.\" In the other, the choice of term did not affect how Europeans rated the seriousness of the problem \"at this moment\" (EC 2008b).\n\nTable 7-13 Public approval of specific environmental proposals: 2001\u00ad07\n(Percent)\n\nEnvironmental proposal\n\n2001 2002 2003 2006 2007\n\nSpending government money to develop alternate sources of fuel for automobiles ....................

Response categories in surveys, however, are not always distinct and may evoke overlapping associations in respondents. \"Air pollution,\" for example, is related to carbon emissions and climate change.\nRecent data show additional signs that awareness of climate change is increasing. Since 2004, Gallup surveys registered gradual increases in the percentage of Americans who say they understand the \"global warming\" issue \"very well\" or \"fairly well,\" from 68% in 2004 to 80% in 2008 (The Gallup Organization 2009a). In addition, the number of Americans who say that the effects of \"global warming\" have already begun to occur has been steadily increasing since 2004 and was at an all time high in 2008 at 61%. The percentage of Americans who believe that most scientists think \"global warming\" is occurring has also been rising for over a decade. Most Americans think that \"the increases in the Earth's temperature over the last century\" are largely the result of human activities rather than natural changes; that percentage has been stable since 2001, hovering between 58% and 61% (The Gallup Organization 2009a).\nNuclear Power\nIn the debate over America's sources of energy, nuclear power has been a controversial subject. On the one hand, nuclear power is an appealing option to meet energy needs due to its low emissions of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. On the other hand, there are serious concerns about this technology, such as risks in the operation of nuclear plants, the disposal of nuclear waste, and nuclear proliferation.\nOverall, support for nuclear power is lower than for conservation-based energy strategies (table 7-13), but it has grown in the last 2 years. American public opinion has been fairly evenly divided since the mid-1990s, but the proportion of Americans who favor the use of nuclear power as one of the ways to provide electricity for the U.S. increased from 53% in 2007 to 59% in 2009 (Jones 2009). A substantial minority of Americans (42%) thinks nuclear power plants are not safe and prior surveys indicate that three out of five Americans oppose the construction of a nuclear energy plant in their local communities.25\nDespite some differences in wording between the Eurobarometer and the U.S. questions, a 2008 report shows that European public opinion on nuclear energy is divided but support for energy production by nuclear power stations has grown since 2005 (EC 2008a). Support for nuclear energy varies a great deal among countries in this region. In general, citizens of countries that have operational nuclear power plants are considerably more likely to support nuclear energy than citizens of other countries (figure 7-18).26\nBiotechnology and Its Medical Applications\nRecent advances in recombinant DNA technology enable the manipulation of genetic material to produce plants and animals with desirable characteristics. The most recent\n\nAmerican data on attitudes in this area are from 2005. They show that Americans, Canadians, and Europeans have similarly favorable attitudes toward biotechnology in general and medical applications in particular.

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nof survey respondents in each country registered favorable attitudes (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005).27\nFew Americans (about 1 in 10) consider themselves \"very familiar\" with biotechnology and Canadians report slightly less familiarity. Without a strong knowledge base to use in evaluating information, their assessment of the credibility of information sources is an important element in forming their judgments about information on this topic. In both the United States and Canada, scientific journals and government-funded scientists were the top-rated institutions that could provide information about biotechnology. Conversely, privately owned mass media, biotechnology company executives, and religious and political leaders ranked near the bottom in both countries. (For more detail on this subject, see NSB 2008.)\nGenetically Modified Food\nAlthough the introduction of GM crops has provoked much less controversy in the United States than in Europe, U.S. popular support for this application of biotechnology is limited. According to a 2008 CBS/New York Times poll, 44% of Americans indicated they had not heard much about GM ingredients added to foods to make them taste better and last longer. However, 87% believed that these foods should be labeled and 53% expected that it was \"not very likely\" or \"not at all likely\" that they would buy food that was labeled as such.\nOverall, these results are consistent with a series of five surveys conducted by the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology between 2001 and 2006. These studies consistently found that only about one-fourth of U.S. consumers favored \"the introduction of genetically modified foods into the U.S. food supply\" (Mellman Group, Inc. 2006). The proportion of U.S. survey respondents reporting a negative reaction to the phrase \"genetically modified food\" (44%) was more than twice the 20% that reported a positive reaction (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005). Nonetheless, consumers in the United States expressed more favorable views than Europeans, with Canadians falling somewhere in between (Gaskell et al. 2006).\nAlthough the FDA proposed guidelines for the approval process for genetically engineered animals in September 2008 (Maugh and Kaplan 2008), past surveys have generally found that in the U.S. residents are even more wary of genetic modification of animals than they are of genetic modification of plants (Mellman Group, Inc. 2005). Many express support for regulatory responses, but this support appears to be quite sensitive to the way issues are framed. Thus, whereas 29% expressed a great deal of confidence in \"the Food and Drug Administration or FDA,\" only about half as many expressed the same confidence when the question was posed about \"government regulators\" (Mellman Group, Inc. 2006). (Additional findings from earlier U.S. surveys can be found in NSB 2006 and NSB 2008.)\n\nNanotechnology\nNanotechnology involves manipulating matter at unprecedentedly small scales to create new or improved products that can be used in a wide variety of ways. Nanotechnology has been the focus of relatively large public and private investments for almost a decade, and innovations based on nanotechnology are increasingly common. However, relative to other new technologies, nanotechnology is still in an early stage of development and the degree of risk remains uncertain (Chatterjee 2008, Barlow et al. 2009).\nData from the 2008 GSS indicated that overall familiarity with nanotechnology is similar to its 2006 level. The proportion of Americans who had heard \"a lot\" or \"some\" about nanotechnology remained virtually unchanged (5% and 15% in both 2006 and 2008), but the proportion of those who had heard \"a little\" or \"nothing at all\" declined slightly (appendix table 7-26). These numbers are similar to those reported by the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies based on a national survey conducted in August 2008 (Peter D. Hart Research Associates 2008). While the questions asked are not strictly comparable, familiarity with nanotechnology in the 2006 GSS was similar to that in Europe in 2005, in which 44% of survey respondents said they had heard of it (Gaskell et al. 2006).\nDespite increased federal funding and more than 600 nanotechnology products already on the market (The National Academies 2008a),28 nanotechnology knowledge levels were not high (appendix table 7-11) and remained similar to 2006, even among the minority of GSS respondents who had heard of nanotechnology. In 2008, 63% of the respondents who had heard at least a little about this technology correctly indicated that the statement \"nanotechnology involves manipulating extremely small units of matter, such as individual atoms, in order to produce better materials\" was true, but many (29%) said they did not know, and a few (8%) thought this statement was false. Almost half (47%) did not know whether the statement \"the properties of nanoscale materials often differ fundamentally and unexpectedly from the properties of the same materials at larger scales\" was true, while 41% correctly answered true and the remaining 12% answered false. A third of the respondents answered both questions correctly.\nWhen nanotechnology is defined in surveys, Americans express favorable expectations for it. After receiving a brief explanation of nanotechnology, GSS respondents were asked about the likely balance between the benefits and harms of nanotechnology. Similar to 2006, in 2008 38% said the \"benefits will outweigh the harmful results\" and only 9% expected the harms to predominate (appendix table 7-27). In 2008, however, the proportion of Americans who said they did not know whether the benefits of nanotechnology would outweigh the harmful results or vice versa increased, and the proportion who expected the benefits to be equal to the harmful results decreased. The fact that about half of respondents either gave a neutral response (12%) or said they did not know (40%) suggests that these opinions\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-41\n\nare open to change as Americans become more familiar with this technology.\nFavorable expectations for nanotechnology are associated with more education, greater science knowledge, and greater familiarity with nanotechnology. Men are also more likely to have favorable expectations than women (appendix table 7-27). In these aspects, patterns are similar to those for responses concerning S&T in general.\nIn the GSS data, favorable attitudes toward nanotechnology are also associated with greater familiarity with it. That is, Americans who say they are more familiar with nanotechnology are more likely to believe that its benefits will outweigh the risks. However, this association does not mean that when people become more familiar their attitudes necessarily become positive. Some data suggest that when individuals who report knowing little or nothing about nanotechnology hear a balanced statement of its risks and benefits, they develop less favorable opinions of it (Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc. 2008). Furthermore, recent research suggests that attitudes toward nanotechnology are likely to vary depending on the context in which it is applied, with energy applications viewed much more positively than those in health and human enhancements (Pidgeon et al. 2009).\nStem Cell Research and Human Cloning\nUnlike most issues involving scientific research, studies using embryonic stem cells have generated considerable public controversy. In the case of stem cell research, strongly held views about moral fundamentals determine many people's attitudes. There is less reason to believe that this is the case for certain other S&T issues, such as nuclear power.\nAlthough a majority of the public supports such research, a substantial minority is opposed to it. When surveys ask about medical technologies that could be derived from embryonic stem cell research in the context of expected health benefits, public response is relatively positive. But technologies that involve cloning human embryos evoke consistently strong and negative responses.\nSince 2004, the majority of the American public has favored \"medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos\" (VCU Center for Public Policy 2008). Support grew continuously from 2002 (35% in favor) to 2005 (58% in favor) and remained at a similar level in 2008 (figure 7-19). In eight annual Gallup surveys between 2002 and 2009, the percentage of Americans who found such research \"morally acceptable\" ranged from 52% to 64%, and the percentage saying it was \"morally wrong\" from 30% to 39% (Saad 2008a; The Gallup Organization 2009c). Similarly, in five Pew surveys conducted between August 2004 and August 2007, a consistent but slim majority agreed that it was \"more important to continue stem cell research that might produce new medical cures than to avoid destroying the human embryos used in the research\" while about a third said not destroying embryos was more important (Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008).\n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ H[[P[\\KLZ [V^HYK Z[LT JLSS YLZLHYJO! \u00b6\n\n*\\T\\SH[P]L WLYJLU[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n \n\n:[YVUNS` MH]VY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n:VTL^OH[ MH]VY\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n     \n\n+VU\u00bb[ RUV^\n:VTL^OH[ VWWVZL\n:[YVUNS` VWWVZL\n\n        \n\n56;,:! 9LZWVUZLZ [V 6U [OL ^OVSL OV^ T\\JO KV `V\\ MH]VY VY VWWVZL TLKPJHS YLZLHYJO [OH[ \\ZLZ Z[LT JLSSZ MYVT O\\THU LTIY`VZ& 4VZ[ YLJLU[ X\\LZ[PVU HZRLK  5V]LTILY\u00b6 +LJLTILY \n:6<9*,! =PYNPUPH *VTTVU^LHS[O <UP]LYZP[` =*< =*< *LU[LY MVY 7\\ISPJ 7VSPJ` =*< 3PML :JPLUJLZ :\\Y]L`  O[[W!^^^]J\\LK\\ SPMLZJPJLU[LYZJLUFSZLFZ\\Y]L`ZO[TS HJJLZZLK  :LW[LTILY  \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\nSupport for stem cell research is higher when the question inquires about research that uses stem cells from sources that do not involve human embryos. Seven out of ten respondents favored this type of research in 2008, down slightly from 75% in 2007 (VCU Center for Public Policy 2008). Support also increased when the question was framed as an emotionally compelling personal issue (\"If you or a member of your family had a condition such as Parkinson's Disease, or a spinal cord injury, would you support the use of embryonic stem cells in order to pursue a treatment for that condition?\"). In this case, 70% of Americans support treatments that use stem cells and only 21% do not (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006). Responses become more mixed when questions mention \"cloning technology\" that is used only to help medical research develop new treatments for disease. However, opinion is decidedly negative when the question asks about cloning or genetically altering animals without mention of a medical purpose (table 7-14).\nAmericans are overwhelmingly opposed to human cloning. In a 2008 VCU survey, the idea of cloning or genetically altering humans was rejected by 78% of Americans (VCU Center for Public Policy 2008). The specter of reproductive cloning can generate apprehension about therapeutic cloning. Asked how concerned they were that \"the use of\n\n\f7-42 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nhuman cloning technology to create stem cells for human therapeutic purposes will lead to a greater chance of human reproductive cloning,\" over two-thirds of Americans said they were either very (31%) or somewhat (37%) concerned (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006).\nIn 2008, about two-thirds of Americans were \"very clear\" (23%) or \"somewhat clear\" (41%) about the difference between stem cells that come from human embryos, stem cells that come from adults, and stem cells that come from other sources (VCU Center for Public Policy 2008). However, public attitudes toward cloning technology are not grounded in a strong grasp of the difference between reproductive and therapeutic cloning (see glossary for the definitions). Most Americans (64%) said they were not clear (\"not very clear\" or \"not clear at all\") about this distinction, with 26% saying they were \"somewhat clear\" and only 8% characterizing themselves as \"very clear\" about it. The number of Americans who professed greater comprehension in 2008 was lower than it was when VCU began asking this question in 2002, despite, or perhaps because of, the increased visibility of stem cell research as a public issue.\nSupport for stem cell research is strongest among people with more years of formal education. Americans who are more religious and more politically conservative are more likely to oppose such research (VCU Center for Public Policy 2008).\nA recent international survey on attitudes toward stem cell research in a dozen European countries, the United States, Japan, and Israel found that awareness, knowledge, and attitudes about this type of research vary widely (Fundacion BBVA 2008). Overall, Americans are more aware of stem cell research than residents of most other countries and more often respond correctly to knowledge questions on this subject. Americans are somewhat more likely than\n\nresidents of several countries in Europe to believe that stem cell research is immoral (appendix table 7-28).\nScience and Mathematics Education\nIn much public discourse about how Americans will fare in an increasingly S&T-driven world, quality education in science and mathematics is seen as crucial for both individuals and the nation as a whole.\nIn the 2008 GSS, majorities of Americans in all demographic groups agreed that the quality of science and mathematics education in American schools is inadequate. Their level of agreement increases with education, science knowledge, income, and age (appendix table 7-29). Dissatisfaction with the quality of math and science education increased from 63% in 1985 to 70% in 2008, but is still below its peak in 1992 (75%) (figure 7-20; appendix table 7-30).\nIn addition, the proportion of Americans who indicated they believe the government is spending too little money in improving education in the biannual GSS surveys has been consistently over 70% since the early 1980s. Along with improving health care, this is one of the two top areas where the public feels government spending is too low (figure 7-20, appendix table 7-23).\nScientific Research on Animals\nThe medical research community conducts experimental tests on animals in order to advance scientific understanding of biological processes and test the effectiveness of drugs and procedures that may eventually be used to improve human health.\nMost Americans support at least some kinds of animal research. Nearly two-thirds said they favored \"using animals in medical research\" (VCU Center for Public Policy\n\nTable 7-14 Public opinion on medical technologies derived from stem cell research: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nQuestion\n\nFavor Oppose\n\n1.

While a majority of Americans say that \"medical testing on animals is morally acceptable,\" this percentage decreased from 65% in 2001 to 56% in 2008 (Saad 2008a). Men are more likely than women to approve this kind of research (appendix table 7-31).\nPast NSF surveys suggest that the public is more comfortable with the use of mice in scientific experiments than the use of dogs and chimpanzees (NSB 2002). In 2001 68% of Americans agreed that scientists should be allowed to do research that causes pain and injury to animals like mice if it produces new information about human health problems, compared to 44% who expressed agreement when the question focused on dogs and chimpanzees (NSB 2002).\nWhile recent comparable international data are lacking, a survey conducted by Gallup in 2003 showed that Americans and Canadians were more likely to tolerate scientific research on animals than the British. When asked: \"Regardless of whether or not you think it should be legal, please tell me whether you personally believe that in general medical testing on animals is morally acceptable or morally wrong,\" the majority of adults in the U.S. and Canada believed it was morally acceptable (63% and 59%, respectively). In contrast, the majority of British respondents thought it was morally wrong (54%) (Mason Kiefer 2003).\n\n-PN\\YL  7\\ISPJ H[[P[\\KLZ [V^HYK JVUK\\J[PUN O\\THU OLHS[O YLZLHYJO [OH[ TH` PUMSPJ[ WHPU VY PUQ\\Y` [V HUPTHSZ! :LSLJ[LK `LHYZ  \u00b6\n7LYJLU[\n\n\n (NYLL\n\n\n +PZHNYLL\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n56;,:! 9LZWVUZLZ [V :JPLU[PZ[Z ZOV\\SK IL HSSV^LK [V KV YLZLHYJO [OH[ JH\\ZLZ WHPU HUK PUQ\\Y` [V HUPTHSZ SPRL KVNZ HUK JOPTWHUaLLZ PM P[ WYVK\\JLZ UL^ PUMVYTH[PVU HIV\\[ O\\THU OLHS[O WYVISLTZ ;HISL PUJS\\KLZ HSS `LHYZ MVY ^OPJO KH[H JVSSLJ[LK :\\Y]L` YLZ\\S[Z MYVT              \" V[OLY `LHYZ L_[YHWVSH[LK\n:6<9*,:! 5H[PVUHS :JPLUJL -V\\UKH[PVU +P]PZPVU VM :JPLUJL 9LZV\\YJLZ :[H[PZ[PJZ :\\Y]L` VM 7\\ISPJ ([[P[\\KLZ ;V^HYK HUK <UKLYZ[HUKPUN VM :JPLUJL HUK ;LJOUVSVN`  \u00b6\" HUK <UP]LYZP[` VM *OPJHNV 5H[PVUHS 6WPUPVU 9LZLHYJO *LU[LY .LULYHS :VJPHS :\\Y]L` \n:JPLUJL HUK ,UNPULLYPUN 0UKPJH[VYZ \n\n\f7-44 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nConclusion\nIn assessing public knowledge and attitudes concerning S&T, two kinds of standards for judgment are possible. One standard involves comparing a country's knowledge and attitudes with those recorded in the past or in other countries. The second standard involves assessing what a technologically advanced society requires (either today or in the future) to compete in the world economy and enable its citizens to better take advantage of scientific progress in their own lives.\nBy the first standard, the survey data provide little or no evidence of declining knowledge or increasingly negative attitudes. Relative to Americans in the recent past, today's Americans score as well on knowledge measures and tend to be more skeptical about scientific claims for pseudoscience, such as astrology. In addition, three decades of U.S. data consistently show that Americans endorse the past achievements and future promise of S&T, are optimistic about new technologies, and are favorably predisposed to increasing government investment in science. When Americans compare science with other institutions, science's relative ranking is as or more favorable than in the past. In addition, the prestige of the engineering profession grew in the last year.\nWhen the data are examined using other countries as a benchmark, the United States compares favorably. Compared with adult residents of other developed countries, Americans appear to know as much or more about science, and they express as much or more optimism about technology.\nBy the second standard, trend data show that significant minorities of Americans cannot answer relatively simple knowledge questions about S&T, they express basic misconceptions about emerging technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, and they believe that relatively great scientific uncertainty surrounds the existence and causes of global climate change. Sizable parts of the population express reservations about how the speed of technological change affects our way of life or the use of animals in medical research.\nRegardless of the standard used in assessing public knowledge and attitudes, one pattern in the data stands out: more highly educated Americans tend to know more about S&T, express more favorable attitudes about S&T, and make discriminations that are more consistent with those likely to be made by scientists and engineers themselves. Thus, for example, they focus more heavily on process criteria when evaluating whether something is scientific, and their classification of fields as more and less scientific more closely resembles a classification that would be found in a university catalog. Whether this association is causal is uncertain. Although greater knowledge may affect attitudes and perspectives, pre-existing attitudes and perspectives may affect whether or not people acquire the kinds of knowledge available to them in school.\n\nNotes\n1. Data from Pew show that the proportion of Americans who read the newspaper declined from 40% to 34% between 2006 and 2008 and that newspapers would have lost more readers if they did not have online versions. Most of the loss in newspaper readership since 2006 has come from those who read the print version of the newspaper--in 2008, 27% said they had read only the print version of a daily newspaper the day before compared to 34% in 2006 (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2008).\n2. In 2001 this question was part of a single-purpose telephone survey focused on science and technology. In 2008 these data were collected as part of a face-to face multipurpose survey covering a broad range of behavior and attitudes. It is unclear whether these differences in data collection or a change in public opinion account for the decline in interest observed between 2001 and 2008. In interviews conducted over the phone, respondents may be more likely to respond to questions in a socially desirable way (Holbrook, Green, and Krosnick 2003). In addition, a single purpose survey may suggest to respondents that science and technology are important.\n3. In interpreting survey data that use the phrase \"science and technology,\" it is important to take into account the uncertainties surrounding its meaning and the different associations Americans make when they hear it.\n4. The peak in the coverage of the category \"Science, space, and technology\" in 1999 illustrated in figure 7-6 includes major network coverage of stories about the so-called millennium bug and business issues from the dot.com boom such as the rise of Internet commerce and the browser antitrust wars.\n5. The question on interest in new scientific discoveries included in the 2005 Eurobarometer (EC 2005) was the same three-category question asked in the United States between 1979 and 2001 and in 2008 (\"very interested,\" \"moderately interested,\" and \"not at all interested\"). The question asked in the 2007 Eurobarometer (EC 2007) was different because it asked about interest in \"scientific research\" rather than \"new scientific discoveries\" and gave respondents four options (\"very interested,\" \"fairly interested,\" \"not very interested,\" and \"not at all interested\"). Thus, the data in this sidebar are not strictly comparable to earlier Eurobarometer surveys or to the U.S. data question on interest.\n6. In Brazil the survey asked respondents about their interest in \"medicine and health\" issues and \"environmental issues\" and the question categories included \"very interested,\" \"a little interested,\" and \"not at all interested.\"\n7. In the past, interest in space exploration has consistently ranked low both in the United States and around the world, relative to other S&T topics. Surveys in Russia, China, and Japan have documented this general pattern. However, though there are new U.S. data on this subject, there have been no recent surveys documenting interest in space exploration in other countries.\n8. People can become involved with S&T through many other nonclassroom activities. Examples of such activities\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 7-45\n\ninclude participating in government policy processes, going to movies that feature S&T, bird-watching, and building computers. Nationally representative data on this sort of involvement with S&T are unavailable.\n9. In the 2008 GSS, respondents received two similar introductions to this question. Response patterns did not vary depending on which introduction was given.\n10. Survey items that test factual knowledge sometimes use easily comprehensible language at the cost of scientific precision. This may prompt some highly knowledgeable respondents to feel that the items blur or neglect important distinctions, and in a few cases may lead respondents to answer questions incorrectly. In addition, the items do not reflect the ways that established scientific knowledge evolves as scientists accumulate new evidence. Although the text of the factual knowledge questions may suggest a fixed body of knowledge, it is more accurate to see scientists as making continual, often subtle, modifications in how they understand existing data in light of new evidence.\n11. Formal schooling and verbal skills are positively associated. In the 2008 GSS data, verbal skills contributed to factual knowledge even when controlling for education.\n12. Among respondents with comparable formal education, attending informal science institutions was associated with greater knowledge.\n13. The two nanotechnology questions were asked only of respondents who said they had some familiarity with nanotechnology, and a sizable majority of the respondents who ventured a response different from \"don't know\" answered the questions correctly. To measure nanotechnology knowledge more reliably, researchers would prefer a scale with more than two questions.\n14. The questions were selected from the Trends in Mathematics and Science Studies (TIMSS), National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), practice General Educational Development (GED) exams, and AAAS Project 2061.\n15. The scoring of the open-ended questions closely followed the scoring of the corresponding test administered to middle-school students.\nFor the NAEP question \"Lightning and thunder happen at the same time, but you see the lightning before you hear the thunder. Explain why this is so,\" the question was scored as follows:\n Complete: The response provided a correct explanation including the relative speeds at which light and sound travel. For example, \"Sound travels much slower than light so you see the light sooner at a distance.\"\n Partial: The response addressed speed and used terminology such as thunder for sound and lightning for light, or made a general statement about speed but did not indicate which is faster. For example, \"One goes at the speed of light and the other at the speed of sound.\"\n Unsatisfactory/Incorrect: Any response that did not relate or mention the faster speed of light or its equivalent, the\n\nslower speed of sound. For example: \"Because the storm was further out.\" or \"Because of static electricity.\"\nFor the TIMSS question \"A solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water will turn blue litmus paper red. A solution of the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water will turn red litmus paper blue. If the acid and base solutions are mixed in the right proportion, the resulting solution will cause neither red nor blue litmus paper to change color. Explain why the litmus paper does not change color in the mixed solution,\" the question was scored as follows:\n Correct: The response had to refer to a neutralization or a chemical reaction that results in products that do not react with litmus paper. Three kinds of answers were classified as correct:\nz The response referred explicitly to the formation of water (and salt) from the neutralization reaction (e.g., \"Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide will mix together to form water and salt, which is neutral.\")\nz The response referred to neutralization (or the equivalent) even if the specific reaction is not mentioned (e.g., \"The mixed solution is neutral, so litmus paper does not react.\")\nz The response referred to a chemical reaction taking place (implicitly or explicitly) to form products that do not react with litmus paper (or a similar substance), even if neutralization was not explicitly mentioned (e.g., \"The acid and base react, and the new chemicals do not react with litmus paper.\")\n Partially correct: The response mentioned only that acids and bases are \"balanced,\" \"opposites,\" \"cancel each other out,\" or only that it changes to a salt without mentioning the neutralization reaction. These answers suggest that the respondent remembered the concept but the terminology they used was less precise, or that the answer was partial. For example, \"they balance each other out.\"\n Incorrect: The response did not mention any of the above or is too partial or incomplete, and/or uses terminology that is too imprecise. For example, \"Because they are base solutions--the two bases mixed together there is no reaction.\" or \"There is no change. Both colors change to the other.\"\n16. In its own international comparison of scientific literacy, Japan ranked itself 10th among the 14 countries it evaluated (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy 2002).\n17. Early NSF surveys used additional questions to measure understanding of probability. Through a process similar to that described in note 12, Bann and Schwerin (2004) identified a smaller number of questions that could be administered to develop a comparable indicator. These questions were administered in 2004 and 2006, and appendix tables 7-13 and 7-14 record combined probability responses using these questions; appendix table 7-13 also shows responses to individual probability questions in each year.\n\n\f7-46 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\n18. Figure 7-12 includes four questions on experimental design included in appendix tables 7-13 and 7-15. Two of these four questions include a question on experimental design and a follow-up question asking \"why\"; correct responses to these two questions represent the combined responses and are incorporated into the figure as one question.\n19. The pseudoscience section focuses on astrology because of the availability of long-term national trend indicators on this subject. Other examples of pseudoscience include the belief in lucky numbers, the existence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), extrasensory perception (ESP), or magnetic therapy.\n20. Methodological issues make fine-grained comparisons of data from different survey years suspect. For instance, although the question content and interviewer instructions were identical in 2004 and 2006, the percentage of respondents who volunteered \"about equal\" (an answer not among the choices given)\" was substantially different. This difference may have been produced by the change from telephone interviews in 2004 to in-person interviews in 2006 (though telephone interviews in 2001 produced results that are similar to those in 2006). More likely, customary interviewing practices in the three different organizations that administered the surveys affected their interviewers' willingness to accept responses other than those that were specifically offered on the interview form, including \"don't know\" responses.\n21. There are large differences among European countries. The lowest support for this statement is found in Iceland, with 38% expressing agreement. Other countries where less than half of residents agree include Ireland (42%), Finland (44%), Denmark (44%), the United Kingdom (45%), and the Netherlands (47%).\n22. This type of survey question asks respondents about their assessment of government spending in several areas without mentioning the possible negative consequences of spending (e.g., higher taxes, less money available for higher priority expenditures). A question that focused respondents' attention on such consequences might yield response patterns less sympathetic to greater government funding.\n23. Unlike the U.S. question, the European question joins two logically independent ideas--more spending on science and less spending on other priorities. In addition, because nations begin from different levels of spending, survey responses cannot be read as indicating different views about the proper level of spending in this area, nor do they indicate the strength of sentiment in different countries. Differences in the connotations of questions posed in different languages add further complexities. Perhaps for some or all of these reasons, variations among European countries in responses to this question are large, with about two-thirds of respondents agreeing in Italy, Spain, and France, but less than onethird in Finland and the Netherlands.\n24. There are many different types of specializations within occupations and prestige may well vary within the same occupation or industry.\n\n25. The two questions from the 2009 Gallup survey were each asked to half the sample (N=500).\n26. Countries with nuclear plants include Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Two exceptions to this pattern are Romania and Spain, both of which have operational nuclear power plants but where the level of support for nuclear energy is below the EU-27 average. An earlier Eurobarometer study showed that the Spaniards and the Romanians were less aware of the fact that their countries have nuclear power plants than respondents in other countries with nuclear plants in operation. This low level of awareness regarding the operation of a nuclear plant in their country may lead to a less positive attitude about nuclear energy.\n27. A 2006 Canadian survey showed little or no change from 2005 (Decima Research 2006).\n28. According to a recent report from The National Academies, more than 600 products involving nanotechnology are already on the market; most of them are health and fitness products such as skin care products and cosmetics (The National Academies, 2008a).\n29. The increase in the proportion of respondents who disagree with this statement may be related to methodological issues, because of the changes in data collection discussed above.\nGlossary\nBiotechnology: The use of living things to make products.

State Indicators\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nTo address the interest of the policy and research communities in the role of science and technology (S&T) in state and regional economic development, this chapter presents findings on state trends in S&T education, the employed workforce, finance, and research and development. This chapter includes 52 indicators for individual states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\nAlthough data for Puerto Rico are reported whenever available, they frequently were collected by a different source, making it unclear whether the methodology used for data collection and analysis is comparable with that used for the states. For this reason, Puerto Rico was neither ranked with the states nor assigned a quartile value that could be displayed on the maps. Data for United States territories and protectorates, such as American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin Islands, were available only on a sporadic basis and for fewer than one-quarter of the indicators and thus are not included.\nThe indicators are designed to present information about various aspects of state S&T infrastructure. The data used to calculate the indicators were gathered from public and private sources. When possible, data covering a 10-year span are provided to identify meaningful trends. However, consistent data were not always available for the 10-year period, and data are given only for the years in which comparisons are appropriate. Most indicators contain data for 2006\u00ad07; some contain data for 2008.\nReady access to accurate and timely information is an important tool for formulating effective S&T policies at the state level. By studying the programs and performance of their peers, state policymakers may be able to better assess and enhance their own programs and performance. Corporations and other organizations considering investments at the state level may also benefit from this information. The tables are intended to provide quantitative data that may be relevant to technology-based economic development. More generally, the chapter aims to foster further consideration of the appropriate uses of state-level indicators.\nTypes of Indicators\nFifty-two indicators are included in this chapter and grouped into the following areas:\n Elementary and secondary education  Higher education  Workforce  Financial R&D inputs  Research and development outputs  S&T in the economy\nThe first two areas address state educational attainment. Student achievement is expressed in terms of performance, which refers to the average state score on a standardized test, and proficiency, which is expressed as the percentage\n\nof students who have achieved at least the expected level of competence on the standardized test.\nComparable state-level performance data are not available for high school students. Instead, mastery of collegelevel material through performance on Advanced Placement Exams has been included as a measure of the skills being developed by the top-performing high school students. Other indicators in education focus on state spending, teacher salaries, student costs, and undergraduate and graduate degrees in S&E. Three indicators measure the level of education in the populations of individual states.\nWorkforce indicators focus on the level of S&E training in the employed labor force. These indicators reflect the higher education level of the labor force and the degree of specialization in S&E disciplines and occupations.\nFinancial indicators address the sources and level of funding for R&D. They show how much R&D is being performed relative to the size of a state's business base. New indicators in this edition focus on state government agency funding for R&D. This section enables readers to compare the extent to which R&D is conducted by industrial, academic, or state agency performers.\nThe final two sections provide measures of outputs. The first focuses on the work products of the academic community. It includes the number of new doctorates conferred, the publication of academic articles, and patent activity from the academic community and from all sources in the state.\nThe second section of output indicators examines the robustness of a region's S&T-related economic activity. These indicators include venture capital activity, Small Business Innovation Research awards, and high-technology business activity. Although data that adequately address both the quantity and quality of R&D results are difficult to find, these indicators offer a reasonable information base.\nData Sources and Considerations\nRaw data for each indicator are presented in the tables. Each table provides an average value for all states, labeled \"United States.\" For most indicators, the state average was calculated by summing the values for the 50 states and the District of Columbia for both the numerator and the denominator and then dividing the two. Any alternate approach is indicated in the notes at the bottom of the table.\nThe values for most indicators are expressed as ratios or percentages to facilitate comparison between states that differ substantially in size. For example, an indicator of higher education achievement is not defined as the absolute number of degrees conferred in a state because sparsely populated states are unlikely to have or need as extensive a higher education system as states with larger populations. Instead, the indicator is defined as the number of degrees per number of residents in the college-age cohort, which measures the intensity of educational services relative to the size of the resident population.\nReaders must exercise caution when evaluating the indicator values for the District of Columbia. Frequently, the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-7\n\nindicator value for the District of Columbia is appreciably different from the indicator values for any of the states. The District of Columbia is unique because it is an urban region with a large federal presence and many universities. In addition, it has a large student population and provides employment for many individuals who live in neighboring states. Indicator values can be quite different depending on whether data attributed to the District of Columbia are based on where people live or where they work.\nKey Elements for Indicators\nSix key elements are provided for each indicator. The first element is a map color-coded to show in which quartile each state placed on that indicator for the latest year that data were available. This helps the reader quickly grasp geographic patterns. The sample map below shows the outline of each state. On the indicator maps, the darkest color indicates states that rank in the first or highest quartile, and white indicates states that rank in the fourth or lowest quartile. Crosshatching indicates states for which no data are available.\nThe second element is a quartiles table. States are listed alphabetically by quartile. The range of indicator values for\n\nthat quartile is shown at the top of the column. Ties at quartile breaks were resolved by moving the tied states into one quartile. All of the indicators are broad measures, and several rely on sample estimates that have a margin of error. Small differences in state values generally carry little useful information.\nIn 1978, Congress initiated the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the National Science Foundation to build R&D capacity in states that have historically been less competitive in receiving federal R&D funding. Subsequently, several federal agencies established similar programs, the largest of which is the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program at the National Institutes of Health.\nThe quartiles table identifies states in the EPSCoR group--those identified as eligible for EPSCoR-like programs by least five federal agencies or departments. The 24 EPSCoR states are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia,\n\nFigure 8-A U.S. map and list of abbreviations\n\nWA\nOR ID\n\nMT WY\n\nNV\n\nUT\n\nCA\n\nCO\n\nAZ\n\nNM\n\nAK\n\nND SD\nNE KS OK\nTX\n\nMN WI\nIA IL\nMO\nAR MS\nLA\n\nVT NH ME\n\nNY MI\n\nPA\n\nOH IN\nWV VA\nKY\n\nNC TN\n\nSC\n\nAL\n\nGA\n\nMA CT RI NJ\nDE\nMD\nDC\n\nFL\n\nHI\n\nAK........

The EPSCoR Program is discussed further in chapter 5, \"Academic Research and Development,\" in the sidebar \"EPSCoR: The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\" The remaining 26 states are considered states in the non-EPSCoR group.\nThe third element, at the bottom of the map box, is a short citation for the data source. The full citation appears under the table on the facing page.\nThe fourth element, in a shaded box on the lower left side of the page, is a summary of findings that includes the national average and comments on national and state trends and patterns for the particular indicator. Although most of the findings are directly related to the data, some represent interpretations that are meant to stimulate further investigation and discussion.\nThe fifth element, on the lower right side of the page, is a description of the indicator and includes information pertaining to the underlying data.\nThe final element is the data table, which appears on the facing page. Up to three years of data and the calculated values of the indicator are presented for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is included in the data table only when data are available.\nFor selected indicators, the data table has been expanded to include the average data and indicator value for the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and the averages for the EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR states. These averages have been calculated in two ways. The first two lines, \"EPSCoR states\" and \"Non-EPSCoR states,\" treat each group as a single geographical unit, ignoring the division of that unit into separate states. The ratio for the group is calculated by totaling the numerator value of each of the states in the group and the denominator value of each of the states in the group and dividing to compute an average. For example, the EPSCoR states average of R&D by gross domestic product by state is calculated by summing the R&D of all the EPSCoR states, summing the gross domestic product of these states, and dividing to compute an average. States with more R&D and a larger gross domestic product affect this average more than smaller ones do, just as data on California affect U.S. totals more than data on Wyoming do.\nThe third and fourth lines, \"Average EPSCoR state value\" and \"Average non-EPSCoR state value,\" represent the average of the individual state ratios for an indicator. The average EPSCoR state value for R&D by gross domestic product by state is calculated by summing the ratios for the 24 EPSCoR states and dividing by 24. All state ratios count equally in this computation.\n\nHigh-Technology Industries\nTo define high-technology industries, this chapter uses a modification of the approach employed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (Hecker 2005). BLS's approach is based on the intensity of high-technology employment within an industry.\nHigh-technology occupations include scientific, engineering, and technician occupations. These occupations employ workers who possess an in-depth knowledge of the theories and principles of science, engineering, and mathematics, which is generally acquired through postsecondary education in some field of technology. An industry is considered a hightechnology industry if employment in technology-oriented occupations accounts for a proportion of that industry's total employment that is at least twice the 4.9% average for all industries (i.e., 9.8% or higher).\nIn this chapter, the category \"high-technology industries\" refers only to private sector businesses. In contrast, BLS includes the \"Federal Government, excluding Postal Service\" in its listing of high-technology industries.\nEach industry is defined by a four-digit code that is based on the listings in the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The 2002 NAICS codes contain a number of additions and changes from the previous 1997 NAICS codes that were used to classify business establishments in data sets covering the period 1998\u00ad2002, and therefore cannot be applied to data sets from earlier years.\nThe list of high-technology industries used in this chapter includes the 46 four-digit codes from the 2002 NAICS listing shown in table 8-A.\nAppendix Tables\nAdditional data tables pertaining to the indicators in this chapter have been included in the appendix. These tables provide supplemental information to assist the reader in evaluating the data used in an indicator. The appendix tables contain state-level data on the performance of students in different racial/ethnic and gender groups on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) evaluations. Additional data on the coefficient of variation for data sources in the chapter also are presented in the appendix tables when they are available.\nReference\nHecker D. 2005.

The NAEP mathematics assessment is a federally authorized measure of student performance in which all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated in 2007.\nStudent performance is presented in terms of average scores on a scale from 0 to 500. Higher scores indicate that fourth graders are demonstrating a stronger foundation for adult mathematics competency. An average score designated as NA (not available) indicates that the state either did not participate in the assessment or did not have a representative sample of fourth graders that was large enough for reporting state-level results.\nNAEP allows students with disabilities or limited English-language proficiency to use certain accommodations (e.g., extended time, individual testing, or small group testing). All data presented here represent scores from tests taken with accommodations offered.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-1 Average fourth grade mathematics performance, by state: 2000, 2005, and 2007\n(Score out of 500)\n\nState\nUnited States...................................................................

Several states more than doubled the percentage of their students performing at or above the proficient level.\nU\u00ca \"v\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca{\u00a3\u00ca\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3`V\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00cc>\u00cc\u00ca\u00ab>\u00c0\u00ccV\u00ab>\u00cci`\u00ca\u00caL\u00cc\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca 2000 and 2007 assessments, all showed significant increases in mathematics proficiency levels for public school fourth graders in 2007.\nU\u00ca The states with the highest percentages of fourthgraders who were proficient in mathematics are concentrated in the northern United States. A number of EPSCoR states were included in this group.\nU\u00ca Substantial differences in mathematics proficiency exist among racial/ethnic groups of fourth graders. The gaps increased between 2000 and 2007 as blacks and Hispanics failed to match the gains made in mathematics proficiency by whites. The gender gap among fourth graders is much smaller and remained unchanged between 2000 and 2007.\n\nThis indicator represents the proportion of a state's fourth grade students in public schools that has met or exceeded the proficiency standard in mathematics.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a federally authorized measure of student performance in mathematics. The National Assessment Governing Board sets performance standards that provide a context for interpreting NAEP results. The standards define \"proficiency\" as well as performance levels that indicate greater (\"advanced\") and lesser (\"basic\") accomplishment. For the fourth grade, the proficient level (scores 249\u00ad281) represents solid academic performance and demonstrates competency over challenging subjectmatter knowledge, its application to real-world situations, and mastery of appropriate analytical skills. The advanced level (282\u00ad500) signifies superior performance. The basic level (214\u00ad248) denotes partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are prerequisite for proficient work.\nApproximately 198,000 fourth grade students in 7,800 schools participated in the 2007 NAEP mathematics assessment. A designation of NA (not available) indicates that the state either did not participate in the assessment or did not have a representative sample of fourth graders that was large enough for reporting state-level results.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-2 Students reaching proficiency in fourth grade mathematics, by state: 2000, 2005, and 2007\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States..................................................................

The standards define \"proficiency\" as well as performance levels that indicate greater (\"advanced\") and lesser (\"basic\") accomplishment.

The advanced level (205\u00ad300) signifies superior performance. The basic level (138\u00ad169) denotes partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are prerequisite for proficient work. A National Academy of Sciences panel evaluated the process used to establish the standards for the science assessment and urged that they be considered developmental and interpreted with caution.\nApproximately 147,700 fourth grade students in 8,500 schools participated in the 2005 NAEP science assessment.

A number of EPSCoR states were included in this group.\nU\u00ca The nationwide percentage of students who performed at or above the proficient level in science was identical for fourth and eighth graders in 2005.\n\nThis indicator represents the proportion of a state's eighth grade students in public schools that has met or exceeded the proficiency standard in science.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a federally authorized measure of student performance in science. The National Assessment Governing Board sets performance standards that provide a context for interpreting NAEP results. The standards define \"proficiency\" as well performance levels that indicate greater (\"advanced\") and lesser (\"basic\") accomplishment. For the eighth grade, the proficient level (scores 170\u00ad207) represents solid academic performance and demonstrates competency over challenging subject-matter knowledge, its application to real-world situations, and mastery of appropriate analytical skills. The advanced level (208\u00ad300) signifies superior performance. The basic level (143\u00ad169) denotes partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are prerequisite for proficient work. A National Academy of Sciences panel evaluated the process used to establish the standards for the science assessment and urged that they be considered developmental and interpreted with caution.\nApproximately 143,400 eighth grade students in 6,400 schools participated in the 2005 NAEP science assessment. A designation of NA (not available) indicates that the state either did not participate in the assessment or did not have a representative sample of eighth graders that was large enough for reporting state-level results.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-8 Students reaching proficiency in eighth grade science, by state: 2000 and 2005\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States.....................................................................

Average teacher salaries remained essentially flat when expressed in constant dollars.\nU\u00ca The highest salaries for teachers are found in states with a high cost of living.\nU\u00ca Teachers in EPSCoR states tended to receive lower average salaries, placing them predominantly in the bottom half of the state rankings.\nU\u00ca High salaries for public school teachers do not necessarily correspond to high student achievement scores on the NAEP mathematics and science tests.\n\nThis indicator measures the average base salary of all fulltime public school teachers. The year is the end date of the academic year. For example, 2007 data represent salaries for the 2006\u00ad07 academic year. The figures (given in current dollars) include salaries for teachers with varying amounts of teaching experience and various kinds and levels of formal education.\nPublic school teacher salaries may reflect a range of factors, including the value that the state places on primary and secondary education, the state's cost of living, the teachers' experience and education level, and the local supply and demand in the job market. Relatively low teacher salaries may hinder recruitment into the teaching profession.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-27\n\nTable 8-9 Public school teacher salaries, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n(Dollars)\n\nState\nUnited States..........................................................................................

See table 8-10.\n\nFindings\nU The 2007 national average for spending on elementary and secondary education was 3.48% of the GDP, a slight increase from 3.28% in 1997. Among individual states, the value for this indicator ranged from 2.34% to 5.28% of the state's GDP in 2007, indicating that some states were directing a much higher percentage of their resources toward elementary and secondary education.\nU\u00ca Spending for elementary and secondary public education as a share of the state's GDP decreased in 16 states and the District of Columbia during the 1997\u00ad2007 period.\nU\u00ca States that spent the highest percentage of their GDP on elementary and secondary education are located in the eastern region of the United States. A number of EPSCoR states were included in this group.\n\nThis indicator measures the relative amount of resources that local, state, and federal governments direct toward public education in prekindergarten through grade 12. It is calculated by dividing the current expenditures of elementary and secondary public schools by the state's gross domestic product (GDP). Current expenditures include instruction and instruction-related costs, student support service, administration, and operations and exclude funds for school construction and other capital outlays, debt service, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education. State and local support represent the largest sources of funding for elementary and secondary education.\nFinancial data on public elementary and secondary education are reported by the National Center for Education Statistics, Department of Education. These data are part of the National Public Education Financial Survey and are included in the 2007 Common Core of Data, a comprehensive annual national statistical database that covers approximately 97,000 public elementary and secondary schools and 18,000 school districts in the United States. Current expenditures are expressed in actual dollars and their data year is the end date of the academic year. For example, current expenditure data for 2007 represent expenditures for the 2006\u00ad07 academic year. GDP data refer to the 2007 calendar year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-29\n\nTable 8-10 Elementary and secondary public school current expenditures as share of gross domestic

Several states that ranked in the lower two quartiles of this indicator ranked in the upper quartiles of the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicators\n\nThis indicator measures the amount that local, state, and federal governments spend on elementary and secondary education, adjusted for the size of the student body. It is calculated by dividing the current expenditures over the entire academic year for prekindergarten through grade 12 by the number of students in those grades in public schools. Current expenditures represent amounts spent on the day-to-day operations of schools and school districts. They include expenditures for instruction and instruction-related costs, student support services, administration, and operations and exclude funds for school construction and other capital outlays, debt service, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education.\nDuring the 2006\u00ad07 school year, 65.8% of current expenses were used for instructional costs, 5.3% for student support services, 10.8% for administrative costs, and 18.0% for operational costs.\nThe number of pupils enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12 is determined during the fall of the academic year. All figures represent actual spending and have not been adjusted for inflation. The year is the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2007 represent costs for the 2006\u00ad07 academic year.\nCurrent expenditures per pupil do not take into account the cost of living in a state, which could affect the amount of goods and services that can be purchased.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-31\n\nTable 8-11 Current expenditures per pupil for elementary and secondary public schools, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States.................

Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia exceeded the 2000 national average in 2008, compared with 15 states and the District of Columbia that exceeded the national average in 2000.\nU\u00ca AP participation levels were higher for all \u00d5\u00c0\u00c3`V\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4n\u00ca\u00cc>\u00ca\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00b0\u00ca\u00c0>\u00c3>\u00c3\u00ca showed the largest increase, with the class of 2008 exceeding the participation of the class of 2000 by more than 25 percentage points. Many of the EPSCoR states had the lowest AP Exam participation rates.\n\nParticipation in the Advanced Placement (AP) program provides a measure of the extent to which a rigorous curriculum is available to and used by high school students. This indicator measures the percentage of students in the graduating class who have taken one or more AP Exams. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of students in the graduating class who have taken at least one AP Exam by the total number of students in the graduating class.\nThroughout the United States, nearly 758,000 public school students from the class of 2008 took nearly 2.2 million AP Exams during their high school careers. Generally, students who take AP Exams have completed a rigorous course of study in a specific subject area in high school with the expectation of obtaining college credit or advanced placement. AP Exams were taken most frequently in U.S. history, English literature and composition, English language and composition, calculus AB, and U.S. government and politics.\nIn the 50 states and the District of Columbia, students from the class of 2008 attended 12,323 U.S. public schools that participated in the AP program. This represented 79% of the public high schools in the United States. These schools make an average of 10 different AP courses available to their students.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-12 Share of public high school students taking Advanced Placement Exams, by state: 2000, 2004, and 2008\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States.............................................

For the class of 2008, this percentage ranged from a high of 23.4% to a low of 3.7% across states. Some of this variation occurs because opportunities for advanced work are more readily available to students in certain states.\nU\u00ca 6>\u00d5i\u00c3\u00cav\u00ca\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca`V>\u00cc\u00c0\u00ca\u00dci\u00c0i\u00ca}i\u00c0\u00cav\u00c0\u00ca>\u00ca\u00d5\u00c0\u00c3`V\u00cc\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4n\u00ca than in 2000. Although two of the three states with the largest increase in performance for the class of 2008 were EPSCoR states, most of the EPSCoR states ranked in the lower quartiles.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the extent to which high school students are successfully demonstrating mastery of college-level material. It is defined as the percentage of U.S. public high school graduates who have scored 3 or higher on at least one Advanced Placement (AP) Exam. Many colleges and universities grant college credit or advanced placement for AP Exam grades of 3 or higher. A high value on this indicator shows the extent to which students have been offered access to rigorous coursework and successfully mastered its requirements.\nA total of 37 different AP Exams are offered each spring by the College Board. The exams are scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 3 representing work equivalent to college-level performance ranging from midlevel B to midlevel C. To prepare for the AP Exam in a subject area, most students enroll in an AP class that employs a curriculum of high academic intensity. Performance on AP Exams is considered one of the best predictors of success in college by many colleges and universities.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-13 Share of public high school students scoring 3 or higher on at least one Advanced Placement Exam, by state: 2000, 2004, and 2008\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States...................................................

States in close proximity to the southern border of the United States tended to rank lowest on this indicator.\n\nThis indicator represents the percentage of the early\u00admidcareer population that has earned at least a high school credential. The indicator displays results based on where high school graduates live rather than where they were educated. High values indicate a resident population and potential workforce with widespread basic education credentials.\nEstimates of educational attainment have been developed by the Census Bureau, which bases them on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but ACS provides annual data on the characteristics of the population and where they live.\nIn 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are developed by the Census Bureau through the Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-37\n\nTable 8-14 High school graduates or higher among individuals 25\u00ad44 years old, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

Between 1997 and 2007, the number of bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old in the population has increased by 8% nationwide.\nU\u00ca In 2007, state values on this indicator varied greatly. They ranged from 89.9 to 20.7 bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old.\nU\u00ca \u00ca\u00a3\u00d3\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00c3\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca\f\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0V\u00cc\u00cav\u00ca Columbia, fewer bachelor's degrees were conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old in 2007 than in 1997.\n\nEarning a bachelor's degree gives people greater opportunities to work in higher-paying jobs than are generally available to those with less education. It also prepares them for advanced education. In addition, the presence of higher education institutions that produce such degrees may generate resources for the state. The cohort 18\u00ad24 years old was chosen to approximate the age range of most students who are pursuing an undergraduate degree.\nAlthough the number of bachelor's degrees awarded is based on an actual count, the population ages 18\u00ad24 years is an estimate developed by the Census Bureau in the Population Estimates Program, which relies on the Decennial Census. Small differences in the indicator value between states or across time generally are not meaningful.\nA high value for this indicator may suggest the successful provision of educational opportunity at this level. Student mobility after graduation, however, may make this indicator less meaningful in predicting the qualifications of a state's future workforce. A state's value for this indicator may also be high when its higher education system draws a large percentage of out-of-state students, a situation that sometimes occurs in states with small resident populations and the District of Columbia.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-39\n\nTable 8-15 Bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-16.\n\nFindings\nU Between 1997 and 2007, the value of this indicator did not change appreciably.\nU\u00ca In 2007, the value of this indicator ranged from 15.4 to 3.7 bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old for individual states.\nU\u00ca States that ranked in the top two quartiles on this indicator were generally the same as those in the top two quartiles for the number of bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states were uniformly distributed throughout the four quartiles of the state ranking, indicating that in spite of the lack of a large, federally supported research structure, institutions in these states do provide college-level training in NS&E fields.\n\nNatural sciences and engineering (NS&E) fields include the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, and computer sciences; mathematics; and engineering. NS&E fields exclude social sciences and psychology. The ratio of new NS&E bachelor's degrees to the population ages18\u00ad24 years indicates the extent to which a state prepares young people to enter the types of technology-intensive occupations that are fundamental to a knowledge-based, technology-driven economy. In addition, the presence of higher education institutions that produce such degrees may generate resources for the state. The cohort 18\u00ad24 years old was chosen to approximate the age range of most students who are pursing an undergraduate degree.\nAlthough the number of NS&E bachelor's degrees awarded is based on an actual count, the population ages 18\u00ad24 years is an estimate developed by the Census Bureau in the Population Estimates Program, which relies on the Decennial Census. Small differences in the value of the indicator between states or across time generally are not meaningful.\nBecause students often relocate after graduation, this measure does not necessarily indicate the qualifications of a state's future workforce. A state's value for this indicator may also be high when its higher education system draws a large percentage of out-of-state students to study in NS&E fields, a situation that sometimes occurs in states with small resident populations and the District of Columbia.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-41\n\nTable 8-16 Bachelor's degrees in natural sciences and engineering conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nEPSCoR states ................\nNon-EPSCoR states........

See table 8-17.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, nearly 686,000 S&E bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees were conferred nationwide, an increase of nearly 27% during the past decade.\nU\u00ca The proportion of S&E degrees as a share of total degrees conferred did not show any substantial changes between 1997 and 2007.\nU\u00ca There are noteworthy differences in the proportions of technical higher education degrees conferred in different states. In some states, more than 40% of higher education degrees were awarded in technical fields. In others, only about 20% of higher education degrees were awarded in technical fields.\nU\u00ca States in which the highest percentages of higher education degrees were conferred in technical fields tended to be located in the western United States.\nU\u00ca The District of Columbia has a high value because of the large number of programs in political science and public administration at several of its academic institutions.\n\nThis indicator is a measure of the extent to which a state's higher education programs are concentrated in S&E fields. The indicator is expressed as the percentage of higher education degrees that were conferred in S&E fields.\nS&E fields include the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Counts of both S&E degrees and higher education degrees conferred include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees; associate's degrees are excluded.\nDegree data reflect the location of the degree-granting institution, not the state where degree-earning students permanently reside. The year indicates the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2007 represent degrees conferred during the 2006\u00ad07 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-43\n\nTable 8-17 S&E degrees as share of higher education degrees conferred, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-18.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, nearly 376,000 NS&E bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees were conferred nationwide, an increase of nearly 25% during the past decade.\nU\u00ca The proportion of NS&E degrees as a share of total degrees conferred showed an 8% decline between 2002 and 2007.\nU\u00ca There are noteworthy differences in the proportions of natural science or engineering higher education degrees conferred in different states. In 2007, the proportions ranged between 35% and 11%.\nU\u00ca States with the highest percentage of higher education degrees in natural science or engineering fields tended to be located in the western United States, and four of the top five are EPSCoR states.\n\nThis indicator is a measure of the extent to which a state's higher education programs are concentrated in natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) fields. The indicator is expressed as the percentage of higher education degrees that were conferred in NS&E fields.\nNS&E fields include the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, and computer sciences; mathematics; and engineering. Social sciences such as anthropology, economics, political science and public administration, psychology, and sociology are not included. Counts of both NS&E degrees and higher education degrees conferred include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees; associate's degrees are excluded.\nDegree data reflect the location of the degree-granting institution, not the state in which degree-earning students permanently reside. The year reflects the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2007 represent degrees conferred during the 2006\u00ad07 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-45\n\nTable 8-18 Natural sciences and engineering degrees as share of higher education degrees conferred, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

Other states with sizeable increases included Texas, New York, Florida, and Minnesota.\n\nGraduate students in S&E fields may become the technical leaders of the future. The ratio of S&E graduate students to a state's population ages 25\u00ad34 years old is a relative measure of a state's population with graduate training in S&E. Graduate students are counted on the basis of their university enrollment and include state residents, residents of other states, and noncitizens. The cohort 25\u00ad34 years old was chosen to approximate the age of most graduate students. This population cohort includes all state residents ages 25\u00ad34 and does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens.\nData on S&E graduate students were collected by surveying all academic institutions in the United States that offer doctoral or master's degree programs in any S&E field, including the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Graduate students enrolled in schools of nursing, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and other healthrelated disciplines are not included.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-47\n\nTable 8-19 S&E graduate students per 1,000 individuals 25\u00ad34 years old, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nS&E graduate students\n\nPopulation 25\u00ad34 years old\n\nS&E graduate students/1,000 individuals 25\u00ad34 years old\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-20.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, more than 150,000 advanced S&E degrees were awarded nationwide. This total represented approximately 26% more degrees than were awarded in 1997. However, the share of advanced degrees remained stable as a percentage of all S&E degrees conferred.\nU\u00ca In 2007, some states provided more extensive graduate-level technical training, with nearly 34% of their S&E graduates V\u00abi\u00cc}\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0>}\u00ca>\u00cc\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca>\u00c3\u00cci\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca`V\u00cc\u00c0>\u00cai\u00dbi\u00c6\u00ca\u00cci\u00c0\u00ca states had much smaller graduate S&E programs, with values as low as 8%.\nU\u00ca The largest absolute increases in the production of advanced S&E degree holders between 1997 and 2007 occurred in California, Illinois, Texas, and New York.\nU\u00ca In states with few S&E graduate programs, the number of advanced S&E degrees conferred varies considerably from year to year. Readers should use caution when making annual comparisons for those states with small S&E graduate programs\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's higher education programs in S&E are concentrated at the graduate level. S&E fields include the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Advanced S&E degrees include master's and doctoral degrees. Total S&E degrees include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees but exclude associate's degrees.\nThe indicator value is computed by dividing the number of advanced S&E degrees by the total number of S&E degrees awarded by the higher education institutions within the state.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-49\n\nTable 8-20 Advanced S&E degrees as share of S&E degrees conferred, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

This total represented approximately 26% more than were awarded in 1997, but the share of advanced degrees remained stable as a percentage of all NS&E degrees conferred.\nU\u00ca In 2007, some states provided more extensive graduate-level training in NS&E, with nearly 37% of their NS&E graduates V\u00abi\u00cc}\u00ca\u00cc\u00c0>}\u00ca>\u00cc\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca>\u00c3\u00cci\u00c0\u00bd\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca`V\u00cc\u00c0>\u00cai\u00dbi\u00c6\u00ca\u00cci\u00c0\u00ca states had much smaller graduate NS&E programs, with values as low as 12%.\nU\u00ca The largest absolute increases in the production of advanced NS&E degree holders between 1997 and 2007 occurred in California and Texas.\nU\u00ca In states with few NS&E graduate programs, the number of advanced NS&E degrees conferred varies considerably from year to year. Readers should use caution when making annual comparisons for those states with small NS&E graduate programs.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's higher education programs in natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) are concentrated at the graduate level. NS&E fields include the physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, and computer sciences; mathematics; and engineering. Social sciences including anthropology, economics, political science and public administration, psychology, and sociology are not included. Advanced NS&E degrees include master's and doctoral degrees. Total NS&E degrees include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees but exclude associate's degrees.\nThe indicator value is computed by dividing the number of advanced NS&E degrees by the total number of NS&E degrees awarded by the higher education institutions within the state.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-51\n\nTable 8-21 Advanced natural sciences and engineering degrees as share of natural sciences and engineering degrees conferred, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...................

In several states, undergraduate charges more than doubled during this period.\nU\u00ca In 2008, the state average for a year of undergraduate education at a public 4-year institution ranged from a low of $9,479 to a high of $19,548.\nU\u00ca Tuition and required fees averaged 44% of the total charges at public 4-year institutions in 2008, but individual states had different cost structures.\n\nThe average annual charge for an undergraduate student to attend a public 4-year academic institution is one indicator of how accessible higher education is to a state's students. The annual charge includes standard in-state charges for tuition, required fees, room, and board for a full-time undergraduate student who is a resident of that state. These charges were weighted by the number of full-time undergraduates attending each public institution within the state. The total charge for all public 4-year institutions in the state was divided by the total number of full-time undergraduates attending all public 4-year institutions in the state. The year is the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2008 represent costs for the 2007\u00ad08 academic year.\nTo improve educational attainment, the federal government, state governments, and academic institutions provide various kinds of financial aid that reduce the charge to students. The data in this indicator do not include any adjustments for such financial aid.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\nTable 8-22 Average undergraduate charge at public 4-year institutions, by state: 1998, 2003, and 2008\n(Dollars)\n\nState\nUnited States.............................................

It is calculated by dividing the average undergraduate charge at all public 4-year institutions in the state by the per capita disposable personal income of state residents. The average undergraduate charge includes standard in-state tuition, room, board, and required fees for a student who is a resident of the state. The year is the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2008 represent costs for the 2007\u00ad08 academic year.\nDisposable personal income is the income available to state residents for spending or saving. It is calculated as personal income minus personal current taxes paid to federal, state, and local governments.\nHigh values indicate that a year of undergraduate education consumes a high percentage of the disposable personal income of state residents. However, the data in this indicator do not include any adjustment for financial aid that a student might receive.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-55\n\nTable 8-23 Average undergraduate charge at public 4-year institutions as share of disposable personal income, by state: 1998, 2003, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-24.\n\nFindings\nU The total amount of state financial aid from grants provided to undergraduates rose nationwide from $3.0 billion in 1997 to $7.3 billion in 2007.\nU\u00ca On a per-student basis, state funding for student grants across the United States increased from $568 per undergraduate in 1997 to $1,029 per undergraduate in 2007 (in current dollars).\nU\u00ca The amount of financial assistance provided by states and the District of Columbia varied greatly in 2007.

Four states reported spending less, in current dollars, per student for student financial aid in 2007 than in 1997, even though the cost of undergraduate education rose rapidly during this period. Three of these four states provided less than $100 per student.\n\nThe cost of an undergraduate education can be reduced with financial assistance from the state or federal government or from an academic institution. This indicator is calculated by dividing the amount of financial support from state grants by the number of full-time undergraduate students who attend both public and private institutions in the state. A high value is one indicator of state efforts to provide access to higher education at a time of escalating undergraduate costs. The actual distribution of state grants to individual students may be affected by the percentage of undergraduates who are state residents.\nThis indicator should be viewed relative to the tuition charged to undergraduates in a state, as some states have chosen to subsidize tuition for all students at public institutions rather than provide grants. Other differences between states (such as the amount of scholarship aid available from other sources, the percentage of students attending out-of-state institutions, and their eligibility for state funding) mean that readers should exercise caution when making comparisons between states and examining changes over time.\nTotal state grant expenditures for financial aid include need-based and nonneed-based grants. State assistance through subsidized or unsubsidized loans and awards to students at the graduate and first professional degree levels is not included. The year is the end date of the academic year. For example, data for 2007 represent costs for the 2006\u00ad07 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-57\n\nTable 8-24 State expenditures on student aid per full-time undergraduate student, by state: 1997, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States.................

That degree may be an associate's, bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. The indicator represents where college degree holders live rather than where they were educated. The age cohort of 25\u00ad44 years represents the group most likely to have completed a college program.\nEstimates of educational attainment are developed by the Census Bureau based on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but ACS provides annual data on the characteristics of population and housing. In 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are taken from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-59\n\nTable 8-25 Associate's degree holders or higher among individuals 25\u00ad44 years old, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States.................

The highest percentages tended to be found in the New England and Middle Atlantic states.\nU\u00ca States with the lowest cost of living tended to rank lowest on this indicator.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to be clustered in the lower quartiles for this indicator. However, several northern EPSCoR states showed high values.\n\nThis indicator represents the percentage of the early- to mid-career population that has earned at least a 4-year undergraduate degree. That degree may be at the bachelor's, master's, or doctoral level. The indicator represents where college degree holders live rather than where they were educated. The age cohort of 25\u00ad44 years represents a group of individuals who are potential long-term participants in a state's workforce.\nEstimates of educational attainment are developed by the Census Bureau based on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but ACS provides annual data on the characteristics of population and housing. In 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are taken from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n

See table 8-27.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, 47 million individuals between ages 25 and 64 held bachelor's degrees in the United States, up from 39 million in 2000. Nationwide, the ratio of bachelor's degree holders to the size of the workforce rose from 28.5% in 2000 to 30.8% in 2007. This ratio varied considerably among the states, ranging from 22.2% to 42.6% in 2007.\nU\u00ca The value of this indicator increased in most \u00d5\u00c0\u00c3`V\u00cc\u00c3\u00caLi\u00cc\u00dcii\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00ca>`\u00ca\u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c7\u00b0\u00ca/\u00c3\u00ca increase may reflect a replacement of older cohorts of workers with younger, more educated ones. It may also indicate the restructuring of state economies to emphasize work that requires a higher level of education or credentials.\nU\u00ca The geographic distribution of bachelor's degree holders bears little resemblance to any of the degree production indicators, which may be indicative of the considerable mobility of the college-educated population in the United States.\n\nThe ratio of degree holders (bachelor's, graduate, or professional) to the population potentially available for work is an indicator of the concentration of individuals with higher education qualifications in a jurisdiction. This indicator does not imply that all degree holders are currently employed; rather, it indicates the educational level of the workforce if all degree holders were employed. Knowledge-intensive businesses seeking to relocate may be attracted to states with high values on this indicator. Workers with at least a bachelor's degree have a clear advantage over less-educated workers in expected lifetime earnings.\nDegree data are based on the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 Decennial Census and American Community Survey and are limited to individuals 25\u00ad64 years old, the age range most representative of a jurisdiction's workforce. Individuals younger than age 25 are considered to be in the process of completing their education. Individuals older than 64 are considered to be largely retired, so their educational attainment would have limited applicability to the quality of the workforce. Civilian workforce data are Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates of employed persons based on Local Area Unemployment Statistics. Estimates for jurisdictions with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for jurisdictions with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-63\n\nTable 8-27 Bachelor's degree holders potentially in the workforce, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2007\n\nBachelor's degree holders 25\u00ad64 years old\n\nEmployed workforce\n\nState\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2007\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2007\n\nUnited States..................

A high value for this indicator shows that a state's economy has a high percentage of technical jobs relative to other states.\nS&E occupations are defined by standard occupational codes. They include engineers and computer, mathematical, life, physical, and social scientists. They exclude managers, technicians, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel.\nState data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. The survey is conducted as part of a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. State data on the size of the civilian workforce are BLS estimates based on the Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a state based on where they live.\nSituations in which workers live in one state and work in another introduce some imprecision into the calculation of this indicator. The treatment of postsecondary teachers is another source of imprecision. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations. Estimates for jurisdictions with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for jurisdictions with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-65\n\nTable 8-28 Individuals in S&E occupations as share of workforce, by state: 2004, 2006, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States..................

These individuals often conduct R&D, manage R&D activities, or are otherwise engaged in knowledge-intensive activities. A high value for this indicator in a state suggests employment opportunities for individuals with highly advanced training in S&E fields.\nData on employed S&E doctorate holders include those with doctoral degrees in computer and mathematical sciences; the biological, agricultural, or environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; psychology; engineering; and health fields. S&E doctorate data derive from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which excludes individuals with doctorates from foreign institutions and those above the age of 75. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a sample survey. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations. Data for S&E doctorate holders are presented by employment location regardless of residence.\nCivilian workforce data are Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics, which bases location on residence. Workforce data represent annual estimates of the employed civilian labor force; estimates are not seasonally adjusted.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-67\n\nTable 8-29 Employed S&E doctorate holders as share of workforce, by state: 1997, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States..................

Between 2004 and 2008, the percentage of the workforce employed in engineering occupations remained unchanged at 1.06%.\nU\u00ca The concentration of engineers in individual states ranged from 0.54% to 1.87% in 2008.\nU\u00ca The states with the highest percentage of engineers in their workforces were centers of automobile and aircraft manufacturing.\nU\u00ca States ranking highest on this indicator also ranked high on employment in high-technology establishments as share of total employment.\n\nThis indicator shows the representation of trained engineers in a state's workforce. Engineers design and operate production processes and create new products and services. The indicator encompasses the standard occupational codes for engineering fields: aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer hardware, electrical and electronics, environmental, industrial, marine and naval architectural, materials, mechanical, mining and geological, nuclear, and petroleum.\nState data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. The survey is conducted as part of a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. State data on the size of the civilian workforce are BLS estimates based on the Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a state based on where they live.\nSituations in which workers live in one state and work in another introduce some imprecision into the calculation of this indicator. The treatment of postsecondary teachers is another source of imprecision. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-69\n\nTable 8-30 Engineers as share of workforce, by state: 2004, 2006, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States..................

Life scientists are identified from standard occupational codes that include agricultural and food scientists, biological scientists, conservation scientists and foresters, and medical scientists. Physical scientists are identified from standard occupational codes that include astronomers, physicists, atmospheric and space scientists, chemists, materials scientists, environmental scientists, and geoscientists. A high share of life and physical scientists in a state's workforce could indicate several scenarios, ranging from a robust cluster of life sciences companies to the presence of forests or national parks, which require foresters, wildlife specialists, and conservationists to manage the natural assets in these areas.\nState data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. The survey is conducted as part of a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. State data on the size of the civilian workforce are BLS estimates based on the Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a state based on where they live.\nSituations in which workers live in one state and work in another introduce some imprecision into the calculation of this indicator. The treatment of postsecondary teachers is another source of imprecision. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations. Estimates for jurisdictions with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for jurisdictions with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-71\n\nTable 8-31 Life and physical scientists as share of workforce, by state: 2004, 2006, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

This may be due to the presence of many government offices, colleges and universities, and government contractors in the area that employ scientists and engineers, especially computer scientists.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to have smaller percentages of computer specialists in their workforces, suggesting that their economies are less technically oriented in this respect.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's workforce makes use of specialists with advanced computer training. Computer specialists are identified from 10 standard occupational codes that include computer and information scientists, programmers, software engineers, support specialists, systems analysts, database administrators, and network and computer system administrators. Higher values may indicate a state workforce that is better able to thrive in an information economy or to embrace and utilize computer technology.\nState data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. The survey is conducted as part of a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. State data on the size of the civilian workforce are BLS estimates based on the Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a state based on where they live.\nSituations in which workers live in one state and work in another introduce some imprecision into the calculation of this indicator. The treatment of postsecondary teachers is another source of imprecision. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-73\n\nTable 8-32 Computer specialists as share of workforce, by state: 2004, 2006, and 2008\n\nComputer specialists\n\nEmployed workforce\n\nState\nEPSCoR states ................\nNon-EPSCoR states........

See table 8-33.\n\nFindings\nU The national value of R&D expenditures as a share of GDP rose slightly between 1998 and 2007, from 2.47% to 2.62%.\nU\u00ca In 2007, state values for this indicator ranged from 0.41% to 7.53%, indicating large differences in the geographic concentration of R&D activity.\nU\u00ca New Mexico, which has large federal R&D activities and a relatively small GDP, is an outlier on this indicator.\nU\u00ca States with high rankings on this indicator also tended to rank high on S&E doctorate holders as a share of the workforce.\nU\u00ca The total R&D performed in states in the EPSCoR group was approximately one-tenth of that performed in states in the nonEPSCoR group. EPSCoR state values on this indicator were more concentrated toward the low end of the distribution than comparable values for the ratio of academic R&D to state GDP.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which R&D plays a role in a state's economy. A high value indicates that a state has a high intensity of R&D activity, which may support future growth in knowledge-based industries. Industries that have a high percentage of R&D activity include pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer equipment and services, electronic components, aerospace, and motor vehicles. R&D refers to R&D activities performed by federal and state agencies, businesses, universities, and nonprofit organizations. In 2007, business performed 72.0% of total R&D at the national level followed by colleges and universities at 13.3%; government facilities, including federally funded R&D centers, at 10.5%; and nonprofit institutions at 4.2%. Data for the value of gross domestic product (GDP) and for R&D expenditures are shown in current dollars.\nThe methodology for assigning industry R&D activity at the state level was modified in 2001, and 1998\u00ad2000 data were recalculated using the new methodology. State-level R&D data from years before 1998 are not comparable.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-75\n\nTable 8-33 R&D as share of gross domestic product, by state: 1998, 2002, and

Higher values were found in the states surrounding the District of Columbia and in sparsely populated states with national laboratories or federal facilities.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to be concentrated in the lower two quartiles of this indicator, showing that many EPSCoR states receive smaller amounts of federal R&D funding than would have been anticipated based on the size of their civilian workforce.\n\nThis indicator shows how federal R&D funding is disbursed geographically relative to the size of a state's civilian workforce. Federal R&D dollars are attributed to the states in which the recipients are located.\nFederal obligations for R&D come from the National Science Foundation Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and include data reported by 11 federal agencies. The Department of Defense (DOD) disburses most--approximately 50%--federal R&D funding. The geographic distribution of DOD development funding to industry reflects the location of prime contractors only, not the subcontractors who perform much of the R&D. A high value may indicate the existence of a number of large prime contractors or major federally funded R&D facilities in a state.\nThe size of a state's civilian workforce is a nonseasonally adjusted annual estimate of employed workers based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-77\n\nTable 8-34 Federal

See table 8-35.\n\nFindings\nU The federal government obligated approximately $111 billion for R&D in 2007-- about $20,000 for each person employed in an S&E occupation.\nU\u00ca The state distribution of federal R&D obligations per person employed in an S&E occupation ranged from $95,724 to $4,394 in 2007.\nU\u00ca The distribution for this indicator was highly skewed in 2007, with only 14 states and the District of Columbia above the national average. High values were reported in the \f\u00c3\u00cc\u00c0V\u00cc\u00cav\u00ca\n\u00d5L>\u00ca>`\u00ca>`}\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00c3\u00ca>`\u00ca >\u00c3\u00ca\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00c3\u00ca\u00dci\u00c0i\u00cavi`i\u00c0>\u00cav>V\u00cci\u00c3\u00ca\u00c0\u00ca>\u00c0\u00ca defense contractors are located.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to rank in the lower two quartiles for this indicator, showing that many EPSCoR states receive smaller amounts of federal R&D funding than would have been anticipated based on the number of S&E workers in the state.\n\nThis indicator describes the relationship between federal R&D spending in a state and the number of employees in the state who work in S&E occupations. Federal R&D dollars are attributed to the states in which the recipients of federal obligations are located.\nFederal obligations for R&D come from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development and include data reported by 11 federal agencies. The Department of Defense (DOD) disburses most--approximately 50%--federal R&D funding. The geographic distribution of DOD development funding to industry reflects the location of prime contractors only, not the numerous subcontractors who perform much of the R&D.\nS&E occupations are defined by standard occupational codes. They include engineers and computer, mathematical, life, physical, and social scientists. They exclude managers, technicians, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel. State data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations.\nData on people in S&E occupations are sample based. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-79\n\nTable 8-35 Federal R&D obligations per individual in S&E occupation, by state: 2003, 2005, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-36.\n\nFindings\nU Nationally, state government agencies spent a total of $1.2 billion on R&D in 2007. This represented $89 for each $1 million of a state's GDP.\nU\u00ca State agency R&D expenditures accounted for 0.34% of total R&D expenditures in 2007, indicating that most R&D was funded by nonstate sources.\nU\u00ca In 2007, the state values for this indicator ranged from $618 per $1 million to $9 per $1 million of state GDP, reflecting varying approaches to the role of state government agencies in the funding of R&D.\nU\u00ca A substantial number of EPSCoR states are among those with the highest values for this indicator, suggesting that there is a statelevel effort to improve R&D infrastructure in \u00cci\u00c3i\u00ca\u00c3\u00cc>\u00cci\u00c3]\u00ca\u00cc\u00ca\u00d5\u00c3\u00cc\u00ca>\u00cavi`i\u00c0>\u00caivv\u00c0\u00cc\u00b0\n\nThis indicator measures the ratio between the amount of state agency R&D funding and the size of a state's economy. State R&D expenditures include state-administered funds from all sources that support R&D performed by either a state agency or an external performer.\nData on state R&D funding come from National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys of state agencies covering 2006 and 2007 expenditures. The data cover funding administered by state government departments, agencies, independent commissions, and other state-run entities. They exclude staterun colleges and universities as well as laboratories or experiment stations controlled by state universities; funding administered by these institutions is classified as academic R&D. The data also exclude state legislatures' direct appropriations to nonstate agencies. Although the surveys are limited to R&D activities, the data may include some expenditures for non-R&D activities such as commercialization, environmental testing, and routine survey work.\nBecause of differences in the survey populations, definition of covered R&D activities, and collection methods, the results of previous NSF surveys on state government R&D are not comparable. Data for the value of gross domestic product (GDP) and for R&D expenditures are shown in current dollars.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-81\n\nTable 8-36 State agency R&D expenditures per $1 million of gross domestic product, by state: 2006 and 2007\n\nState\nEPSCoR states ..........................................

See table 8-37.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, state government agency R&D expenditures averaged $8.42 per civilian worker nationwide.\nU\u00ca State agency R&D funding per civilian worker across the United States was approximately 1% of the $764 in federal R&D obligations per worker in 2007.\nU\u00ca State agency R&D spending per civilian worker varied greatly among the states in 2007, ranging from a high of $69.87 to a low of $0.74.\nU\u00ca A number of EPSCoR states had high values for this indicator.\n\nThis indicator measures the extent of R&D activity funded by state government agencies relative to the size of the state's civilian workforce. State R&D expenditures include state-administered funds from all sources that support R&D performed by either a state agency or an external performer.\nData on state R&D funding come from National Science Foundation surveys of state agencies covering 2006 and 2007 expenditures. The data cover funding administered by state government departments, agencies, independent commissions, and other staterun entities. They exclude state-run colleges and universities as well as laboratories or experiment stations controlled by state universities; funding administered by these institutions is classified as academic R&D. The data also exclude state legislatures' direct appropriations to nonstate agencies. Although the surveys are limited to R&D activities, the data may include some expenditures for non-R&D activities such as commercialization, environmental testing, and routine survey work.\nThe size of a state's civilian workforce is a nonseasonally adjusted annual estimate of employed workers based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-83\n\nTable 8-37 State agency R&D expenditures per civilian worker, by state: 2006 and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...........................

See table 8-38.\n\nFindings\nU In 2007, the average state agency R&D expenditure per person employed in an S&E occupation was $219, indicating that state agency funding for R&D was a very small fraction of total R&D funding.\nU\u00ca Nationally, state government agencies spent about $1.2 billion for R&D in 2007. By comparison, the federal government obligated more than $111 billion for R&D in 2007, about $20,000 for each person employed in an S&E occupation.\nU\u00ca State agency R&D funding per person employed in an S&E occupation ranged from $2,404 to $20 per state in 2007.\nU\u00ca Several EPSCoR states had the highest state agency R&D spending per S&E worker.\n\nThis indicator measures the extent of the R&D activity funded by a state's government agencies relative to the number of individuals engaged in S&E occupations in the state.\nData on state R&D funding come from National Science Foundation surveys of state agencies covering 2006 and 2007 expenditures. The data cover funding administered by state government departments, agencies, independent commissions, and other staterun entities. They exclude state-run colleges and universities as well as laboratories or experiment stations controlled by state universities; funding administered by these institutions is classified as academic R&D. The data also exclude state legislatures' direct appropriations to nonstate agencies. Although the surveys are limited to R&D activities, the data may include some expenditures for non-R&D activities such as commercialization, environmental testing, and routine survey work.\nThe denominator of this indicator measures individuals with bachelor's or higher degrees who work in S&E occupations. S&E occupations are defined by standard occupational codes. They include engineers and computer, mathematical, life, physical, and social scientists. They exclude managers, technicians, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel. State data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, in these data, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-85\n\nTable 8-38 State agency R&D expenditures per individual in S&E occupation, by state: 2006 and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States...........................

See table 8-39.\n\nFindings\nU The amount of R&D performed by business rose from nearly $164 billion in 1998 to about $266 billion in 2007, an increase of more than 60% (in current dollars).\nU\u00ca The value of this indicator exhibited little overall change between 1998 and 2007.\nU\u00ca Business R&D was concentrated in a few states--only 12 states had indicator values that met or exceeded the national average in 2007.\n\nThis indicator measures the role of R&D in a state's business activity. Business R&D focuses on projects that are expected to yield new or improved products, processes, or services and to bring direct benefits to a company. A high value for this indicator shows that the businesses within a state are making a significant investment in their R&D activities.\nBecause industries differ in their reliance on R&D, the indicator reflects state differences in industrial structure as much as the behavior or priorities of individual businesses. Estimates for states with smaller economies are generally less precise than those for states with larger economies.\nThe methodology for making state-level assignments of the business R&D reported by companies with operations in multiple states changed in 1998. Therefore, pre-1998 data on the amount of R&D performed by industry in states are not comparable.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-87\n\nTable 8-39 Business-performed R&D as share of private-industry output, by state: 1998, 2002, and 2007\n\nState\nUnited States.................

Academic R&D is more basic and less productoriented than R&D performed by business. It can be a valuable basis for future economic development. In this indicator, data for Maryland exclude expenditures by the Applied Physics Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University.\nData for the value of gross domestic product (GDP) by state and for R&D expenditures are shown in current dollars.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-89\n\nTable 8-40 Academic R&D per $1,000 of gross domestic product, by state: 1998, 2003, and

See table 8-41.\n\nFindings\nU In 2006, about 29,000 S&E doctorates were awarded by U.S. academic institutions, approximately 19% more than in 2001 and 12% more than in 1997.\nU\u00ca Nationwide, the value of this indicator declined between 1997 and 2006, reflecting an increase in the stock of employed S&E doctorate holders in the United States.\nU\u00ca Low state values on this indicator may indicate either a small S&E graduate-level educational program or a concentration of S&E doctorate-level employment opportunities that attract significant numbers of S&E doctorate holders who were educated elsewhere. Low-ranking EPSCoR states tend to fall into the former category.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the rate at which the states are training new S&E doctorate recipients for entry into the workforce. High values indicate relatively large production of new doctorate holders compared with the existing stock of employed doctorate holders. States with relatively low values may need to attract S&E doctorate holders from elsewhere to meet the needs of local employers.\nData on doctorates conferred and on employed doctorate holders include those in computer sciences; mathematics; the biological, agricultural, or environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; psychology; engineering; and health fields. S&E doctorate data derive from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which excludes individuals with doctorates from foreign institutions and those above the age of 75. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a sample survey. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations. Data for doctorates conferred are presented by the location where the doctorate was earned; data for S&E doctorate holders are presented by employment location regardless of residence.\nThe indicator does not take into account the postgraduation mobility of recent S&E doctorate recipients to their place of employment. Graduate students with temporary visas may decide to return home after graduation to begin their careers. The indicator also does not take into account individuals with non-U.S. S&E doctorates who are working in the United States.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-91\n\nTable 8-41 S&E doctorates conferred per 1,000 employed S&E doctorate holders, by state: 1997, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

Publications are only one measure of academic productivity, which includes trained personnel, patents, and other outputs. A high value on this indicator shows that the S&E faculty in a state's academic institutions are generating a high volume of publications relative to other states. Academic institutions include 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges and universities, medical schools, and university-affiliated research centers. Research is more central to the mission of some of these institutions than others.\nPublication counts are based on the number of articles that appear in a set of journals tracked by Thomson Scientific in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. Academic article output is based on the most recent journal set; data for earlier years may differ slightly from previous publications due to changes in the journal set. Articles with authors from different institutions were counted fractionally. For instance, for a publication with authors at N institutions, each institution would be credited with 1/N of the article.\nS&E doctorates include those in computer sciences; mathematics; the biological, agricultural, or environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; psychology; engineering; and health fields. S&E doctorate data derive from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which excludes those with doctorates from foreign institutions and those above the age of 75. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a sample survey. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations. Data for S&E doctorate holders in academia are presented by employment location regardless of residence.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-93\n\nTable 8-42 Academic S&E article output per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders in academia, by state: 1997, 2003, and 2008/06\n\nState\nEPSCoR states ................\nNon-EPSCoR states........

This partly reflects the effect of general price inflation but may also indicate rising academic research costs.\nU\u00ca Between 1998 and 2008, the value for this indicator decreased in all states but one and by 40% nationwide.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to cluster in the lower quartiles for this indicator.\n\nThis indicator shows the relationship between the number of academic S&E publications and expenditures for academic R&D. A high value for this indicator means that the S&E publications output of a state's academic institutions is high relative to their R&D spending. Academic institutions include 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges and universities, medical schools, and university-affiliated research centers. This indicator is not an efficiency measure; it is affected by the highly variable costs of R&D and by publishing conventions in different fields and institutions. It may also reflect variations in field emphasis among states and institutions.\nPublication counts are based on the number of articles that appear in a set of journals tracked by Thomson Scientific in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. Academic article output is based on the most recent journal set; data for earlier years may differ slightly from previous publications due to changes in the journal set. Articles with authors from different institutions were counted fractionally. For instance, for a publication with authors at N institutions, each institution would be credited with 1/N of the article.\nIn this indicator, Maryland data exclude expenditures by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Johns Hopkins University. APL employs more than 3,000 workers and supports the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other government agencies. It does not focus on academic research.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-95\n\nTable 8-43 Academic S&E article output per $1 million of academic R&D, by state: 1998, 2003, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-44.\n\nFindings\nU Throughout the United States, the number of patents awarded to academic institutions increased from about 2,500 in 1997 to about 3,400 in \u00d3\u00e4\u00e4\u00c8]\u00ca>\u00caV\u00c0i>\u00c3i\u00cav\u00ca\u00ce\u00c8\u00af\u00c6\u00ca\u00cci\u00ca\u00d5Li\u00c0\u00ca of academic S&E doctorate holders rose by 18% during the same period.\nU\u00ca In 2006, 11.6 academic patents were produced nationally for each 1,000 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, slightly higher than the 10.1 patents produced in 1997.\nU\u00ca In 2006, states varied widely on this indicator, with values ranging from 0 to 24.7 patents per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, indicating a difference in patenting philosophy or mix of industries with which these academic institutions deal.\nU\u00ca California showed the highest level of both academic patenting and venture capital investment.\n\nSince the early 1980s, academic institutions have increasingly been viewed as engines of economic growth. Growing attention has been paid to the role of academic R&D in creating new products, processes, and services. One indicator of such R&D results is the volume of academic patents awarded. Academic patenting is highly concentrated and partly reflects the resources devoted to institutional patenting offices.\nThis indicator is an approximate measure of the degree to which results with perceived economic value are generated by the doctoral academic workforce. Academia includes 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges and universities, medical schools, and university-affiliated research centers. Utility patents--commonly known as patents for inventions--include any new, useful, or improved method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound, and represent a key measure of intellectual property.\nS&E doctorates include those in computer sciences; mathematics; biological, agricultural, or environmental life sciences; physical sciences; social sciences; psychology; engineering; and health fields. S&E doctorate data derive from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which excludes those with doctorates from foreign institutions and those above the age of 75. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a sample survey. Estimates for states with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for states with larger populations. Data for S&E doctorate holders are presented by employment location regardless of residence.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-97\n\nTable 8-44 Academic patents awarded per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders in academia, by state: 1997, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

This decline may have been due to fewer patent applications being filed, a reduced capacity of USPTO to process applications and award patents, and/or an increase in the number of individuals working in S&E occupations.\nU\u00ca Idaho typically reports the highest values for this indicator, reflecting the presence of the Department of Energy's highpatenting Idaho National Laboratory. Values for the remaining states ranged from 35.4 to 1.5.\nU\u00ca Nearly 25% of all 2008 U.S. utility patents were awarded to residents of California.\n\nThis indicator shows state patent activity normalized to the number of employees in S&E occupations. People in S&E occupations include computer, mathematical, life, physical, and social scientists; engineers; and postsecondary teachers in any of these fields. Managers, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel are excluded.\nThis indicator includes only utility patents, commonly known as patents for inventions. Utility patents can be granted for any new, useful, or improved method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound and represent a key measure of intellectual property.\nUSPTO classifies patents geographically according to residence of the firstnamed inventor. Only U.S.-origin patents are included. State data on individuals in S&E occupations come from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which surveys states' workplaces and assigns workers to a state based on where they work.\nSituations in which workers live in one state and work in another introduce some imprecision into the calculation of this indicator. The treatment of postsecondary teachers is another source of imprecision. Because OES data do not classify postsecondary teachers by field, faculty teaching in S&E fields are not counted as working in S&E occupations. Estimates for jurisdictions with smaller populations are generally less precise than estimates for jurisdictions with larger populations.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-99\n\nTable 8-45 Patents awarded per 1,000 individuals in S&E occupations, by state: 2004, 2006, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

High-technology industries are defined as those in which the proportion of employees in technology-oriented occupations is at least twice the average proportion for all industries. States often consider such industries desirable, in part because they tend to compensate workers better than other industries do. This indicator does not take into account establishment size. Each establishment with an employer identification number is counted without regard to the number of its employees.\nThe data pertaining to establishments for 2003, 2004, and 2006 are based on their classification according to the 2002 edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). See table 8-A in the \"Introduction\" for a list of the 46 industries (by 4-digit NAICS code) that are defined as high technology.

From a base of approximately 7.6 million total business establishments, 84,777 new business establishments were formed in high-technology industries and 70,746 ceased operations in those same industries.\nU\u00ca Almost all states showed more establishments beginning operations in high-technology industries than ceasing operations in 2006.\nU\u00ca Utah and Virginia showed the highest rates of net high-technology business formation in 2006. However, the largest numbers of net new businesses were formed in California, Texas, and Florida.\nU\u00ca EPSCoR states tended to be distributed throughout the state ranking, indicating that the rate of net high-technology business formation in many of these states was comparable to that in non-EPSCoR states.\n\nThe business base of a state is constantly changing as new businesses form and others cease to function. The term net business formations refers to the difference between the number of businesses that are formed and the number that cease operations during any particular year.\nThe ratio of the number of net business formations that occur in hightechnology industries to the number of business establishments in a state indicates the changing role of high-technology industries in a state's economy. High positive values indicate an increasingly prominent role for these industries.\nThe data on business establishments in high-technology industries are based on their classification according to the 2002 edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). See table 8-A in the \"Introduction\" for a list of the 46 industries (by 4-digit NAICS code) that are defined as high technology. Data for years prior to 2002 are not directly comparable.\nChanges in company name, ownership, or address are not counted as business formations or business deaths. Net business formations cannot be used to directly link the number of high-technology business establishments in different years because the primary industry of some establishments may have changed during the period.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-103\n\nTable 8-47 Net high-technology business formations as share of all business establishments, by state: 2004 and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...........................

High-technology industries are defined as those in which the proportion of employees in technology-oriented occupations is at least twice the average proportion for all industries.\nThe data pertaining to establishments are based on their classification according to the 2002 edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). See table 8-A in the \"Introduction\" for a list of the 46 industries (by 4-digit NAICS code) that are defined as high technology.

Awards are made to evaluate the feasibility and scientific merit of new technology (up to $100,000) and to develop the technology to a point where it can be commercialized (up to $750,000). The total award dollars include both Phase 1 and Phase 2 SBIR awards.\nBecause of year-to-year fluctuations, this indicator is calculated using 3-year averages. The average annual SBIR award dollars won by small businesses in a state are divided by the average annual gross domestic product. A high value indicates that small business firms in a state are doing cutting-edge development work that attracts federal support.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-107\n\nTable 8-49 Average annual federal SBIR funding per $1 million of gross domestic product, by state: 1998\u00ad2000, 2002\u00ad04, and 2006\u00ad08\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-50.\n\nFindings\nU The total amount of venture capital invested in the United States increased from about $21 billion in 1998 to about $28 billion in 2008, an overall increase of 34%. However, this was a decade of great volatility, as U.S. venture capital investment peaked at $106 billion in 2000.\nU\u00ca Venture capital is concentrated in relatively few states. Companies in California received 50% of the total venture capital disbursed in the United States in 2008, followed by companies in Massachusetts with 11%.\nU\u00ca The distribution of venture capital is becoming more concentrated, making it more difficult for companies in many states to access this type of financing. Thirty-five states reported lower values for this indicator in 2008 than in 1998.\nU\u00ca The average indicator value for EPSCoR states was substantially lower than that of non-EPSCoR states. The state distribution of venture capital was similar to indicators of high-technology business activity.\n\nVenture capital represents an important source of funding for startup companies. It supports the growth and expansion of these companies early in their development, before they establish a predictable sales history that would qualify them for other types of financing.\nThis indicator shows the relative magnitude of venture capital investments in a state after adjusting for the size of the state's economy. The indicator is expressed as dollars of venture capital disbursed per $1,000 of gross domestic product. High values indicate that companies in those states are successfully attracting venture capital to fuel their growth. Access to venture capital financing varies greatly among states.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-109\n\nTable 8-50 Venture capital disbursed per $1,000 of gross domestic product, by state: 1998, 2003, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-51.\n\nFindings\nU The number of venture capital deals that involved U.S. companies increased from about 2,900 deals in 2003 to about 3,700 deals in 2006.\nU\u00ca In 2006, venture capital deals were concentrated in only a few states. Indicator values ranged from a high of 2.31% to a low of zero with a median value of 0.20%.\nU\u00ca Companies in high-technology industries located in Massachusetts were the most successful in accessing venture capital investments in 2006, with a 2.31% rate. California companies in high-technology industries obtained venture capital investment at a rate of 1.81%. No other states reached a rate of 1.00%.\nU\u00ca In 2006, companies in EPSCoR states tended to receive little venture capital investment, and no venture capital deals were reported in three EPSCoR states.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the extent to which high-technology companies in a state receive venture capital investments. The value of the indicator is calculated by dividing the number of venture capital deals by the number of companies operating in high-technology industries in that state. In most cases, a company will not receive more than one infusion of venture capital in a given year.\nVenture capital investment can bring needed capital and management expertise that can help to grow a high-technology company. High values indicate that high-technology companies in a state are frequently using venture capital to facilitate their growth and development.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-111\n\nTable 8-51 Venture capital deals as share of high-technology business establishments, by state: 2003, 2004, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-52.\n\nFindings\nU In 2008, the size of the average venture capital investment in the United States was about $7 million per deal. This represented an increase in investment size from about $5 million per deal in 1998 but a decline from $13 million per deal in 2000 expressed in current dollars.\nU\u00ca The total number of venture capital deals has risen slightly, increasing from 3,632 deals in 1998 to 3,806 in 2008.\nU\u00ca In 2008, the state distribution on this indicator was skewed from a high value of $24 million per deal to a low of zero, with a median value of $5.03 million per deal. The value of this indicator continued to show a high level of variability from year to year and among states.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the average size of the venture capital investments being made in a state. The indicator is expressed as the total dollars of venture capital invested in millions divided by the number of companies receiving venture capital. The availability of venture capital may vary widely based on stage of investment, type of company, and numerous other factors.\nThis indicator provides some measure of the magnitude of investment that developing companies in a specific state have attracted from venture capital sources. Some states have relatively few venture capital deals taking place in a given year; thus, the value of this indicator may show large fluctuations on a year-toyear basis. Eighteen states reported fewer than 10 venture capital deals in 2008. In such states, a single large or small venture capital investment can significantly affect the value of this indicator.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n 8-113\n\nTable 8-52 Venture capital disbursed per venture capital deal, by state: 1998, 2003, and 2008\n\nState\nUnited States.................

The purpose of this appendix is to explain the methodological and statistical criteria used to assess possible data sources for inclusion in SEI and to develop statements about the data. It also provides some basic information about how statistical procedures and reasoning are applied.\nThe first section describes the statistical considerations that are part of the selection process for data sets to be included in SEI. The next section discusses the different types of data (e.g., sample surveys, censuses, and administrative records) used in the report and provides some information about each type. A section on data accuracy follows, discussing factors that can affect accuracy at all stages of the survey process. The last section discusses the statistical testing employed to determine whether differences between sample survey-based estimates are statistically significant, i.e., greater than could be expected by chance. The appendix concludes with a glossary of statistical terms commonly used or referred to in the text.\nSelection of Data Sources\nFour criteria guide the selection of data for SEI:\n Representativeness. Data should represent national or international populations of interest.\n Relevance. Data sources should include indicators central to the functioning of the science and technology enterprise.\n Timeliness. Data that are not part of a time series should be timely, i.e., substantial and unmeasured changes in the population under study should not have occurred since the data were collected.\n Statistical and methodological quality. Survey methods used to acquire data should provide sufficient assurance that statements based on statistical analysis of the data are valid and reliable.\nData that are collected by U.S. government agencies and that are products of the federal statistical system meet rigorous statistical and methodological criteria as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, these data are representative of the nation as a whole and of the demographic, organizational, or geographic subgroups that comprise it.\nFor data collected by governments in other countries and nongovernment sources, including private survey firms and\n\nacademic researchers, methodological information is examined to assess conformity with the criteria U.S. federal agencies typically use. Government statistical agencies in the developed world cooperate extensively in developing data quality standards and improving international comparability for key data, and methodological information about the data generated by this international statistical system is relatively complete.\nMethodological information about data from nongovernmental sources and from governmental agencies outside the international statistical system is often less well documented. These data are evaluated and must meet basic scientific standards for representative sampling of survey respondents and adequate and unbiased coverage of the population under study, and the resulting measurements must be sufficiently relevant and meaningful to warrant publication despite methodological uncertainties that remain after the documentation has been scrutinized. The most important statistical criteria are described in general terms below and in greater detail in the following sections.\nMany data sources that contain pertinent information about some segment of the S&E enterprise are not cited in SEI because their coverage of the United States as a nation is partial in terms of geography, incomplete in terms of segments of the population, or otherwise not representative. For example, data may be available only for a limited number of states or studies may be based on populations not representative of the United States as a whole. Similarly, data for other countries should cover and be representative of the entire country. (In some cases, data that have limited coverage or are otherwise insufficiently representative are referenced in sidebars.)\nData included in SEI must be of high quality. Data quality can be measured in a variety of ways, some of which are described in the following sections. Some key dimensions of quality include:\n Validity. Data have validity to the degree that they accurately measure the phenomenon they are supposed to represent.\n Reliability. Data have reliability to the degree that the same results would be produced if the same measurement or procedure were performed multiple times on the same population.\n Lack of bias. Data are unbiased to the degree that estimates from the data do not deviate from the population value of a phenomenon in a systematic fashion.\n\n A-1\n\n\fA-2 \n\nAppendix. Methodology and Statistics\n\nData Sources\nMuch of the data cited in SEI come from surveys. Surveys strive to measure characteristics of target populations. To generalize survey results correctly to the population of interest, a survey's target population must be rigorously defined and the criteria determining membership in the population must be applied consistently in determining which units to include in the survey.\nSome surveys are censuses (also known as universe surveys), in which the survey attempts to obtain data for all population units. The decennial census, in which the target population is all U.S. residents, is the most familiar census survey. SEI uses data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, an annual census of individuals who earn doctorates from accredited U.S. institutions, for information about the numbers and characteristics of new U.S. doctorate holders.\nOther surveys are sample surveys, in which data are obtained for only a representative portion of the population units. The Survey of Recent College Graduates, which gathers data on individuals who recently received bachelor's or master's degrees in science, engineering, and health fields from U.S. institutions, is an example of a sample survey.\nA sample is a probability sample if each unit in the sampling frame has a known, nonzero probability of being selected for the sample. Probability samples are necessary for inferences about a population to be evaluated statistically. Except for some Asian surveys referenced in chapter 7, sample surveys included in SEI use probability sampling. In nonprobability sampling, a sample is selected haphazardly, purposively, or conveniently, and inferences about the population cannot be evaluated statistically. Internet surveys and phone-in polls that elicit responses from self-selected individuals are examples of nonprobability sample surveys.\nIn sample surveys, once a survey's target population has been defined, the next step is to establish a list of all members of that target population (i.e., a sampling frame). Members of the population must be selected from this list in a scientific manner so that it will be possible to generalize from the sample to the population as a whole. Surveys frequently sample from lists that to varying extents omit members of the target population, because complete lists are typically unavailable.\nSurveys may be conducted of individuals or of organizations, such as businesses, universities, or government agencies. Surveys of organizations are often referred to as establishment surveys. An example of an establishment survey used in SEI is the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\nSurveys may be longitudinal or cross-sectional. In a longitudinal survey, the same individuals (or organizations) are surveyed repeatedly. The primary purpose of longitudinal surveys is to investigate how individuals or organizations change over time. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a longitudinal sample survey of individuals who received research doctorates from U.S. institutions. SEI uses results from this survey to analyze the careers of doctorate holders.\n\nCross-sectional surveys provide a \"snapshot\" at a given point of time. When conducted periodically, cross-sectional surveys produce repeated snapshots of a population, enabling analysis of how the population changes over time. However, because the same individuals or organizations are not included in each survey cycle, cross-sectional surveys cannot, in general, track changes for specific individuals or organizations. National and international assessments of student achievement in K\u00ad12 education, such as those discussed in chapter 1, are examples of repeated cross-sectional surveys. Most of the surveys cited in SEI are conducted periodically, although the frequency with which they are conducted varies.\nSome of the data in SEI come from administrative records (data previously collected for the purpose of administering various programs). Examples of data drawn directly from administrative records in SEI include patent data from the records of government patent offices; bibliometric data on publications in S&E journals, compiled from information collected and published by the journals themselves; and data on foreign S&E workers temporarily in the United States, drawn from the administrative records of immigration agencies.\nMany of the establishment surveys that SEI uses depend heavily, although indirectly, on administrative records. Universities and corporations that respond to surveys about their R&D activities often use administrative records developed for internal management or income tax reporting purposes to respond to these surveys.\nSurveys are conducted using a variety of modes (e.g., mail, telephone, the Internet, or in person). They can be selfor interviewer administered. Many surveys are conducted in more than one mode. For example, the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, a census of establishments (university departments) from which students earn S&E graduate degrees, collects most of its data via a Web-based questionnaire but also allows respondents to answer a paper questionnaire. The National Survey of College Graduates, a longitudinal sample survey that collects data on individuals with S&E-related degrees and/or occupations, is initially conducted by sending a paper questionnaire by mail. Later, potential participants who did not respond to the questionnaire are contacted via telephone or in person.\nData Accuracy\nAccurate information is a primary goal of censuses and sample surveys. Accuracy can be defined as the extent to which results deviate from the true values of the characteristics in the target population. Statisticians use the term \"error\" to refer to this deviation. Good survey design seeks to minimize survey error.\nStatisticians usually classify the factors affecting the accuracy of survey data into two categories: nonsampling and sampling errors. Nonsampling error applies to all surveys, including censuses, whereas sampling error applies only to\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n A-3\n\nsample surveys. The sources of nonsampling error in surveys have analogues for administrative records: the processes through which such records are created affect the degree to which the records accurately indicate the characteristics of relevant populations (e.g., patents, journal articles, immigrant scientists and engineers).\nNonsampling Error\nNonsampling error refers to error related to survey design, data collection, and processing procedures. Each stage of the survey process is a potential source of nonsampling error. For most types, there is no practical method of measuring the extent of nonsampling error. A brief description of five sources of nonsampling error follows. Although for convenience the descriptions occasionally refer to samples, they apply equally to censuses.\nSpecification Error. Survey questions often do not perfectly measure the concept for which they are intended as indicators. For example, the number of patents is not the same as the amount of invention.\nFrame Error. The sampling frame, the list of the target population members used for selecting survey respondents, is often inaccurate. If the frame has omissions or other flaws, the survey is less representative because coverage of the target population is incomplete. Frame errors often require extensive effort to correct.\nNonresponse Error. Nonresponse errors occur because not all members of the sample respond to the survey. Response rates indicate what proportion of sample members respond to the survey. Other things being equal, lower response rates create a greater possibility that, had nonrespondents supplied answers to the questionnaire, the survey estimates would have been different.\nNonresponse can cause nonresponse bias, which occurs when the people or establishments that respond to a question, or to the survey as a whole, differ in systematic ways from those who do not respond. For example, in surveys of national populations, complete or partial nonresponse is often more likely among lower-income or less-educated respondents. Evidence of nonresponse bias is an important factor in decisions about whether survey data should be included in SEI.\nManagers of high-quality surveys, such as those in the U.S. federal statistical system, do research on nonresponse patterns to assess whether and how nonresponse might bias survey estimates. SEI notes instances where reported data may be subject to substantial nonresponse bias.\nThe response rate does not indicate whether a survey has a problem of nonresponse bias. Surveys with high response rates sometimes have substantial nonresponse bias, and surveys with relatively low response rates, if nonrespondents do not differ from respondents on important variables, may have relatively little.\n\nMeasurement Error. There are many sources of measurement error, but respondents, interviewers, and survey questionnaires are the most important. Knowingly or unintentionally, respondents may provide incorrect information. Interviewers may inappropriately influence respondents' answers or record their answers incorrectly. The questionnaire can be a source of error if there are ambiguous, poorly worded, or confusing questions, instructions, or terms, or if the questionnaire layout is confusing.\nIn addition, the records or systems of information that a respondent may refer to, the mode of data collection, and the setting for the survey administration may contribute to measurement error. Perceptions about whether data will be treated as confidential may affect the accuracy of survey responses to sensitive questions about business profits or personal incomes.\nProcessing Error. Processing errors include errors in recording, checking, coding, and preparing survey data to make them ready for analysis.\nSampling Error\nSampling error is probably the best-known source of survey error and the most commonly reported measure of a survey's precision or accuracy. Unlike nonsampling error, sampling error can be quantitatively estimated in most scientific sample surveys.\nChance is involved in selecting the members of a sample. If the same, random procedures were used repeatedly to select samples from the population, numerous samples would be selected, each containing different members of the population with different characteristics. Each sample would produce different population estimates. When there is great variation among the samples drawn from a given population, the sampling error is high and there is a large chance that the survey estimate is far from the true population value. In a census, because the entire population is surveyed, there is no sampling error.\nSampling error is reduced when samples are large, and most of the surveys used in SEI have large samples. Sampling error is not a function of the percentage of the population in the sample (when the population is large) or the population size but is a function of the sample size, the variability of the measure of interest, and the methods used to produce estimates from the sample data.\nSampling error is measured by the standard error of the estimate, sometimes called the \"margin of error.\" The standard error of an estimate measures how closely the estimate from a particular sample approximates the average result of all possible samples. The standard error of the estimate is expressed as a range in the size of the difference (e.g., \u00b12%) between the sample estimate and the average result of all possible samples.\n\n\fA-4 \n\nAppendix. Methodology and Statistics\n\nStatistical Testing for Data From Sample Surveys\nStatistical tests determine whether differences observed in sample survey data could have happened by chance, i.e., as the result of random variation in which people or establishments in the population were sampled. Differences that are very unlikely to have been produced by chance variations in sample selection are termed statistically significant. When SEI reports statements about differences on the basis of sample surveys, the differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. This means that, if there were no true difference in the population, the chance of drawing a sample with the observed difference would be no more than 5%.\nA statistically significant difference is not necessarily large, important, or significant in the usual sense of the word. It is simply a difference that cannot be attributed to chance variation in sampling. With the large samples common in SEI data, extremely small differences can be found to be statistically significant. Conversely, quite large differences may not be statistically significant if the sample or population sizes of the groups being compared are small. Occasionally, apparently large differences are noted in the text as not being statistically significant to alert the reader that these differences may have occurred by chance.\nNumerous differences are apparent in every table in SEI that reports sample data. The tables permit comparisons between different groups in the survey population and in the same population in different years. It would be impractical to test and indicate the statistical significance of all possible comparisons in tables involving sample data.\nAs explained in \"About Science and Engineering Indicators\" at the beginning of this volume, SEI presents indicators. It does not model the dynamics of the S&E enterprise, although analysts could construct models using the data in SEI. Accordingly, SEI does not make use of statistical procedures suitable for causal modeling and does not compute effect sizes for models that might be constructed using these data.\nGlossary\nMost glossary definitions are drawn from U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Office of Statistical Policy (2006), \"Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys\" and U.S. Bureau of the Census (2006), \"Organization of Metadata, Census Bureau Standard Definitions for Surveys and Census Metadata.\" In some cases, glossary definitions are somewhat more technical and precise than those in the text, where fine distinctions are omitted to improve readability.\nAdministrative records: Data collected for the purpose of carrying out various programs (e.g., tax collection).\nBias: Systematic deviation of the survey estimated value from the true population value. Refers to systematic errors that can occur with any sample under a specific design.\n\nCoverage: Extent to which all elements on a frame list are members of the population and to which every element in a population appears on the frame list once and only once.\nCoverage error: Discrepancy between statistics calculated on the frame population and the same statistics calculated on the target population. Undercoverage errors occur when target population units are missed during frame construction, and overcoverage errors occur when units are duplicated or enumerated in error.\nCross-sectional sample survey: Based on a representative sample of respondents drawn from a population at a particular point in time.\nEstimate: A numerical value for a population parameter derived from information collected from a survey and/ or other sources.\nEstimation error: Difference between a survey estimate and the true value of the parameter in the target population.\nFrame: A mapping of the universe elements (i.e., sampling units) onto a finite list (e.g., the population of schools on the day of the survey).\nItem nonresponse: Occurs when a respondent fails to respond to one or more relevant item(s) on a survey.\nLongitudinal sample survey: Follows the experiences and outcomes over time of a representative sample of respondents (i.e., a cohort).\nMeasurement error: Difference between observed values of a variable recorded under similar conditions and some fixed true value (e.g., errors in reporting, reading, calculating, or recording a numerical value).\nNonresponse bias: Occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Nonresponse bias may occur as a result of not obtaining 100% response from the selected units.\nNonresponse error: Overall error observed in estimates caused by differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Consists of a variance component and nonresponse bias.\nNonsampling error: Includes measurement errors due to interviewers, respondents, instruments, and mode; nonresponse error; coverage error; and processing error.\nPopulation: See \"target population.\" Precision of survey results: How closely results from a\nsample can reproduce the results that would be obtained from a complete count (i.e., census) conducted using the same techniques. The difference between a sample result and the result from a complete census taken under the same conditions is an indication of the precision of the sample result. Probabilistic methods: Any of a variety of methods for survey sampling that give a known, nonzero probability of selection to each member of a target population. The advantage of probabilistic sampling methods is that sampling error can be calculated. Such methods include random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2010\n\n A-5\n\nThey do not include convenience sampling, judgment sampling, quota sampling, and snowball sampling. Reliability: Degree to which a measurement technique would yield the same result each time it is applied. A measurement can be both reliable and inaccurate. Response bias: Deviation of the survey estimate from the true population value due to measurement error from the data collection. Potential sources of response bias include the respondent, the instrument, and the interviewer. Response rates: Measure the proportion of the sample frame represented by the responding units in each study. Sample design: Sampling plan and estimation procedures. Sampling error: Error that occurs because all members of the frame population are not measured. It is associated with the variation in samples drawn from the same frame population. The sampling error equals the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard error: Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic.
