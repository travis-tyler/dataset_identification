Using nationally representative data, this study explored the relationship between students' school-entry math skills, classroom content coverage, and end of kindergarten math achievement.

On average, exposure to this basic mathematics content was negatively associated with math achievement across kindergarten. Importantly, children with the lowest levels of math skills benefited from exposure to this basic mathematics content while other children benefited from exposure to more advanced content."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Recently, scholars and education advocates have focused on the importance of mathematics for young children, indicating that 3-to 6-year-olds are ready to learn varied mathematics content that establishes a solid base for future learning (National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2002; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2007; National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008) . Math skills measured at school entry are important predictors of subsequent school achievement in both reading and math (Duncan, et al., 2007) , and teachers' instructional practices and content coverage have an important influence on early math skills (Bodovski & Farkas, 2007; Croninger, Rice, Rathbun, & Nishio, 2007; Crosnoe et al., 2010; Guarino, Hamilton, Lockwood, Rathbun, & Hausken, 2006; Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007; Palardy & Rumberger, 2008) .\nAlthough research highlights the importance of kindergarten mathematics for later achievement, math is underemphasized in kindergarten. Kindergarten teachers spend little time on mathematics instruction and cover very basic content, such as counting (Bargagliotti, Guarino, & Mason, 2009; Rudd, Lambert, Satterwhite, & Zaier, 2008) . For example, teachers report spending approximately five hours per week on reading compared with only three hours per week on mathematics. Further, undergraduate programs in early childhood education focus little on mathematics instruction and teachers of young children are unsure about how to teach math (Ginsburg, Lee, & Boyd, 2008) . Kindergarten mathematics standards and the mathematics content taught in kindergarten classrooms emphasize early number skills over more advanced mathematics skills (Reys, Chval, & Switzer, 2008) .\nGiven the importance of early mathematics skills for later school success, understanding how math content exposure influences mathematics achievement is important for both education policy and practice. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K) cohort, we describe how the math content on which kindergarten teachers focus aligns with students' mathematics knowledge. We explore the interaction between students' school-entry math skills, classroom content coverage, and end-of-kindergarten math achievement. We examine how exposure to specific mathematics content influences math test scores at the end of kindergarten for all children and for children with different levels of math skills at kindergarten entry."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Achievement", "text": "Children in the United States lag behind their peers in other developed countries in mathematics achievement (Ginsburg, Cooke, Leinwand, Noell, & Pollack, 2005; Mullis, Martin, & Foy, 2008; OECD, 2004) . Further, low-income and minority children are at particular risk for underachievement in mathematics (Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni & Locuniak, 2007 Siegler, 2009; Siegler & Ramani, 2008; Starkey, Klein, & Wakeley, 2004) , and a large literature documents race and income gaps in school-entry math skills (e.g. Bodovski & Farkas, 2007; Fryer & Levitt, 2004; Magnuson & Duncan, 2006; Phillips, Crouse, & Ralph, 1998) . Early math skills are malleable and can be influenced by a child's environment (Starkey & Klein, 2000) .\nRecent research has shown that low-income children experience gains in mathematics skills even from brief interventions (Klein et al., 2008; Siegler & Ramani, 2008; Siegler & Ramini, 2009; Starkey et al., 2004) .\nThe mathematics knowledge and skills that students have at school entry and acquire during kindergarten are key to later school success (Claessens & Engel, in press; Claessens, Duncan, & Engel, 2009; Duncan, et al., 2007) . Thus, it is surprising that kindergarten teachers spend limited time on mathematics instruction and tend to focus most on narrow and basic mathematical content (Rudd et al., 2008) . For example, in the nationally representative ECLS-K, kindergarten teachers reported spending nearly twice as much instructional time on reading compared with mathematics 2 ; a pattern that continues in the average public elementary school through at least fourth grade and has been documented over two decades (Morton & Dalton, 2007) . Further, nearly 20 percent of kindergarten teachers reported engaging in mathematics instruction three times per week or less (Bargaglioti et al., 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Teachers and Instruction", "text": "A large literature documents both the important influence that teachers have on student learning and substantial variation in teacher effectiveness (Aaronson, Barrow, & Sander, 2007; Hanushek, Kain, O'Brian, & Rivkin, 2005; Harris & Sass, 2008; Kane, Rockoff, & Staiger, 2006; Nye, Konstonopoulos & Hedges, 2004; Rockoff, 2004) , including the importance of quality teacher-child interactions (e.g. Mashburn, Painta, Hamre, Downer, et al., 2008) .\nHowever, efforts to link observable teacher characteristics such as years of experience, certification, and years of education to their effectiveness have found that few teacher characteristics are associated with teacher value added. Teacher qualifications and characteristics explain little of the total variation in teacher effectiveness (Goldhaber, 2002; Rockoff, 2004) .\nThe limited association between teacher characteristics and teacher effectiveness is likely because these qualities are not direct measures of instruction. Teacher qualifications, knowledge, and experience are most likely to have an indirect influence on student achievement through their correlation with teachers' instructional practices and content coverage (Goe, 2007) . Studies comparing the predictive power of teacher characteristics with that of classroom practices have found that the latter, more proximal measures, better predict student test score gains (Guarino et al., 2006; Palardy & Rumberger, 2008) .\nFor example, studies of pedagogical approaches and indicators of instructional quality, such as quality of teacher-led discussions or rigor of activities have found particular practices to be associated with student learning. Smith, Lee, and Newman (2001) found that instructional strategies coded \"interactive\" were associated with larger student test score gains than strategies coded \"didactic.\" Other studies used instruments such as the Danielson Framework (Danielson, 1996) to code the quality of instructional practices, finding that teachers whose instruction included high-quality discussions, rigorous activities, and high expectations of students are more effective (Borman & Kimball, 2005; Holtzapple, 2003 , Matsumura et al., 2006 .\nA number of studies have used the ECLS-K to examine teacher practices and their association with student achievement. In mathematics, \"teaching for understanding\" and \"drill\" both positively predicted math achievement (Milesi & Gamoran, 2006) . For first graders, the use of worksheets and working on problems with a calendar were positively associated with gains in mathematics achievement, while the use of geometric manipulatives had a negative correlation (Palardy & Rumberger, 2008) . Emphasis on traditional practices and computation, measurement and advanced topics, and numbers and operations were all positively associated with kindergarten math gains (Gaurino et al., 2006) . Similarly, Bodovski and Farkas (2007) found that practices including both \"traditional math\" and \"group/interactive activities\", as well as instruction on content including advanced counting, practical math, and single-digit operations were all positively associated with kindergarten mathematics gains. Interestingly, Bodovski and Farkas found time spent on basic numbers and shapes to be negatively correlated with achievement.\nTaken together, prior studies on instruction have found a range of pedagogical practices and instructional modalities to be associated with student achievement. Studies that included ECLS-K teacher-reported content coverage (e.g. Guarino et al., 2006; Bodovski & Farkas, 2007) found some content to be positively associated with student achievement while other content appeared to have a negative effect. For example, students with higher levels of reading skills benefited from more advanced content and curricula in reading (Xue & Meisels, 2004) . One limitation of many of the prior studies that used the ECLS-K to examine the effects of instruction is that they used measures that mixed content coverage, pedagogical practices, and instructional modalities. While all of these aspects of instruction are important, we focus on content to better understand how student exposure to specific mathematics content predicts mathematics achievement.\nWe posit that content exposure, in and of itself, is important for children's learning.\nFurther, it is possible that content coverage is more amenable to change than pedagogy, instructional modalities, or the allocation of instructional time. Introducing teachers to new teaching methods and skills that they will successfully adopt is likely to be time intensive and difficult. Further, large-scale policies such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) appear to have done little, on average, to change the allocation of instructional time (Morton & Dalton, 2007) .\nIn contrast, having teachers shift the content they cover, particularly to reallocate their focus among topics that they already teach seems quite amenable to change. Thus, while we recognize the importance of pedagogy, our study examines the effects of content coverage. We argue that content that is aligned with children's skill levels will best facilitate student learning. We expand upon the extant literature by examining the extent to which kindergarten mathematics content is aligned with school-entry math skills and how children's math skills interact with this content exposure."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "A child's predispositions, knowledge, and skills contribute to his own learning and to the environment in which he operates; in turn, the child receives feedback from others in the environment (Meisels, 1998) . This complex interaction between the child and his environment affects his developmental trajectory (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994; Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998) . Given that these interactions rely on both the individual child's skills and the environment in which he operates, we argue that school-entry skills in mathematics will interact with the mathematics content to which a child is exposed. For example, a child who enters kindergarten with high levels of math skills but is exposed to basic mathematics content might not have the opportunity to develop new mathematics skills over the kindergarten year.\nSimilarly, a student who enters kindergarten with low levels of mathematics skills, but is exposed to advanced mathematics content might not improve in mathematics because he cannot grasp the advanced material. Exposing students to content beyond their current skills but still within their range of abilities may promote early skill development (Vygotsky, 1978) . Thus, we posit that the content must be properly aligned to a child's skill level to optimize learning.\nInterestingly, our investigation aligns most closely with recent theory and research in reading. Recent evidence on literacy practices has found that effective reading instruction varies by a child's skill level in language and literacy (Connor, Morrison, & Katch, 2004; Connor, Piasta, Fishman, Glasney, & Schatschneider, 2009) . Termed \"Child \u00d7 Instruction interactions,\" these studies found that children benefited from instructional activities and content that was adapted to their entering skill level (Connor et al., 2004) . Experimental results have provided further evidence that literacy instruction aimed at meeting a child's individual language and literacy needs does in fact produce the largest gains (Connor et al., 2009) . Relatedly, theory on mathematics learning trajectories for young children posits that the mathematics children already know should be key to determining the content that they are taught ). The current study explores the interaction between students' mathematics knowledge at kindergarten entry, the instruction that they receive in kindergarten,\nand their end-of-kindergarten math test scores for a nationally representative sample."}, {"section_title": "The present study", "text": "Our study provides a descriptive picture of children's early math skills and the kindergarten mathematics content to which they are exposed. We examine the influence of teacher-reported mathematics content coverage on mathematics achievement gains during kindergarten. Further, we examine how children's math knowledge at school entry interacts with the mathematics content covered in kindergarten. We hypothesize that despite the fact that most children have mastered math skills like basic counting at kindergarten entry, kindergarten teachers continue to emphasize these basic skills while underemphasizing advanced content. We also expect that children will benefit most from exposure to mathematics content that advances beyond their skills at kindergarten entry. Finally, we hypothesize that exposure to mathematics content that is at or below the level of knowledge and skills that children had at kindergarten entry will be negatively associated with mathematics learning during kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data used in this study came from the ECLS-K. The ECLS-K followed a nationally representative sample of children who were in kindergarten in the 1998-99 school year through eighth grade. The dataset provides extensive information on children's academic skills at school entry and throughout elementary and middle school. The ECLS-K contains detailed information about children and their families, teachers, classrooms, and schools. We used data from the fall and spring of kindergarten for this analysis. When weighted, the ECLS-K is representative of all U.S. kindergarteners from the 1998-99 school year. The ECLS-K sampling design included multiple children in most kindergarten classrooms, averaging six students per class."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Mathematics Content. In the spring of kindergarten, teachers reported on classroom activities and content. We focused on teacher reports of how often they had students engage in particular math activities. We used these items to construct math content measures designed to align with the four mathematics proficiency levels measured by the ECLS-K mathematics achievement test in the fall of kindergarten. We created content measures that align as closely as Shapes, includes teachers' reports of how many days per month they had children count aloud, work with geometric manipulatives, practice correspondence between number and quantity, and recognize and name geometric shapes. Responses ranged from zero days to twenty days per month. The corresponding math proficiency level encompassed identifying some one-digit numerals, recognizing geometric shapes, and one-to-one counting up to ten objects. Each content measure is an average of the non-missing items in the scale. As shown in Table 1 , reliabilities for the four content measures range from .58 to .78. Appendix A provides item-level detail on mathematics content and instructional practices for all items included on the spring of kindergarten teacher survey.\nGiven our use of secondary data, we were constrained by the available items and by the available information about the knowledge and skills encompassed in the different proficiency level measures (described below). Due to these data constraints, we created content measures that aligned as closely as possible with the mathematics achievement test proficiency levels provided by the ECLS-K and detailed below.\nStudent achievement. Children were given direct assessments in language and literacy (reading) and mathematics during the fall and spring of kindergarten. The assessments were designed using Item Response Theory (IRT) to allow for the examination of growth over time (Tourangeau et al., 2009 ). We use sample children's spring mathematics IRT scores as our dependent variable and control for children's fall mathematics IRT scores in all of our models.\nThe ECLS-K provides proficiency scores for nine math achievement proficiency levels as well as dichotomous variables indicating whether or not a child has mastered each of these nine levels. We use the dichotomous indicators of mastery to group children by school-entry mathematics ability for some of the analyses presented below. We use these measures to group children by their fall of kindergarten math skills, although we use children's mathematics IRT scores in all of our regression models. The ECLS-K math assessment measured children's conceptual and procedural knowledge and problem solving skills, and scores range in reliability from .89 to .94 (Tourangeau et al., 2009 ). The proficiency levels in math measured in kindergarten include 1) numbers, shapes, and counting to ten; 2) counting beyond ten, patterns, and relative size; 3) ordinality and sequence; and 4) addition and subtraction (see final column of Table 1 for more detail).\nChild, home, and family characteristics. We include a variety of child and family characteristics as control variables in our analyses. Many characteristics of children and their families are likely correlated with both mathematics achievement and kindergarten classrooms.\nThus, we control for child race and ethnicity, age, sex, overall health, birth weight, whether the child was premature, and type of preschool care. We also include fall of kindergarten math achievement scores, reading, a general knowledge test, and teacher ratings of the child's approaches to learning (attention and task persistence). In addition to child characteristics, we control for home and family background variables including geographic region, number of preschool moves, and neighborhood safety. We also control for home environment factors such as family structure, number of siblings, home language, and parental education, occupation, and expectations for child's education. Appendix B contains a complete list of these variables."}, {"section_title": "Teacher characteristics.", "text": "Teachers completed surveys about their background characteristics and qualifications in the fall and spring of kindergarten. We include a range of these variables capturing teacher background and qualifications as controls in our models including gender, age, race and ethnicity, education, and experience."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Sample", "text": "Weighted descriptive statistics for the full sample and our analytic sample of 11,517 students and 2,176 teachers are provided in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. In the analytic sample, we included only those students with math, reading, and general knowledge test score data for fall of kindergarten and spring of kindergarten math test scores, as well as data on race, gender and age. As shown in Table 2 , over half of the analytic student sample is White (64 percent), 15 percent is African American, and 13 percent is Hispanic. Almost one quarter of the analytic sample (21 percent) lived in single parent families in the fall of kindergarten, and 6 percent were in households where English was not the primary language spoken. Our analytic sample has fewer Hispanic children than the full sample (13 percent versus 18 percent) and are more likely to speak English at home (6 percent versus 11 percent). On the other measures, the analytic sample is similar to the full sample. In order to maximize sample size for our analytic sample, we assigned zeroes to cases with missing data on control variables and used missing data dummy variables (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003) . Appendix B provides information on missing data for control variables for our analytic sample. About 25 percent of the full sample was lost, because we require that children have information for all of the content measures.\nTurning to Table 3 , almost all kindergarten teachers in the analytic sample were women (97 percent). The average teacher was 41 years old, and most were White (85 percent).\nApproximately one third of teachers had at least a master's degree, and they had taught kindergarten for eight years, on average. Sample teachers had taken an average of three courses in teaching reading and a little over two and a half courses in teaching math. The majority of the sample had a teaching certificate (89 percent). Finally, teachers reported spending approximately three hours per week teaching math. There were few differences between the full and analytic samples of teachers. The analytic sample was slightly less likely to have a temporary certificate than the full sample (8 percent versus 10 percent). Like the student sample, cases of missing data on control variables for teachers were assigned zeroes and missing data dummy variables were used (Cohen et al., 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Plan", "text": "First, we provide a description of the content coverage in kindergarten classrooms. Given that theory and research suggest early mathematics skills might lead children to benefit more from particular teacher or classroom opportunities (Crosnoe et al., 2010; Gamoran, 1991) , we are interested in the interaction between mathematics content exposure and schoolentry math skills. To test our hypotheses regarding student mathematics skills and kindergarten mathematics content, we conducted the analysis described above for subgroups of students with different levels of math skills at the fall of kindergarten. Specifically, we conducted separate analyses for students who were not proficient on level one (5 percent of the analytic sample) as well as students whose highest levels of mastery were Proficiency Levels 1(32 percent), 2 (39 percent), 3 (19 percent) and 4 or higher (4 percent), respectively. 3 We conducted subgroup analyses rather than using formal interaction terms for ease of interpretation. As with interaction terms, the subgroup models allow for the comparison of the relationship between math content and spring of kindergarten math achievement across groups of children with differing schoolentry math skills.

Very few students, a mere 7 percent, had mastered Proficiency Level 4 (corresponds with Addition and Subtraction) in the fall of kindergarten. Mirroring these levels of mastery, at kindergarten entry, the average score on the first math proficiency probability level -identifying some one-digit numerals, recognizing geometric shapes, one to one counting of ten objects -was .94 out of 1. The average score on the second level -reading all one-digit numeral, counting beyond ten, and recognizing a sequence of patterns -was .58, and .23 for level three -reading two-digit numbers, recognizing the next number in a sequence, identifying the ordinal position of an object, and solving simple word problems. For level four -solving addition and subtraction problems -the average score was only .04. The results described thus far have shown the relationship between individual mathematics content measures and children's math achievement at the end of kindergarten. In order to examine the relationship between each content measure and mathematics achievement net of the other measures, columns (9) and (10) the full models were similar to those shown in the previous models. Finally, although not the primary focus of our analysis, across all the models shown in Table 6 , time spent on mathematics was positively and statistically significantly associated with math achievement at the end of kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics content in kindergarten", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mathematics content and mathematics achievement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mathematics content and achievement by student mathematics skills", "text": "We hypothesized that children may benefit differentially from exposure to particular mathematics content during the kindergarten year depending on their kindergarten-entry mathematics skills. Thus, we examined the relationship between our four mathematics content measures and children's math achievement for subgroups of children with different levels of kindergarten-entry mathematics skills. Table 7 presents results from models that are equivalent to those shown in columns (9) and (10) of Table 6 for five subgroups of children determined by their highest level of math proficiency at kindergarten entry. These groups are children who have not mastered Proficiency Level 1 and those who have mastered Proficiency Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 or higher, respectively. The first column for each subgroup in Table 7 presents the results from models without teacher, child, and family control variables and the second column includes these controls.\nFully controlled results for the group of children with the lowest level of kindergartenentry math skills ( 4 We also examined differences across full-or part-day kindergarten by estimating the models shown in Table 7 separately by full-and part-day kindergarten. The results (not shown) indicated no differences between content and math achievement outcomes by kindergarten type.\nOne potential explanation of our finding that children benefit differentially from exposure to the most basic content (Basic Counting and Shapes) depending on their knowledge at kindergarten entry is that teachers might adjust their content based on student knowledge. As such, we explored the extent to which teacher-reported content coverage varies by student mathematics achievement at the fall of kindergarten. Figure 1 shows teacher-reported content coverage by sample students' fall of kindergarten mathematics achievement. While content exposure does vary somewhat by student knowledge at kindergarten entry, sample children are exposed to similar amounts of both basic and advanced content, regardless of school-entry knowledge. For example, children who enter kindergarten not yet having mastered Proficiency Level 1 are exposed to Basic Counting and Shapes, on average, 13.1 days per month and are exposed to Addition and Subtraction 3.8 days per month, on average. Children at the opposite end of the mathematics knowledge distribution at kindergarten entry, those who have mastered the four most basic proficiency levels, experience an average of 12.1 days of instruction on Basic\nCounting and Shapes and 4.9 days of instruction on Addition and Subtraction. These differences suggest that teachers might adjust mathematics content coverage in response to children's entering skill levels. However, the figure also reveals that all kindergarten students are exposed to a large amount of Basic Counting and Shapes even though the vast majority have already mastered this content.\nTaken together, Table 7 and Figure 1 show that both the small group (5 percent of the sample) of children who benefit from exposure to Basic Counting and Shapes and the large group who do not are exposed to nearly the same amount of that content. Results also show that all children are exposed to less content related to Place Value and Currency and little content related to Addition and Subtraction -content that the vast majority of students benefit from and for which we find no evidence of negative effects."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Using a nationally representative sample of kindergartners, this study examined the relationship between kindergarten classroom mathematics content coverage and children's math achievement test scores at the end of kindergarten. Our results reveal several important relationships. First, the vast majority of kindergarten students (95 percent) entered school having mastered basic counting and are able to recognize geometric shapes. Second, among the mathematics content covered in kindergarten, teachers reported spending the most time -about 13 days per month-on Basic Counting and Shapes. This suggests that children are exposed to mathematics content that they have already mastered for much of the already limited time they spend learning mathematics during kindergarten. Indeed, regression-adjusted results showed that for the majority of children, the teacher-reported content measure Basic Counting and Shapes was negatively associated with math achievement across the kindergarten year and that children benefited most from exposure to more advanced mathematics content such as Place Value and\nCurrency and Addition and Subtraction. We also examined this relationship by subgroups of children based on their kindergarten-entry math skills. As anticipated, we found that children who had not mastered basic counting at kindergarten entry benefited from this content coverage but that those children who already had these skills actually gained less in mathematics if their teachers reported spending more time on this content.\nThe fact that most children have mastered certain basic math skills at kindergarten entry and that their teachers reported a substantial focus on these skills points to a mismatch between the skills that many students have and the mathematics content that they are typically exposed to in kindergarten. This misalignment between student skills and content coverage is potentially problematic and may result from several different factors. First, teachers are unsure about teaching mathematics and spend less time on mathematics than reading, particularly in the first years of school (Bargagliotti et al., 2009; Ginsburg et al., 2008; Rudd et al., 2008) . Thus, teachers may focus on the most basic skills because of a discomfort with teaching math or because of a lack of math pedagogical knowledge beyond the most basic skills. In addition, teachers may not be aware of children's mathematics skill levels at kindergarten entry. For example, teachers in schools without early assessments in mathematics may have relatively little information about the skills their students have in mathematics, and thus, spend more time on the basics. Finally, it is possible that kindergarten teachers may, in fact, have a sense of what math skills children have and be equipped to teach more advanced content. These teachers may be following state or district mathematics standards for kindergarten classrooms that emphasize early number skills over more advanced mathematics skills (Reys et al, 2008) .\nBeyond the descriptive pattern of children's entering math skills and the content teachers cover, this study examined how teacher-reported mathematics content coverage was related to children's mathematics achievement scores at the end of kindergarten. We found that for most children exposure to basic content was negatively associated with children's math achievement measured at the end of kindergarten. Time spent on Basic Counting and Shapes was associated with lower mathematics achievement at the end of kindergarten for all but the lowest achieving students. We also found that exposure to more advanced mathematics content in kindergarten was associated with increased math achievement. Thus, while exposure to basic skills may be detrimental for the majority of students, exposure to advanced content appears to benefit most students with no evidence of deleterious effects.\nThe fact that the vast majority of children have mastered basic numbers and geometric shapes may explain why we find exposure to these skills over the course of kindergarten to be detrimental to students' math achievement. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the relationship between kindergarten mathematics content coverage and children's mathematics achievement varied by children's school-entry mathematics skills. We found that a child's entering skill level determined the relationship between exposure to basic mathematics content and subsequent math achievement. Among children who had not mastered basic math skills at kindergarten entry, more time on basic mathematics content during kindergarten was positively associated with spring of kindergarten mathematics achievement. However, for students who had already mastered these skills at kindergarten entry --over 95 percent of kindergarteners --more time on basic mathematics content was negatively associated with math achievement at the end of kindergarten. For this group of students, exposure to more advanced content was positively associated with end-of-kindergarten mathematics achievement.\nThese results support the idea that the effect of mathematics content exposure on a child's achievement in kindergarten depends upon that child's mathematics skills at kindergarten entry.\nRecent research on language and literacy has highlighted the importance of the interaction between child and instruction (Connor et al., 2009; . In an experimental intervention, literacy instruction aimed at meeting children's individual language and literacy needs resulted in the largest learning gains (Connor et al., 2009) . Consistent with the results of these literacy studies and with theory about early mathematics learning ), the present study provides suggestive evidence that children benefited most from instruction that best matched their individual skill levels in mathematics. Further research on the interaction between mathematics content coverage and children's skill levels is needed, but the results found here suggest a possible role of \"Child x Instruction\" interactions for improving mathematics achievement.\nThe findings presented here have shown that a large portion of the mathematics content taught during kindergarten may not meet the needs of many kindergarteners and that closer attention to children's knowledge and skills at school entry may be warranted. However, the effect sizes found in this study are small. Typically around .03 or .04 of a standard deviation, these effect sizes suggest that a relatively modest shift in classroom content coverage would lead to small gains in mathematics achievement. In this case, an effect of .03 is associated with a teacher report of spending approximately four more days per month on a particular mathematics content area, such as Addition and Subtraction. It is important to note that an effect size of .03 is larger in magnitude than the estimated relationship between many other classroom and teacher inputs and student achievement. For example, teacher qualifications and education were unrelated to children's achievement gains in the present study and are consistently found to have small to null relationships with student achievement (Nye et al., 2004; Rockoff, 2004) . More time in school, as indicated by full-day kindergarten attendance, was related to increased math achievement with an effect size of about a tenth of a standard deviation. Given the costs likely involved in shifting classroom mathematics content to cover more advanced skills versus the costs associated with extending the school day, it seems that small changes to content coverage may be a potentially lower-cost avenue for improving student learning in mathematics.\nBased on our findings that the vast majority of kindergarten students are exposed to large amounts of content that they do not benefit from in kindergarten as well as prior research finding that kindergarten teachers spend less time on and are unsure about teaching mathematics (e.g. Ginsburg et al., 2008) , future research should examine the potential for professional development aimed at supporting teachers as they shift content coverage and continue to develop their pedagogical content knowledge for teaching mathematics in the early years of school."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The present study is not without limitations. The data used here are non-experimental.\nThus, concerns about selection and omitted variable bias persist. We controlled for a wide range of teacher, child, and family characteristics, but we cannot be certain that we have accounted for all potential omitted variables. However, the fact that we found a differential effect of exposure to particular mathematics content for children with different math skills provides evidence that both supports our hypotheses and reduces the threat from omitted variable bias.\nWe are also constrained to using the math achievement tests and mathematics content information available in the ECLS-K. While these variables appear to cover a broad range of content and the measures we created were both reasonably reliable and correlated with student achievement in logical ways, more nuanced measures of classroom content coverage might better capture what children are exposed to over the course of kindergarten. Future research should replicate our analyses using more detailed measures of both content and student knowledge. For example, the usefulness of classroom observations using measures such as the CLASS (e.g. Mashburn et al., 2008) or even of instructional logs completed by teachers (Rowan, Jacob, & Correnti, 2009 ) for measuring instruction is well documented. However, if classical measurement error is the primary problem with these measures, our estimated coefficients are likely biased toward zero.\nFinally, the ECLS-K cohort was in kindergarten during the 1998-99 school year, prior to the implementation of influential reforms such as NCLB. Although these data are now over a decade old, recent evidence suggests that time on math in first through fourth grades did not change substantially following NCLB (Morton & Dalton, 2007) and also indicates that the kindergarten mathematics standards of many states do emphasize very basic mathematics content (Reys et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study expands our understanding of children's math achievement, the mathematics content taught in kindergarten, and the relationship between content exposure, children's math skills, and learning. Using a nationally representative sample of children, we found that most children have mastered basic math skills at school entry, that most kindergarten teachers spend substantial time teaching these same basic skills, and that this is detrimental for most children's mathematics achievement. Future research should explore the driving forces behind this misalignment. Finally, this study is one of the first to demonstrate, using nationally representative data, that children's mathematics skills are important determinants of the mathematics content exposure that will optimize their learning.\nNotes 1 Authors' calculation using ECLS-K.\n2 Three percent of the analysis sample (n=337) of students are missing data for the variable indicating highest level of math proficiency despite the fact that they do have math test scores.\nWe include these students in our main analyses, but, by definition they are excluded from the subgroup analyses.
