In this work, we analyzed whether these stable MCI over short-term periods are actually appropriate training examples of non-disease patterns. To this aim, we compared the diagnosis of MCI patients at 2 and 5 years of follow-up, and investigated its impact on predictive performance of baseline volumetric MRI measures primarily involved in AD, i.e., hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes. Predictive power was evaluated in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in a trial sample of 248 MCI patients followed-up over 5 years. We further compared the sensitivity in those MCI that converted before 2 years and those that converted after 2 years. Our results indicate that 23% of the stable MCI at 2 years progressed in the next three years and that MRI volumetric measures are good predictors of conversion to AD dementia even at the mid-term, showing a better specificity and AUC as follow-up time increases. The combination of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex yielded an AUC that was significantly higher for the 5-year follow-up (AUC = 73% at 2 years vs. AUC = 84% at 5 years), as well as for specificity (56% vs. 71%). Sensitivity showed a non-significant slight decrease (81% vs. 78%). Remarkably, the performance of this model was comparable to machine learning models at the same follow-up times. MRI correctly identified most of the patients that converted after 2 years (with sensitivy > 60 %), and these patients showed a similar degree of abnormalities to those that converted before 2 years. This implies that most of the MCI patients that remained stable over short periods and subsequently progressed to AD dementia had evident atrophies at baseline. Therefore, machine learning models that use these patients to learn non-disease patterns are including an important fraction of patients with evident pathological changes related to the disease, something that might result in reduced performance and lack of biological interpretability.\n\uf0b7 MRI predicted AD dementia significantly better when extending follow-up from 2 to 5 years. \uf0b7 MRI was similarly able to detect AD in short and mid-term converters \uf0b7 Predictive models should not learn non-disease patterns from stable MCI over short periods."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly population, is still presenting challenges for an early diagnosis. Since the only definite way to identify AD is by means of a brain biopsy, this disease is predominantly diagnosed clinically [1] and, when possible, diagnosis is supported with biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid or imaging. Although certainty in diagnosis augments by tracking the progression in time of cognitive performance, early symptoms of AD are difficult to distinguish from age-related cognitive impairment and other neuropsychological disorders. These early symptoms are common to a condition known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [2] in which a cognitive decline is evident but not sufficiently specific to be considered incipient AD. At this stage, the mean annual conversion rate from MCI to probable AD is about 7%, with most of the MCI patients not progressing to AD within 10 years [3] . This result suggests that the origin of the MCI condition is variable and cannot be only attributed to AD, making difficult to filter out those MCI patients with incipient AD.\nAs pointed out in [4] , a possible reason of the failure of some clinical trials could be the selection of participants with clinical AD at a disease stage that might be too progressed to benefit from the treatment. Restricting the selection to MCI participants seemed the most straightforward solution to this issue. However, the aforementioned heterogeneity of MCI, both in definition and etiology, along with low conversion rates, critically contributed to the impossibility of detecting differences between treatment and placebo groups [5] . Furthermore, in order to be approved as a clinical target, both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that MCI must be defined through robust and validated criteria, being the EMA even more restrictive by requiring positivity in at least one biomarker of amyloidosis or neurodegeneration [6, 7] . These requirements resulted in clinicopathological diagnostic definitions, known as prodromal AD or MCI due to AD [8, 9] , incorporating biomarkers. These definitions are widely used nowadays in clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs [10] .\nAmong biomarkers of AD, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used technique to identify brain atrophies related to AD. Hippocampal atrophy, i.e, volumetric abnormality, assessed visually or quantitatively, is the best stablished MRI biomarker of AD [11] , although there is accumulating evidence that atrophies in other parts of the brain such as the entorhinal cortex provide complementary prognostic information as well [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] . Beyond visual assessment and volumetric measurements, several different machine learning"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T approaches have been explored for both feature extraction and classification, reporting an earlier and better detection of AD standard metrics [17] . Although the most emphasized strength of these approaches is the power to predict AD dementia earlier, a few models were also designed with the aim of predicting imminent conversion, so that clinical trials could use these approaches for sample enrichment. Despite the good reported results, these techniques have not been used yet neither in clinical routine nor trials [18, 17] , probably due to poor performance when evaluated in new data sets [18] . As an example, in [19] , 10 methods that reported significant prognostic ability using MRI were evaluated using new data. None of them showed to be different from random chance, indicating that the previously reported results were probably biased. Experimenter interventions in the testing process, tuning some of the free parameters of the model, and circular analysis or double-dipping [20] might explain the lack of generalizability of these models.\nApart from the previous mentioned methodological issues, we also found issues concerning the training sample. The typical approach when training a machine learning classifier is to label as progressive MCI (pMCI) those MCI patients who converted to AD within a fixed follow-up time, typically 1-3 years, and to label as stable MCI (sMCI) those who have not converted within that period. Using this labeling, machine learning algorithms learn the pattern that, theoretically, best discriminates between incipient AD and the rest of MCI. The conceptual validity of this approach relies on the assumption that only a negligible fraction of the sMCI patients are affected by AD or, alternatively, those sMCI actually affected by AD present a too early disease stage in which no major structural changes have occurred yet. Based on the latter assumption, an important number of machine learning classifiers were trained to capture the subtle structural changes that may contribute to an earlier prediction of AD [17] . However, neither the hypothesis of the absence of evident structural changes in mid-term pMCI nor the small size of its effect have been confirmed yet, leaving unclear how accurate is the correspondence between sMCI and absence of AD. If an important deviation of this correspondence is finally confirmed, it would imply that this common labeling suffers from poor biological interpretability and, therefore, may result in reduced performance and lack of generalizability.\nIn this work, we studied the predictive power of MRI measurements of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes for short (2 years) and mid-term (5 years) follow-up times. We also investigated the performance in the subgroups of MCI who converted before 2 years (short-term pMCI), and in those who converted after 2 years and before 5 (mid-term pMCI), as well as in sMCI\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T over 5 years versus sMCI with shorter follow-up times. To this aim, we used all the available data from the ADNI database, including data from [2] MCI patients enrolled in ADNI1 and ADNI2. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the predictive power of MRI is evaluated at 5-year follow-up using the ADNI1 and ADNI2 MCI cohorts, providing a detailed comparison of performance between the short and mid-term.\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T time remaining stable affected classification accuracy of MRI. Specifically, in Subanalysis 1 we compared sensitivities in short-term pMCI (converters within 2 years) and mid-term pMCI (converters after 2 years and before 5) to investigate how NC-like patients at baseline that then progressed within 5 years affect the overall sensitivity. In Subanalysis 2 we stratified the sMCI patients over 2 years into those that remained stable for 5 years and those with shorter follow-up times. We then compared specificities between these two independent samples, so we can assess that our results are not influenced due to the exclusion of sMCI that did not reach the 5 year endpoint. In Subanalysis 3, we separated converters into short-term and mid-term converters, as in Subanalysis 1. We then computed the AUCs of these two types of converters versus sMCI over 5 years, and compared the results. In this way, we can evaluate whether short-term and mid-term converter distributions of atrophies present different degrees of overlapping with the distribution of sMCI over five years. \nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T\nThe selection process described in Section 2.3 resulted in a sample of 230 NC and 230 AD (124 from ADNI1 and 106 from ADNI2).

Patients in the diagnostic group of Subjective Memory Complaints (SMC) or early MCI were not included. We did not include Early MCI because the aim of this study is to compare the performance of well-known volumetric biomarker metrics with the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning models, which, to the best of our knowledge, were mainly applied to late MCI data [18, 17] . The inclusion criteria of the diagnostic groups in the ADNI1/GO/2 study can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/. All the participants without clinical evaluation at baseline were excluded. We selected all the participants with available segmentations that passed the quality control. Only MCI patients with a suspected MCI due to Alzheimer's disease at baseline were included. We excluded all the MCI participants that remained stable and withdrew before the minimum follow-up considered in this study, 2 years.\nMCI patients were considered progressive MCI (pMCI) if they converted at any point within the follow-up time, regardless of the observed outcome in longer follow-up times. For these pMCI patients, conversion time was estimated as the mid-point between the visit in which AD is diagnosed for the first time and the previous visit. MCI patients who progressed to other types of dementia were regarded as stable MCI (sMCI). We also excluded NC participants in which a progression to MCI or AD was observed at any point in their follow-up, as well as AD patients in which a reversion to MCI or NC occurred. After this selection, the number of NC participants was superior to AD in both ADNI1 and ADNI2 cohorts. In order to obtain a balanced sample of NC"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "and AD in both ADNI studies, we excluded those participants with the shortest follow-up times until we balanced the number of NC and AD. We chose a balanced design to exclude informative prior probability [26] . Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the whole selection process. It should be noted that the inclusion criteria for all the previously mentioned diagnostic categories are equivalent across ADNI1/2, the only difference being that ADNI2 required a lumbar puncture to participate in the study. Thus, and given the differences in imaging protocols, we decided to analyze ADNI1 and ADNI2 MRI data of common diagnostic cohorts (NC, MCI, and AD) separately. RID identification numbers and diagnosis for the different follow-up times were provided in the Supplementary Material.\non that set after relabeling the diagnosis of MCI patients at the 2-year follow-up (Table 2) . Results were almost identical to those obtained in the previous analysis. ). Despite this sensitivity degradation in hippocampus and MRI model, most of the patients were correctly classified regardless of conversion time, as can be seen in Figure 5 .\nSubanalysis 2 showed that classification accuracy in the sMCI sample with shorter follow-up times than 5 years was significantly lower than the corresponding classfication accuracy of sMCI \n\ncompeting factors that determine its trend with follow-up time. On the one hand, atrophy is a late stage pathophysiological change in the course of AD [32] and, thus, by increasing follow-up time we provide more time for the development of atrophies and AD dementia in patients that had no atrophies at baseline. This effect results in an increased number of false negatives, so we expect certain decrease in sensitivity as we increase follow-up time. On the other hand, there is a significant number of patients with atrophies that only progressed in the mid-term, so these false positive cases turned to be true positive, increasing sensitivity. Looking at Figure 3 , it seems that these two factors compensate each other, resulting in a relatively stable sensitivity for the follow-up times studied here.\nFrom a clinical perspective, the fact that many atrophied patients do not progress in the short-term but in subsequent years indicates that hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy can be ascertained at mid-term time frames prior to the onset of dementia and that this pathological feature is more specific than what was previously thought. This finding can contribute to re-examine the role of hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy as indicators of short-term decline, reinforcing their early prognostic ability, and to re-evaluate their importance at the time of diagnosing early AD dementia. Moreover, the observation of the same levels of atrophy in patients who progressed in the short-term and in the mid-term supports the hypothesis that progression depends on more factors than just biomarker evidence of AD. Among the possible factors, it is likely that cognitive reserve [33] drives most of the variance in conversion times and, thus, comparing clinical symptoms with the expected clinical symptoms for the observed atrophy might help to better predict progression.\nOur findings also have implications on the novel machine learning algorithms that learn discriminative patterns from a sample of sMCI and pMCI over a short follow-up time. Table 3 presents a summary of the aforementioned algorithms reviewed in [17] that reported AUC as performance measure. We selected AUC for being the most robust performance measure against sample imbalance. They used a wide variety of methods, some of great complexity, to detect AD dementia in MCI patients, claiming in some cases to be earlier and more accurate predictors than common volumetric measures. In this context, it is surprising that a simple model based solely on the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, such as the one studied in this paper, evaluated in a larger and independent sample, and in a longer time frame with conversions to AD dementia after differences in time to progression to AD dementia in patients with the same level of neurodegeneration are probably explained by differences in cognitive reserve [32, 33] . This implies that an important part of the variance in conversion times is driven by variables that are independent from MRI and, therefore, variations in these variables across different populations (more educated cohorts or cultural differences) will probably affect the performance of the ML model. For instance, consider an ML model which is tested in a cohort that is less educated than the cohort used to train the model. A higher level of education implies a higher cognitive reserve [34] and, therefore, we expect that patients progressing within 2 years will present a more advanced pathophysiological stage, i.e., higher baseline atrophies than those progressive patients in the less educated cohort. Thus, the ML model will learn that a very advanced atrophy is necessary to ascertain conversion within 2 years, resulting in an increased number of false negatives in the less educated test cohort, in which the level of atrophy required to progress is expected to be lower.\nThis implies that a fraction of patients with evident atrophies will be labelled as non-progressive, even when these atrophies might be severe and we will actually observe a progression, spoiling the reliability and interpretability of the model.\nAlthough we consider that the aforementioned issues contribute to the non-generalizability of machine learning methods in incipient AD dementia detection [18] , we also consider that it they are not the only ones. As stated in Section 1, it is equally important the report of non-biased results\nand a statistically powerful comparison between novel and standard metrics. As an example, the two best performing algorithms from Table 3 manually tuned some of the multiple parameters of their complex algorithms, which may result in optimistically biased results. These pitfalls, but also others of a different nature, were also common in the rest of the algorithms and critically contribute, in our view, to a poor generalizability. Looking at Table 3 , it seems evident that if MRI machine learning algorithms can actually provide an improvement in AD dementia detection, this improvement has to be relatively small.\nHowever, even if this small improvement exists, this result is going to be impossible to ascertain due the uncertainty generated by the 20% of sMCI patients who are misleadingly labelled as non-AD. It is of capital importance to provide an accurate ground-truth diagnosis in training phases, probably including only those stable MCI with the longest follow-up times, in order to exploit the potential of machine learning to improve AD dementia detection in the usually small available cohorts. Although we explored a relatively long 5-year follow-up, it is likely that a nonnegligible proportion of our stable MCI over 5 years is still affected by AD and presented evident atrophies at baseline, as suggested by the fact that we obtained a significant number of false positives. In this context, and given the lack of data with long follow-ups, the usually abandoned strategy of using NC vs. AD for training might be more adequate than what was expected.\nThis study had some limitations. ADNI1 and ADNI2 used MRI scanners with different field strengths, so combining results from both studies might have influenced our results.\nHowever, our models were fitted separately for ADNI1 and ADNI2 data, contributing to a better control of bias and generalizability. The heterogeneous protocols in ADNI1 and ADNI2, combining different sequences, are sources of variability whose assessment is beyond the scope of this work but that definitively need to be addressed in future studies. Since we focused on patients with long follow-up, our results might suffer from survivor bias. Nevertheless, Subanalysis 2, performed on the patients that did not reach the follow-up time, supported our conclusions, so we conclude that this source of bias is not significantly affecting our conclusions."}, {"section_title": "Performance evaluation", "text": "In order to obtain an index for the prediction of MCI progression based on baseline MRI data, we fitted logistic regressions on each NC vs. AD sample from ADNI1 (1.5T) and ADNI2 (3T).
