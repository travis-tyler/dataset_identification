Van Metre,* Jeffrey W. Frey, MaryLynn Musgrove, Naomi Nakagaki, Sharon Qi, Barbara J. Mahler, Michael E. Wieczorek, and Daniel T. Button T he USEPA lists nutrients as the second leading cause of impairment in rivers and streams in the United States (USEPA, 2006) . Nutrient enrichment-primarily nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)-can lead to shifts in species composition, reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, fish kills, and toxic algae blooms. Excess nutrients in water also can spur algal growth, resulting in taste and odor problems if the water body is used as a drinking water source (USEPA, 2000a). The USEPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) for nitrate in drinking water is 10 mg L -1 as N based on concern for metheloglobinemia in infants (USEPA, 2015) . Streams in the Midwest Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin) have some of the highest concentrations of nutrients in the United States; of the Corn Belt states, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa have the highest nutrient application rates and yields to streams (Dubrovsky et al., 2012; Ruddy et al., 2006) . Nitrogen sources in the Mississippi River basin, which includes the US Midwest, have been linked to Gulf of Mexico hypoxia (Goolsby et al., 1999; Rabalais et al., 1996) . The USEPA characterized 71% of stream miles in the Temperate Plains Ecoregion (central United States region, including the Corn Belt) as being in fair (13%) or poor (58%) condition on the basis of total N concentrations during the 2008-2009 National River and Stream Assessment (NRSA) (USEPA, 2013) .\nAntecedent moisture conditions affect N concentrations and loads in streams in agricultural settings, with the typical pattern being increased N export after a prolonged drought (Garrett, 2012; Gentry et al., 2014; Lucey and Goolsby, 1993; Macrae et al., 2010; Murphy et al., 2014) . Most studies have been performed in one or a few small watersheds (Burt and Worrall, 2009; Gentry et al., 2014; Macrae et al., 2010) or on larger rivers with long (decades) temporal records of flow and water quality (Lucey and Goolsby, 1993; Murphy et al., 2014) . A mass-balance analysis of N over a dry-wet multiyear cycle found that watershed inputs were greater than outputs during the dry year and that outputs were greater during the subsequent wet year, suggesting carryover of N stored in the soil (Gentry et al., 2009 ).\nThey noted large tile-drain and riverine loads during higherthan-normal precipitation in April to June of the wet year. Murphy et al. (2014) reported that nitrate concentrations in the upper Mississippi River and three major tributaries (Illinois, Ohio, and Iowa Rivers) were anomalously high in years when the mean daily streamflow for the previous year was lower than average. Murphy et al. (2014) hypothesized that nitrate that accumulates in these basins during a drought is flushed to streams during subsequent high flows.\nThe 2012 drought in the Midwest was the most severe and extensive in at least 25 yr (USDA, 2014b). The drought had a pronounced effect on agriculture in the region: corn yields and production in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri were 16 to 34% lower in 2012 relative to 2011 (USDA-NASS, 2013a). High nitrate concentrations in streams in 2013 negatively affected some water users. During spring and summer 2013, the Des Moines (Iowa) Water Works had to activate its nitrate removal facility for 74 d to decrease nitrate concentrations in water from the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers to levels acceptable for drinking (i.e., less than or equal to the MCL) (Meinch, 2015a) . That was the largest number of days of nitrate removal operation since 1999 (median of 22 d, 1992-2015) , although in 2015 the facility set a new record by operating for 177 d ( Jeff Mitchell, Laboratory Supervisor, Des Moines Water Works, personal communication, April 2016). In March 2015, the Des Moines Water Works filed a lawsuit in federal court against three rural Iowa counties to recover added treatment costs and lost revenue associated with elevated nitrate concentrations (Meinch, 2015b) .\nIn 2013, the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Project and the USEPA NRSA collaborated to assess stream quality across the Midwest (Van Metre et al., 2012) . The goal was to characterize water-quality stressorscontaminants, nutrients, sediment, and habitat-and ecological conditions in streams across the Midwest region and to determine the relative effects of these stressors on aquatic organisms. The Midwest region was selected because it is one of the most intensive and economically important agricultural regions of the country. The region also is the largest contributor of nutrients to the lower Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico (Robertson et al., 2009) . Herein we present an analysis of the occurrence and likely causative factors of nitrate concentrations in streams in 2013, a widely recognized stressor of aquatic ecology (e.g., USEPA, 2013) . The combination of a drought in 2012 and normal to wet conditions in 2013 allowed us to test for the effects of multiyear precipitation cycles on nitrate in streams in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design and Setting", "text": "For the USGS Midwest Stream Quality Assessment (MSQA), 100 wadeable streams each were sampled 12 times between early May and early August 2013 to characterize water quality (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). At the end of the sampling period, ecological surveys were done at all sites, and bed sediment samples were collected for chemical analysis and toxicity testing. The MSQA study combined the targeted design of the USGS NAWQA Program (e.g., Coles et al., 2012) and the probabilistic design of the USEPA NRSA (Olsen et al., 1999; USEPA, 2013) to select 100 sites on wadeable streams for sampling (Supplemental Fig. S1 ; Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Fifty sites were selected by the USEPA; inclusion or exclusion of candidate sites followed USEPA protocols (USEPA, 2013) with the exception that larger, nonwadeable streams and some very small, potentially ephemeral streams were excluded. The remaining 50 sites were selected by the USGS on the basis of watershed characteristics and included a subset of sites with long-term monitoring data. These targeted sites were added to achieve full coverage of the range in stressor levels in the region by adding reference, lowintensity agricultural, and urban sites (Van Metre et al., 2012) . This study, therefore, characterizes wadeable (i.e., less than about 1 m deep in most of the sampling reach at base flow) perennial streams in the region.\nThe MSQA study region encompassed all or part of six USEPA level 3 ecoregions. Small parts of surrounding ecoregions were included where the watershed of a site extended outside of the six primary ecoregions (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Land use in the MSQA region is dominated by cultivated crops, primarily corn and soybeans. For some interpretations, level 3 ecoregions were grouped into three relatively homogeneous subregions of MSQA identified as the West, East, and South that are delineated based on level 3 ecoregion boundaries (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Watershed characteristics were determined for two groups of sites-the 100 MSQA sites and 79 stream sites (Supplemental Table S3 ) sampled historically by the USGS across the region (watershed delineation is described in Supplemental information). Land use within the 100 MSQA watersheds reflects the land use within the region, with the average watershed being 54% row crop, 11% pasture and hay, 8% urban (compared with 57, 12, and 10%, respectively, for the whole region), and most of the remainder in woodlands and grasslands. The climate is temperate, with cold winters and hot, humid summers, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 14\u00b0C. Annual precipitation ranges from 69 cm in the western to 130 cm in the eastern parts of the study region (USAclimatedata, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling, Analytical Methods, and Quality Control", "text": "Twelve samples were collected at each site over a 14-wk period (early May to early August 2013) with a weekly sampling interval except for two 2-wk periods (one sample during 2 wk) in late May/early June and in early July. Although sampling did not target high flows associated with runoff events, higher-thannormal precipitation across the region in May and June caused sustained high flows (Supplemental Fig. S2 and S3), which were captured by the weekly sampling. Samples were analyzed for nutrients, pesticides, major ions, and suspended sediment (Van Metre et al., 2012) . All samples for analysis of nutrients were collected according to standard USGS and NAWQA protocols, typically by using a depth-integrating sampler at multiple vertical locations in the stream cross-section (USGS, 2006) . Samples for analysis of dissolved nutrients were filtered in the field using a capsule filter with an acrylic copolymer membrane with a pore size of 0.45 mm. Nutrient samples were chilled and maintained at 4\u00b0C until analysis at the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Lakewood, CO. Nitrite (NO 2 ) plus nitrate (NO 3 ) was analyzed according to methods described by Fishman (1993) . The median and maximum nitrite concentrations were 0.025 and 0.60 mg L -1 as N, respectively, about 70 times lower than the associated nitrate concentrations (Supplemental Table S4 ; all concentrations are reported in mg L -1 as N), and the correlation coefficient between nitrate and nitrite plus nitrate is effectively 1.0 (>0.9999). Hereafter nitrate refers to the sum of nitrite plus nitrate. A total of 1199 environmental samples were collected at the 100 sites. There were 60 blank samples collected from 59 sites (one site had two blanks collected) to assess sampling contamination. There were no detections of nitrate in any of the blanks. There were 59 replicate samples collected from 51 sites to assess analytical precision. With the exception of three outliers, the relative percent difference between the two replicate samples was less than 4.5%, with a median relative percent difference of 0.7%. The three outliers had percent differences of 5.8, 10.9, and 21.8%, and two of the three had concentrations <1 mg L Nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate can indicate contributions from different sources of N, distinguishing, for example, among fertilizer, soil organic N, and N from human and animal waste (Kendall et al., 2008) . Samples were collected during the fourth sampling visit from 28 May to 7 June (one sample was taken on 21 May) and during the 11th visit from 29 July to 2 August, with the objectives of representing spring high-flow and summer base-flow conditions, respectively. Samples were filtered in the field, chilled, and frozen pending results of analysis of nitrate concentration (which was needed to determine sample volume to process samples for isotope analysis). Samples for 15 N and 18 O analysis were prepared by freeze-drying, ion exchange, and conversion of NO 3 to nitrous oxide, which was analyzed by continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry at the USGS Reston Stable Isotope Laboratory in Reston, VA (R\u00e9v\u00e9sz and Casciotti, 2007) . Isotope ratios are expressed in delta (d) notation as the ratio of the heavy to the light isotope, normalized to a standard, in per mil (\u2030). Precision is estimated to be \u00b1 0.4\u2030 (R\u00e9v\u00e9sz and Casciotti, 2007) . Results are given in Supplemental Table S5 ."}, {"section_title": "Historical Data and Antecedent Conditions", "text": "Two sets of historical data were used for comparison to 2013 MSQA results. Historical data for 1143 stream sites sampled in the MSQA region at least six times during May to July from any combination of years between 1992 and 2011 (Supplemental Table S6 ) were compared with 2013 MSQA nitrate concentrations on a state-by-state basis. Although dry and wet years occurred in the region during 1992 to 2011, no instances of as pronounced a dry-wet cycle as 2012 to 2013 occurred ( Supplemental Fig. S4) ; therefore, no historical data were excluded because of precipitation anomalies. The data, compiled by the USGS and the Northeast-Midwest Institute, are from multiple local, state, federal, and tribal agencies (Betanzo et al., 2015) . This large historical dataset was further screened to provide a set of sites as comparable as possible to the MSQA sites that was suitable for the development of a regression model of mean May to June nitrate concentrations. The regression model was used to evaluate whether May to June nitrate concentrations measured in 2013 were significantly different from what was expected given the setting of each MSQA site. Screening criteria included sampling done by the USGS, watershed area less than 2400 km 2 , and 12 or more samples collected in May and June (mean of 31 samples) with sampling spanning at least 3 yr.\nSeventy-nine sites met these criteria (Supplemental Table S3 ). Only USGS sites were used to provide better consistency for sampling and analytical methods with MSQA sampling.\nWatershed characteristics and nitrate data for the 79 historically sampled sites were used to develop a regression equation to predict expected mean May to June nitrate concentrations across the region. Linear, logarithmic, and square root transformations of mean May to June nitrate concentration were tested; the square root was used because it most closely approximated a normal distribution. Seventeen independent variables were evaluated for inclusion in the regression model (Supplemental Table S7 ). Independent variables were tested that were more highly correlated to nitrate concentration and not highly correlated to one another. Model development attempted to adequately meet regression assumptions (e.g., normally distributed residuals) using as few independent variables as possible yet still achieving reasonable predictive power. Statistica and R were used for modeling and for evaluating residuals. The final variables chosen for inclusion in the regression equation were N application rate (fertilizer and manure) in the watershed (kg km -2\n) and the percentage of watershed area in pasture and hay (Supplemental Table S7 ). The adjusted r 2 of the equation was 0.73. The regression equation was applied to the 100 MSQA sites to estimate the expected mean May-June nitrate concentration at each site. Following the approach described in Nowell et al. (2006) , the probability that the observed concentration exceeded the 95th percentile confidence interval of the predicted mean May-June nitrate concentration was determined. This probability is a function of the predicted concentration for a site and the overall model error, and it can be approximated by algebraically rearranging the formula for computing prediction interval limits. For sites where the p-value was <0.05 (95% confidence), it was concluded that the nitrate concentration measured in 2013 was a significant anomaly.\nEvaluation of the effect of antecedent moisture condition on nitrate concentration requires a measure of the departure from normal for moisture condition as well as for nitrate concentration. Long-term and 2013 moisture conditions at the 100 MSQA sites were characterized using PRISM climate data (Daly et al., 2008) . PRISM compiles point measurements of precipitation and temperature and develops spatial climate datasets that cover the United States. PRISM estimates of monthly precipitation for 1981 to 2013 were obtained on a 4-km grid. Departure from normal for each month in 2012 and 2013 was calculated as the ratio of each month's precipitation to the long-term (1981-2010) mean precipitation for that month. April 2012 to March 2013 was selected to represent antecedent moisture condition on the basis of monthly precipitation and continuous nitrate and streamflow data at three sites monitored in 2012 and 2013, two of which were sampled by MSQA. The 12 mo preceding the 2013 growing season were selected based on the assumption that fall and winter precipitation and runoff would affect nitrate storage and availability during the subsequent spring runoff. This assumption was supported by flow and nitrate concentration patterns at the three continuously monitored sites. April to July 2013 was used to represent the MSQA sampling period. Departure from normal for each of those two periods was calculated as the mean of the monthly ratios to the long-term mean. We took the ratio of the April to July 2013 departure from normal to the April 2012 to March 2013 departure from normal as the antecedent precipitation index for the site (PPT 13/12 ). Thus, if the 12-mo period of April 2012 to March 2013 was, on average, 20% drier than normal (mean of 12 monthly ratios of 0.8) and the 4-mo period of April to July 2013 was, on average, 20% wetter than normal (mean ratio of 1.2), the antecedent precipitation index for the site was 1.2/0.8 = 1.5."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Nitrate concentrations measured for the MSQA study ranged from less than the reporting level (0.04 mg L Tables S4 and S8 ). The mean nitrate concentration exceeded the MCL of 10 mg L -1 at 12 sites in Iowa, four sites in Minnesota, four sites in Illinois, and one site in Nebraska (Fig. 1) . The highest concentrations were measured in streams in Iowa and Minnesota: the mean nitrate concentrations in Iowa (17 sites) and Minnesota (seven sites) were 14.4 and 10.2 mg L -1 , respectively. A concentration greater than 20 mg L -1 was measured in at least one sample from 14 sites (Fig. 1) . The highest nitrate concentrations (mean, 30.4; maximum, 41.8 mg L . Nitrate concentrations were lowest in the eastern part of the MSQA region and near the northern and southern borders, with mean concentrations ranging from 0.28 to 3.0 mg L -1 for sites in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, and Kansas. Spatial variations in mean nitrate concentrations are apparent among ecoregion-based subregions ( Fig. 1) : concentrations in the West subregion, on average, were about 2.5 times greater than in the East subregion and about 6 times greater than in the South subregion (Supplemental Table S8 ).\nNitrate concentrations declined throughout the MSQA region during the sampling period. Concentrations at most sites were highest in May and June, decreased through July, and, by the first week of August (last sample), concentrations were about one third to one half of the maximum concentration (Supplemental Table S8 ). In 2013, the decrease in nitrate concentrations coincided with a decrease in rainfall and stream flow over the 3-mo sampling period; rainfall decreased by a factor of about 3 from May to August across the 100 MSQA sites (Supplemental Fig. S2 )."}, {"section_title": "Comparison to Historical Data", "text": "Geographic patterns of historical nitrate concentrations by state are similar to those measured in 2013, with the highest concentrations in Minnesota and Iowa, followed by Illinois, and the lowest concentrations across the southern part of the region (Kansas and Missouri) (Fig. 2) . Nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in Iowa in 2013 than those measured historically (Mann-Whitney U test; p < 0.005); for most other states, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) or the sample size was too small to warrant a test (Kansas, South Dakota, and Kentucky). Data for Indiana indicated that 2013 concentrations were significantly lower than historical concentrations (p < 0.005).\nThree USGS NAWQA sites at which nitrate concentrations have been measured more or less monthly since the early 1990s were included in the MSQA study: South Fork Iowa River near New Providence, Iowa; Sugar Creek at New Palestine, Indiana; and Maple Creek at Nickerson, Nebraska (Supplemental Fig. S1 , Map_IDs 12, 48, and 83, respectively). Nitrate concentrations measured in 2013 at the Iowa site were higher than at any time since sampling began in 1996 (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). At the Indiana and Nebraska sites, in contrast, nitrate concentrations measured in 2013 were typical of historical concentrations (12th and 10th highest medians out of 22 yr of sampling at the Indiana and Nebraska sites, respectively). These comparisons are consistent with the historical regional pattern of higher nitrate concentrations measured in Iowa streams than in Nebraska and Indiana streams and the centering of an apparent nitrate anomaly in 2013 on Iowa and Minnesota (Fig. 2) . Nitrate concentrations measured in May and June 2013 were significantly elevated at 17 of the 100 MSQA sites, as determined by comparison of observed and predicted concentrations (p < 0.05). These sites were in Iowa (nine sites), Minnesota (four sites), Illinois (three sites), and Missouri (one site) ( Fig. 3 ; Supplemental Table S8 ). The residual nitrate concentration in 2013 (observed minus predicted) are weakly correlated with PPT 13/12 (r = 0.22; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4) . One reason for the relatively weak relation might be that nitrate source strength (e.g., fertilizer application, corn acreage, etc.) also affects nitrate concentrations. The 17 sites with a significant nitrate anomaly in 2013 also had a historical May to June nitrate concentration, PPT 13/12 , and residual nitrate concentration significantly higher than the other 83 sites (Table 1 ) (Mann-Whitney U test; p < 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Relations to Watershed Characteristics", "text": "Correlations between land use and other watershed characteristics and the mean nitrate concentration (all 12 MSQA samples) for each of the 100 MSQA sites were evaluated using the nonparametric Kendall's t test. Eighteen of the 24 variables tested had significant univariate rank correlations with nitrate Table S9 ). The strongest relations were to agricultural land-use variables (in order of decreasing t value): percentage of the watershed in corn in 2012, the percentage in corn in 2013, application rate of N (kg km -2 ), percentage of the watershed in row crops in 2011, and application rate of P (t = 0.56-0.64). These five variables correlate to one another (t = 0.64-0.85) and represent the same general factor: anthropogenic N source strength. An exponential regression equation indicates that corn production in 2012 in the watershed explains 67% of the variance in mean 2013 nitrate concentration (Fig. 5) . When sites are grouped into categories of land use, sites with watersheds that are dominated by row crops had significantly higher nitrate concentrations than sites with watersheds dominated by urban, grassland, or less developed (reference) land use (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p < 0.001) (Supplemental Fig. S6) .\nMost of the other variables tested that correlated significantly to nitrate concentration affect the transport of chemicals to streams. Most notable among these are soil K factor (r = -0.457; an indicator of the erodibility of the soil) and three different geographic information system layers that estimate the percentage of land that is under subsurface tile drainage (r = 0.369-0.406) (Supplemental Table S9 ). The strongest correlation for tile drains is to a data layer processed for this study that used 2012 Census of Agriculture statewide estimates and a geographic information system approach that assigned the statewide estimates to cropland overlying poorly drained soils (Nakagaki and Wieczorek, 2016) . One caution, however, in interpreting these relations is the large uncertainty and temporal variability in the available geographic data sets."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen and Oxygen Isotopes", "text": "Graphical comparison of the isotopic ratios indicates that ammonium fertilizer (NH 4 ), soil NO 3 , and human and animal waste NO 3 contribute to nitrate for the MSQA sites (Fig. 6) . In May, most of the higher-concentration samples (\u226510 mg L -1 ) plot in the soil NO 3 and NH 4 zones. Human and animal waste NO 3 and soil NO 3 sources are indicated for many of the lower-concentration samples in May. In July, when stream flow and nitrate concentrations were lower than in May, there was an isotopic shift in 15 N away from fertilizer sources and toward animal waste sources and/or denitrification (Fig. 6) ; denitrification is more clearly indicated for sites in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois, which had higher nitrate concentrations, than for sites in the other states (Supplemental Fig. S7 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The MSQA provided a unique opportunity to assess the effects of a wet year following a drought year on nitrate concentrations in streams at a regional scale in an area of intensive agriculture. We hypothesize that anomalously high concentrations of nitrate in streams in part of the region in 2013 resulted from a lack of rain during the previous year, which led to N accumulation in the soils and the subsequent mobilization of nitrate by precipitation in 2013. Significant differences in nitrate concentrations, residuals, and PPT 13/12 for sites with a significant anomaly relative to sites without an anomaly (Table 1) and correlation of the precipitation index (PPT 13/12 ) and the nitrate residual in 2013 (Fig. 4) support this hypothesis. A high antecedent precipitation index did not result in a nitrate anomaly for all sites (e.g., \n17 sites with a significant NO 3 anomaly 1.62 \u00b1 0.23 19.8 \u00b1 6.6 10.4 \u00b1 4.6 83 sites without a significant NO 3 anomaly 1.35 \u00b1 0.21 3.56 \u00b1 3.8 \u22120.97 \u00b1 4.6 \u2020 The residual is the difference between the measured and the predicted nitrate concentration. along the western edge of the region in Kansas and Nebraska) (Fig. 3) . Elevated nitrate concentrations in streams depend not only on precipitation patterns but also on N source strength; the mean percentage corn in 2012 for the 11 sites in Kansas and Nebraska was 22 \u00b1 16%, much lower than the mean of 50 \u00b1 13% for the 17 sites with a significant anomaly, which might explain the lack of elevated nitrate concentrations at these sites. The relations between nitrate concentrations and corn production (Fig. 5 ) and the N and O isotopic ratios (Fig. 6 ) indicate that use of N fertilizer and manure on row crops (mainly corn) is the primary source of nitrate to small streams in the region. The great majority of N fertilizer use in the region is for corn (in 2010, 95-99% of N fertilizer use in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana was for corn) (USDA-NASS, 2013b) . In addition to fertilizer and manure sources, N and O isotopes suggest soil NO 3 as a source (Fig. 6) . Mineralization of soil organic matter is an important source of nitrate to shallow groundwater in the Midwest. Nolan et al. (2012) attributed significant amounts of nitrate in drainage and leachate to mineralization, noting that in their models, mineralization estimates in Iowa exceeded fertilizer inputs. Minet et al. (2012) concluded that mineralization and the nitrification of soil organic N, stimulated by previous and current management practices, can mask the original N source from the isotopic perspective. The soil NO 3 source thus might represent fertilizer and manure applications and plant matter from the previous year(s) that were transformed to nitrate by mineralization of plant matter and nitrification.\nSignificant relations between nitrate concentrations in streams and soil K factor, soil organic matter content, base-flow index, and subsurface tile drains indicate that these variables affect the transport of nitrate to streams and thereby affect nitrate concentrations. A longterm study of three Illinois watersheds concluded that artificial tile drainage was the primary mechanism for N export and that it was strongly correlated to elevated discharges (Royer et al., 2006) . Greater intensity of corn production and differences in tile drainage and soil characteristics might contribute to the historically higher nitrate concentrations in streams in the West subregion in normal precipitation years.\nAt least three factors might be contributing to the decrease in nitrate concentrations at most MSQA sites during the period from May to August 2013. Median monthly precipitation for the 100 MSQA sites decreased from 143 mm in May to 61 mm in July and was 45 mm in August 2013 (Supplemental Fig.  S2 ). The decrease in precipitation during the sampling period suggests reduced transport of nitrate from fields to streams, including by tile drains (Royer et al., 2006) . Reduced rainfall later in the growing season might further result in cessation of flow and NO 3 discharge from tile drains (Gentry et al., 2009 (Gentry et al., , 2014 . Second, fertilizer applications occur in the fall and spring, and, over time after spring applications, depletion of soil N by runoff and uptake by plants, as well as uptake by algae and aquatic plants in the streams, will reduce stream concentrations of N. Third, the isotopic shift toward higher d 15 N and d"}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "O values for some sites ( Fig. 6; Supplemental Fig. S6 ) suggests a proportional increase in nitrate affected by denitrification, which means loss of N to the atmosphere. In-stream denitrification likely contributes to the lower nitrate concentrations during summer low-flow periods but is unlikely to be a major sink for nitrate in the small streams during high-flow and higher-nitrate concentration periods in May and June (Royer et al., 2004) . Denitrification also can occur in groundwater before discharge to streams (Anderson et al., 2014; McMahon and Bohkle, 1996) . It is notable that the states with the highest nitrate concentrations (Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois) are the states with the clearest isotopic evidence of denitrification (Supplemental Fig. S7) . Some of the factors that correlate with high nitrate in streams also might enhance soil denitrification in the fields and in shallow groundwater (Gentry et al., 2009) , such as positive relations to base flow index and soil organic matter (Supplemental Table S9 ). , often by a factor of 2 or more ( Fig. 1 ; Supplemental Table S8 ). The recommended USEPA nitrate criteria for streams in the parts of USEPA ecoregion VI that coincide with the MSQA study region range from 1.60 to 1.97 mg L -1 (USEPA, 2000b), levels that were exceeded at over one half of the MSQA sites in 2013 based on mean concentrations. The highest nitrate concentrations (>40 mg L -1 ) measured in 2013 are among the highest measured in small streams historically across the region and the nation (Dubrovsky et al., 2012) . In addition to the extensively documented adverse effects of excessive N on ecological condition (USEPA, 2000a), nitrate concentrations of this magnitude might be toxic to some invertebrates in streams.\nThe Great Lakes Environmental Center tested the toxicity of nitrate to seven aquatic species and estimated that nitrate LC 50 values (the concentration expected to kill 50% of the organisms) range from 16.4 to 937 mg L -1 (USEPA, 2010). The most sensitive (i.e., the lowest LC 50 value) was for Hyalella azteca (16.4 mg L -1 ), which was exceeded in 9% of MSQA samples and was exceeded by the mean concentration at nine sites, eight of which were in Iowa and one of which was in Minnesota.\nThe historical data indicate that the Iowa and Minnesota streams sampled have median nitrate concentrations 3 to 8 mg L -1 greater than streams in the other Midwest states (Fig. 2) . Much of this difference can be linked to differences in the intensity of corn production across the region, a factor that has changed over time. Hatfield et al. (2009) reported that nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River in Iowa had increased since 1970 coincident with increasing dominance of corn and soybeans and the reduction of small grains and hay crops. Annual mean nitrate concentrations increased from 1 to 2 mg L -1 in the early 1970s to 7 to 10 mg L -1 by the 1990s and 2000s, with no significant trend in concentrations from 1992 to 2008 (Hatfield et al., 2009; Jayasinghe et al., 2012) . Mean nitrate concentrations at the two MSQA sites in the Raccoon River basin were 17.6 and 19.8 mg L -1\n. Others also have shown evidence that this crop management change has led to higher nitrate concentrations over time in Iowa (Schilling and Libra, 2003) . The trend in conversion of grasslands and wetlands to corn/soy production accelerated in the western Corn Belt after 2005 coincident with the expansion of the biofuel industry; the net loss of grassland to corn and/or soybean production from 2006 to 2011 was estimated to be 152,000 ha in Iowa and 52,000 ha in Minnesota (Wright and Wimberly, 2013) . The strong association of corn production and nitrate in streams (Fig. 5) suggests that the expansion of corn production, particularly on more marginal lands in Iowa and Minnesota (Wright and Wimberly, 2013) , is putting upward pressure on trends in nitrate concentrations in streams. The expansion of subsurface tile drainage in the western part of the MSQA region in the past two decades also might be affecting nitrate concentration trends. Comparing tile drainage area by state from the 2012 Census of Agriculture (USDA, 2014a) and the early 1990s estimates of Sugg (2007) indicates a 43% increase in tile drainage area in Iowa and a 38% increase in Minnesota but little change in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.\nThe effect of dry-wet multiyear weather cycles on nitrate concentrations in small agricultural streams has implications at larger scales. The effect of antecedent streamflow condition on nitrate concentrations was reported for sampling sites on the Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, and upper Mississippi Rivers; these sites have watersheds ranging in area from 32,375 to 221,700 km 2 . Nitrate loads in the Mississippi River in 2013 were unusually high; springtime nitrate load in the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, LA, exceeded the 85th percentile of long-term estimated loads, and the June and July loads exceeded the 90th percentiles for those months (Pellerin et al., 2014) . The MSQA region is estimated to contribute about 64% of the N load reaching the Gulf of Mexico in a typical year (Robertson et al., 2009) , although it covers only about 20% of the Mississippi River drainage area (Supplemental Fig. S8 ). As shown here, a strong precipitation-driven nitrate anomaly occurred in 2013 over part of the MSQA study region (Fig. 3) . The coincidence of the nitrate anomaly in part of the MSQA region and higher-than-normal N loading in the Mississippi River in 2013 suggests that anomalous multiyear precipitation patterns in this relatively small but intensively farmed area of the Midwest might substantially affect N loading to the Gulf of Mexico. Justic et al. (2005) have shown that climate-driven variations in the Mississippi River fluxes of freshwater and nutrients strongly influence the areal extent and severity of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate forecasting and the record over the past 20 yr indicate wetter conditions in the US Midwest with more frequent heat waves, floods, and droughts (USGCRP, 2009 ). Events such as the nitrate anomaly of 2013 could thus become more common in the future."}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Material", "text": "All data used in analyses presented here are available in machine-readable format at http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/ F7Z03672.
