[{"section_title": "Operations of U.S. Multinational Companies in 2005", "text": "By Ray Mataloni T HREE key measures of the worldwide operations of nonbank U.S. multinational companies (MNCs)-value added, employment, and capital expenditures-continued to increase in 2005, according to preliminary results from the annual survey of U.S. direct investment abroad conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). 1 The results discussed in this article supersede the advance summary estimates that were released in April. From the advance estimates to the preliminary estimates, the estimate of employ ment was revised up 0.6 percent, the estimate of capital expenditures was revised down 5.7 percent, and the es timate of sales was revised down 0.8 percent. In 2005, growth in all three measures of MNC oper ations continued at a healthy pace for the second consecutive year after unusual decreases in [2001][2002][2003] for employment and capital expenditures and in 2001-2002 for value added. Both domestic and foreign operations continued to grow. The worldwide currentdollar value added of U.S. MNCs-the combined value added of U.S. parent companies and their majorityowned foreign affiliates (\"foreign affiliates\")-in creased 6.5 percent in 2005; value added of parents increased 6.0 percent, while valued added of foreign af filiates increased 7.8 percent. Value added measures the contribution of a company to the Gross domestic product of the country in which it resides. Worldwide employment by U.S. MNCs increased 3.0 percent in 2005. Employment by parents increased 2.8 percent. And employment by foreign affiliates in creased 3.3 percent. Worldwide capital expenditures by U.S. MNCs increased 3.9 percent. Expenditures by par ents increased 4.4 percent. And expenditures by for eign affiliates increased 2.8 percent. Production by MNCs expanded along with world wide economic activity: Growth in the value added of 1. A U.S. MNC comprises a U.S. parent company and its foreign affiliates. For both conceptual and practical reasons, the examination of foreign oper ations of U.S. MNCs in this article generally focuses on data for majorityowned foreign affiliates (MOFAs) rather than data for all foreign affiliates. Conceptually, most data users prefer using the data for majority-owned affiliates because such affiliates are unambiguously under U.S. control; for eign affiliates that are minority-owned by a U.S. resident could be under the control of foreign investors. In addition, some of the data items necessary for the examination of foreign operations of U.S. MNCs are more easily col lected for majority-owned affiliates, and most foreign affiliates are majority owned; majority-owned affiliates accounted for 87 percent of the employ ment by all nonbank foreign affiliates in 2005. U.S. parents (6.0 percent) approached that of currentdollar U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) (6.4 per cent); growth in the value added of foreign affiliates (7.8 percent) approached that of worldwide GDP (8.0 percent). 2 A sharp rise in crude oil prices (35.9 per cent) also contributed to the growth in current-dollar value added of U.S. MNCs. Value added of MNCs not involved in the extraction or refining of crude oil and natural gas increased 5.1 percent, compared with a 6.5 percent increase in value added for MNCs in all indus tries. Estimates of real value added by foreign affiliates in manufacturing, discussed later in this article, indi cate that real output of these affiliates decreased in 2005. Increases in MNC value added were widespread by industry and by geographic area. By industry, some of the sharpest increases were in mining (mainly oil and gas extraction), manufacturing, and \"other industries\" (mainly retail trade). By geographic area, the increases were sharpest in Africa and the Middle East (mainly in petroleum-producing countries) and in Asia and Pa cific (chart 1). By area, the largest dollar increases were in Europe and in Asia and Pacific; by industry, the larg est dollar increases were in manufacturing and in min ing. The following are additional highlights of MNC op erations in 2005: \u2022 The operations of U.S. MNCs remained concen trated in the United States: U.S. parents accounted for a little more than 70 percent, and foreign affili ates for a little less than 30 percent, of their com bined value added of $3,185.2 billion, capital expenditures of $450.8 billion, and employment of 30.7 million (table 1). However, the parent shares were down roughly 4 percentage points from the shares in the 1999 benchmark (or census) survey year. \u2022 Most foreign affiliates continued to be located in high-income countries. In 2005, affiliates in these countries accounted for 81 percent of the value added by all affiliates and for 76 percent of the value added by affiliates that were newly acquired or established. However, the high-income-country share of value added by all affiliates in 2005 was down 4 percentage points from its level in the 1999 benchmark survey year.  1993 ............................................... 24,221.5 22,760.2 17,536.9 6,684.6 5,223.3 1,461.3 1999-2004................................. -2.3 -2.1 -3.4 0.4 1.7 -5.3 1994 ............................................... 25,670.0 24,272.5 18,565.4 7,104.6 5,707.1 1,397.5 2004-2005 MNCs Multinational companies 1.

MNC-associated imports of goods increased 11.5 percent to $603.3 billion. The increase was slightly less pronounced than the increase in total U.S. imports of goods; as a result, the MNC-associated share of total U.S. imports of goods edged down 1 percentage point to 36 percent. The increase in MNC-associated exports of goods in 2005 reflected increases in both trade between U.S. parents and their foreign affiliates and trade be tween U.S. MNCs and \"others\" (trade between U.S. parent companies and foreigners other than their own affiliates and trade between foreign affiliates and U.S. residents other than their own parents). U.S. exports between U.S. parents and foreign affiliates increased 10.5 percent, and exports between U.S. MNCs and others increased 11.5 percent. By industry of U.S. parent, the largest increase in exports between U.S. MNCs and others was by parents in manufacturing, mainly transportation equipment and petroleum and coal products manufacturing. By industry of foreign affiliate, the largest increases in intra-MNC exports were to affiliates in manufacturing, mainly semicon ductors and other electronic components and trans portation equipment manufacturing.

R&D expendi tures by foreign affiliates increased 9.6 percent to $28.3 billion. By industry of U.S. parent, the largest increases in R&D expenditures were in manufacturing, mainly transportation equipment and computers and electronic products manufacturing. Within transpor tation equipment, R&D expenditures were boosted by motor vehicles manufacturers' research directed to ward improving fuel efficiency. Within computers and electronic products, producers of microprocessors in creased their R&D, partly to support customers that produce advanced computer and telecommunications products. 4.

R&D expenditures in information decreased sub stantially. However, information from public financial reports suggests that at least some of the decrease re sulted from lower compensation costs for R&D em ployees stemming from decreases in the cost of employee stock options rather than from a reduction in R&D activity.\nIn 2005, the cost of R&D performed by U.S. parents to taled $178.5 billion, compared with $164.2 billion in 2004. U.S. parents accounted for 78.9 percent of total R&D performed by all U.S. businesses in 2005 (table  7). This share is notably higher than parents' share of private industry value added, which was 24.2 percent, and of employment, which was 18.6 percent. Taken to gether, these shares suggest that production by U.S. parents is highly R&D intensive. R&D expenditures in three industry sectors-man ufacturing ($144.7 billion), information ($12.7 bil lion), and professional, scientific, and technical services ($13.9 billion)-accounted for 96 percent of all R&D expenditures by U.S. parents in 2005. Within these sectors, R&D expenditures were concentrated in only a few industries, including transportation equip ment manufacturing ($42.2 billion), pharmaceuticals and medicines manufacturing ($36.6 billion), publish ing-mainly software publishing-($9.3 billion), and computer systems design and related services ($9.5 bil lion). Some segments of these four industry groups have been cited as being among those in which U.S. firms-including U.S. parent companies-have main tained a global competitive advantage in recent de cades.  2,173,467 2,303,060 129,593 6.0 Mining ............................................................................... 44,226 52,376 8,150 18.4 Utilities .............................................................................. 89,765 75,032 1,052,546 94,514 9.9 Of which: Food \nR&D expenditures by foreign affiliates increased 9.6 percent to $28.3 billion in 2005 (table 13). The loca tion of R&D expenditures continued to be concen trated in a small number of host countries. Seven countries-the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Japan, Singapore, and China-accounted for two-thirds of total R&D performed by foreign affiliates in 2005. Just two of these countries-the United King dom and Germany-together accounted for over a third of the all-countries total. The conduct of R&D in foreign countries that are similar to the United States in level of economic development is a longstanding tendency that partly reflects an effort to incorporate local consumer tastes in product design by performing R&D in the largest foreign markets and that partly re flects the importance of the local presence of worldclass centers of learning from which to attract R&D scientists.

Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corre  the top seven locations for R&D by foreign affiliates is a relatively recent phenomenon; it partly reflects the growing importance of East Asian customers in the marketing strategies of U.S. MNCs, the need to de velop products to meet the tastes of those consumers, and the growing technological capabilities of those countries.

This broad definition results in considerable variation across U.S. MNCs in the shares of their worldwide resources located abroad and in the United States. In 2005, employment by foreign affiliates accounted for less than 10 percent of the worldwide employ ment of 24 percent of MNCs and for more than 90 percent of the worldwide employment of 3 percent of MNCs (see the chart). Some U.S. MNCs are very large U.S. companies with small or even miniscule foreign operations; in 2005, for example, there were 46 U.S. MNCs with over 10,000 U.S. employees and fewer than 100 for eign employees. A result of the inclusion of these large but only marginally multinational companies in the U.S.-MNC universe is that when they enter or depart the universe, they have a much larger effect on the measures of U.S. parent operations than on the measures of foreign affiliate operations. When analysts have had discretion over which companies to include in the MNC universe, they have some times used a more restrictive definition that involves some threshold of operations abroad that must be reached before that company is considered to be multinational; for example, one recent study used a criterion in which only companies that had at least 10 percent of their assets abroad were considered to be multinational. 1   1.

In Europe, the value added of affiliates increased $24.8 billion, the largest dollar increase for any area, or 5.4 percent. The increases were widespread by indus try, but the largest increases were in manufacturing (mainly petroleum and coal products), mining (mainly oil and gas extraction) and wholesale trade. These increases partly reflected the rise in petroleum prices. In Latin America and Other Western Hemisphere, the value added of affiliates increased $7.6 billion or 9.7 percent. The largest increases were in manufactur ing, mining, and \"other industries\" (mainly retail trade). Growth in local car sales contributed to the in crease in production by Brazilian affiliates in automo bile manufacturing. The rise in copper prices contributed to the increase in the dollar value of pro duction by affiliates in Peru. The increase in retail trade partly reflected the continued expansion of U.S. based discount retailers in the region. In Canada, the value added of affiliates increased $7.6 billion or 7.7 percent. The largest increases were in mining (mainly oil and gas extraction) and in \"other industries\" (mainly retail trade). The increase in oil and gas extraction partly reflected the rise in petro leum prices, and the increase in retail trade partly re flected the continued expansion of U.S.-based discount retailers. By industry sector, increases were widespread, but  they were largest in manufacturing and in mining (mainly oil and gas extraction). Newly acquired or established affiliates. The in crease in the value added of foreign affiliates in 2005 resulted partly from the addition of affiliates that were newly acquired or established during the year. Data for these affiliates show where U.S. MNCs have been expanding their operations through new business enterprises and thus can provide some evidence of the countries and industries that have offered attrac tive investment opportunities to U.S. MNCs. In 2005, U.S. MNCs acquired or established 836 new foreign af filiates, which had a combined value added of $23.7 billion and a combined employment of 217,600 work ers (table 10). By area, high-income countries accounted for 76.2 percent of the total value added of all new affiliates and for 44.5 percent of the total employment of all new af filiates. New affiliates in high-income countries ac counted for a much larger share of the value added of all new affiliates than of the employment of all new af filiates because affiliates in high-income countries tend to be involved in less labor-intensive industries than af filiates in low-to-middle-income countries. New affili ates in three East Asian countries-Indonesia, China, and Thailand-accounted for nearly two-thirds of the employment of new affiliates in low-to-middle-income countries. Production by new affiliates in these coun tries was overwhelmingly directed toward customers in the host country and in other foreign countries; sales to the United States accounted for less than 10 percent of their total sales. By industry, manufacturing continued to be among the leading industries for new investments in 2005. 7 New manufacturing affiliates accounted for 26.6 percent of all new affiliates, for 22.5 percent of their value added, and for 58.9 percent of their employment. Affiliate share of host-country GDP. Value added of foreign affiliates represents these firms' contribution to a host country's GDP. In 2005, the value added of affil iates accounted for 7.0 percent or more of the GDP of three of the host countries shown in table 11: Ireland (18.5 percent), Singapore (15.0 percent), and Canada (9.5 percent). The relatively high MOFA shares of host-country GDP in these countries can be traced to some of the following factors: A common language 7. \"Holding companies\" also accounted for a large share (15.9 percent) of new affiliates but for very little of the employment or value added of new affiliates. In the last two decades, the number of foreign affiliate holding companies has increased, but this trend has had little effect on the value added or employment of foreign affiliates because the primary activity of these companies is holding the securities or financial assets of other companies.     with the United States, marketing and commercial le gal systems similar to those in the United States, geo graphic proximity to the United States, the availability of a skilled work force, political stability, and low cor porate tax rates. The large affiliate share for Ireland may also be re lated to U.S. MNCs' geographic allocation of their in come from intellectual property rights (such as patents). A sizable share of the investment in Ireland is in industries, such as pharmaceuticals and software engineering, where intellectual property plays a major role. Affiliates in Ireland conduct substantial R&D work, but it appears that a significant portion of the intellectual property held by these affiliates originated as a result of parent-company activity in the United States, and the property rights were subsequently relo-  Gross domestic product data for host countries were obtained from the World Bank Web site. GDP Gross domestic product cated to Ireland where the tax regime for patent royal ties is favorable. The royalty income, much of which is for use of the patents in other countries, is treated as arising from sales of services and is counted as part of the value added of the affiliates that hold them. Al though this treatment is in accordance with accepted guidelines for both financial and economic account ing, some have questioned whether the shifting of rights to intangible assets between the domestic and foreign units of multinational firms, without a com mensurate shift in productive activity, should result in changes in the attribution of production by country. 8 Real value added in manufacturing. In addition to the current-dollar estimates of value added of for eign affiliates, BEA prepares estimates of the real value added of foreign affiliates in manufacturing. These estimates provide more meaningful compari sons of value added of foreign affiliates across coun tries and over time than the current-dollar estimates. Comparisons across countries are enhanced because the estimates in real terms are based on purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates rather than on mar ket exchange rates. 9 Comparisons over time are en hanced because the estimates are denominated in chained (2002) dollars that account for both changes in prices and changes in the industry mix of produc tion by manufacturing affiliates. The estimates are re stricted to manufacturing because the source data necessary for the adjustments are unavailable for other industries. The real value added of foreign affiliates in manu facturing edged down 0.4 percent to $359.5 billion in 2005 (table 12). The 27 countries for which estimates are available accounted for 76.0 percent of the total. The real value added of manufacturing affiliates in these countries decreased 3.1 percent to $273.1 billion, in contrast to a 1.4-percent increase in total manufac turing production in these countries (chart 2). A de crease in Canada (down 7.2 percent) was partly offset by a large increase in \"all other countries\" (up 10.1 percent). In Canada, real value added of foreign affili ates in manufacturing decreased $3.7 billion to $47.4 billion, partly reflecting a 0.7-percent decrease in total 9. To translate the value-added estimates that are denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for international comparisons, PPP exchange rates generally are preferable, because they approximate the number of for eign currency units required in a foreign country to buy the goods and ser vices that are equivalent to those that can be bought in the United States with 1 U.S. dollar. A distinguishing feature of PPP exchange rates is that they are based on the prices of all goods and services produced or sold in a country, both those that are traded internationally and those that are not. For details and for a summary of the methodology used to derive the esti mates of real value added, see Raymond J.

The portion of the goods and services sold or added to inventory or fixed investment by a firm that reflects the production of the firm itself. It represents the firm's contribution to gross domestic product in its country of residence, which is the value of goods and ser vices produced by labor and property located in that country. Compared with sales, value added is a preferable measure of production because it indicates the extent to which a firm's sales result from its own production rather than from production that originates elsewhere, whereas sales data do not distinguish between these two sources of production. Value added can be measured as gross output minus intermediate inputs; alternatively, it can be measured as the sum of the costs incurred (except for intermediate inputs) and the profits earned in produc tion.
