[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Farm operators who own their land or who expect to lease their land year after year have a profit motive to insure that the quality and productivity of their land do not deteriorate over time. Furthermore, farm operators typically live near their farms, giving them an incentive to reduce some types of farming-related environmental degradation. Nonetheless, some conservation practices require an investment of funds and can reduce farm profitability, particularly in the short-run, making their adoption costly. In addition, much of the unintended environmental damage caused by farm production occurs far downstream. Farming-related environmental problems are less likely to be addressed if the farm operator does not directly or indirectly benefit from adopting conservation practices. As a result, farming remains a major source of some pollutants (Ribaudo, 2000;Claassen et al., 2001). The United States (US) government provides technical and financial support for farm conservation efforts as incentives to reduce onsite and offsite environmental impacts. These programs are voluntary, and their cost and effectiveness depend on what farm operators demand in compensation for altering farming practices. Considerations other than farm profits and environmental outcomes, such as household resource constraints and opportunities, farm structure and ownership, and personal goals, can affect the decision to adopt conservation practices or participate in conservation programs. The determinants of farm operator adoption of selected conservation practices and participation in the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) conservation programs are examined in this study. Understanding how potential participants respond to market and program incentives is achieved by identifying the characteristics of farm households that have adopted conservation practices. Farm and ranch 1 land accounts for about half of the land in the 48 contiguous States. Farming practices adopted by the roughly two million US farm operators have a major impact on soil erosion, sedimentation levels in streams and rivers, nutrient and pesticide run-off, groundwater contamination, and air quality. Nearly 71 percent of farmland is located in watersheds where nitrate, phosphorous, coliform bacteria, or suspended sediment levels surpass criteria for safe, water-related activities (Smith et al., 1994). National water quality assessments conducted by the US Geological Survey suggest that agriculture is a leading source of water quality problems in the US (Ribaudo, 2000). Agriculture has also been cited as a major contributor to declining levels of groundwater and increasing groundwater contamination, wildlife habitat loss, increases in threatened and endangered species, air pollution, and toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks (Claassen et al., 2001;EPA, 2004). Improved conservation practices can mitigate these unintended environmental consequences of agricultural production. For example, farming practices such as conservation tillage and crop rotation reduced soil erosion on US cropland by no more than 40 percent between 1982 and 1997 (Claassen et al., 2004). Variable rate fertilizer application has decreased nutrient loadings into the environment in some cases (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2004). The establishment of permanent cover on farmland enrolled in land retirement programs has improved water quality, wildlife habitat, and increased carbon sequestration (Feather et al., 1999;Ribaudo et al., 1990). Economists typically assume that the decision to adopt a specific farming practice is based on profit maximizing behavior given resource constraints. Indeed, research has shown that the operator's profit motive is often sufficient to elicit cost-cutting conservation efforts. For example, 75 percent of the reduction in soil erosion by US corn producers between 1982 and 1997 can be attributed to the adoption of conservation tillage practices for business reasons (Hopkins and Johansson, 2004). But is profit the only motive behind the decision to practice good stewardship? Roughly 63 percent of farm operators in the US are classified as ''residential'' or ''lifestyle'' farmers, or are retired (USDA-ERS, 2005), suggesting that the decision to pursue farming is based on quality-of-life factors as well as the farm's ability to generate profits. Concerns over succession (Wilson, 1997, p. 82;Battershill and Gilg, 1997, p. 222), the desire to limit the time and energy spent farming (Lobley and Potter, 1998, p. 423;Loftus and Kraft, 2003, p. 81), and the need for income stability (Loftus and Kraft, 2003, p. 81) can also affect decisions about farming practices and conservation program participation. Indeed, studies of farmer adoption of conservation practices and participation in conservation programs in the European Union and the US have found that quality-of-life factors and personal attributes of farm operators also influence the decision. For example, Caswell et al. (2001) found that farmer education and the operator's willingness to pursue offsite expert advice had a positive influence on the decision to adopt ''managementintensive'' conservation technologies in the US. Loftus and Kraft (2003) found that farmers who more frequently visited extension agents were more likely to enroll land into conservation programs. Length of residency in a given location has also been found to be positively related with participation in the Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme in the European Union (Wilson, 1997). Understanding the economic and demographic profiles of farm households adopting conservation-compatible practices, with and without Federal program assistance, is an important first-step in designing conservation policies and programs that maximize the environmental benefits from public and private conservation outlays. The objective of this paper is to understand the factors associated with the decision to adopt conservation-compatible practices. To meet this objective, information from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) on farm production and household characteristics is used to compare households that have and have not incorporated conservation practices into management decisions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the conservation programs available to farm operators and the kinds of practices supported by the federal government on a cost-share basis. This is followed by a section describing the data and the research methodology. Discussion of the results and policy implications conclude the paper."}, {"section_title": "Conservation policy, land retirement programs, and workingland practices", "text": "The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency manage several voluntary conservation programs for private land with the objective of fostering good stewardship practices. The NRCS lists 151 structural farming practices (for example, construction of riparian buffers, dams, and sediment basins) and 16 management practices (for example, crop rotation, pest management, and nutrient management) that are eligible for Federal cost-sharing under one or more of its conservation programs (NRCS, 2004). Each practice addresses one or more of the major concerns underlying USDA's conservation policy: soil and land conservation, water quality and conservation, crop nutrient management, livestock manure management, wildlife habitat management, and air quality improvement (USDA, 2003). Federal programs providing conservation funding directly to farmers and ranchers focus largely on either: (1) retiring environmentally sensitive farmland from production or (2) improving conservation practices on working farmland. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the primary land retirement program operated by USDA, while the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is one example of the Department's working-land conservation programs. The CRP was authorized by the 1985 Farm Security Act to retire environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production for 10-15 years. In return for an annual rental payment and partial reimbursement for the cost of establishing and maintaining approved ground cover, participants agree to take enrolled land out of production and plant grasses, trees, or other conservation cover. 2 Based on the distribution of hectares enrolled in the CRP, the program puts most of its effort into planting land to grasses, largely through enrollment of whole fields (Fig. 1). Nonetheless, while the number of hectares involved in working-land compatible practices is small, such signups amount to 20 percent of the contracts outstanding in 2001. 3 Despite its focus on land retirement, CRP's size made it the primary source of Federal assistance for conservation activities pursued by working farms until recently (Fig. 2). EQIP provides financial and technical assistance to help participants install or implement conservation practices on eligible agricultural land. EQIP is a working-land program designed to help farmers institute conservation-compatible practices and integrate conservation structures into their farming operations. For structural and vegetative practices, EQIP can reimburse up to 75 percent of the installation costs. 4 Producers can also receive incentive payments for adopting management practices. Since its inception in 1996, $720 million USD in EQIP funds have helped nearly 46,500 ranchers and farmers improve air, soil, and water quality on private working-land (USDA, 2005). By law, 60 percent of EQIP funds go to livestock producers, including large confined livestock operations (Fig. 1). In the years following CRP's implementation, most conservation payments to farmers funded land retirement. But with the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, funding for working-land programs has increased (Fig. 2). While land retirement and working-land practices are not mutually exclusive, one would expect land retirement to appeal to a different segment of the farming population than working-land practices. Land retirement may appeal more to operators who wish to curtail their  [1997][1998][1999][2000]. Notes: Distribution of hectares enrolled in CRP/CREP and contracts as of November 2001.

Comparisons between participants in these two general types of conservation practices are the focus of this paper.\nThe random utility model assumes that a farm operator will adopt a conservation-compatible practice (e.g. standard or management-intensive practices) or install a conservation structure (e.g. plant conservation cover, or install working-land conservation structures) if the benefit (utility) derived from adoption of a practice is greater than it is without the practice. The utility a farmer gains from adopting one of these practices is hypothesized to be a function of exogenous variables (x i ) characteristic to farmer i; U \u00c3 ij \u00bc x 0 i b \u00fe e i , with U \u00c3 ij an (unobserved) latent response, b the mean response vector, and e i a random disturbance term. Let C ij \u00bc 1 indicate that farmer i uses the jth conservation-compatible management practice (or practices one of three conservation activities), 0 otherwise. Hence, U ij 4U ik if C ij \u00bc 1 and C ik \u00bc 0 for all other choices. Therefore, the choice of U ij is the maximum utility gained by farmer i among all other choices. In the case of adoption of conservation-compatible practices, a cumulative probit regression (Allison, 2003,  p. 138) was used to estimate the effects of business, operator, and household characteristics on the likelihood of a farm operator adopting one or more managementintensive conservation-compatible techniques. 10 By assuming that conservation-compatible management practices can be represented as an ordered progression in intensity from low to high management activities, and that such a progression would go from non-adopters, to adopters of ''standard practices'', to adopters of ''decision aids'' but not ''management-intensive'' practices, to adopters of ''management-intensive'' practices, the marginal effect on the probability of an individual using the next (or higher) level of technology can be estimated.\nIn the case of installation of working-land compatible structures, wildlife enhancement, or planting conservation cover, a multinomial logit regression (Greene, 2003, p. 720) was estimated to correlate farm structure, household, and environmental characteristics with the conservation practice decision. Because there is no apparent hierarchy among the conservation structures and practices of interest, the multinomial regression analysis attempts to identify (ceteris paribus) the factors associated with the use of different categories of conservation structures (workingland structures, wildlife enhancements, and whole-field retirements) and the absence of such structures.\n\nLarger corn farms and farm households with relatively little off-farm income were more likely to employ decision aids and use management-intensive practices (Table 3). Thus, the larger the farm and the more important its profitability is to the farm household's income and wellbeing (as evidenced by the operator's primary occupation and the farm household's reliance on off-farm income), the more receptive the operator will likely be to practices that potentially reduce costs or increase yields. 13 If these practices cut costs by reducing chemical input use or runoff, they could have broader environmental benefits. While farming practices vary depending on the commodity grown, a similar pattern emerges for soybean and cotton farms (not shown). Corn farm operations tended to be larger than many other family farm operations, averaging 261 hectares compared with 168 hectares operated by the typical family farm in 2001. However, even with a distribution skewed toward full-time farming operations, the effect of scale on farming practice decisions is clear. As the management skill needed to make a farming practice profitable increases, so too does the size of adopting farms (in terms of hectares operated, net farm income, and commodity payments received). While the per-hectare outof-pocket cost of decision aids and management-intensive practices should not vary much as the size of the farm increases, there may be a steep learning curve to use these practices profitably. (Perhaps reflecting the skills needed to profitably adopt more intensive practices, both the average level of education and reliance on outside consultants increase with management intensity.) Because of the widespread use of standard practices (for example, crop rotation) that have conservation benefits, relatively few farms had not adopted one or more of the practices examined. The operations were smaller than the ''adopting'' farms and had lower average yields. Farm operators who did not adopt any of the conservationcompatible practices examined also had fewer years of formal education, relied less on outside consultants, and had lower household income levels. Results of the cumulative probit regression (Table 4) supplement the univariate findings in Table 3. Larger corn operations were more likely to use decision aids and management-intensive technologies, as evidenced by the positive marginal effect of gross cash income from farming. While we cannot infer cause and effect, farms that practice more management-intensive farming practices have higher average yields.\nFarms that combined corn production with the production of high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, and nursery products), poultry, or hogs were more likely to use decision aids or information-intensive technologies. Direct government payments were positively associated with the likelihood that corn-farm operations used more intensive technologies. Corn-farm operators who used advice from consulting services and extension agents and corn-farm operators reporting higher levels of educational attainment were more likely to use decision aids and other management intensive information systems. Operators who irri-gated some hectares on their corn farms were also more likely to use decision aids and management-intensive technologies. Operators who organized themselves as family corporations were more likely to use decision aids and management-intensive technologies on their farms, but operators who shared income with other households were less likely to adopt these technologies. These and the univariate findings are generally consistent with those reported by Caswell et al. (2001) in their analysis of farming practices in the 1990s. They found that farm size, receipt of government commodity program payments, c Farms that use variable rate application of fertilizers and pesticides, rely on soil tests for nitrogen application, or display evidence of integrated pest management practices.\nd US dollar. e CV is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50. f CV is above 50. g Farmers who relied on crop consultants or extension service personnel when deciding how much nitrogen to apply. use of expert advice, educational attainment, and use of irrigation systems were often related with the decision to adopt ''modern'' farming practices (which loosely correspond to our ''management-intensive'' conservation practices).\nThe univariate results of Table 5 are supplemented by the results of the multinomial logit regression (Table 6). Farms concentrating on grain production were more likely to install working-land conservation structures. Farms using land susceptible to water erosion or near water sources (streams, rivers, etc.) were more likely to install working-land conservation structures. Apparently, these factors weigh more heavily in the decision to install various conservation structures than operator characteristics, holding other factors constant.\nConservation-compatible practices that reduce the operator's time to produce a commodity or reduce out-ofpocket labor and input costs without requiring specialized skills or knowledge have been widely adopted without direct financial assistance from the government. Because of their widespread appeal, the adoption of such practices as conservation tillage, crop rotation, and insect and herbicide tolerant plants have had beneficial impacts on the environment. To the extent that environmental benefits are the goal of conservation efforts, funds to develop the next generation of knowledge-embodied conservation practices (i.e., conservation practices that do not require Table 6 Marginal effects of the multinomial logit regression for conservation structures and vegetative cover practices WF grasses, trees, etc.\nWildlife enhancement Working lands the farm operator to make a sizeable investment of time or money) might be considered. Development of environmentally friendly plant varieties, farming practices, and inputs, coupled with extension and education, could have broad environmental benefits if they make good stewardship of farmland easier, more profitable, and less risky. Conservation-compatible practices requiring a sizeable investment of management time or skill are less likely to be adopted by operators of small farms focused primarily on non-farm activities. The financial assistance needed to induce these farm operators to adopt managementintensive conservation practices would likely be high. But, for full-time commercial farm operations, such practices as variable input application rates and integrated pest management can be both profitable and environmentally friendly. The findings of this research also indicate that the availability of expert advice may help induce the adoption of specialized conservation practices. However, in response to chronic fiscal crises, State funds earmarked for extension are becoming scarce (McDowell, 2004). As a result, many traditional roles played by extension agents are now met by crop consultants. As crop input management decisions become increasingly complex, technical assistance becomes all the more challenging. EQIP currently budgets 23 percent of its funds for technical assistance, part of which goes to non-government technical experts to assist farm operators with conservation practice decisions (USDA, 2003). The findings suggest that technical assistance will remain important if farmers are to make the best use of the growing funds for working-land programs such as EQIP. 16 Our research also suggests that farm payments may influence the conservation behavior of farmers. The relationship between farm payments and conservationcompatible innovations appears to go beyond satisfying compliance requirements-many farms adopting conservation-compatible practices do not have HEL or wetland that is subject to compliance. By reducing the financial risks of changing farming practices, program payments may make it easier for eligible farmers to introduce such changes. Conservation practices and structures that do not pay for themselves in reduced costs or increased yields, may require some incentive (positive or negative) for adoption. Voluntary working-land programs could be effective for larger commercial scale farms, especially if combined with technical assistance. Working-land programs could make many of the practices recognized as good conservation behavior affordable. But, the findings presented here also suggest that the cost share needed to make a practice affordable is a function of farm size and the farm operator's plans. If meeting environmental goals requires increased participation in conservation programs, consid-eration might be given to a sliding scale of payments that accounts for the higher effective cost of conservation practice adoption by smaller farm operations."}, {"section_title": "Motivation for adoption of conservation-compatible practices", "text": "Cost reduction is one argument for adopting conservation-compatible practices. For example, variable rate application of inputs not only reduces the likelihood of excessive use of nutrients and chemicals, but also it can reduce the cost of growing (or increase revenue from) a crop (Griffin et al., 2004). Nonetheless, variable rate input management may require new or retro-fitted spreaders and new management skills. The ability to spread fixed and human capital costs over more hectares makes conversion more economical. Thus, the scale of the farm operation is likely to be a major determinant in many farming practice decisions (Fernandez-Cornejo, 1994;Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2001). For the same reason, the farmer's planning horizon can also influence cost-effective calculations. Younger farmers and those who plan on staying in farming for many years may be more willing to re-tool than farmers looking forward to retirement. But accounting profits are not the only consideration when making farming practice decisions. Even practices that promise higher farm profits may not appeal to some operators if they require lifestyle changes that are inconsistent with household goals. If off-farm employment contributes to farm household income more than farm profit does, then minimizing the amount of time the operator spends farming may be more important than maximizing farm profits (Nehring et al., 2002). Not all conservation practices save time or reduce costs. When adopting a conservation practice implies a drop in production or increased input cost and management skills to maintain production levels, what would motivate such a change? One reason may involve the level of adoption costs. Operators who participate in conservation programs may find the out-of-pocket expenses of conservation practices much reduced. But farm operators can also value land stewardship and the environment apart from any profit motive. While environmentalist sentiments are not the exclusive province of any particular type of farm, adoption of conservation practices may be more likely in environmentally sensitive areas and when the cost is relatively low."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data used in this study", "text": "The USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is used to characterize farm households that adopt conservation practices. 5 ARMS is the only annual source of data on the finances and practices of a nationally representative sample of US farms that includes information on the characteristics of farm operators and their households. ARMS is a collection of annual surveys that focus on the farm enterprise and on specific crops. Family farms are the unit of analysis in this study. That is, we exclude non-family corporate and cooperative farms and other operations with a hired farm manager. Family farms operated approximately 354 million hectares of farm and ranchland in 2003 (94 percent of the total) and accounted for more than 98 percent of US farms. The household, operator, and farm characteristics of operations that have adopted one or more of a limited number of conservation practices are examined because of their broad applicability in different geographic locations and across different types of farming operations. Farm scale and farm household characteristics influence farming practice decisions. To appreciate the importance of scale in the conservation practice decision, a farm typology 6 was constructed as a heuristic (Table 1). Retirement and residential farms are generally smaller in size and are less engaged in farming as an occupation. For corn, soybean, and cotton farms, we combine these two groups. Low sales farm operators consider farming their primary occupation, but may lack the resources needed to remain viable in the long run without significant offfarm income. Higher sales farms are more focused on farming as an income source and have the scale needed to make farming investments payoff. For analyses of corn, soybean, and cotton farms, this latter group is divided into small/higher-sales farms and commercial farms (Tables 1  and 2)."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual model, analytical framework, and empirical methods", "text": "To facilitate comparison of farm households that have adopted conservation practices with those that have not, three broadly defined groups of conservation-compatible management practices were constructed: ''standard practices'', ''decision aids'', and ''information/managementintensive'' practices (Table 2). 7,8 These practices do not necessarily imply good stewardship, but their use suggests that the farm operator understands the costs and benefits of farm management practices that are compatible with conservation goals. Paired T-tests are used to compare farm household and production characteristics of the households adopting these strategies to the reference group of farm households that do not use these conservationcompatible practices. To compare all family farms practising conservation activities, information on the use of conservation cover practices and structures is analyzed (Table 2). 9 These practices include (1) retiring farmland and planting it with cover crops, (2) installing structures or setting aside land to enhance wildlife, and (3) installation of conservation structures on working farmland. Household and production characteristics of farms that have chosen to retire land or install conservation structures are compared using T-tests, with the reference group being farm households that have chosen not to adopt any of these conservation structures. To supplement these univariate comparisons, a random utility framework (Greene, 2003, p. 719) is used to model farmer behavior.

Caswell et al. (2001) applied this theoretical framework to estimate adoption of soil and water management practices in the US. Soule et al. (2000) used this latent utility approach to determine the relationship between land tenure and adoption of conservation practices. Loftus and Kraft (2003) used a similar discrete choice model in their study of the factors influencing the decision to enroll conservation buffers into land retirement programs.

It is often assumed that owner-operators will be better stewards of their land because it is in their best interest. Some studies have found that land tenure security is an important component of adoption of new technologies (Soule et al., 2000). The proportion of land owned to land operated was used to measure the effect of land tenure on adoption of conservation practices. Scale effects may be important with respect to the conservation practice decision (Lynch et al., 2001;Soule et al., 2000). Fernandez-Cornejo (1994) used total hectares operated by farms to measure scale effects on farm technical efficiency. Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2001) also used hectares operated to measure the effects of scale on the adoption of agrobiotechnology and precision agriculture technologies. But scale effects have also been measured using gross farm income. Gunter and McNamara (1990) used the absolute value of gross farm income to measure the effect of farm size on off-farm labor supply by farm households.

The 2001 ARMS survey of farms growing corn asked respondents directly whether any of their farmland was classified by NRCS as HEL, so our analysis of conservation-compatible practices used this more precise measure.

Finally, the Economic Research Service (ERS) resource regions were used to control for regional effects attributable to weather, climate, and other factors characteristic to these regions. 12 Fig. 3 shows the percentages of farms growing corn, soybean, and cotton whose operators reported that they were engaged in selected farming practices that are compatible with conservation. While there are variations from one crop to the next, a high percentage of farm operators reported the use of one or more of the ''standard'' conservation-compatible practices-conservation tillage, crop rotation, or insect and herbicide tolerant plants. Fewer farm operators performed soil tests, systematically scouted for pests, or developed soil maps to help manage inputs. And still fewer farm operators reported use of management-intensive conservation practices, such as variable rate application of inputs, and nutrient and pest management systems. Because these are all working-land management practices, they are not reimbursable under any of the land retirement programs (CRP, CREP, and A description of the ERS resource regions is available at www.ers. usda.gov/Emphases/Harmony/issues/resourceregions/resourceregions.htm.

Scale and farm typology do not appear to influence adoption of standard conservation-compatible practices.

Fig. 5 shows the percentages of all farms that installed conservation structures on their farms or rotated fields out of production in 2001. 14 As expected, scale is important when the conservation structure is compatible with ongoing farming operations (for example, grass waterways and filters, contour strips, and riparian buffers) but is less important when practices involve land retirement and wildlife enhancement. Furthermore, participation in a conservation program was higher among farms planting whole fields to grasses, etc. and installing wildlife enhancements than it was for working-land conservation structures. Table 5 presents descriptive statistics on the business, operator, and household characteristics of farms that installed conservation structures and those that did not. Most family farms had none of the identified structures in place in 2001. Of the 25 percent that had one or more conservation structures, over half were in the form of whole fields planted to grasses, legumes, or trees. Workingland conservation structures accounted for another onethird of ''practising'' farms. Major differences between farms that did not install conservation practices were largely restricted to the working-land structures. The significant differences between non-installers and farms that retired whole fields to vegetative cover were the lower percentage of retired farm operators, the lower level of conservation payments, and the higher proportion growing high-valued crops among non-installers. 15 There were a number of significant differences between farms that ''retired'' whole fields and those that installed grass waterways, filter strips, and other structures compatible with working-land. Farms that installed the latter were larger grain farms that rely less on conservation payments. The farm operator was more likely to consider farming his/her primary occupation, was slightly younger, and relied less on off-farm income than farm households that participated in land retirement programs. These differences are consistent with the previous finding that farm operators focused on farm production and relatively more reliant on farm income were more likely to invest in relatively costly and management-intensive conservation practices."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "There are significant differences in the adoption of conservation practices that embody knowledge and skill within the technology itself (such as insect and herbicide tolerant plants) and the adoption of practices that require farm operator knowledge and skill (such as variable rate application of inputs). Farm conservation practices requiring relatively little specialized management skills and costing the farm operator little in foregone profits or outof-pocket expenses are widely dispersed among the farming population. Their adoption may have environmental benefits, but the farm operator's primary consideration is cost (time) minimization. Farm practices that require more intensive management skills and considerable investment in working capital appeal more to farm operators concerned with maximizing farm profits. Large-scale farm operations can spread the cost of such practices over more hectares, making it easier to justify the initial investment in equipment and management skill. For example, contour farming or strip cropping is much easier using autoguidance steering. These navigating systems are relatively expensive, costing up to 35 thousand dollars (Griffin et al., 2005). Larger operations can more quickly recapture this capital outlay through input cost savings and soil productivity enhancement. Likewise, younger farmers may be more willing to make such investments because of their longer farming horizons. Farm households that depend on farm earnings may also feel pressure to maximize yields by making full use of the farm's resources. Installation of conservation structures follows a similar logic. Structures that encompass whole fields appeal to farm operators that: (1) have marginal land that cannot be profitably farmed year after year, (2) own pasture not suitable for crop production, or (3) are primarily interested in a goal other than maximizing crop yields. This might be maximizing rental returns (in the form of CRP payments), finding time for other pursuits (such as retirement or an off-farm career), or increasing the value of farmland for non-farm activities (such as hunting, fishing, and scenic enjoyment). Structures that are compatible with continued crop production, such as filter strips, appeal to larger operations that rely more on federal commodity payments than on conservation program payments. Their initial cost and the potential demand on operator management skill when merging such structures into a farm operation make them less suited to smaller operations without significant cost sharing. Thus, the role of conservation programs in influencing conservation practice decisions likely varies by type of practice, the farm's cost structure, the operator's skill, and the household's goals."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "With the impending expiration of 80 percent of the 14 million hectares currently enrolled in CRP, policymakers and program managers face important decisions about the future direction of USDA's conservation efforts. By taking a close look at the characteristics of farms, operators, and households that have adopted conservation-compatible practices, with and without Federal conservation program support, this study offers some basic insights into the role of conservation programs in the agricultural sector's conservation efforts. With EQIP augmenting voluntary land retirement programs, the USDA offers farm operators financial assistance for a wide range of conservation programs. In general, working-land and land retirement programs play complementary roles to reduce the environmental consequences of agricultural production. Our research and that of others suggests that, while there is overlap, land retirement and working-land practices are often used by different types of farms. Land retirement need not signal a retrenchment from production agriculture. Larger farms also retire whole fields. 17 Whether to take marginal land out of production, diversify their operation to include hunting or scenic viewing, address conservation compliance concerns, or reduce variability in farm returns, enrolling one or more fields in CRP may be a logical part of a profit-maximizing farm operation. Roughly half of the participants in the CRP are working farms, so land retirement can be an integral part of a working-land approach to conservation, or a viable strategy to keep the farm working. While working-land programs have the potential to reach more farms than the traditional land retirement programs can, they are unlikely to appeal to all farm operators and may not provide all of the environmental (particularly wildlife) benefits attributed to USDA's land retirement programs. Smaller farms, particularly those whose operators consider themselves retired or whose primary occupation is something other than farming, are less likely to adopt management-intensive farming practices. They are more likely to adopt conservationcompatible practices that save time and effort and do not require major changes in established practices. But their primary motivation may not be maximizing farm profits, so practices that bolster returns at the cost of added complexity are, ceteris paribus, less likely to be adopted, with or without conservation program financial or ARTICLE IN PRESS 16 In 2007, EQIP's base funding will be $1.36 billion per year, more than quintuple its original funding allocation (USDA, 2003). If technical assistance funds increase proportionally, they will amount to more than $300 million in the coming years. technical assistance. Land retirement is more attractive to retirement and residential/lifestyle farm households than full-time farm households. CRP payments may also stabilize farm income for retired farmers and farmers nearing retirement. In addition, retiring contiguous fields from production can provide a broader array of environmental benefits than is easily accomplished through working-land conservation structures. Wildlife populations, in particular, may require more undisturbed land than is possible through working-land programs. Finally, it is also important to recognize that varying degrees of environmental benefits can accrue from the adoption of specific conservation practices, depending on the physical characteristics of the farmland. For example, the marginal environmental benefit of adopting conservation tillage on a farm with low soil erodibility is likely to be low, providing little onsite erosion reduction for the farmer or offsite benefit to society. 18 There may still be business reasons why these farmers would find it profitable to adopt conservation tillage practices even though the environmental benefits are negligible."}]
