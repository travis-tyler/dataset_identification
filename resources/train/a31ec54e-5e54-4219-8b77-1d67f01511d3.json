[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: The thickness of the brain's cortical gray matter (GM) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cerebral white matter (WM) each follow an inverted U-shape trajectory with age. The two measures are positively correlated and may be modulated by common biological mechanisms. We employed four types of genetic analyses to localize individual genes acting pleiotropically upon these phenotypes. Methods: Whole-brain and regional GM thickness and FA values were measured from high-resolution anatomical and diffusion tensor MR images collected from 712, Mexican American participants (438 females, age = 47.9 \u00b1 13.2 years) recruited from 73 (9.7 \u00b1 9.3 individuals/family) large families. The significance of the correlation between two traits was estimated using a bivariate genetic correlation analysis. Localization of chromosomal regions that jointly influenced both traits was performed using whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Gene localization was performed using SNP genotyping on Illumina 1M chip and correlation with leukocyte-based gene-expression analyses. The gene-expressions were measured using the Illumina BeadChip. These data were available for 371 subjects. Results: Significant genetic correlation was observed among GM thickness and FA values. Significant logarithm of odds (LOD \u2265 3.0) QTLs were localized within chromosome 15q22-23. More detailed localization reported no significant association (p < 5\u00b710 \u22125 ) for 1565 SNPs located within the QTLs. Post hoc analysis indicated that 40% of the potentially significant (p \u2264 10 \u22123 ) SNPs were localized to the related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and NARG2 genes. A potentially significant association was observed for the rs2456930 polymorphism reported as a significant GWAS finding in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative subjects. The expression levels for RORA and ADAM10 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with both FA and GM thickness. NARG2 expressions were significantly correlated with GM thickness (p < 0.05) but failed to show a significant correlation (p = 0.09) with FA. Discussion: This study identified a novel, significant QTL at 15q22-23. SNP correlation with gene-expression analyses indicated that RORA, NARG2, and ADAM10 jointly influence GM thickness and WM-FA values."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The human cerebrum is a complex, multi-compartmental structure whose anatomy and function are influenced by individual genetic variations Glahn et al., 2007) . Understanding the genetic mechanisms that control inter-subject cerebral variability is critical for deciphering the brain's normal and pathological function. Recent discoveries of genetic factors that can increase the likelihood of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as dementias has emphasized the need to identify genes that influence integrity of cerebral tissue (Glahn et al., 2007; Meyer-Lindenberg, 2010; Stein et al., 2010a) . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilitates the in vivo assessment of cerebral atrophy and structural integrity. Statistical genetic methods have been developed to measure the genetic modulation of inter-subject variability. By combining neuroimaging with genetics clinical investigators have promoted a better understanding of cortical variability (Walsh, 2000; Farnham et al., 2004; Gaitanis and Walsh, 2004; Jones et al., 2004; Edenberg et al., 2005; Klein et al., 2005; Kamarajan et al., 2006; Brouwer et al., 2010; Kochunov et al., 2010a; Joshi et al., 2011) and neurodegenerative processes (Biffi et al., 2010; Joshi et al., 2011) .\nWe hypothesized that some of the genetic factors responsible for the integrity of cortical gray matter (GM) are also responsible for the integrity of cerebral white matter (WM). To test this hypothesis we identified genetic sources of shared covariance in indices of GM and WM integrity measured in a well-characterized population of Mexican Americans (Mitchell et al., 1996; Olvera et al., 2010) . Integrity of the GM and WM compartments was assessed using the thickness of cortical GM and the fractional anisotropy (FA) of cerebral WM. GM thickness is calculated as the distance from the outer cortical surface to the inner cortical WM-GM boundary (Fischl and Dale, 2000) , or a related symmetric measure (Lerch and Evans, 2005; Aganj et al., 2009) . GM thickness is an indirect measure of a complex cortical architecture that is sensitive to cortical myelination, synaptic pruning, and cell density (Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997) . Integrity of cerebral WM was assessed using FA of water diffusion, measured from diffusion tensor imaging data. FA describes the directional selectivity of the random diffusion of water molecules (Beaulieu, 2002) . WM-FA values are sensitive to various tissue properties including myelin content, intra-voxel axonal crossing, and axonal fiber density and diameter (Beaulieu, 2002) . Though gray and WM measures are highly heritable (h 2 = 0.4-0.8; p < 10 \u22126 ) the extent to which these different measures are influenced by overlapping genetic factors is unknown (Brouwer et al., 2010; Kochunov et al., 2010a; Winkler et al., 2010; Chiang et al., 2011) .\nGray matter thickness and FA values follow an inverted U-shape trajectory with age (Sowell et al., 2003; Gogtay et al., 2004; Salthouse, 2009; Kochunov et al., 2010b) . The two measurements have a positive linear relationship across the lifespan (Kochunov et al., 2011) . Age-related changes in cerebral myelination are thought to be the putative biological mechanisms responsible for the shape of their age-trajectories and the relationship between them (Sowell et al., 2003; Gogtay et al., 2004) . Histological studies that compared GM thickness measured from MRI with those from the corresponding myelin-stained sections observed that the MR signal was sensitive to intra-and inter-layer myelination and the intra-and inter-layer density of glial cells. Likewise, inter-subject differences in the regional WM FA values have been reported to be predominantly due to the regional inter-subject differences in myelination levels and density of the glial cells (Song et al., 2005; Madler et al., 2008) . Age-related changes in regional axonal myelin, reflected by changing FA values in WM, are likely to be similar to age-related changes in cortical myelin (Abe et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2009 ).\nIn our current study we attempted to localize chromosomal sites and identify individual genes that jointly influence these quantitative traits using bivariate genetic analyses. For correlated traits bivariate genetic analyses can reveal genetic factors that contribute jointly to both traits and can greatly increase the power of genetic discovery compared to univariate analyses (Amos and Laing, 1993; Schmitz et al., 1998; Amos et al., 2001) . We performed analyses in this well-characterized population of Mexican Americans where we have demonstrated significant heritability (h 2 = 0.4-0.6; p < 10 \u22126 ) of cortical GM thickness (Winkler et al., 2010) and FA values (Kochunov et al., 2010a) ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS", "text": "The Genetics of Brain Structure and Function study recruited, among others, active participants from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS; Mitchell et al., 1996) for brain imaging and neurocognitive assessment (Olvera et al., 2010) .

Computationally, cortical thickness is determined by measuring the distance between two polygonal meshes, one representing the pial cortical surface and the other the white-gray interface. Multiple GM thickness measurement algorithms have been proposed to deal with the complex topography of the cerebral cortex. We used a GM thickness measurement tool distributed as a plug-in for BrainVisa 2 . This tool uses a \"normal-average\" algorithm that has been reported to be a good compromise between accuracy and performance (Lerch and Evans, 2005) . The GM thickness is measured as the Euclidean distance from an inner mesh vertex to the outer mesh along the direction normal to the inner mesh polygon. The measurement is repeated, inward, along the direction normal the outer mesh and the two distances are averaged (Kochunov et al., 2008) . The consistency of the distance measurements is ensured by verifying that the line connecting the two surfaces does not intersect other polygons, inner or outer, along the way.

In short, the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) software (Smith et al., 2006) was used for multi-subject analysis of FA images. FA images were created by fitting the diffusion tensor to the raw diffusion data (Smith, 2002) . All FA images were non-linearly aligned to a group-wise, minimal-deformation target (MDT) brain (Kochunov et al., 2001) . Next, individual FA images were averaged to produce a group-average anisotropy image. This image was used to create a group-wise skeleton of WM tracts, which encodes the medial trajectory of the WM fibertracts. Finally, FA values from each image were projected onto the group-wise skeleton of WM structures. This step helps account for residual misalignment among individual WM tracts. FA values are assigned to each point along a skeleton using the peak value found within a 20-mm distance perpendicular to the skeleton. The FA values vary rapidly perpendicular to the tract direction but very slowly along the tract direction. By assigning the peak value to the skeleton, this procedure effectively maps the center of individual WM tracts onto the skeleton. (Kochunov et al., 2010b) . Briefly, the population-based, 3D, DTI cerebral WM tract atlas developed at the John Hopkins University (JHU) and distributed as part of the FSL software package (Wakana et al., 2004 ) was used to calculate population average diffusion parameter values along the nine major WM tracts (Table 1; Figure 3 ).

We used bivariate genetic analyses to localize chromosomal regions and to identify individual genes involved in this relationship. The bivariate linkage analysis of the whole-brain average GM thickness and FA values produced a suggestive locus on the chromosome 15q22-23 near the previously reported univariate QTL for the FA values (Kochunov et al., 2010a) . Bivariate linkage analyses of regional GM and FA trait pairs produced thirteen significant loci in the same region. This chromosomal region of 5.6 Mb harbors over 30 genes, many of which are critical to normal brain development. Reports on individuals with chromosomal deletions in this region have described severe congenital defects such as holoprosencephaly (Machado et al., 2010) and cerebral dysmorphia (Koivisto et al., 1999; Lalani et al., 2006) . A microdeletion of 1 Mb of genome in the immediate vicinity to the rs1574119 resulted in cerebral dysmorphia, autism, mental retardation, and developmental delay (Smith et al., 2000) .

It produced several useful results. 41% of the potentially (p < 10 \u22123 ) significant SNPs were localized to two proximal genes NARG and RORA. These two genes span 14% of the genome between markers rs12901270 and rs1574119 and therefore received a higher (two to three times)\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenomics number of associations than would be expected by chance. Examining the top-10 most significant SNPs for each of the 13 trait pairs found that 22% (28 out of 130) of the polymorphism were also localized to the NARG2 or RORA genes. Correlation with geneexpression values identified three transcripts whose expression levels were significantly (r < 0.05) correlated with whole-brain average measurements for both traits. Two of these transcripts were from the RORA gene. The third transcript was from the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) gene. The transcript for NARG2 gene showed a significant correlation with GM thickness and a suggestive (p = 0.09) correlation with the FA values.\nWe consider RORA as the likely candidate for pleiotropic association between FA and GM thickness. RORA was discovered as the site of the \"staggerer\" mutation in a mouse model that is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and profound neurodegeneration (Hamilton et al., 1996; Dussault et al., 1998) . RORA encodes a protein that acts as a constitutive activator of transcription and a receptor for glucocorticoids (Jarvis et al., 2002) . It is expressed in many tissues including cortical, subcortical and cerebellar neurons and neuroglial cells (Jarvis et al., 2002) . In neuronal and glial cells the RORA transcription factor exerted both neuroprotective and antiinflammatory functions. It provides neuroprotection by increasing the expression of antioxidant proteins, which makes neurons less sensitive to apoptotic stimuli (Boukhtouche et al., 2006) . In glial cells its expression is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and loss of its function leads to pro-inflammatory activation in astrocytes. Epidemiological genetic analyses implicated this gene in several disorders including: depression (Garriock et al., 2009; Lavebratt et al., 2009; Le-Niculescu et al., 2009; McGrath et al., 2009; Terracciano et al., 2010 ), Parkinson's disease (Edwards et al., 2010) , age-related macular degeneration (Schaumberg et al., 2010) , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Neale et al., 2008) . Its lymphocytic expression levels in autistic individuals were lower than in healthy controls and correlated with the severity of the disorder (Hu et al., 2006 (Hu et al., , 2009 Nguyen et al., 2010; Sarachana et al., 2010) .\nWe consider NARG2 as a potential candidate gene. Relatively little is know about this gene. It codes the N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate-gated ion channel (Sugiura et al., 2001) . It is highly expressed in the neonatal brain and plays an important role in brain development by regulating neuronal survival, migration, and proliferation (Sugiura et al., 2004) . Though NARG2 is located next to RORA on the q-terminal, the lack of correlation between NARG2 and RORA indicates that NARG2 modulation of GM thickness is unrelated to its proximity to RORA.\nNotably, the gene-expressions for the \u03b1-secretase, ADAM10 gene were correlated with both GM thickness and FA values. ADAM10 is an \u03b1-secretase capable of anti-amyloidogenic proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. This gene is considered a novel treatment target for Alzheimer's disease (AD; Kim et al., 2009) . In vitro studies demonstrated that \u03b1-secretase is responsible for the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of Alzheimer's plaque protein."}, {"section_title": "www.frontiersin.org", "text": "Up-regulation of its expression can prevent intracellular and extracellular accumulation of the toxic \u03b2-amyloid species (A\u03b2; Jarvis et al., 2010) . In vivo animal studies in Alzheimer mouse models showed that blocking ADAM10 expression, or its trans-synaptic transport, led to a rapid increase in the concentration of A\u03b2 plaque and increased brain atrophy Wang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010) . Reduced ADAM10 trans-synaptic trafficking rates were also demonstrated in the hippocampal tissue samples from AD patients . Two ADAM10 polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of developing a late-onset AD ). These polymorphisms significantly attenuated \u03b1-secretase activity of (>70% decrease), and elevated A\u03b2 levels (1.5-3.5-fold).\nOur study replicated an association between rs2456930 and brain integrity (Stein et al., 2010b) . Stein and colleagues identified this SNP as a significant GWAS finding in 742 participants in the Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The genotypic frequencies for this SNP in our subjects (AA = 14.6%, AG = 48.3%, GG = 36.9%) were nearly identical to those reported by Stein and colleagues (AA = 13.0%, AG = 49.5%, GG = 37.5%; Stein et al., 2010a) . The magnitudes and the direction of the genetic effects for were also similar. In both populations the homozygous minor allele (AA) exerted neuroprotective properties. The AA carriers had higher GM thickness and FA values (3.8 and 3.4%, respectively) than carriers of the homozygous major allele (GG). Stein et al. (2010a) reported a 3.13% higher volume of the temporal lobe for AA versus GG carriers. This polymorphism is found within a \"gene desert\" over 200 kb away from known genes. It is located within a 10 kb of a region with both promoter and enhancer histone markings which characterizes it as an area with potential regulatory function (Schones and Zhao, 2008) . It potentially has high functional relevance, even though the gene target is not yet known. Our finding suggests the neuroprotective effects of this polymorphism can be observed in normal aging and therefore, are probably not directly associated with AD pathology.\nOur analysis of a population of healthy aging Mexican Americans has identified a novel, significant QTL at the chromosome 15q22-23. SNP association and correlation with gene-expression analyses identified three genes located under the linkage peak, RORA, NARG2, and ADAM10, showed potential for jointly influencing cortical thickness and cerebral WM integrity. Genetic factors that are jointly influencing two different imaging traits may be acting through neuroprotective effects. The scientific literature indicates that RORA and ADAM10 genes are considered potential treatment targets for neurodegenerative disorders, and two mutations of ADAM10 gene are being considered as candidates for AD susceptibility. Localization of these genes reached only trend significance and further deep sequencing and functional variants analyses will be required for the true identification."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "This study was performed in Mexican Americans, a population with significant Native American admixture. If relatively rare variants are involved in the determination of quantitative variability, we may expect considerable differences in the localization of the most important genetic loci across populations . Linkage studies of such complex phenotypes cannot be used to exclude genetic regions for important QTLs. Therefore, the lack of concordance cannot be interpreted as evidence against the hypothesis that a QTL exists in a particular genomic region.\nThe gene-expression correlation analyses were limited by two factors. First, these were available for about half (N = 371, 150/221 males/females; average age = 47.8 \u00b1 12.9 years) of our subjects. Second, the collection of gene-expression data preceded the acquisition of brain images by 17 years. This prospective analysis approach may limit future replications studies.\nAnother limitation of this analysis is the use of Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Permutation analysis can be used to infer empirical p-values and provide less conservative correction for multiple comparisons than that obtained with Bonferroni. However, the variance-components estimation in large extended pedigrees is not trivial and sometimes may fail to converge as permutation does not take family structures into the account. Hence permutation would require significant additional effort, and since the Bonferroni thresholds are conservative, we chose to use that methodology."}]
