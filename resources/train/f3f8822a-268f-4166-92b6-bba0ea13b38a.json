Currently, AD dementia is estimated to affect nearly 1 out of 10 individuals over the age of 65. The multi-staged disease is believed to transition from clinically normal (CN) to a range of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by an ultimate decline towards AD dementia. [1, 2] As AD progresses, patients experience worsening symptoms of episodic memory, cognition, and daily functioning. [3] [4] [5] These symptoms greatly compromise an individual's quality of life, but perhaps none more than impairment in everyday functioning. Daily functioning is measured by performance of activities of daily living (ADL), impairment in which is integral for the diagnosis of AD dementia. AD patients often experience an early loss of independence, which increases the burden of responsibilities on caregivers. ADL are commonly categorized as either basic or instrumental with the former including eating, grooming, bathing, dressing and toileting, while the latter is comprised of more complex tasks such as managing one's own schedule, performing household chores like laundry, preparing meals, handling finances, driving or using public transportation and shopping. [6] Impaired ADL also play a significant role in understanding disease progression. While impairment in basic ADL is found in the moderate-to-severe stage of AD dementia, decline in instrumental ADL (IADL) has been found to accompany the earlier transition from the MCI stage to AD dementia. [4] The disappointing results from recent AD clinical trials point to the need for earlier intervention in order to slow disease progression and improve treatment outcomes. [1] A better understanding of IADL impairment can help better define early AD trial outcomes.\nClinicians use functional assessment scales to detect the changes in IADL impairment that occur throughout the course of AD. Subjective scales are administered with either caregivers (informant-based) or patients (self-reported), while performance-based tests are administered directly to patients. The Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) [7] is a ten-item subjective, informant-based scale primarily used to detect IADL impairment in MCI and mild dementia. [6] Recently, two large multicenter studies established that the FAQ clearly distinguishes between the three stages of AD progression: CN individuals potentially in the preclinical stage of AD, MCI and AD dementia. [4, 8] IADL impairment has also been associated with changes in brain metabolism as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Using 18 F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET, Landau et al. demonstrated an association between FDG hypometabolism in a composite of temporal, lateral parietal and posterior cingulate cortices, a pattern of brain regions typically implicated in AD, and greater IADL impairment in MCI and mild AD dementia subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) longitudinal study [9] . Cross-sectional analyses have been conducted to localize IADL impairment to specific brain regions. One such study revealed an association between IADL impairment and hypometabolism in the inferior parietal, superior occipital, and inferior temporal cortices in AD dementia patients. [10] Loss of independence in AD patients due to disease progression is a significant challenge faced by both patients and their caregivers and is attributable to impaired IADL performance in AD patients. Measurement and detection of IADL impairment with the FAQ scale and FDG-PET, respectively, have demonstrated the utility of IADL in tracking disease progression, a critical step for improving treatment outcomes in AD clinical trials.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism in FDG-PET regions of interest (FDG-ROIs)and IADL as measured by FAQ both crosssectionally and longitudinally across the AD continuum (CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia), while adjusting for subject demographics, and behavioral and cognitive functions. We intend to expand further on the studies described above by assessing the FDG regional correlates of IADL impairment in the early AD spectrum, including CN elderly at risk for AD. Furthermore, we will systematically assess which brain regions are associated with IADL impairment using a data-driven approach."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "This study analyzed data acquired from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu\\ADNI) (See Supplementary Data).

[4, 9] Mean follow-up time was 2.3\u00b10.9 years; CN and MCI subjects had up to 3 years follow-up and AD dementia subjects had up to 2 years follow-up. At screening, subjects were ages 55-91 (inclusive), were medically stable and in generally good health, did not have significant neurological conditions (other than MCI or AD dementia for subjects falling into those groups), and had a study partner able to provide collateral information about the subject's daily functioning, cognition, and behavior. Subjects did not have significant cerebrovascular disease and had a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score [12] \u2264 4. Subjects did not have active psychiatric disorders and had a Geriatric Depression Scale, short form[13] \u2264 5.

Further, a backward elimination (cutoff p<0.05) general linear model (GLM) with baseline FAQ score as the dependent variable, a diagnosis main effect, and all 35 FDG ROIs simultaneously included in the initial predictor pool was run. The FDG ROIs significantly associated with baseline FAQ according to these screening tests were then used subsequently in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of primary interest in this study (see Supplementary Data for more detail).\nCross Sectional Analyses-The FDG ROIs surviving the data reduction above were then entered as simultaneous predictors in another backward elimination GLM regressing baseline FAQ on these predictors as well as diagnosis, and the interaction of each of these FDG ROIs with diagnosis.

The backward elimination GLM of the baseline FAQ regressed on all 35 FDG ROIs as simultaneous initial predictors, along with baseline diagnosis, reduced down to 6 FDG ROIs that were significantly associated with total FAQ score and demonstrated an additive significant diagnosis effect (AD FAQ mean>MCI mean) (Supplementary Table 2 ).

These interactions showed a greater decline in IADL performance as FDG metabolism decreased for the AD dementia group relative to the MCI group, and the MCI group relative to the CN group ( Figure 1A ). Main effects were found for greater orbitofrontal (p=0.009) and middle frontal (p=0.003, Figure 1B ) FDG hypometabolism associated with greater IADL impairment. Greater frontal pole FDG hypometabolism (p=0.008) was associated with less IADL impairment. This latter effect is likely due to the high positive correlations (multicollinearity) of frontal pole FDG metabolism with some of the other FDG ROIs in the model since the univariate unadjusted relationship for frontal pole FDG hypometabolism parallelled the association with greater IADL impairment found with the other FDG ROI main effects, see Figure 1C and 1D.

The faster trajectory of deterioration in FAQ scores for these FDG-ROIs is depicted for each population across the AD spectrum in Figure 2 . There was also a significant partialed interaction of orbitofrontal FDG metabolism (p=0.0006) with time whereby greater hypometabolism was associated with lesser rate of worsening of IADL impairment over time. This latter finding was possibly suggestive of multicollinearity due to the moderate positive correlations of orbitofrontal cortex with posterior cingulate gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Additionally, significant relations were found in the expected direction for APOE4, RAVLT total learning, NPI-Q Apathy, baseline FAQ, sex (female higher), and interactions of diagnosis with time such that the AD dementia and MCI groups deteriorated faster than the CN group.\nThe percent variance accounted for by the overall model fixed effects was 75%, and the percent variance accounted for by the entire mixed random and fixed coefficient model was 95% (Table 3 ).

We found no such 3-way interaction effects except for a barely significant one, suggesting that the association of posterior cingulate FDG hypometabolism with greater rate of worsening IADL impairment over time was slightly stronger in the MCI group when compared to the other diagnostic groups."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This data-driven analysis sought to characterize the relationship between regional FDG metabolism and IADL cross-sectionally and longitudinally across CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. The cross-sectional results suggest that orbitofrontal and middle frontal FDG hypometabolism are associated with greater IADL impairment, independent of diagnosis at baseline, while there were significant interactions for FDG posterior cingulate and parahippocampal hypometabolism with diagnosis illustrated by the greater decline in IADL performance (increasing FAQ scores) as metabolism decreased for AD dementia relative to MCI, and MCI relative to CN. The longitudinal analysis showed that baseline middle frontal and posterior cingulate FDG hypometabolism were associated with a greater rate of increase in IADL impairment over time across the AD spectrum.\nIt is notable that although regional hypometabolism accounted for only a modest proportion (percent variance) of IADL impairment when compared to diagnostic group in these analyses, the contribution of regional hypometabolism was independent of diagnostic group for many of the regions. Considering that in early AD, IADL play a major role in the determination of diagnosis, it is challenging to find other important variables that are associated with IADL. Moreover, in these analyses, the FAQ (the IADL measure), was not included in the initial diagnosis determination, which provided the baseline diagnosis variable for all analyses.\nLocalization of IADL impairment to medial parietal and medial temporal synaptic dysfunction is consistent with regions typically prominently affected in MCI and AD dementia, while prominent involvement of frontal regions is less typical early on in AD. However, multiple studies have shown frontal hypometabolism in AD dementia though always to a lesser extent than temporo-parietal hypometabolism. [22] [23] [24] [25] Moreover, progression from MCI to AD dementia, which is often driven by worsening IADL, has been associated with greater frontal hypometabolism [26, 27] . Finally, frontal regions have been associated with executive function, which is essential for the performance of IADL. [4, 28] Our results reinforce this association in early AD.\nSalmon et al. demonstrated an association between IADL impairment and inferior temporal, inferior parietal, and superior occipital hypometabolism in patients with mild to moderate AD dementia in a cross-sectional study using FDG PET. [10] Our results demonstrated involvement of other temporal and parietal regions and did not show occipital involvement. Our sample was much earlier on the AD trajectory, possibly accounting for this difference.\nIn their seminal work using FDG PET to associate cognitive and functional impairments, Landau et al. showed that a composite of FDG regions typically affected in AD at baseline can be predictive of future increases in FAQ score indicative of IADL decline in MCI and AD dementia. [9] Similarly, our results suggest a faster trajectory of decline in IADL performance over time across the AD spectrum. However, we demonstrated which regions drove this association, and in addition to associations with posterior cingulate and temporal region (parahippocampus), we found associations with frontal regions. These results reinforce the cortical regional localization of progressive functional impairment in the AD spectrum.\nCross-sectional studies using other imaging modalities have also looked at the regional association with IADL in mild AD dementia and have found similar regional involvement to that found in our study. One study utilizing single-photon emission computed tomography showed an association between IADL impairment and lateral superior parietal, dorsolateral prefrontal, medial frontal, and occipital hypoperfusion. [29] Two studies employing structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an association between IADL impairment and medial frontal and temporoparietal atrophy. [30, 31] Of note, the FDG-PET results presented in our study were not corrected for partial volume effects and were therefore likely influenced by underlying atrophy. As such, our imaging results might be more representative of overall neurodegeneration, as seen with structural MRI, rather than regional synaptic dysfunction, which is more specific to FDG-PET.\nRecent work by Royall et al. has shown that the cognitive correlates of IADL have been associated specifically with atrophy in the Default Mode Network (DMN) [32] . Our results also support this link in light of the association we found between IADL impairment and FDG hypometabolism in lateral and medial frontal, medial temporal, and posterior cingulate regions, all parts of the DMN. Future studies using resting-state functional MRI can directly assess the association between IADL and DMN connectivity.\nThe preliminary data reduction from 35 to 6 FDG ROIs allowed the data to drive the localization of IADL impairment, and subsequently allowed for the most critical ROIs to be identified. However, ROIs may not fully encompass significant regions, which can be captured in whole brain voxel-based analyses. Moreover, we looked at averaged bilateral regions and not separate left and right regions because that would have doubled the number of ROIs, making the data reduction process potentially too challenging. That said, the combined use of data-derived ROIs and a mixed effects longitudinal model allows the results to be more readily adaptable to patient populations. This study features some limitations. The ADNI sample is not representative of the general population because subjects were carefully selected to have limited general health issues, psychiatric conditions, and cerebrovascular disease. [11, 33] Moreover, subjects were highly intelligent premorbidly and had a high proportion of APOE4 carriers. However, we adjusted for these elements in all analyses. Additionally, this population resembles that of most AD spectrum clinical trials, making it easier to compare the results to clinical trial outcomes. The IADL scale used in these analyses, the FAQ, has been shown to be a sensitive measure for differentiating between CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia, but nearly all CN subjects had a score of 0 at baseline, representing a major floor effect. [4, 8] Therefore, the cross-sectional results were driven by the MCI and AD dementia groups. However, the longitudinal results were significant across all diagnostic groups indicating that the FAQ is sensitive to the development of functional decline over time even in CN subjects. Drawbacks to the datadriven regression models used in these analyses are the instances of multicollinearity in which counter-intuitive findings may falsely indicate significant interactions. We observed such instances cross-sectionally for the main effect of frontal pole FDG hypometabolism with FAQ and longitudinally with orbitofrontal FDG hypometabolism and FAQ decline. In each case, the univariate unadjusted relationship for these FDG regions was in the expected direction, but the adjusted relationship in the model was in the reverse direction possibly due to positive inter-correlations with other FDG ROIs in the model. However, since significance tests run on the study results encompass numerous image pixels, and the mean SUV of the ROI and the maximum pixel SUV are determined when generating FDG ROIs, positive inter-correlations are expected and results are inherently conservative. [34, 35] In their study of time series analysis using functional MRI, Locascio et al. determined possible sources of positive correlation as attributable to physiologically based associations, close spatial proximity of pixels, image smoothing, or image resolution that is finer than areas of (non-task-related) activation. [35] In conclusion, orbitofrontal and middle frontal FDG hypometabolism are associated with IADL impairment in mild AD dementia cross-sectionally, while baseline posterior cingulate and middle frontal FDG hypometabolism predict worsening IADL impairment over time across the AD spectrum. These results demonstrate the association between patterns of regional FDG hypometabolism and complex daily functioning decline in early AD, and subsequently reinforce the importance of measuring IADL impairment throughout the course of AD progression. Frontal regions are not typically affected prominently in early AD. Our findings suggest that these regions are affected in the context of IADL impairment in early AD. In order to better develop early interventions, it is essential to understand the pathophysiological underpinnings of important clinical outcomes such as IADL. Our results move us closer to this goal."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
