In addition, while employment can potentially provide students with valuable work experience, some researchers have found that employment and working many hours while in high school negatively affect academic outcomes such as high school grades and the probability of completing high school (DeSimone 2006; Dustmann and Van Soest 2007; Lillydahl 1990; Montmarquette et al. 2007; Oettinger 1999; Ruhm 1997; Tyler 2003) . Thus, one potential channel through which high school employment has a negative effect upon academic achievement is through its effects on homework. However, only a few economic studies have directly investigated this channel and they (Betts 1996; Aksoy and Link 2000; Eren and Henderson 2008) have examined the effects of completed or assigned homework in high school classes on students' performance on math tests only. Studies of middle school students (Eren and Henderson 2011) and college students (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2008; Grodner and Rupp 2013) have found that homework similarly improves students' performance on math and other tests as well as first-semester grade point averages (GPA).0 F 1 A concern with these studies, however, is that the majority are based on retrospective questionnaire data that provide information about assigned or completed homework during a typical week, which may not be accurate and also may be subject to social desirability bias. Time-diary data, on the other hand, 1 Cooper, Robinson, and Patall (2006) provide a nice overview of the effects of homework on academic achievement in the education, psychology, and sociology literatures. In general, small positive effects have been found. More recently, using 1990 data from National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) and 2002 data from Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), Maltese, Tai, and Fan (2012) found no effect of math and science homework on final course grades, but a significant positive association between homework time and the SAT-Mathematics subscore.\n1 are more accurate because of a shorter recall period and are not subject to social desirability bias because they are collected for all activities over an entire 24-hour period rather than just for specific activities (Juster, Ono, and Stafford 2003) . In addition, time-diary data may be more detailed than questionnaire data if they capture the presence of secondary activities (i.e., activities performed at the same time as a reported main activity) that the usual survey questions do not.\nUnfortunately, most time-diary data sets do not contain information on the future outcomes of those completing the diaries and thus are limited in the questions they can answer.1 F 2\nOne data set that does have both homework and outcome information, however, is the combined Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID-CDS) and its follow-up, the Transition to Adulthood Study (TA). Students participate in the TA a few years after participating in the CDS. The CDS data provide information from two time diaries, one for a weekday and the other for a weekend day. Some students are tracked in high school according to ability and thus some may be assigned more homework than others. However, the CDS data provide scores on students' standardized tests taken before high school, which we include to control for this. These scores also control for cognitive ability given that ability may directly affect academic performance. The TA data provide information on high school GPA and college attendance.\nWe measure homework time in four ways. Three of our measures account for the fact that multitasked homework may be less productive than sole-tasked homework. These include total homework time (homework performed as either a primary or secondary activity), time spent doing homework as a primary activity (homework may be combined with another activity but homework is deemed the more important activity by the respondent), and time spent doing homework as a sole activity (homework performed when no other activities were also being performed). Our fourth measure examines whether students did any homework during their two diary days. This is used as a measure of homework frequency. This last measure is included because Trautwein (2007) found a positive effect of homework frequency on achievement.\nUsing each of these measures alternately, we estimate the effects of time spent on homework on high school GPA and college attendance by age 20, both long-term measures of academic achievement. We examine whether these effects differ by gender, given substantial differences in how girls and boys spend their time. Because homework, however measured, is potentially endogenous in that an omitted factor, such as motivation, may affect both homework time and academic performance directly, we take an instrumental variables approach in this paper. Our results show that time spent in homework, however measured, has no effect on either high school GPA or college attendance."}, {"section_title": "II. Data", "text": "The data used in our analyses primarily come from all waves of the CDS (1997, (2002) (2003) (2007) (2008) and TA (2005 , 2007 , 2009 , and 2011 ) (PSID 2013 . Information about children aged 0-12 first was collected in the 1997 CDS (CDS1) and additional information about respondents is provided in the TA for those aged 18 and older at the time of that survey. The CDS1 provides background information on the parent/caregiver of the CDS child as well as 3 information on the child's race. The CDS2 and CDS3 provide time-diary information for a weekday and a weekend day for a subset of CDS children, with diaries collected for up to two children per family. Each randomly-assigned diary day records the child's primary and secondary activities from midnight to midnight. By the time the child was in high school, most filled out the diaries themselves instead of the parent. The TAs provide information on high school GPA and college attendance for high school graduates. We obtain information on each child's gender, family structure, parental education, and family income from the main PSID survey.2 F 3 We also control for school-level characteristics by matching our sample to the NCES'\nCommon Core of Data (CCD) using school identifiers from the restricted-use version of the PSID-CDS.\nIn the CDS2 and CDS3 there were 1,648 students who attended grades 9 through 12. We limit our sample to high school graduates.3 F 4 We further exclude those who did not complete both a weekday and a weekend day diary, those who completed their time diaries over winter break or on any day in June when they did not attend school,4 F 5 those who were missing the child interview in 2007, those who were missing information on race, one respondent whose family income was negative, those who were missing TA information on college attendance by age 20, those who were missing a diary date, those who attended private school, and those who were missing a 3 Our measure of family income comes from the main PSID interviews. It is constructed to be the average of yearly family income reported in the three PSID main interviews prior to completing the CDS high school diary, in 2006 dollars. If one or more years is missing, then the remaining values are used to create the average. Family structure and parental education are obtained from 2003 and 2007 main PSID surveys. 4 High school GPA and information on college attendance are available only for high school graduates. In the PSID-CDS, ninety-two percent of high school students graduated, which is close to the graduation rate reported by the U.S. Department of Education (2013) Our key explanatory variables are total weekly hours spent doing homework, weekly hours spent doing homework as a primary activity, weekly hours spent doing homework as a sole activity, and an indicator for whether any homework was performed over the two diary days.\nTotal homework time includes time spent on homework, regardless of whether it was reported to be the main activity. Primary homework time may be multitasked time. However, it may be a measure of higher quality homework time than total homework time because it includes only homework time when homework is reported as the main (or viewed by the student as the most important) activity. Time spent doing homework as a sole activity may be a measure of even higher quality homework because it captures homework time when homework is the only activity being performed. One study by Rosen, Carrier, and Cheever (2013) found that those who checked Facebook while studying had lower GPAs. A study by Pool, Koolstra and van der Voort (2003) found that those who watched TV simultaneously while studying completed their 6 GPA scales vary by school. Because we have only the reported GPA and the maximum possible GPA for each observation, we created this variable by dividing the reported GPA by the maximum possible and multiplying by 100. 7 In each TA, the student reported the first enrollment date for \"current / last college attended\" and then the first enrollment date for one additional prior college attended. We compare the first reported enrollment date in months with the month that the student would have turned age 20 to determine college attendance by age 20.\n5 homework less accurately. Any homework is a measure of the frequency of homework performed.\nBecause we have only two days of time-diary information, one weekday and one weekend day, we constructed each of our weekly homework measures by multiplying the weekday time spent by 5, multiplying the weekend day time spent by 2, and then adding these two products together, as in Hofferth (2010) . A disadvantage of time-diary data compared to survey data is that time diaries usually cover only one or two days of a person's time use. Given that we are interested in examining the effect of time spent on homework during a student's high school career on future outcomes, our time use variables, which are based on two diary days, may be measured with error, biasing our estimated effects toward zero. However, this criticism applies to many survey data questions as well, as they often measure \"usual\" or \"last week's\" activity. Fortunately, instrumental variables techniques may be used not only to control for the potential endogeneity of a variable, they may also be used to correct for measurement error (Frazis and Stewart 2012) . Therefore, our instrumental variables approach will address this measurement error issue.\nAll four of our homework measures include the following activity codes: 5040 (using a computer for homework, studying, or research), 5192 (being tutored), 5490 (general homework/studying), 5491 (non-computer-related homework), 5492 (studying, research, reading related to classes, or working on school project), 5493 (\"Went to library\"), and 5494 (reviewing homework with a parent/caregiver). Common activities performed while doing homework were listening to music and watching TV (Pabilonia 2015). Our measures do not capture homework done while in class."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "We control for a rich set of individual, family, and school characteristics. Our individual controls include indicators for being female, being black or Hispanic, the Census region of residence in high school, and a set of year dummies indicating the year prior to the student graduating high school. The year dummies control for the fact that students are interviewed in different grades and in different time periods.7 F 8 We also control for whether a student was living in a state that required all high school students to take a college entrance exam as this could affect students' motivation. To control for ability, we include age-adjusted broad-reading and applied-problems standardized test scores from the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of Basic Achievement (WJ-R).8 F 9 These scores are from the CDS interview occurring five years prior to the CDS high school interview and are more likely to measure inherent ability than tests administered during high school.\nWe control for several family characteristics, including the number of other household children under age 20, average real family income over the five years prior to the time diary and its square, and indicators for whether the mother has a college degree, mother's degree is missing, whether the student lives with a single mother, and whether the student lives in some other family arrangement that was not a two-parent family.9 F 10 We also control for three schoollevel characteristics: the fraction of the respondent's high school that was white (averaged over the respondent's high school years)1 0 F 11 , the fraction of the respondent's high school that was freeor reduced-price-lunch eligible (also an average over the respondent's high school years), and the 13 Several additional variables are used as exclusion restrictions to identify homework in the outcome equations. That is, these variables are expected to affect how much time was spent on homework on the diary days but should otherwise be uncorrelated with high school GPA and college attendance. They include indicators for whether the weekday diary day was a Friday, whether the weekend diary day was a Saturday, whether the diary was in a spring month, and whether the student was older than the state minimum driving age at the time of the weekday diary. There is existing support for using temporal variables is time-use equations as Robinson and Godbey (1997) found that the day of the week and the season of the year affect time allocation. Intuitively, whether a diary day was a Friday or Saturday could affect a student's homework time because students are less likely to be assigned homework to do on the weekend. Whether a diary day occurred during a particular season could affect a student's homework time because of seasonal sports or exams. In the fall, many students play or watch football. In the spring, students may be taking and need to study for state standardized tests.\nHowever, neither the day or week nor the season of year indicator variables should affect a longterm outcome measure such as high school GPA or college attendance. Regarding the final instrumental variable, eligibility for a driver's license, such eligibility provides a student with more opportunities for work and socializing, which could leave less time for homework.\nHowever, all students will encounter this eligibility at some point based on their age and state of 12 The student-teacher ratio in each year is the total number of students in the school divided by the number of full-time-equivalent classroom teachers. 13 We also include an indicator for missing school characteristics variables. Some of these are due to a missing school-level identifier in the PSID-CDS and some are simply missing values. We assign the average of the non-missing values to those with a missing value.\nresidence. Therefore, it should not directly affect our long-term academic performance measures either."}, {"section_title": "III. Descriptive statistics", "text": "For our sample of 817 high school graduates, Table 1 reported spending six or more hours per week doing homework in their senior year.\nThe average time spent in homework as a primary activity is, of course, smaller than that for total homework because it does not include homework performed as a secondary activity, but girls still have a higher average than boys (7 hours versus 5 hours). The results also show that students often are doing other things while doing their homework. Time spent doing homework as a sole activity is roughly half the amount of total homework time, with an average of 3.6 hours for girls and 2.4 hours for boys.\nOver the course of the two observed diary days, 66 percent of students did some homework outside of school hours, but there were large differences in homework frequency by reported doing no homework on a \"usual\" day while another 12 percent reported doing more than two hours. Table 2 shows differences in hours spent on homework across GPA quartiles and between those attending or not attending college by age 20. Panel A shows the results using the total homework measure, Panel B shows the results using the homework as a primary activity measure, Panel C shows the results using the homework as a sole activity measure, and Panel D\nshows the results using the any homework measure. Regardless of measure, those students in the top GPA quartile did statistically significantly more homework, on average, than those in the bottom GPA quartile. Those in the top GPA quartile also did more than those in the middle quartiles though the difference was not statistically significantly different for the homework as a sole activity measure. In every quartile, girls did more homework than boys. On average, students who attended college did about two hours more homework than those who did not. The difference in homework time by college attendance was largest for boys. Boys who attended college did 3.22 hours more homework than those who did not. Differences in average homework time were not statistically significant for girls. However, even girls who did not attend college did more homework than boys who attended college.\n[ Table 2 near here]"}, {"section_title": "IV. Econometric analyses", "text": "For high school GPA, we first estimate the following linear regression model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):\nwhere Z represents high school GPA; b0, b1, and b2 are the coefficients to be estimated; H is a measure of time spent on homework, X is the matrix of control variables, and u is a normallydistributed error term. The subscripts indicating observation are suppressed. For college attendance, which is a discrete outcome, we estimate a probit model via maximum likelihood:\nwhere Y* is the latent variable representing the net benefit of attending college; Y is the observed outcome; a0, a1, and a2 are the coefficients to be estimated; and e is a normallydistributed error term. As in (1), the subscripts indicating observation are suppressed. Tables A2 and  A3 . For females, the applied-problems score has a positive significant effect on GPA and living in a family arrangement other than a two-parent family has a negative significant effect on GPA. For males, having a mother with a college degree and the fraction free-or-reduced-price-lunch eligible in high school have positive significant effects on GPA. For females, being black or Hispanic, the reading score, the applied-problems score, living in a state that mandates a college exam, the number of household children, having a mother with a college degree, and household income all have positive effects on attending college by age 20. For males, the applied-problems score and living in a state that mandates a college exam have positive effects on college by age 20 while the fraction free-or-reduced-price-lunch eligible in high school has a negative significant effect on attending college by age 20.\nusing survey weights and standard errors are adjusted for clustering on state because we include some state-level regressors (Cameron and Miller 2015) .\n[ Table 3 here]\nNot surprisingly given the large mean differences for males, we find a significant positive relationship between the hours spent on homework and college attendance by age 20 for males.\nThe magnitude of the effect is also economically significant. An extra hour of total homework per night (i.e. 7 hours per week) would increase the probability of attendance by about 5 percentage points. We also find that homework measured as a sole activity is related positively to GPA for males. The effects of homework as a sole activity on GPA are quite small, however, with the effects of an increase in homework on GPA by one hour per night being about 2.5\npercentage points on a scale of 100 for males. We find no significant relationship between homework and any outcome measure for females. We do not find a relationship between homework frequency and either outcome for either males or females.\nWe next model homework time as endogenous. Although teachers assign a certain amount of homework, students choose their level of effort, which may depend on an unobserved factor such as motivation, which also affects academic achievement directly.1 6 F 17 We therefore add the following homework equation to each of the previous models: 17 We did include test scores to control for ability and we do find that their inclusion slightly decreases the magnitude of the effects in the OLS specifications (results available upon request).\nwhere W includes our instrumental variables (indicators for whether the weekday diary day was a Friday, whether the weekend day diary day was a Saturday, an indicator for whether the diary was in a spring month, and whether the student was older than the state minimum driving age) to identify homework in the outcome equation, d0, d1 and d2 are the coefficients to be estimated, and \u03b3 is an error term. Joint estimation of the outcome equation (either [1] or [2] ) and the homework equation (3) is achieved via limited information maximum likelihood using the cmp command in Stata and assumes that the error terms in the outcome and homework equations are jointly normally distributed. We use this method of estimation because joint estimation of the homework equations is more efficient than two-stage estimation such as two-stage least squares (2SLS) because it allows the error terms in the homework and outcome equations to be correlated and also because it allows us to model a binary endogenous regressor, any homework, with a probit model. 2SLS allows only continuous endogenous regressors. level. However, the estimated correlation coefficients between the error terms across equations are mostly not significant. The exception is any homework for females in the GPA equation.\nThus, joint estimation of the outcome and homework equations in most cases has not led to 18 Results for the other coefficients in these models are available in online appendix Tables A4-A7 . 19 We also estimated a Tobit model for homework as there are a fair number of students who do not report doing any homework (see online appendix Table A8 ) and some studies (Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2012) have used Tobits to estimate homework equations. In these specifications, we find no significant effects of homework on academic achievement.\nincreased efficiency of the estimates. This is not surprising, however, given the extensive set of control variables included in each equation.\n[ Table 4 here]\nA drawback to using cmp to estimate the \"first-stage\" equation jointly with the \"second stage\" equation, however, is that standard instrumental variables tests cannot be performed.\nThus, to verify the validity of our instruments, we use two-stage least squares (2SLS) to reestimate our GPA specifications as this estimation technique allows weak-instruments and overidentification tests to be performed.1 9 F 20 Results are presented in Table 5 . A problem with 2SLS, however, is that, for the \"any homework\"/GPA specification (Panel D), we must incorrectly treat our any homework indicator variable as a continuous variable in order to run these tests. Regardless, our 2SLS estimates are quite similar to our cmp estimates. In the pooled models, the robust F-statistic for the exclusion restrictions in the first stage is greater than 10, with the exception of the \"any homework\"/GPA specifications, suggesting that we do not have a weak instruments problem; however, it is less than 10 in models in which we focus on the separate boy and girl samples. Perhaps this is a small sample size issue. For the overidentifying restrictions tests based on Hansen's J-statistic, we fail to reject the null that the instruments are uncorrelated with the error term.\n[ Table 5 here]"}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we examine the effects of high school homework time on two long-term academic outcomes, high school GPA and college attendance by age 20, using time-diary data.\nThese data may be more accurate and less subject to social desirability bias than data from retrospective survey questions, and they allow us to examine several different measures of homework. We control for a rich set of variables that includes students' characteristics, such as early test scores to control for ability, family variables, and school-level characteristics. Given that student motivation is unmeasured and may affect both homework and academic performance, we take an instrumental variables approach to control for this omitted variable bias.\nOnce we do this, all the positive effects of homework on high school GPA and college attendance become statistically insignificant.\nTime spent on homework may not accurately capture the quality of homework, however.\nStudies that examine specific types of homework assignments (reading, writing, etc.) and how they are graded (carefully or points just for turning it in) are needed to truly discover what types of homework assignments may improve students' long-run academic outcomes.
