[{"section_title": "", "text": "Previous studies, however, have been limited in three respects. First, they have not examined whether the relation between preschool enrollment and the magnitude of achievement gaps emerges prospectively or exists in full prior to the preschool years. In order to infer causation rather than selection as the basis for the relation between preschool enrollment and the magnitude of achievement gaps, the relation would have to exist only after the beginning of the preschool years. Second, because previous researchers have used data from only one child per family, they have been unable to estimate the effects of preschool on the total extent of between-family variation. Third, the specific characteristics of families examined have typically been macro-level characteristics, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and race, but not more proximal indices of the home environment, such as cognitive stimulation by parents. On the basis of previous work implicating more proximal learning environments, particularly parenting behaviors, as critical mediators of racial and socioeconomic disparities in achievement (Duncan et al., 1994; Guo & Harris, 2000; Lugo-Gil & Tamis-LeMonda, 2008) , one might expect preschool enrollment to diminish the influences of minority status and SES on child development, in part by reducing the influences of more proximal parenting behaviors.\nTo address these outstanding issues, the current project used longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins nested within families. The twin design was used to separate disparities in achievement associated with the between-family environment from disparities in achievement associated with the unique (withinfamily) environment and with genes. In addition to estimating the relation between preschool attendance and the total amounts of between-family environmental variation, I also estimated the associations between preschool attendance and the sizes of achievement gaps related to minority status, SES, and parental stimulation of cognitive development. Thus, this project examined the extent to which total between-family variation in achievement was reduced by preschool attendance and the extent to which these reductions could be accounted for by reductions in the associations between both macro-level characteristics of families and a proximal index of parenting. Moreover, by measuring children at ages 2, 4, and 5, I was able to estimate the extent to which the patterns observed were evident prior to preschool enrollment (which would be consistent with a selection but not causation account) or only after preschool enrollment (which would be consistent with a causal account of preschool enrollment in attenuating achievement gaps)."}, {"section_title": "Method Participants", "text": "Participant data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) twin sample (Snow et al., 2009) , which was representative of twins born in the United States in 2001.

Zygosity classifications from physical similarity ratings such as these have been consistently shown to be more than 90% accurate when crossvalidated using twins of known zygosity (Forget-Dubois et al., 2003; Goldsmith, 1991; Price et al., 2000) . Same-sex pairs who received a dizygotic classification were eliminated from analyses if their parents indicated that there was a medical reason for their dissimilarity.

Parents reported that 15% of twins were enrolled in the federally funded Head Start program, 61% of twins were enrolled in other forms of center-based care, and 26% were not enrolled in any center-based care. A twin was considered enrolled in preschool if he or she was enrolled in any form of center-based care (including Head Start). There were six pairs in which only one of the twins was enrolled in preschool; these pairs were eliminated from analyses. Eliminating children attending Head Start from analyses produced similar results to those reported here.\nEarly mental ability (2 years). At 2 years, ECLS staff individually administered to each twin the Bayley Short FormResearch Edition (BSF-R; Andreassen & Fletcher, 2007) , a shortened form of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (Bayley, 1993) . Item response theory was used to create a mental-ability score, which was based on items tapping the quality of exploration of objects, early problem solving, the production of simple sound and gestures, and receptive and expressive communication with words. The reliability estimate for this score was .88 (Andreassen & Fletcher, 2007) .\nEarly academic achievement (4 years and 5 years).

Interrater reliability of this rating was estimated at greater than 90% for both waves of data collection (Andreassen & Fletcher, 2007; Najarian et al., 2010) .

According to genetic theory, additive genetic variation is correlated at 1.0 for monozygotic twins and at .50 for dizygotic twins. By definition, shared environmental variation is correlated at 1.0 across all twin pairs, and nonshared environmental variation is uncorrelated across all twin pairs. For the current study, this standard SEM was expanded in order to examine whether the amounts of variation attributable to A, C, and E differ for children who attend preschool (preschool = 1) versus children who do not attend preschool (preschool = 0), as follows (cf. Purcell, 2002) :\nwhere \u00b5 is the mean of the phenotype; b preschool , a, c, and e are the main effects of preschool enrollment, A, C, and E, respectively; and a\u2032, c\u2032, and e\u2032 represent the interactions of preschool enrollment with A, C, and E, respectively.

Table 2 presents the results of a multiple logistic regression predicting the log odds of preschool enrollment at the 4-year wave. Results of the analysis indicated that older children and children from higher SES families were more likely to attend preschool. Table 3 presents parameter estimates from the application of Model 1 to mental-ability scores at age 2 and to reading and math scores at ages 4 and 5. First, although the logistic regression analyses reported in Table 2 indicate that there are, in fact, family and child characteristics that systematically predict the likelihood of preschool attendance, the magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on mental ability at age 2 did not significantly differ by subsequent preschool enrollment status (i.e., the a\u2032, c\u2032, and e\u2032 coefficients were not significantly different from zero).

Second, at 4 years, shared environmental influences on math and reading scores began to differ by preschool attendance, although these differences were not statistically significant for reading and only marginally significant for math. For math scores, the shared environment accounted for 74% of the variance among children who did not attend preschool at age 4 and 55% of the variance among children who attended preschool at age 4. For reading scores, these proportions were 82% and 63%, respectively.\nFinally, by 5 years, shared environmental influences on math and reading scores differed sharply between children who attended preschool at age 4 and those who did not. The shared environment accounted for 72% of the variance in math scores at age 5 among children who were not enrolled in preschool versus 47% of the variance among those who were enrolled the previous year. For reading scores, these proportions were 73% and 43%, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates this pattern by showing the unstandardized variance in math and reading scores accounted for by the shared environment at ages 4 and 5 by preschool enrollment. The magnitude of shared environmental influence on these two outcomes began to differ at age 4, with the difference growing substantially over the 1-year interval. By age 5, familylevel influences on achievement were substantially lower for children who had attended preschool during the previous year. Tucker-Drob The Shared Environment \u00d7 Preschool interaction is further illustrated in Figure 2 , which plots math and reading scores at age 5 as a function of latent shared-environment factor scores and preschool enrollment. The relation between scores on the latent shared-environment factor and achievement scores is steeper for children who had not attended preschool than for those who had. For very low scores on the shared environment (1.5 standard deviations below the mean), children who had been enrolled in preschool scored approximately 0.8 points better in math and 0.9 points better in reading than those who had not been enrolled in preschool. For very high scores on the shared environment (1.5 standard deviations above the mean), there was no appreciable achievement disparity between children who had attended preschool and those who had not. In the next set of analyses, I sought to clarify these results by examining measured rather than latent characteristics of families."}, {"section_title": "Interactions between measured covariates and preschool", "text": "Parameter estimates for applications of Model 2 are presented in Table 4 for math skills at age 5 and in Table 5 for reading skills at age 5. Three parameters from each model are of particular interest: b F , b\u2032 F , and c\u2032. The b F parameter represents the main effect of the measured covariate for children who had not attended preschool at age 4; this parameter was significantly positive in all cases: For children who had not attended preschool at age 4, being White, being from a higher-SES family, and receiving more parental stimulation predicted greater math and reading scores at age 5. The b\u2032 F parameter (the interaction between the measured covariate and preschool) represents the difference in the effect of the measured covariate for children who had been enrolled in preschool at age 4. This parameter was significantly negative in all cases: The associations between ethnic minority status, SES, and parental stimulation, on the one hand, and math and reading scores at age 5, on the other hand, were substantially reduced for children who had been enrolled in preschool at age 4.\nFinally, the c\u2032 parameter represents the extent to which the remaining shared environmental influences (i.e., unmeasured family-level variation unaccounted for by the measured covariates) are lower for children who had attended preschool at age 4. In all cases, this parameter was attenuated relative to its corresponding estimate in Table 3 , which indicates that the interactions between the measured covariates and preschool accounted for some of the Shared Environment \u00d7 Preschool interactions.

This indicates that the interaction effects largely represent an overlapping set of family-level influences that are together attenuated by preschool enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The major finding reported in this article is that preschool enrollment at age 4 was prospectively associated with substantially reduced family-level influences on early reading and math skills at age 5. Among children who attended preschool at age 4, shared environmental influences accounted for 47% of the variance in math scores and 43% of the variance in reading scores at age 5. In contrast, among children who did not attend preschool at age 4, shared environmental influences accounted for 72% of the variance in math scores and 73% of the variance in reading scores at age 5. The magnitude of shared environmental influences on cognitive test scores at age 2 did not differ by subsequent preschool enrollment, which suggests that the interaction effects observed at age 5 were not simply manifestations of preexisting interactions. Preschool attendance was prospectively associated with enhanced reading and math skills, particularly for racial and ethnic minorities, children from lower-SES families, and children whose parents were rated as less cognitively stimulating. It was primarily the overlapping effect of minority status, SES, and parental stimulation that was attenuated by preschool enrollment. Moreover, SES significantly predicted the likelihood of being enrolled in preschool, a fact suggesting that the very children who would benefit most from preschools are those who are least likely to be enrolled in preschools. Therefore, differences in the rate of preschool enrollment across families may actually serve to perpetuate achievement disparities at the population level.\nPrevious research on the role of early child care in equalizing between-family disparities in academic achievement has used designs with only one child per family. As a result, these studies were able to examine only whether preschool enrollment attenuates the impact of specific, measured family characteristics. In contrast, the current study used twin data, which allowed estimates of the total effect of family-level influences on achievement to be made. The method applied relies on the standard assumptions of the twin approach. However, Loehlin, Harden, and Turkheimer (2009) have demonstrated that interaction-effect estimates in twin models are far Model-implied average math scores (left column) and reading scores (right column) at age 5 for children who had been enrolled in preschool at age 4 and those who had not. Results are shown as a function of minority status (top row), socioeconomic status (SES; middle row), and ratings of parental stimulation of cognitive development from a video-recorded dyadic task between parent and child (bottom row). For SES and parental stimulation, low is equal to 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, and high is equal to 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\nless influenced by violations of standard assumptions than are main-effect estimates. Because the current study was primarily concerned with interaction effects (specifically, the Shared Environment \u00d7 Preschool interaction), the current findings can be considered robust.\nBecause data were available from multiple waves, including a wave preceding preschool enrollment, the current study was able to test whether there were preexisting differences in the magnitude of shared environmental influences associated with later preschool status. The absence of such preexisting differences strengthens the inference that the observed interaction effects were indeed caused by preschool attendance. In theory, an even stronger causal inference could be made using a randomized experiment, such as a lottery for preschool vouchers, combined with methods to examine treatment-effect heterogeneity (e.g., Tucker-Drob, 2011) .\nAlthough this study was unique in examining multiple measured family-level covariates as modifiers of preschool effects, a limitation is that specific characteristics of preschools were not examined. One might expect that the greatest preschool boost would occur for the few disadvantaged children who are fortunate enough to attend high-quality preschools. Previous work has shown that several indices of child-care quality, including live observer ratings of preschool teachers' sensitivity, responsivity, and stimulation of cognitive development (Dearing, McCartney, & Taylor, 2009) , are specifically associated with reduced achievement gaps. Other factors associated with reduced achievement gaps at school entry include earlier age of enrollment in child care (Caughy, DiPietro, & Strobino, 1994) , being in a full-time rather than a part-time program (Geoffroy et al., 2007) , being in a formal center-based program rather than an informal program (Geoffroy et al., 2010) , and being exposed to more school-transition practices, such as preschoolers spending time in the kindergarten classroom and teachers visiting the home at the beginning of the kindergarten school year (Schulting, Malone, & Dodge, 2005) . Future longitudinal studies should chart the achievement gap prior to and following preschool enrollment. Although empirical research on school and home quality (Dowsett, Huston, Imes, & Gennetian, 2008) has found that preschools \"offer more opportunities for cognitive and intellectual development than do the home-based settings . . . that are typically used by low-income parents\" (p. 90), it is possible that the preschool-associated gap reductions found in the study reported here were primarily driven by those preschools meeting a minimum threshold of quality.\nFinally, although this study examined (and detected) effects of preschool on achievement gaps in academic achievement in kindergarten, it is unknown whether gap reductions would be maintained into later childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The vast majority of previous experimental and quasiexperimental studies have reported large immediate benefits of preschools on impoverished children's achievement, but only a select subset (e.g., Campbell, Ramey, Pungello, Sparling, & Miller-Johnson, 2002; Schweinhart et al., 2005) have found the effects to persist in the long term. Many other studies have found that the effects fade out over time (e.g., Currie & Thomas, 1995; see Leak et al., 2010 for a meta-analysis). Barnett (1995) speculated that differences in quality and funding across programs may help to account for differences in longterm effects. It is also likely that inequalities in children's experiences following preschool serve to wash out early gains and that maintenance of gains among low-income children would generally require amelioration of inequalities that exist during the elementary school, middle school, and high school years.\nNotwithstanding this latter issue, economic analyses have indicated that there are long-term monetary benefits of investing in preschool programs for impoverished children (Barnett, 1995; Duncan, Ludwig, & Magnusson, 2007; Heckman, 2006) .\nIn conclusion, the results reported here suggest that preschool attendance may help to reduce achievement gaps associated with multiple measured and unmeasured family-level variables. However, because lower-SES families are less likely to send their children to preschool, the equalizing effects of preschools at the population level may not be fully realized.\nIt remains unclear what specific aspects of preschools are responsible for these effects or whether the immediate benefits of preschools for reducing achievement gaps would persist in the long term."}, {"section_title": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests", "text": "The author declared that he had no conflicts of interest with respect to his authorship or the publication of this article."}]
