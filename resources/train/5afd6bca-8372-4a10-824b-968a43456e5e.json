All participants gave their written informed consent to engage in these studies, which were approved by the research ethics board of the respective institutions, and included consent for data sharing with collaborators as well as secondary analysis. Ethical approval was also obtained at the site of secondary analysis (CRIUGM).\nThe ADNI2 data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership representing efforts of co-investigators from numerous academic institutions and private corporations. ADNI was followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 that included newer techniques. Subjects included in this study were recruited by ADNI-2 from all 13 sites that acquired resting-state fMRI on Philips scanners across North America. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nThe final combined sample included 112 cognitively normal elderly subjects (CN) and 143 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the CN group, the mean age was 72.0 (s.d. 7.0) years, and 38.4% were men. Mean age of the MCI subjects was 72.7 (s.d. 7.7) years, and 50.3% were men.

[1] . These eight resolutions of brain parcellations (Fig. 1) , registered to both symmetric and asymmetric MNI templates, have been released on figshare 8 and Neurovault. 9 These eight resolutions were further processed to generate eight parcellations that contain ROIs that are spatially connected and span only one hemisphere (for an example, see Fig. 2 ). These latter parcellations contain 10, 17, 30, 51, 77, 137, 199, and 322 total ROIs. We have provided labels for each parcel at every resolution, except for resolutions 4 and 6 due to the merging of networks at those low resolutions. At resolution 4, we observed the sensory-motor network, visual network, a network that resembles the endogenous network [6] and a network that merges the cerebellum and the mesolimbic network together. At resolution 6, we observed the visual network, cerebellum, mesolimbic network, sensory-motor network, a network that merges the deep gray matter nuclei with the frontoparietal network, and a network that merges the default mode network with the posterior attention network. For resolution 12, we manually labeled each parcel (deep gray matter nuclei (DGMN), posterior default mode network (pDMN), medial temporal lobe (mTL), ventral temporal lobe (vTL), dorsal temporal lobe (dTL), anterior default mode network (aDMN), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), posterior attention (pATT), cerebellum (CER), sensory-motor (SM), visual (VIS), and frontoparietal network (FPN)). Then, we decomposed the networks at resolution 12 into smaller subclusters at all higher resolutions (for an example, see Fig. 3 ). Each parcel at higher resolutions was labeled in reference to the parcels at resolution 12, with the following convention: (resolution)_(parcel label)_(#); for example, at resolution (R) 22, the anterior default mode splits into two clusters, which were named \"R22_aDMN_1\" and \"R22_aDMN_2\"."}, {"section_title": "Derivation of functional connectomes", "text": "Between and within-clusters connectivity was measured as described in Tam et al. [1] . "}, {"section_title": "Statistical testing", "text": "To test for differences between aMCI and CN at a resolution of 33 clusters, we used a general linear model (GLM) for each connection between two parcels [7] . Specific details of the GLM can be found in Tam et al. [1] . From this analysis, we present uncorrected t-maps illustrating functional connectivity differences between patients and controls for four seeds/regions of interest (striatum, dorsal prefrontal cortex, middle temporal lobe, and medial frontal cortex) (Fig. 4) . These maps have been released on figshare and Neurovault. These four seeds were chosen for further analyses because, together, they were associated with 47% of all significant group differences across all brain regions. Briefly, we found that MCI patients exhibited reduced connectivity between default mode network nodes and between areas of the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.
