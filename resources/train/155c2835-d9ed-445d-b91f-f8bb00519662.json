[{"section_title": "SECTION I. GENERAL NOTES", "text": "This report presents data on the demographic and employment characteristics of the nation's doctoral scientists and engineers. The data were developed as part of the Doctorate Data Project.' The goal of the 1997 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is to provide policymakers and researchers with high-quality data and analyses for making informed decisions related to the educational achievement and career patterns of the nation's doctoral scientists and engineers. Current information on the supply and utilization of doctoral personnel in science and engineering reflects the results of SDR, the thirteenth in a biennial series. The population of the 1997 survey includes persons under the age of 76 who hold doctorates in science or engineering from U.S. institutions. The SDR is a longitudinal demographic survey of science and engineering doctorate holders conducted biennially for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and for other Federal agencies (current and past sponsors included NIH and DOE) since 1973. Several changes have been made to the 1997 tables and are noted in the Technical Notes, included in the back of this report. (See appendix SECTION II.

The advance letter was sent in May 1997, followed by the 1.\" mailing in early June. The second mailing was sent in August 1997. To increase the mail response rate, an additional follow-up mailing occurred via Federal Express. The CATI follow-up ended in March 1998."}, {"section_title": "RESPONSE RATES", "text": "The overall unweighted response rate for the 1997 SDR was 85 percent. The response to the mail phase of the survey was about 55 percent. The overall weighted response rate was about 78 percent (weighted response divided by the weighted sample cases.)"}, {"section_title": "DATA PREPARATION", "text": "Data preparation for the 1997 SDR included pre-data entry edit, data entry, coding, telephone call backs for critical items and sample verification, post-data entry editing and data review, and imputation. As completed survey mail questionnaires were received, they were logged and transferred to the pre-data entry editing at NORC for processing. The data from the questionnaire were keyed into the database in a process known as CADE (Computer-Assisted Data Entry). The data entry program, SurveyCraft, contained a full complement of range, consistency, skip error checks to prevent entry errors and inconsistent answers. Three on-line coding programs were tied into the SDR CADE program to ease data entry of special codes: IPEDS for educational institutions, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for U.S. states and foreign countries, and Primary Field of Study/Education. Consistency checks were also built into the CATI program along with the skip patterns. Some consistency checks were performed on a num-ber of variables prior to the merge of the CADE and CATI data files to ensure complete compatibility. Computer checks also flagged the cases with missing key items (employment status, occupation, birthdate, etc.) and the telephone call-backs were made to obtain the response; otherwise they were considered as incomplete responses. A detailed edit specification was developed from the SESTAT surveys edit guideline to perform further computer editing of multiple values to \"Mark One\" questions, skip errors, range errors, inter-item inconsistencies, cross year inconsistencies. \"Other Specify\" responses were coded using the SESTAT coding guidelines and respondents' occupational data was reviewed along with other work-related data from the questionnaire to \"correct\" known respondent self-reporting problems to obtain the \"best\" occupation codes."}, {"section_title": "Basic frequency distributions of all survey items", "text": "showed item nonresponse rates to be generally less than 3 percent. Nonresponse to a few questions deemed somewhat sensitive, such as annual salary or household income, was around 6.5 percent. To compensate for the item nonresponse, data not reported by the respondents, as well as response of \"refused\" or \"don't know\" were imputed. Two imputation methods were used: (1) logical imputation, and (2) hot deck imputation. For logical imputation, either the respondent's answers to related questions determined what the missing value had to be, or the respondent's answer to the same question in the prior survey round substituted for the missing value. The latter approach of using the historical data is often called \"cold deck\" imputation. Cold deck imputation is useful for variables that are static, such as place of birth or gender. When logical imputation was used, it was employed before hot deck imputation. In hot deck imputation, a donor case is selected from the current round of respondents by matching on related variables. The donor case's response is used as a proxy for the recipient's missing variable. Hot deck imputation is the method of choice for variables that may change over time, such as employment characteristics. Hot deck is preferable to model-based imputation in this application because it easily preserves correlation among variables and maintains the valid response rages for categorical variables. Imputation was done in a specified sequence, with key auxiliary variables being imputed first. After the key variables were imputed, variables were imputed by questionnaire section. Within a section, variables were imputed more or less in questionnaire order, with certain exceptions. Questions used to drive skip patterns were imputed before questions affected by the skip driver. Questions new to this round were imputed last within a section. Where logical, groups of companion variables were imputed together (such as the various reasons for working outside the Ph.D. field)."}, {"section_title": "WEIGHTING AND ESTIMATION", "text": "To enable weighted analyses of the 1997 SDR data, a sample weight was calculated for every person in the sample. The primary purpose of the weights is to create representative estimates by adjusting for unequal probabilities of selection. The second purpose is to adjust for the effects of nonresponse. Informally, a sampling weight approximates the number of persons in the Ph.D. population that a sampled person represents. The weights were calculated in several stages. The first stage was the calculation of base weights that account for the sample design. A base weight for a respondent is the reciprocal of the probability of selection. The revised base weights ranged from 1.0 to 112.008 with a median value of 11.442. The sum of the revised weights, 632,789, is also an estimate of the frame size. Base weights varied within cells because different sampling rates were used depending on the year of selection and the stratification in effect at that time. The next stage was to construct a combined weight, which took into account the subsampling of nonrespondents at the CATI phase. All respondents received a combined weight, which for mail respondents was equal to the sample weight and for CATI respondents was a combination of their original sample weight and their CATI subsample weight. The final stage was to adjust the sampling weights for unit nonresponse. (Unit nonresponse occurs when the sample member refuses to participate or cannot be located.) This was done in a group of nonresponse adjustment cells created using poststratification. Within each nonresponse adjustment cell, a weighted nonresponse rate, which took into account both mail and CATI nonresponse, was calculated. The nonresponse adjustment factor was the inverse of this weighted response rate. The initial set of nonresponse adjustment factors was examined and, under certain conditions, some of the cells were collapsed if use of the adjustment factor would create excessive variance. The final weights for respondents were calculated by multiplying their respective combined weights by the nonresponse adjustment factor. In data analysis, population estimates are made by summing the final weights of all respondents who possess a particular characteristic."}, {"section_title": "RELIABILITY", "text": "Because the estimates produced from this survey are based on a sample, they may vary from those that would have been obtained if all members of the target population had been surveyed (using the same questionnaire and data collection methods). Two types of error are possible when population estimates are derived from measures of a sample: nonsampling error and sampling error. By looking at these errors, it is possible to estimate the accuracy and precision of the survey results. Sampling error is the variation that occurs by chance because a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed. The particular sample that was used to estimate the 1997 population of science and engineering doctorates in the United States was one of a large number of samples that could have been selected using the same sample design and size. Estimates based on each of these samples would have differed. Sampling errors were developed using a generalized variance procedure in order to provide approximate sampling errors that would be applicable to a wide variety of items. As a result, these sampling errors provide an indication of the order of magnitude of a sampling error rather than a precise sampling error for any specific item. This method first computes the variances associated with selected variables for certain subsets of the sample. The variances of the selected variables were computed using SUDAAN software and the Taylor series approximation method, which can incorporate finite correction factors. The finite correction factors are important for the SDR sample design where some strata had high sampling fractions. The estimated variances for the selected variables were used to estimate regression coefficients for use in generalized variance functions that estimate the standard errors associated with a broader range of totals and percentages. For each of the demographic groups and fields of study shown in Appendix D, 31 models from the variables listed above were combined into a nonlinear regression to fit a predictive model for standard errors, as described below. Appendix table D. shows model parameters, a and b, that can be used to approximate standard errors for the S&E doctoral population overall, for broad field groupings used by NSF, and for selected subgroups of analytic interest.4 Let x denote the estimated total for which a standard error is desired. The standard error can be approximated using the appropriate values of a and b along with the following formula for standard errors of totals: Percentages are another type of estimate for which standard errors may be desired. The standard error of a percentage may be approximated using the formula: where p equals the percentage possessing the specific characteristic and x and y represents the numerator and denominator, respectfully, of the ratio that yields the observed percentage. In addition to sampling error, data are subject to nonsampling error, which can arise at many points in the survey process. Sources of nonsampling error takes many different forms: (1) nonresponse bias, which arises when the characteristics between individuals who do not respond to a survey differ significantly from those who do; (2) measurement error, which arises when we are not able to precisely measure the variables of interest; (3) coverage error, which arises when some members of the target pOpulation are not,identified and thus do not have a chance to be selected for the sample; (4) prOCessing error, which can arise at the point of data editing, coding or key entry. These sources of error are much harder to estimate than sampling errors."}, {"section_title": "IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE TABLES", "text": "Please note several changes that were made in the 1997 tables from 1993 and 1995 reports 1. Doctorate field groups were changed as follows: 4The generalized error estimates in this report were based on a set of assumptions that did not appear to hold in the case of some small subpopulations. In such cases, the parameters listed for a higher-level field within a demographic group or a higher-level demographic group within a field were considered a useful substitute as a generalized error estimate.
