[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "There has been some criticism of the teacher education programs in Turkey, claiming that pre-service teachers were not ready for the profession. This study explored the mental readiness of pre-service teachers to facilitate integrated mathematics and science. Data were collected from pre-service teachers who were enrolled in either integrated or departmentalized teacher education programs. Data were analyzed using a three-way multivariate factorial analysis of variance model. The independent variables were program (integrated or departmentalized), department (mathematics or science), and gender while the dependent variables were the attitudes towards the integrated teaching and nature of mathematics and science. The results indicated that pre-service mathematics teachers in the integrated teacher education program had more favorable attitudes towards integrated teaching of mathematics than pre-service mathematics teachers in the departmentalized program. The study showed that the integrated program may be an effective alternative to the standard departmentalized teacher education programs in Turkey."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Turkish political leadership's vision was to develop a competitive country in the st century. To accomplish this, the political leadership developed the Vision 2023 foresight document and charged policy making organizations to enact legislations that would increase the size and productivity of the innovative human capital of the nation (Serbest, 2005) . Both Ministry of National Education (MoNE), K-12 policy maker, and Council of Higher Education (CoHE), higher education policy maker, independently developed strategies to improve mathematics and science education in the country. However, reforms at K-12 and higher education levels were enacted with little coordination between policy making organizations. For example, MoNE changed the middle grades (fourth through eighth grade) standards and encouraged mathematics and science education teachers to integrate their subjects (MoNE, 2009a (MoNE, , 2009b (MoNE, , 2013a (MoNE, , 2013b after CoHE abandoned the double certification program for middle grades mathematics and science preservice teachers, which was enabling them to graduate with a minor degree in the other subject. During this period of double certification, CoHE's pre-service teacher education program required no coursework to foster integrated teaching knowledge (Corlu, 2014) and few courses in pre-service teachers' minor teaching area. When the new program was introduced, it became apparent that the new program was even more theory (content or pedagogy) intensive than the old program (Bulut, 2007; Kartal, 2011) . Because CoHE recommended it, almost all universities adopted this teacher education program with minor modifications (Isiksal & Cakiroglu, 2006) .\nThe uncoordinated strategies of MoNE and CoHE limited the impact of the reforms in twofold. First, according to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Turkish students continued to underperform peers (Alacaci & Erbas, 2010 ; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2009b) . Second, according to the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the need for quality teachers continued to be a major problem (OECD, 2009a) . In response to discouraging findings in cross-national studies, several influential organizations in the country, such as Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (2010) and Turkish Academy of Sciences (2010) called policy making organizations to coordinate their efforts and increase access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education by developing effective teacher education programs. The uncoordinated reform approaches in K-12 and teacher education levels failed to produce effective outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Attitudes towards Mathematics and Science", "text": "Researchers described the attitude concept in regard to two related theories. The theory of planned behavior, which was an extension of theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) , posited that if individuals evaluated the suggested behavior (attitude) as positive and if they thought they were expected to perform the behavior then they would increase their motivation, which would result in an intention to perform that suggested behavior (Ajzen, 1985 (Ajzen, , 1988 . In both theories, attitude was a concept of belief that represented a person's general feeling of favorableness or unfavorableness toward some stimulus object (Fishbein & Ajzen, , p. . \"ecause teacher beliefs were tacit, often unconsciously held assumptions about students, classrooms, and the academic material to be taught Kagan, , p. , attitudes of teachers was defined as a mental state of readiness, which was organized through experience (Kulm, 1980) . In fact, some researchers added that attitudes towards a discipline were usually defined by the instruments used in the study (Aiken, 1970) .\nThe attitudes of mathematics and science teachers have been investigated in a number of studies. Researchers stated that poor attitudes of pre-service teachers towards mathematics or science might inhibit both their own learning and teaching their subject area (Battista, 1986; Czerniak & Chiarelott, 1990) . Research also showed that teachers' negative attitudes towards mathematics might be transmitted to students Larson, or might negatively affect their students' mathematics achievement Schofield, . Earlier research on teachers' attitudes towards mathematics indicated that attitude had a statistically significant relationship with student achievement despite little practical significance (Aiken, 1976; Pajares, 1992) . A mean effect size Cohen's d = 0.12) is estimated across more recent studies on mathematics attitude and achievement (Ma & Kishor, 1997) . In Turkey, it was shown that there was no statistically significant difference between male and female pre-service teachers' attitudes towards science (Bayraktar, 2011; Bilgin & Geban, 2004; Tekbiyik & Ipek, 2007; Turkmen, 2002; Ucar & Sanalan, 2011) . In one of the recent studies, researchers found that at the end of their four-year pre-service teacher education program, Turkish science teachers attitudes towards science was statistically significantly less than their attitudes at the beginning Cohen's d = 0.60) (Bayraktar, . In another study, CoHE's new pre-service teacher education program did not improve pre-service teachers' attitudes towards science (Ucar & Sanalan, 2011) .\nSeveral researchers in the U.S. concluded that the attitudes of in-service teachers towards mathematics and science integration were statistically significantly lower than pre-service teachers' attitudes. \" possible explanation to this finding was the subject-matter oriented teacher education of the past compared to the pedagogical content knowledge emphasis in the current pre-service teacher education programs in the U.S. (Lehman, 1994; Pang & Good, 2000; Stevens & Wenner, 1996) . However, research also indicated that teachers' positive attitudes towards the integrated nature of mathematics and science did not automatically transfer into a successful implementation of integrated curriculum (Wicklein & Schell, 1995) .\nIn qualitative investigations of attitudes of pre-service teachers' towards the integrated nature of mathematics and science, researchers found that integrated teacher education programs enhanced preservice teachers' understanding of integration and at the end of the program they were able to recognize and appreciate integrated mathematics and science applications (Koirala & Bowman, 2003; Morrison & RothMcDuffie, 2009 ). In another similar study, an integrated pre-service teacher education program was found to be an effective way to help mathematics and science pre-service teachers recognize the complexity and challenges of STEM education teaching (Berlin & White, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Research Constructs and Questions", "text": "STEM education is conceptually defined as the set of knowledge, skills and beliefs which are collaboratively constructed [by students and teachers] at the intersection of more than one STEM subject area Corlu, Capraro, & Capraro, , p. . Similarly, a positive attitude towards STEM education is described as a mental state of readiness to construct knowledge at the intersection of more than one STEM subject area. Dogan (1999) suggested that when exploring the attitudes of pre-service teachers, it was necessary to consider their attitudes towards both the nature and teaching of the subject area. Several examples of STEM education with respect to mathematics used in science exist in the curriculum, including using probability in Punnett squares, reading graphs in time-velocity-displacement, or checking relations among quantities through dimensional analysis. Thus, in this paper, we limited our definition of mental readiness towards STEM education to the attitudes towards mathematics and science integration.\nThe purpose of this study is to describe the mental readiness of pre-service teachers for STEM education in terms of their attitudes towards integrated nature and teaching of mathematics and science. The specific research questions were: (a) Are the attitudes of teachers studying in an integrated teacher education program more favorable than teachers studying in a departmentalized teacher education program? (b) Are the attitudes of teachers affected by any interaction of program (integrated or departmentalized), department (mathematics or science), and gender main effects?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The sample for this study was purposively drawn from pre-service mathematics and science teachers who were studying at state universities (university A or university B).

Further, the participants in the sample met two criteria: (a) they were eligible to graduate at the end of the term; (b) they were enrolled in their last methods courses.\nThe total sample size was 226: university A mathematics = 50 (Female = 25), university A science = 19 (Female = 12), university B mathematics = 49 (Female = 24), and university B science = 108 (Female = 75).

There were three major differences between the universities:\n1. At university A, the integrated program required a balanced coursework in theory (pedagogy and content) and practice (pedagogical content knowledge and integrated teaching courses). At university B, departmentalized programs were theory intensive; 2. at university A, the integrated program required more content courses in pre-service teachers' minor teaching area (mathematics or science) than departmentalized programs at university B; 3. at university A, integrated program allowed pre-service teachers in both departments to take courses together while at university B departmentalized programs required pre-service teachers to take all their courses separately.\nAlthough the two departments in the integrated program at university A were very similar in terms of distribution of coursework, at university B pre-service mathematics teachers were required to take relatively less pedagogical content knowledge courses in their major teaching area than pre-service science teachers. Earlier research showed that CoHE's standard program was similarly theory-intensive and similar to university B program (Ucar & Sanalan, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "The data collection instrument adapted items from Dogan's (1999) attitude survey, which was selected for four reasons: (a) items were developed with a consideration of other widely-used surveys, either in attitudes towards mathematics or science (e.g., Aiken, 1970 Aiken, , 1976 Schonfeld, 1989) ; (b) Dogan developed items with a consideration of mathematics and science curriculum in Turkey; (c) items were specifically designed in Turkish and for Turkish pre-service teachers; (d) score reliability in a similar context to the current study was reported at an acceptable level Cronbach's alpha = 0.76 for N = 344).\nThe instrument used in the current study included seven negatively and seven positively worded items in addition to the definition and several examples to ensure that there was a similar understanding between the researcher and the participants. The integrated nature and teaching of mathematics and science was defined as particular products of STEM education that allows teachers to teach mathematics used in science.\nThe instrument was administered online and participants were allowed to complete the survey anytime in a 24-hour period at their convenience. To ensure there were no missing data, online survey used item validation, which required pre-service teachers to respond to each item. To ensure participant answers were not random, their completion time was monitored. Mean completion time was 4.5 minutes (SD = 1.8 minutes). There were no outliers in terms of completion time.

A necessity to reword T7 and T9 emerged as their factor score weights for integrated nature of mathematics and science were greater than their factor score weights for integrated teaching of mathematics and science.

Hence, it might be the case that pre-service teachers evaluated the abstract nature of mathematics as boring. The errors of T I don't have enough interest in mathematics used science to motivate pupils) and T9 (mathematics used in science is one of my favorite subjects to teach were correlated with the theoretical support from Dweck and Leggett's (1998) model, explaining the relationship between interest and motivation."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.", "text": "Revised confirmatory factor analysis model.\nThe sample size was considered large enough to yield robust estimates.

However, the instrument requires refinement, especially with the wording of two items intended to measure the integrated teaching of mathematics and science dimension of pre-service teachers' attitudes. The current wording fosters variation in response where the items load partially on integrated nature of mathematics and science. While this is not a fatal flaw, the language should be cleared up to prevent the interpretation by the respondents that the items measure the attitudes towards the integrated nature of mathematics and science. Those changes need not invalidate the entire instrument but further work would delineate the practical importance of the two factors and their distinguishing abilities.\nThis study highlights the importance of integrated mathematics and science programs for developing positive attitudes toward teaching mathematics and science in an integrated curriculum. The findings indicate that the impact of the integrated university curriculum is noteworthy for pre-service mathematics and science teachers' attitudes when compared to pre-service mathematics teachers in the departmentalized program. The integrated university program provides a number of distinct opportunities to pre-service teachers, which may explain this finding. For example, pre-service teachers in the integrated program may benefit from the balanced coursework of content, pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge (Carroll, Sanders, , integrated teaching courses \"erlin & White, Schleigh, \"oss\u00e9, & Lee, , or the increased peer stimulation during classroom instruction (Subotnik, Tai, Rickoff, & Almarode, 2010) , which have all been shown to positively impact pre-service teacher ability to integrate mathematics and science, which might led pre-service teachers to be less prone to anxiety for teaching in an integrated curriculum (Bursal, 2010) . The excessive focus on mathematics content knowledge coursework in the departmentalized program may have a negative impact on pre-service mathematics teachers' attitudes toward integrating mathematics and science (cf. Blomeke, Suhl, & Kaiser, 2011) . Pre-service mathematics teachers in the departmentalized program need to be provided with at least as many pedagogical content knowledge courses as their peers in the science department. Pre-service mathematics and science teachers can be better prepared to adapt to MoNE's reformist curricula with an integrated teacher education program (cf. Ertekin, 2010 ).\nIntegrated program emerges as an alternative to CoHE's standard program. We believe that the integrated program prepares pre-service teachers equipped with a mental readiness to implement STEM education and adapt to MoNE's reforms. We further believe that pre-service teachers, who graduate from integrated teacher education programs with a strong integrated teaching knowledge (Corlu, 2014) , will understand and teach STEM as an interconnected entity with a strong connection to life. These students will graduate with the ability to positively affect their students' achievement, beliefs, and attitudes and lead more and better prepared students to stay in the STEM pipeline (Subotnik, Tai, Rickoff, & Almarode, 2010) ."}]
