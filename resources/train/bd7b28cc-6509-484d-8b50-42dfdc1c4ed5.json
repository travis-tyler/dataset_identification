[{"section_title": "", "text": "At each time point, ECLS-K's main school contact, referred to as the School Coordinator, provided information on whether a student received special education services. The School Coordinator also identifi ed the student's primary service provider (i.e., the person with primary responsibility for providing the student's special education services), who identifi ed the student's primary disability. 3 Additional information was collected on the student and the student's school, including the student's sex, race/ethnicity, and poverty status (poor or nonpoor) 4 and the school's control (public or private), urbanicity (central city, urban fringe/large town, or small town/rural), region, and poverty concentration (higher poverty schools are those with 50 percent or more students eligible for the National School Lunch Program; lower poverty schools are those with fewer than 50 percent of students eligible). This Issue Brief provides a detailed description of the proportion of elementary school students receiving special education in kindergarten, fi rst grade, third grade, and fi fth grade; the primary disabilities of these students; and the variation in these measures across a range of demographic NCES 2007-005 Issue Brief and school characteristics. 5 Table 1 presents the percentages of the student cohort receiving special education in the specifi ed grades (as reported by the School Coordinator), by primary disability (as identifi ed by the primary special education provider). Table 2 presents the percentages of students receiving special education in the specifi ed grades by other demographic characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, and poverty status) and school characteristics (school control, urbanicity, region, and poverty concentration). Table 2 also reports fi ndings separately for students identifi ed as having a learning disability or a speech or language impairment as their primary disability.

The percentage of the cohort receiving special education increased in each subsequent grade analyzed: 5.4 percent of students in fi rst grade, 9.4 percent in third grade, and 11.9 percent in fi fth grade. In kindergarten, the most commonly identifi ed primary disability was a speech or language impairment (2.3 percent of students). In fi rst grade, the most commonly identifi ed primary disabilities were a speech or language impairment (1.8 percent) and a specifi c learning disability (1.2 percent). In third and fi fth grades, the most commonly identifi ed primary disability was a specifi c learning disability (3.3 and 6.5 percent, respectively). The percentage of the student cohort with a specifi c learning disability as a primary disability increased across each grade, from 0.5 percent in kindergarten to 6.5 percent in fi fth grade. Except for these two most common primary disabilities, no other disability had a prevalence of more than 1 percent in any grade. However, some other disabilities did show changes in prevalence over time. The percentages of students with an identifi ed health impairment, mental retardation, or a serious emotional disturbance were greater in fi fth grade than in kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Students Receiving Special Education", "text": "Sex. Among the kindergarten class of 1998-99, the percentage of boys receiving special education (5.3 percent) was greater Issue Brief July 2007 than that of girls (2.9 percent) (table 2). The percentage of boys receiving special education was also greater than that of girls in each of the other grades sampled. Race/ethnicity. The percentage of students receiving special education showed little variation across racial/ethnic categories. However, the percentage of White, non-Hispanic students receiving special education in kindergarten (4.6 percent) was greater than the percentage of Hispanic students or students in the other/more than one race category (3.3 and 2.8 percent, respectively). In addition, a greater percentage of White, non-Hispanic students than Hispanic students received special education in fi rst grade (5.8 vs. 4.0 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Student poverty status.", "text": "The percentage of poor students receiving special education was greater than that of nonpoor students in each grade.

In each grade, the percentage of public school students receiving special education services was greater than the percentage of private school students. Urbanicity. Central city schools reported lower percentages of students receiving special education than did schools in other settings in some grades. For example, lower percentages of children in central city schools than in urban fringe/large town schools received special education in kindergarten and fi rst grade (3.0 vs. 4.8 percent and 3.1 vs. 5.5 percent, respectively). Also, in each of the grades sampled, lower percentages of children in central city schools than in small town/rural schools received special education (3.0 vs. 5.0 percent in kindergarten, 3.1 vs. 8.8 percent in fi rst grade, 8.3 vs. 10.7 percent in third grade, and 10.5 vs. 14.6 percent in fi fth grade).

By region, students in the West were less likely than students in the Northeast and South to receive special education in kindergarten (2.0 vs. 6.2 and 5.3 percent, respectively), fi rst grade (2.2 vs. 5.6 and 7.5 percent), and third grade (6.3 vs. 11.1 and 10.7 percent). A smaller percentage of students in the Midwest than in the Northeast and the South received special education in kindergarten (2.6 vs. 6.2 and 5.3 percent, respectively). In fi fth grade there were no statistically signifi cant differences across regions in the percentage of students receiving special education-in all regions the estimate ranged between 11 and 13 percent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "For the cohort of students beginning kindergarten in 1998, specifi c learning disabilities and speech or language impairments were the most prevalent primary disabilities over the grades studied. The percentage of the student cohort receiving special education grew from 4.1 percent in kindergarten to 11.9 percent of students in fi fth grade. Higher percentages of boys than girls and of poor students than nonpoor students received special education. Also, greater percentages of students in higher poverty rather than lower poverty schools received special education in kindergarten and third grade. Higher percentages of students in the South and Northeast than in the West received special education in three of the four grades. And, higher percentages of students in small town/rural schools than in central city schools received special education in each of the four grades. Finally, in each grade studied, public schools reported higher percentages of students receiving special education than did private schools. This Issue Brief does not follow individual students over time through the elementary grades to determine if the same students received special education across years and if the primary disability for which students received special education services changed across years. However, the ECLS-K would support such a longitudinal analysis. The ECLS-K follows children through the cohort's eighth grade year.  : 1998-99, 1999-2000, 2001-02 ! Interpret data with caution.
