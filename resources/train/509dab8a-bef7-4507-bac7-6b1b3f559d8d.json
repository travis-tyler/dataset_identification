Similarly, the percentage of students with a low sense of school belonging who had ever been suspended or expelled (28 percent) was higher than the percentage of students with a middle or high sense of school belonging who had ever been suspended or expelled (16 percent and 15 percent, respectively; Spotlight 1). x Between 1997 and 2013, the 1-day count of juvenile offenders in residential placement facilities that house such offenders fell by nearly 50 percent, from approximately 105,000 to 54,000 (Spotlight 2). x The rate of residential placement for Black male juvenile offenders in 2013 was 1.6 times the rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males, 2.7 times the rate for Hispanic males, 5 times the rate for White males, and over 16 times the rate for Asian males (Spotlight 2). x In 2013, 32 percent of juvenile offenders were housed in state-run residential placement facilities, with an additional 32 percent in private facilities and 36 percent in local facilities (Spotlight 2).\nThe High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:2009) followed a nationally representative cohort of ninth-grade students throughout high school. During the first wave of data, which was collected from ninth-graders and their parents in the fall of 2009, parents were asked to report whether their child had ever been suspended or expelled from school since starting kindergarten. During the first follow-up (conducted in the spring of 2012, when most of the students were in the 11th grade), parents and their children were surveyed again, and parents were asked to report on whether their child had been suspended or expelled since the last data collection. In addition to examining differences for all students who had ever been suspended or expelled, this spotlight examines differences in relation to the timing of students' suspensions or expulsions. For this spotlight, students who were ever suspended or expelled are categorized into three different groups depending on the time period in which their suspension or expulsion occurred. One group consists of those who were suspended or expelled only before fall 2009 (in the spotlight, this group is described as being made up of those who were suspended or expelled only in the \"early time period\"). A second group consists of those who were suspended or expelled only between fall 2009 and spring 2012 (in the spotlight, this group is described as being made up of those who were suspended or expelled only in the \"late time period\"). A third group consists of those who were suspended or expelled in both time periods. 1 \"Ever suspended or expelled\" are those fall 2009 ninth-graders who were suspended or expelled at any time. \"Suspended or expelled in the early time period\" are those students who were only suspended before fall 2009. \"Suspended or expelled in the late time period\" are those who were only suspended between fall 2009 and spring 2012. \"Suspended or expelled in both time periods\" are those who were suspended or expelled both before fall 2009 and between fall 2009 and spring 2012.

There were no measurable differences between the percentages of students who had ever been suspended or expelled in terms of the time period during which they were suspended or expelled (7 percent were suspended or expelled only in the early time period, 7 percent were suspended or expelled only in the late time period, and 6 percent were suspended or expelled in both time periods). A higher percentage of males (26 percent) than of females (13 percent) were ever suspended or expelled. There were no measurable differences between the percentages of male students who were suspended or expelled only in the early time period, only in the late time period, or in both time periods. For female students who had ever been suspended or expelled, however, higher percentages were suspended or expelled only in the early time period (5 percent) and only in the late time period (5 percent) than in both time periods (3 percent). A higher percentage of Black students (36 percent) than of Hispanic (21 percent), White (14 percent), and Asian students (6 percent) had ever been suspended or expelled (figure S1.2 and table S1.1). Additionally, a higher percentage of students of Two or more races (26 percent) and Hispanic students had ever been suspended or expelled than White students. A lower percentage of Asian students than of students of any other race/ethnicity with available data had ever been suspended or expelled. The percentages of students in the White, Black, and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups who had ever been suspended or expelled varied in terms of the time period in which the suspensions or expulsions occurred: For White students, a higher percentage were suspended or expelled only in the late time period (7 percent) than only in the early time period (4 percent) or in both periods (3 percent); for Black students, higher percentages were suspended or expelled only in the early time period (15 percent) or in both periods (14 percent) than only in the late time period (7 percent); and for Hispanic students, a higher percentage were suspended or expelled only in the early time period (10 percent) than in both periods (4 percent). \nData on the characteristics of students' families, such as their parents' highest level of education and their families' socioeconomic status, were also collected as part of the HSLS:2009 study, and the percentage of students who had ever been suspended or expelled varied according to these characteristics. For example, of students whose parents' highest level of education was high school completion or less, 27 percent had ever been suspended or expelled (figure S1.3 and table S1.1). Of students whose parents' highest level of education exceeded high school completion, the percentages who had ever been suspended or expelled were lower (21 percent for students whose parents had some college, 13 percent for students whose parents had a bachelor's degree, and 10 percent for students whose parents had a master's or higher degree). A greater percentage of students of low socioeconomic status (SES) than of students of middle SES had ever been suspended or expelled (29 vs. 17 percent), and both of these percentages were greater than the percentage of high-SES students who had ever been suspended or expelled (9 percent). 2 2 Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite score on parental education and occupations, and family income at the time of data collection. Students living in households in the highest 20 percent of the SES scale were identified as being from high-SES households, those living in households in the middle 40 percent of the SES scale were identified as being from middle-SES households, and those living in households in the lowest 40 percent of the SES scale were identified as being from low-SES households. 28.0 1 A school engagement scale was constructed based on students' responses to questions about how frequently they went to class without homework done, without pencil or paper, without books, or late. Students' school engagement is considered low if they were in the bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter. 2 A school belonging scale was constructed based on the extent to which students agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school, that they felt proud of being part of the school, that there were always teachers or other adults at school they could talk to if they had a problem, that school was often a waste of time, and that getting good grades was important to them. Students' sense of school belonging is considered low if they were in the bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter.

Research shows that students' attitudes toward school are associated with their academic outcomes (Morrison et al. 2002), and that schools with a supportive climate have lower rates of delinquency, including suspensions and expulsions (Christle, Jolivette, and Nelson 2005). As part of the HSLS:2009 data collection, students reported on their school engagement and sense of school belonging in the fall of their ninth-grade year. School engagement measured how frequently students went to class without homework done, without pencil or paper, without books, or late. 3 The percentage of students with low school engagement who had ever been suspended or expelled (28 percent) was higher than the percentage of students with middle or high levels of school engagement who had ever been suspended or expelled (21 percent and 9 percent, respectively; figure S1.4 and table S1.1). Sense of school belonging was measured based on the extent to which students agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school, that they felt proud of being part of the school, that there were always teachers or other adults at school they could talk to if they had a problem, that school was often a waste of time, and that getting good grades was important to them. 4 The percentage of students with a low sense of school belonging who had ever been suspended or expelled (28 percent) was higher than the percentage of students with a middle or high sense of school belonging who had ever been suspended or expelled (16 percent and 15 percent, respectively). \nIn 2013 (after most fall 2009 ninth-graders had completed high school), students' high school transcripts were obtained. In addition, students and their parents were asked about students' high school completion status. The percentages of students who had ever been suspended or expelled were higher for those students with lower grade point averages (GPAs). About 46 percent of students with a GPA below 1.99 had ever been suspended or expelled, compared with 28 percent of students with a GPA of 2.00-2.49, 18 percent of students with a GPA of 2.50-2.99, 8 percent of students with a GPA of 3.00-3.49, and 3 percent of students with a GPA of 3.50 or above (figure S1.5 and table S1.1). Also, a higher percentage of students who had not completed high school by 2013 than of students who had completed high school by 2013 had ever been suspended or expelled (54 vs. 17 percent).\nSpotlights 16 for White youth. In contrast, the disparity between American Indian/Alaska Native youth and White youth was larger in 2013 than in 1997. The American Indian/Alaska Native rate was 2.4 times the White rate in 1997 and 3.3 times the White rate in 2013. In 1997, residential placement rates were similar for White and Asian/Pacific Islander youth. However, residential placement rates declined more sharply for Asian/Pacific Islander youth than for White youth. As a result, in 2013 the residential placement rate for Asian/Pacific Islander youth was approximately one-quarter of the rate for White youth. The residential placement rate per 100,000 youth was also considerably higher for Black males than for males or females of any other racial/ethnic group. The rate of residential placement for Black males in 2013 was 804 per 100,000, which was 1.6 times the rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males (496 per 100,000), 2.7 times the rate for Hispanic males (296 per 100,000), 5 times the rate for White males (162 per 100,000), and over 16 times the rate for Asian/Pacific Islander males (49 per 100,000) (figure S2.3). Black males made up over one-third (35 percent) of all youth in residential placement in 2013. Older youth made up a greater share of juveniles in residential placement than younger youth in 2013: A majority (69 percent) were between the ages of 16 and 20, about 30 percent were between the ages of 13 and 15, and 1 percent were age 12 or younger (table S2.1). In 2013, the number of juveniles in residential facilities was highest for those being held for offenses against persons 6 (19,922, or 37 percent of all juveniles held) and second highest for those being held for offenses against property 7 (12,768, or 24 percent). The number in residential facilities was 9,316 (17 percent) for those being held for technical violations, such as violations of probation, parole, or valid court order; 6,085 (11 percent) for those being held for offenses against the public order; 8 and 3,533 (7 percent) for 1 Private facilities are operated by private nonprofit or for-profit corporations or organizations. NOTE: Data are from a biennial survey of all secure and nonsecure residential placement facilities that house juvenile offenders. Data do not include adult prisons, jails, federal facilities, or facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected youth. The data provide 1-day population counts of juveniles in residential placement facilities.

A total of 2,524 juvenile offenders (5 percent) were being held for status offenses, which are actions that are illegal for underage persons but not for adults. 9 Between 1997 and 2013, the largest percentage declines in the number of juveniles in residential placement were observed for those being held for drug offenses (61 percent), status offenses (60 percent), and offenses against property (60 percent). Percentage declines over the period were smaller for juveniles being held for offenses against the public order (41 percent) and offenses against persons (43 percent). Juvenile residential placements for technical violations were 25 percent lower in 2013 than in 1997. Residential placement facilities vary by size, operational control, and classification. The percentage of juveniles in residential placement who were in the largest size facilities (201 or more residents) declined from 35 to 13 percent between 1997 and 2013. In 2013, most juveniles in residential placement were either in a facility of 21 to 50 residents (27 percent) or a facility of 51 to 150 residents (36 percent). In 1997, about 44 percent of juveniles were held in facilities operated by state government agencies, with the remainder split evenly between facilities operated 9 Examples include curfew violation, running away, truancy, and underage drinking. by local government agencies and facilities operated by private entities (28 percent each; figure S2.4 and table S2.1). In 2013, the share of juveniles in state facilities had declined to 32 percent, with an additional 32 percent in private facilities and 36 percent in local facilities. Juveniles may be placed in a wide range of facility types, including detention centers, shelters, reception/ diagnostic centers, group homes, boot camps, ranch/ wilderness camps, residential treatment centers, and long-term secure facilities. Over time, detention centers and long-term secure facilities have held the largest numbers of youth. 10 In 2013, detention centers held 36 percent of the youth in residential placement and long-term secure facilities held 27 percent. Data on residential treatment centers first became available in the 2003 CJRP. Since then, this facility type has contained the third-largest number of youth, accounting for 23 percent of juveniles in residential placement in 2013. About 8 percent of youth were held in group homes in 2013, and 2 percent or less of youth were held in each of the following facility types: ranch/wilderness camp, shelter, reception/diagnostic center, and boot camp. 10 Although respondents were able to select more than one type for their facility, the data used for this indicator assign each facility to a single primary type based on an analysis that applies a hierarchy rule.\nThis page intentionally left blank.

In 2013, a lower percentage of 12th-graders (4 percent) than of 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders (7 percent each), and 11th-graders (8 percent) reported being called a hate-related word at school. A lower percentage of 7th-graders (22 percent) reported seeing hate-rated graffiti at school than 9th-and 10th-graders (27 and 26 percent, respectively). In each data collection year between 1999 and 2013, a higher percentage of public school students than of private school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. For instance, in 2013, approximately 26 percent of public school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school, compared with 13 percent of private school students. However, the percentages of public and private school students who reported being called a hate-related word were not measurably different in 2013 (7 percent each). Students who reported being the target of haterelated words at school in 2013 were asked to indicate whether the derogatory word they were called referred to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). A lower percentage of male students than of female students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their gender (less than one-half of 1 percent vs. 2 percent). With respect to being called a hate-related word referring to their race, a lower percentage of White students than of their peers reported being targeted in 2013 (table 10.2). Specifically, 2 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their race, compared with 4 percent of Hispanic students, 6 percent of Black students, and 8 percent each of Asian students and students of other races/ethnicities. 3.3 3.5 3.1 1.9 1.9 1.2 1.4 0.8 0.7 0.9 1.0 1.0 0.3 1.7 1.1 0.9 1.3 1.9\nSchool Environment 62\n\nBetween 1993-94 and 2011-12, the percentage of teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated between 64 and 73 percent, and the percentage who agreed that rules were enforced by the principal fluctuated between 82 and 89 percent, showing no consistent trends. However, a lower percentage of teachers reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers in 2011-12 (69 percent) than in the previous survey year (72 percent in 2007-08). Similarly, the percentage of teachers who reported that school rules were enforced by the principal was lower in 2011-12 than in 2007-08 (84 vs. 89 percent). In 2011-12, the percentages of public school teachers who reported that student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching varied by state. For example, among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching ranged from 31 percent in Wyoming to 55 percent in Louisiana (table 12.3). The percentages of teachers who reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers and by the principal also varied by state. \nFights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances There were no measurable differences by grade in the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere or on school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days in 2013: About 18 percent of students at each of grade levels 9 through 12 reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days, and 5 percent each of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders and 6 percent of 11th-graders reported carrying a weapon on school property. However, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (11 percent) than of 9th-and 10th-graders (8 percent each) reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days during the previous 30 days (table 14.2). In 2013, state-level data on percentages of public school students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere were available for 34 states (table 14.3). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in New Jersey and Hawaii to 29 percent in Wyoming. There were also 34 states that had 2013 data available on the percentages of students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from 3 percent in New Jersey, Delaware, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Nevada to 10 percent in Wyoming, Montana, and Vermont. Reported incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school are also important to examine. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school. State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2013-14 school year, there were 1,501 reported firearm possession incidents at schools (table 14.5). The total number of incidents varies widely across states, due in large part to states' differing populations. Therefore, the rate of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across states. During the 2013-14 school year, the rate of firearm possession incidents was 3 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of states had rates between 1 and 10 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students from 2009-10 to 2013-14. Two states, Hawaii and Maine, reported no firearm incidents during the 2013-14 school year and therefore had a rate of 0 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students. Four other states had rates of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students below 1. The four states were Illinois, New Jersey, Iowa, and Maryland. Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, and Iowa also had rates below 1 during the 2012-13 school year. During the 2013-14 school year, three states had rates above 10: Louisiana, Arkansas, and Vermont. However, of these three states, only Arkansas also had a rate above 10 during the 2012-13 school year. Information about students' access to firearms can put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and on school property into context. In the SCS survey, students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year. In 2013, about 4 percent of students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year (figure 14.3 and table 14.4). The percentage of 12-to 18-yearold students reporting that they had access to a loaded gun without adult permission decreased from 7 percent in 2007 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 4 percent in 2013. There was no measurable difference between the percentages who reported having such access to a loaded gun between 2011 and 2013.  In every survey year from 2007 to 2011, a higher percentage of male students than of female students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission. However, there was no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun in 2013. The percentage of male students who reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission was lower in 2013 than in 2011 (4 vs. 6 percent). The percentages of female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun were not measurably different between these two years. In 2013, higher percentages of 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission than did 7th-and 8th-graders. About 5 percent of 10th-graders and 6 percent each of 11th-and 12th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult supervision, compared with 2 percent each of 7thand 8th-graders. The percentage of 11th-graders reporting that they had access to a gun without adult supervision was also higher than the percentage of 9th-graders reporting such access (3 percent).\nFights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances 82\nFear and Avoidance 94\n\nDiscipline, Safety, and Security Measures 100 During the 2013 -14 school year, there were 1.3 million reported discipline incidents in the United States for reasons related to alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession (table 19.4). 66 About 78 percent of these discipline incidents were violent incidents with or without physical injury (figure 19.2). Fifteen percent of these discipline incidents were illicit drug related, 5 percent were weapons possessions, and 2 percent were alcohol related. The number of discipline incidents can also be expressed as a ratio of discipline incidents per 100,000 students. During the 2013-14 school year, there were 2,615 reported discipline incidents related to alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession per 100,000 students in the United States. The total number of discipline incidents for reasons related to alcohol, drugs, violence, and weapons possession varies widely across states, due in large part to states' differing populations. Therefore, the ratio of such discipline incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across states. The majority of states had ratios between 500 and 5,000 alcohol-, drug-, violence-, or weapons possession-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2013-14 school year. Three states had ratios per 100,000 students that were below 500: Texas, Idaho, and Delaware. Rhode Island, the District of Columbia, Colorado, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Alabama had ratios per 100,000 students that were above 5,000.\nIn 2013-14, use of various safety and security procedures also differed by school size. A higher percentage of public schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled than those with fewer students enrolled reported the use of security cameras, a requirement that students wear badges or picture IDs, use of random dog sniffs, and use of random metal detector checks (table 20.2). A lower percentage of schools with less than 300 students enrolled reported that they required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs (46 percent) than schools with greater numbers of students enrolled. A higher percentage of public schools located in cities than those in suburban areas, towns, and rural areas reported that they enforced a strict dress code, required students to wear uniforms, and used random metal detector checks in 2013-14 (table 20.2). A higher percentage of schools in suburban areas required faculty or staff to wear badges or picture IDs (79 percent) than those in towns (67 percent), cities (67 percent), and rural areas (60 percent). Random dog sniffs were reported by a higher percentage of public schools in rural areas (35 percent) and towns (32 percent) than suburban areas (19 percent) and cities (11 percent). Many safety and security measures tended to be more prevalent in schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (table 20.2). A higher percentage of these schools reported they enforced a strict dress code, required school uniforms, and required students to wear badges or picture IDs than schools with lower percentages of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch. Conversely, a lower percentage of schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported the use of random dog sniffs (14 percent) than schools where lower percentages of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. A higher percentage of schools where 25 percent or less of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs (82 percent) than schools where higher percentages of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The percentages of public schools reporting the use of various safety and security measures in 2013-14 tended to be higher than in prior years (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public schools reporting the use of security cameras increased from 19 percent in 1999-2000 to 75 percent in 2013-14. Similarly, the percentage of public schools reporting that they controlled access to school buildings increased from 75 percent to 93 percent during this time. From 1999-2000 to 2013-14, the following safety and security measures also increased: requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs, enforcing a strict dress code, use of random dog sniffs, requiring school uniforms, and requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs. Conversely, the percentage of schools that reported using random metal detector checks decreased from 7 percent in 1999-2000 to 4 percent in 2013-14. Indicator 20 continued on page 106.  In the 2013-14 school year, 43 percent of public schools reported the presence of one or more security guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers, or sworn law enforcement officers at their school at least once a week during the school year (table  20.3). 67 The percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff did not differ measurably between 2013-14 and prior years in which data on this item were collected. However, the percentage of public schools reporting the presence of full-time security staff was lower in 2013-14 (24 percent) than in prior years, while the percentage of public schools reporting part-time-only security staff in 2013-14 (19 percent) was higher than it was in prior years. About 29 percent of public primary schools reported the presence of one or more security staff at their school at least once a week in 2013-14. The percentage of primary schools reporting security staff was lower than the percentages of middle schools and high/ combined schools reporting the presence of security staff (63 and 64 percent, respectively). Differences in the presence of security staff were also found by other school characteristics. Public schools with greater numbers of students were more likely to report the presence of security staff. For example, 22 percent of schools with less than 300 students enrolled reported the presence of security staff at least once a week, compared with 87 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled. The percentage of public schools in rural areas that reported the presence of one or more security staff at least once a week during the 2013-14 school year (36 percent) was lower than the percentages of schools in cities (45 percent), suburban areas (48 percent), and towns (48 percent). Another aspect of school safety and security is ensuring plans are in place to be enacted in the event of a crisis situation. In 2013-14, about 94 percent of public schools reported they had a written plan for procedures to be performed in the event of a natural disaster (figure 20.3 and table 20.4). 68 Eighty-three percent of these schools reported that they had drilled students on the use of the plan. About 88 percent of public schools reported they had a plan for procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting, and 70 percent of these schools had drilled students on the use of the plan. Public schools also reported having plans in place for bomb threats or incidents (88 percent); chemical, biological, or radiological threats or incidents 69 (60 percent); and hostages (50 percent).  Drilled students on the use of a plan In 2013, about 77 percent of students ages 12-18 reported observing one or more security cameras to monitor the school during the day at their schools, and 76 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether their schools used certain security measures. 70 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or assigned police officers, adults supervising hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a written code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2013, nearly all students ages 12-18 reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). In 2013, most students ages 12-18 reported that their schools had a written code of student conduct and a requirement that visitors sign in (96 percent each). Approximately 90 percent of students reported the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway, 77 percent reported the use of one or more security cameras at their schools, and 76 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day. About 70 percent of students reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers, 52 percent reported locker checks, and 26 percent reported that students were required to wear badges or picture identification at their schools. Eleven percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools, representing the least observed of the selected safety and security measures. The percentage of students who reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased between the two most recent survey years, as well as over the past 14 years. Specifically, 76 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day in 2013, representing an increase from 65 percent in 2011, as well as an overall increase from 38 percent in 1999. The percentage of students who reported the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway also was higher in 2013 (90 percent) than in 2011 (89 percent) and in 1999 (85 percent). The percentage of students who reported the presence of metal detectors at school increased from 1999 to 2013 (from 9 to 11 percent), as did the percentage of students who reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers (from 54 to 70 percent) and the percentage of students who reported a requirement that visitors sign in (from 87 to 96 percent). Beginning in 2001, students were asked whether they observed the use of security cameras at school and whether they were required to wear badges or picture identification. From 2001 to 2013, the percentage of students who reported the use of one or more security cameras at school increased from 39 to 77 percent, and the percentage of students who reported that they were required to wear badges or picture identification increased from 21 to 26 percent. No measurable differences were found between the two most recent survey years (2011 and 2013) in the percentages of students reporting these safety and security measures.  \nIn addition to reporting on-campus arrests, institutions report referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts only include incidents for which there was a referral for institutional disciplinary action, but no arrest. In 2013, there were 246,400 referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving weapons, drugs, and liquor law violations, with most of the referrals (90 percent) involving violations in residence halls (table 22.1). The largest number of disciplinary referrals (190,900) involved liquor law violations.   2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009    1 Willfully or maliciously destroying, damaging, defacing, or otherwise injuring real or personal property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it. 2 Placing another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack. 3 A physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness. 4 The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession of another. 5 Any sexual act directed against another person forcibly and/or against that person's will. 6 Attack upon a person for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. 7 Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. 8 Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence. NOTE: Data are for degree-granting institutions, which are institutions that grant associate's or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. Some institutions that report Clery data-specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia-are excluded. A hate crime is a criminal offense that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the perpetrator's bias against a group of people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Includes on-campus incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus crimes and arrests even if they involve college students or staff. Larceny was the fourth most commonly reported hate crime in 2013. Five of the 15 larceny hate crimes reported in 2013 were associated with race, followed by sexual orientation and religion (3 incidents each) and ethnicity and gender (2 incidents each). No larceny hate crimes were associated with disability. While the number of hate crimes reported in 2013 was highest at 4-year private nonprofit and 4-year public postsecondary institutions (349 and 295 total incidents, respectively), these institutions also enroll the largest numbers of students. Public 2-year institutions, which also enroll a large number of students, had the third highest number of reported hate crimes (106 incidents). The frequency of crimes and the most commonly reported categories of bias were similar across these types of postsecondary institutions.  The total includes all students whose parents provided a response about their child's suspension and expulsion status both on the base-year (2009) questionnaire and on the first follow-up (2012) questionnaire. 2 Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite score on parental education and occupations, and family income. 3 A school engagement scale was constructed based on students' responses to questions about how frequently they went to class without homework done, without pencil or paper, without books, or late. Students' school engagement is considered low if they were in the bottom quarter of the scale distribution, middle if they were in the middle two quarters, and high if they were in the highest quarter."}, {"section_title": "vii", "text": "x The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1993-94 and 2011-12; however, the percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased over this time period (from 25 to 35 percent).

Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Nansel et al. 2001;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004;Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002;Smith and Smith 2006). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Organization of This Report", "text": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015 is the 18th in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. Although the data presented in this report are the most recent data available at the time of publication, the data do not cover the most recent two or more school years. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent crimes. The sections cover violent deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization; school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and security measures; and campus safety and security. This year's report also includes a spotlight section on topics related to student suspension and expulsion and juvenile offenders in residential placement facilities that house such offenders. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A reference section and a glossary of terms appear at the end of the report. This edition of the report contains updated data for eleven indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1); incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2); violent and other criminal incidents at public schools, and those reported to the police (Indicator 6 ); discipline problems reported by public schools (Indicator 7); illegal drug availability and drug-related discipline incidents (Indicator 9); students carrying weapons on school property and anywhere and students' access to firearms (Indicator 14); students' use of alcohol and alcohol-related discipline incidents (Indicator 15); serious disciplinary actions taken by public schools (Indicator 19); safety and security measures taken by public schools (Indicator 20); criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 22); and hate crime incidents at postsecondary institutions 1 Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of hours that youths spend on school property versus the number of hours they spend elsewhere. (Indicator 23). In addition, it includes two spotlight indicators: suspension and expulsion by student, family, and academic characteristics (Spotlight 1) and juveniles in residential placement: youth and facility characteristics (Spotlight 2). Also included in this year's report are references to publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the \"For more information\" sidebars at the bottom of each indicator."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, principals, and postsecondary institutions and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of Postsecondary Education, the Office for Civil Rights, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2013-14 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2013, but they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent victimization at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys."}, {"section_title": "Introduction 4", "text": "Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard error was between 30 and 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation [CV] for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on 10 or fewer cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed (Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation [CV] is 50 percent or greater). See appendix A for more information. The appearance of a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with a high ratio of standard error to estimate so the reader should use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the comparison being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used to examine changes in percentages over a range of values such as time or age. Linear trends tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Percentages reported in the tables and figures are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the text are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates. Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.  Figure S2. 4 .............................................................17 Students may be suspended (temporarily removed from regular school activities in or out of school) or expelled (permanently removed from school with no services) for a variety of disciplinary reasons. Suspensions and expulsions from school are often associated with negative academic outcomes, such as lower levels of achievement and higher school dropout rates (Christle, Nelson, and Jolivette 2004;Skiba et al. 2002). The timing of school suspensions or expulsions is also associated with student outcomes. For example, students' suspension in elementary or middle school is associated with a greater likelihood of being suspended later in school, poor academic performance, and a lower likelihood of graduating from high school on time (Raffaele Mendez 2003). This spotlight examines the characteristics of students who have ever been suspended or expelled, as well as academic outcomes for these students. It also examines differences in students' characteristics based on the timing of their suspension or expulsion."}, {"section_title": "Spotlight 2 Juveniles in Residential Placement: Youth and Facility Characteristics", "text": "The rate of residential placement for Black males in 2013 was 804 per 100,000, which was 1.6 times the rate for American Indian/Alaska Native males (496 per 100,000), 2.7 times the rate for Hispanic males (296 per 100,000), 5 times the rate for White males (162 per 100,000), and over 16 times the rate for Asian/Pacific Islander males (49 per 100,000). Juvenile offenders held in residential placement facilities often lack the necessary services and supports that can help them to develop skills, encourage learning, and lead to successful academic performance (U.S. Departments of Education and Justice 2014). The experiences of these youth during placement and following their reentry into the community are frequently characterized by high rates of reoffending, lower educational attainment, and negative employment outcomes (Aizer and Doyle 2015;Apel and Sweeten 2009;Hjalmarsson 2008; The Pew Charitable Trusts 2015; Solomon 2012). These juveniles often experience disruptions to their education as they pass in and out of traditional schooling. While most facilities provide middleschool-and high-school-level educational services (Hockenberry, Sickmund, and Sladky 2013), these services are generally not comparable to those available to their peers in the community (The Council of State Governments Justice Center 2015). Students who exit residential facilities also face challenges related to reenrollment, transfer of academic records, and acceptance of credits when they attempt to reenter the traditional education system (Feierman, Levick, and Mody 2009/10). The Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) is a biennial survey of all secure and nonsecure residential placement facilities that house juvenile offenders, defined as persons younger than 21 who are held in a residential setting as a result of some contact with the justice system (i.e., being charged with or adjudicated for an offense). The CJRP provides a 1-day count of the number of youth in residential placement, as well as data on the characteristics of youth in these facilities and information about the facilities themselves. The census does not include adult prisons, jails, federal facilities, or facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected youth. Between 1997 and 2013, the number of youth in residential placement facilities fell by nearly 50 percent, from approximately 105,000 to just over 54,000 (figure S2.1 and table S2.1). The number of youth in these facilities declined for both males and females, and the ratio of males to females did not change measurably between 1997 and 2013. In each of the nine years in which the CJRP was conducted, there were approximately 6 times as many males as females in residential facilities. The decline in residential placements between 1997 and 2013 was also observed for White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native youth. The number of residential placements declined by about one-third for Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native youth; by about one-half for White, Black, and Pacific Islander youth; and by more than three-fourths for Asian youth. It is also important to examine the residential placement rate, which is the number of juvenile offenders in residential facilities per 100,000 youth in the general population. This rate provides a more comparable measurement across time because it accounts for population growth and demographic changes. The overall residential placement rate fell from 356 per 100,000 youth in 1997 to 173 per 100,000 in 2013 (figure S2.2 and table S2.2). The residential placement rate for White youth fell from 201 to 100 per 100,000 during the same period, while the rate for Black youth fell from 968 to 464 per 100,000. Between 1997 and 2013, rates for American Indian/Alaska Native youth fell from 490 to 334 per 100,000, rates for Hispanic youth fell from 468 to 173 per 100,000, and rates for Asian/Pacific Islander youth fell from 195 to 28 per 100,000. 5 Although residential placement rates per 100,000 youth declined for all racial/ethnic groups, disparities between racial/ethnic groups persist. In 1997, the residential placement rate for Black youth was 4.8 times the rate for White youth, and in 2013 it was 4.6 times the rate for White youth. In 1997, the rate for Hispanic youth was 2.3 times the rate for White youth, and in 2013 it was 1.7 times the rate Spotlight 2 continued on page 16.

Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school population and surrounding community. This indicator presents data on school-associated violent deaths that were collected through the School-Associated Violent Deaths (SAVD) Surveillance System, as well as data on total suicides collected through the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal (WISQARS\u2122 Fatal) and data on total homicides collected through the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). The SAVD Surveillance System defines a school-associated violent death as \"a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention death 11 (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.\" School-associated violent deaths include those that occurred while the victim was on the way to or returning from regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of schoolassociated violent deaths include not only students and staff members, but also others who are not students or staff members, such as students' parents or community members. The most recent data released by the SAVD Surveillance System cover the period from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. During this period, there were a total of 53 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of these 53 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths, there were 41 homicides, 11 suicides, and 1 legal intervention death. 12 11 A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions. 12 Data from 1999-2000 onward are subject to change until interviews with school and law enforcement officials have been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. For more information on this survey, please see appendix A. Data on violent deaths occurring away from school were included in order to calculate the percentage of violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent data available for total suicides of school-age youth (ages 5-18; also referred to as \"youth\" in this indicator) are for the 2012 calendar year; the most recent data available for total homicides of youth are for the 2012-13 school year. 13 During the 2012-13 school year, there were 1,186 homicides of youth in the United States (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2012 calendar year, there were 1,590 suicides of youth. During the 2012-13 school year, there were 31 homicides and 6 suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). When instances of homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school were combined, there was approximately 1 homicide or suicide at school for every 1.5 million students enrolled. 14 The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 3 percent of the total number of youth homicides between 1992-93 (when data collection began) and 2012-13, even though the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied across the years 15 (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between 1992-93 and 2012-13, a range of 1 to 10 school-age youth died by suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years. 13 Data on total suicides are from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal (WISQARS\u2122 Fatal) and data on total homicides are from the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these differences in reference periods, please use caution when comparing total suicides to other categories. 14 The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2012-13 school year was 54,952,269 (Snyder and Dillow 2016). 15 Single incidents occurring at school with a large number of school-age victims could result in large variations in the number of homicides of school-age youth at school between two years. Please use caution when making comparisons over time. This indicator has been updated to include 2012-13 data for school-associated violent deaths and total youth homicides, and 2012 data for total youth suicides.

Thefts at school declined from a rate of 114 per 1,000 students to 14 per 1,000, and thefts away from school declined from a rate of 79 thefts per 1,000 students to 11 per 1,000. The rate of violent victimization at school declined overall from 68 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 19 per 1,000 in 2014. The rate of violent victimization away from school declined from 94 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 13 per 1,000 in 2014. Serious violent victimizations at school declined from 8 per 1,000 students in 1992 to 4 per 1,000 in 2014. The rate of serious violent victimization away from school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 6 per 1,000 in 2014. In 2014, the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent victimization for males did not differ measurably from the rates for females; this pattern held regardless of whether the location of victimization was at school or away from school. In 2014, the rate of total victimization at school for males was 35 victimizations per 1,000 students and the rate for females was 31 victimizations per 1,000 students (table 2.2 and figure 2.2). The total victimization rate away from school for males was 25 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the rate for females was 23 victimizations per 1,000 students. The rate of violent victimization at school for males was 20 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the rate for females was 18 victimizations per 1,000 students. The violent victimization rate away from school for males was 14 victimizations per 1,000 students, and the rate for females was 12 victimizations per 1,000 students. In 2014, the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent victimization for students ages 12-14 did not differ measurably from the rates for students ages 15-18; this pattern held regardless of whether the location of victimization was at school or away from school. Total victimization rates at school were 34 per 1,000 students ages 12-14 and 32 per 1,000 students ages 15-18 (table 2.2). Total victimization rates away from school were 22 per 1,000 students ages 12-14 and 26 per 1,000 students ages 15-18. Differences in the rates of total victimization of students ages 12-18 at school by urbanicity were observed in 2014 (table 2.2, figure 2.3). In 2014, students residing in rural areas had higher rates of total victimization at school (53 victimizations per 1,000 students) than students residing in suburban areas (28 victimizations per 1,000 students). These differences were primarily driven by higher rates of violent victimization at school among students living in rural areas. In the same year, the rate of total victimization at school for students residing in urban areas was 32 victimizations per 1,000 students; the rates between rural and urban areas were not measurably different. Violent victimization rates at school were 40 per 1,000 students in rural areas, compared with 16 per 1,000 students in urban areas and 14 per 1,000 students in suburban areas. There were no measurable differences in rates of theft at school by urbanicity. In 2014, there were no differences by urbanicity in total victimization rates, theft rates, or violent victimization rates for victimizations that occurred away from school.

The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property has decreased over the last decade, from 9 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2013. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether they had been threatened or injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property 27 during the 12 months preceding the survey. In 2013, about 7 percent of students reported they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (table 4.1).

Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit these offenses. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) asks school teachers whether they were threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months. During the 2011-12 school year, 9 percent of school teachers reported being threatened with injury by a student from their school (table 5.1). This percentage was lower than the 12 percent of teachers who reported being threatened with injury in 1993-94, but higher than the percentages of teachers who reported being threatened with injury in 2003-04 and 2007-08 (7 percent each; figure 5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school in 2011-12 (5 percent) was higher than in any previous survey year (ranging from 3 to 4 percent). During the 2011-12 school year, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of male and female teachers who reported being threatened with injury during the school year (9 percent each); however, there were gender differences in the reports of being physically attacked (figure 5.2). Six percent of female school teachers reported being physically attacked by a student from their school, compared with 4 percent of male teachers. There were some differences in the percentages of teachers who reported being threatened by a student and being physically attacked by the race/ethnicity of the teacher. In the 2011-12 school year, a higher percentage of Black teachers (14 percent) than White teachers and teachers of other racial/ethnic groups (9 percent each) reported being threatened by a student from their school during the school year. A higher percentage of Black teachers (8 percent) than Hispanic teachers (4 percent) reported being physically attacked by a student. The percentages of teachers who reported being threatened with injury or being physically attacked during the school year by a student from their school varied by school characteristics during the 2011-12 school year (figure 5.3). The percentage of elementary teachers who reported being physically attacked by a student was higher than the percentage of secondary teachers reporting it (8 vs. 3 percent).

The School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on bullying 42 and cyber-bullying 43 by asking students ages 12-18 if they had been bullied at school 44 and cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year. Students were also asked about the types and frequencies of bullying and cyber-bullying they had been subjected to, as well as whether an adult at school 45 had been notified of the incidents. Cyber-bullying is distinct from bullying at school; however, bullying at school might be a pertinent context to understand cyber-bullying anywhere. In the SCS, survey items on cyber-bullying anywhere were asked separately from survey items on bullying at school. In a different survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had been bullied on school property 46 or electronically bullied during the previous 12 months. In addition to collecting data at the national level, the YRBS also collects data at the state level. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. On the SCS in 2013, about 22 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Of students 42 \"Bullying\" includes students who responded that another student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm; tried to make them do something they did not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose; destroyed their property on purpose; or pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them. 43 \"Cyber-bullying\" includes students who responded that another student had posted hurtful information about them on the Internet; purposely shared private information about them on the Internet; threatened or insulted them through instant messaging; threatened or insulted them through text messaging; threatened or insulted them through e-mail; threatened or insulted them while gaming; or excluded them online. 44 \"At school\" includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. 45 \"Adult at school\" refers to a teacher or other adult at school. 46 In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), bullying was defined for respondents as \"when one or more students tease, threaten, spread rumors about, hit, shove, or hurt another student over and over again.\" \"On school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. ages 12-18, about 14 percent reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted; 13 percent reported being the subject of rumors; and 6 percent reported that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. Of those students who reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school, about 21 percent reported injury as a result of the incident. Additionally, about 4 percent of all students reported being excluded from activities on purpose, 4 percent reported being threatened with harm, 2 percent reported that others tried to make them do things they did not want to do, and 2 percent reported that their property was destroyed by others on purpose. In 2013, a higher percentage of females than of males ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (24 vs. 19 percent). Also, higher percentages of females than of males reported that they were made fun of, called names, or insulted (15 vs. 13 percent); were the subject of rumors (17 vs. 10 percent); and were excluded from activities on purpose (5 vs. 4 percent). In contrast, a higher percentage of males (7 percent) than of females (5 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. A higher percentage of White students (24 percent) than of Hispanic students (19 percent) and Asian students (9 percent) reported being bullied at school in 2013. In addition, higher percentages of Black students (20 percent) and Hispanic students than of Asian students reported being bullied at school. A higher percentage of White students (16 percent) than of Hispanic students (12 percent), Black students (10 percent), and Asian students (7 percent) reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted. Similarly, 15 percent of White students reported that they had been the subject of rumors, compared with 11 percent of Hispanic students and 4 percent of Asian students. Indicator 11 continued on page 64.  Higher percentages of students in grades 6 through 11 than of students in grade 12 reported being bullied at school during the school year. In 2013, about 14 percent of 12th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 28 percent of 6thgraders, 26 percent of 7th-graders, 22 percent of 8th-graders, 23 percent of 9th-graders, 19 percent of 10th-graders, and 20 percent of 11th-graders. No measurable differences were observed in the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school by school characteristics such as urbanicity and control of school. The SCS also asked students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school to indicate the location where they had been victimized. In 2013, of students who reported being bullied during the school year, about 46 percent of students reported that the bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell at school, 34 percent reported being bullied inside the classroom, and 23 percent reported being bullied outside on school grounds (figure 11.2 and table 11.2). About 19 percent of students who were bullied reported that the bullying occurred in the cafeteria, 9 percent reported that it occurred in the bathroom or locker room, 8 percent reported that it occurred on the school bus, and 1 percent reported that it occurred somewhere else in school. In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). About 3 percent of students reported that another student had posted hurtful information about them on the Internet, and 3 percent reported being the subject of harassing text messages. Some 2 percent reported being the subject of harassing instant messages and 1 percent each reported having their private information purposely shared on the Internet, being the subject of harassing e-mails, being harassed while gaming, and being excluded online. A higher percentage of female students than of male students ages 12-18 reported being victims of cyberbullying in 2013. Nine percent of females compared with 5 percent of males were victims of cyber-bullying overall. In particular, a higher percentage of females than of males were victims of various types of cyberbullying: Having hurtful information about them posted on the Internet by another student (5 vs. 1 percent), having their private information purposely shared on the Internet (1 percent vs. less than one-half of 1 percent), being the subject of harassing instant messages (3 vs. 1 percent), and being the subject of harassing text messages (5 vs. 2 percent).

Violent incidents can be examined by the specific types of incidents that schools recorded. In 2013-14, about 58 percent of public schools reported one or more incidents of a physical attack or fight without a weapon. This percentage translates to approximately 453,000 incidents at a rate of about 9 crimes per 1,000 students. Some 47 percent of schools reported one or more incidents of threat of physical attack without a weapon (a rate of 6 crimes per 1,000 students). Serious violent incidents are included within the total number of violent incidents, but can also be examined on their own. About 13 percent of public schools recorded one or more serious violent incidents in 2013-14 (a rate of 1 crime per 1,000 students). The types of serious violent incidents recorded included: threat of physical attack with a weapon (9 percent), robbery without a weapon (2 percent), physical attack or fight with a weapon (2 percent), sexual battery other than rape (2 percent), and rape or attempted rape (less than one half of 1 percent).

In order to assess gang activity in and around the vicinity of schools, the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages 12-18 if gangs were present at their school 36 during the school year. The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from 18 percent in 2011 to 12 percent in 2013 (figure 8.1 and table 8.1).

Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. In the YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. 37 From 1993 to 1995, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property increased (from 24 to 32 percent), but then decreased to 22 percent in 2013 (table 9.1).

It is also important to examine discipline incidents that result from illicit drug-related activities at school, which reflect disruptions in the educational process and provide a gauge for the scope of drug use at school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of discipline incidents resulting in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day that involve students' possession or use of illicit drugs on school grounds. 38 State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2013-14 school year, there were 197,000 reported illicit drug-related discipline incidents in the United States (table 9.3). 39 The number of illicit drug-related incidents varies widely across states, due in large part to states' differing populations. Therefore, the rate of illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across states. During the 2013-14 school year, the rate of illicit drug-related discipline incidents was 394 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of states had rates between 100 and 1,000 illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2013-14 school year.

The percentage of female students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school was lower in 2013 (25 percent) than in 2011 (28 percent) and lower than in 1999 (39 percent). In 2013, a lower percentage of White students than students of any other race/ethnicity reported being called a hate-related word during the school year. About 5 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word, compared with 7 percent of Hispanic students, 8 percent of Black students, 10 percent of Asian students, and 11 percent of students of other races/ethnicities. There were no measurable differences by race/ethnicity, however, in the percentages of students who reported seeing haterelated graffiti at school in 2013.

A similar pattern was observed for some of the student and school characteristics examined. As mentioned in the introduction, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) collects both national and state-level data on bullying and electronic bullying for students in grades 9-12. In 2013, both national and state-level data on the percentages of students who reported being bullied on school property during the previous 12 months were available for 40 states (table 11.6). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported being bullied on school property ranged from 16 percent in Florida to 26 percent in Montana. There were also 40 states that had 2013 data available on the percentages of students who reported being electronically bullied during the previous 12 months.

These data differ from those based on a matching of the respondent-reported school name to the In 2011-12, higher percentages of public school teachers than of private school teachers reported that student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from valuable instructional time and student engagement in academic behaviors (Riley et al. 2011). In the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), public and private school teachers were asked whether student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. During the 2011-12 school year, 38 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 35 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether school rules were enforced by other teachers at their school, even for students not in their classes, and whether school rules were enforced by the principal. In 2011-12, about 69 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules (figure 12.1 and table 12.2). The percentages of teachers who reported that student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching varied by school characteristics during the 2011-12 school year (table 12.1). For example, a higher percentage of public school teachers (41 percent) than of private school teachers (22 percent) reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching. Thirtyeight percent of public school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching, compared with 19 percent of private school teachers. In every survey year, a lower percentage of elementary school teachers than of secondary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching; in 2011-12, 31 percent of elementary school teachers and 45 percent of secondary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (table 12.1). There was no measurable difference between the percentages of elementary and secondary school teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching. The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1993-94 and 2011-12; however, the percentage was higher in 2011-12 (38 percent) than in the previous survey year (34 percent in 2007-08; figure 12.2). The percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased between 1993-94 and 2011-12 (from 25 to 35 percent). A higher percentage of teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching in 2011-12 than in 2007-08 (35 vs. 31 percent). In every survey year, a lower percentage of public school teachers than of private school teachers agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers and by the principal in their school (table 12.2). In 2011-12, some 68 percent of public school teachers reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers, compared with 77 percent of private school teachers.

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked about their involvement in physical fights in general (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this indicator), 47 as well as about their involvement in physical fights on school property, during the 12 months preceding the survey. 48 In this indicator, percentages of students reporting involvement in fights occurring anywhere are used as a point of comparison with percentages of students reporting involvement in fights occurring on school property. Overall, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between 1993 and 2013 (from 42 to 25 percent), and the percentage of students in these grades who reported being in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 8 percent; figure 13.1 and table 13.1).

From 1993 through 2013, the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere as well as a physical fight on school property decreased for all four grade levels. The 2013 percentages of 12th-graders who reported being in a physical fight, either anywhere or on school property, were lower than the percentages reported by 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders.

Similarly, 5 percent of 12th-graders, compared with 11 percent of 9th-graders, 8 percent of 10th-graders, and 7 percent of 11th-graders reported being in a physical fight on school property. The percentages of 9th-to 12th-graders who reported being in a physical fight in 2013 differed by race/ ethnicity. For example, a higher percentage of Black students (35 percent) than of students of Two or more races (29 percent), Hispanic students (28 percent), Pacific Islander students (22 percent), White students (21 percent), and Asian students (16 percent) reported being in a physical fight anywhere (figure 13.2 and table 13.1). In addition, higher percentages of Hispanic students and students of Two or more races than of White students and Asian students reported being in a physical fight anywhere. With regard to the involvement of 9th-to 12th-graders in physical fights on school property, the same patterns by race/ ethnicity were observed. The percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property was higher for Black students (13 percent) than for students of Two or more races (10 percent), Hispanic students (9 percent), Pacific Islander students (7 percent), White students (6 percent), and Asian students (5 percent), and the percentages were higher for students of Two or more races and Hispanic students than for White students and Asian students.

In 2013, some 18 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 9 percent reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days, 6 percent reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 3 percent reported carrying a weapon on 1 day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). In comparison, 5 percent of students reported carrying a weapon on school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days. This percentage was composed of 3 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 6 or more days, 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 1 day during the 30-day period.

NOTE: The term \"anywhere\" was not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days during the previous 30 days they had at least one drink of alcohol. In the question about drinking alcohol at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. Data on alcohol use at school were not collected in 2013. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding Prior to 2013, data were also collected on student alcohol consumption on school property during the previous 30 days. In 2011, some 5 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol on school property, which was not measurably different from the percentage in 1993 (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). About 3 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous 30 days in 2011. One percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and less than one percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on all of the previous 30 days (table 15.2). Higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (21 percent) and Hispanic students (7 percent) than of Black students (5 percent), White students (4 percent), and Asian students (3 percent) reported alcohol consumption on school property in 2011. However, there were no measurable differences in the percentages of students who reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day on school property in 2011 by sex and grade level. In 2011, state-level data on the percentages of students who reported using alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days on school property were available for 37 states and the District of Columbia (table 15.3). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported drinking alcohol on school property ranged from 2 percent in Indiana and Iowa to 7 percent in the District of Columbia. It is also important to examine discipline incidents that result from possession or use of alcohol at school, which reflect disruptions in the educational process and provide a gauge for the scope of alcohol use at school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of discipline incidents resulting in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day that involve students' possession or use of alcohol on school grounds. State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2013-14 school year, there were 24,000 reported alcohol-related discipline incidents in the United States (table 15.4). 52 The number of alcohol-related incidents varies widely across states, due in large part to states' differing populations. Therefore, the rate of alcoholrelated discipline incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across states. During the 2013-14 school year, the rate of alcohol-related discipline incidents was 48 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of states had rates between 10 and 100 alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2013-14 school year. Texas and Wyoming had rates of alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students that were at or below 10. Tennessee, Montana, and Washington had rates above 100. In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least one time in the previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent). In 2011, some 6 percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time on school property. The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in grades 9-12 whether they had used marijuana in the previous 30 days. Prior to 2013, students were also asked whether they had used marijuana on school property 53 in the previous 30 days. Due to this change in the questionnaire, this indicator differs from previous editions; it first discusses students' reports of marijuana use anywhere using data up to 2013, and then discusses students' reports of marijuana use on school property using data up to 2011. In 2013, some 23 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least one time in the previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent) but not measurably different from that reported in 2011 (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In 2013, about 7 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana 1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 11 percent reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the previous 30 days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 16.2). In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher percentages of male students than of female students reported using marijuana at least one time in the previous 30 days; in 2013, there was no measurable difference in the percentages reported by male and female students (25 and 22 percent, respectively; figure 16.1 and table 16.1). However, a higher percentage of males (7 percent) than of females (3 percent) reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days in 2013 (figure 16.2 and table 16.2). In 2013, some differences in the percentages of students who reported marijuana use were observed by race/ethnicity and grade level. The percentages of Asian students (16 percent) and White students (20 percent) who reported using marijuana during the previous 30 days were lower than the percentages reported by Hispanic students (28 percent), Black students and students of Two or more races (29 percent each), and American Indian/Alaska Native students (36 percent; figure 16.3 and table 16.1). In addition, the percentage of students in 9th grade (18 percent) who reported using marijuana was lower than the percentages of students in 10th grade (23 percent), 11th grade (26 percent), and 12th grade (28 percent) who reported doing so. In 2013, state-level data for students who reported using marijuana at least one time in the previous 30 days were available for 42 states (table 16.3). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported using marijuana ranged from 8 percent in Utah to 28 percent in New Mexico. Year NOTE: The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they had used marijuana. In the question about using marijuana at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. Data on marijuana use at school were not collected in 2013.  On school property, 2011 NOTE: The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many times during the previous 30 days they had used marijuana.

Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding Prior to 2013, data were also collected on students' marijuana use on school property during the previous 30 days. Some 6 percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time on school property in 2011; this was not measurably different from the percentage reported in 1993 but was higher than the percentage reported in 2009 (5 percent; figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In 2011, about 3 percent of students reported using marijuana on school property 1 or 2 times in the previous 30 days, about 2 percent reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the previous 30 days, and 1 percent reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 16.2). In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher percentages of male students than of female students reported using marijuana on school property at least one time in the previous 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). For example, 8 percent of male students reported using marijuana on school property in 2011, compared with 4 percent of female students. In 2011, a higher percentage of American Indian/ Alaska Native students (21 percent) than of students from most other racial/ethnic groups reported using marijuana on school property at least one time in the previous 30 days. Additionally, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (8 percent) than of White or Asian students (5 and 4 percent, respectively) reported using marijuana on school property, and a higher percentage of Black students (7 percent) than of White students reported doing so. There were no measurable differences by grade level in the percentages of students reporting marijuana use on school property in 2011. In 2011, state-level data for students who reported using marijuana on school property at least one time in the previous 30 days were available for 36 states and the District of Columbia (table 16.3). Among these states, the percentages of students who reported using marijuana on school property ranged from 2 percent in Oklahoma to 10 percent in New Mexico.   The percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 2013, and the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school decreased from 6 percent in 1999 to 3 percent in 2013. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked how often 54 they had been afraid of attack or harm \"at school or on the way to and from school\" as well as \"away from school.\" 55 In 2013, about 3 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school or on the way to and from school during the school year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1). Similarly, 3 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm away from school during the school year. Between 1995 and 2013, the percentages of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased overall (from 12 to 3 percent), as well as among male students (from 11 to 3 percent) and female students (from 13 to 4 percent; figure 17.1). In addition, the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased between 1995 and 2013 for White students (from 8 to 3 percent), Black students (from 20 to 5 percent), and Hispanic students (from 21 to 5 percent). A declining trend was also observed for away from school: between 1999 (the first year of data collection for this item) and 2013, the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm decreased from 6 to 3 percent overall, from 4 to 2 percent for male students, and from 7 to 3 percent for female students. The percentages of White students (from 4 to 2 percent), Black students (from 9 to 4 percent), and Hispanic students (from 9 to 4 percent) who reported being afraid of attack or harm away from 54 Students were asked if they \"never,\" \"almost never,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"most of the time\" feared that someone would attack or harm them at school or away from school.

Between the two most recent survey years, 2011 and 2013, no measurable differences were found in the overall percentages of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm, either at school or away from school. In 2013, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic students (5 percent each) than of White students (3 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school (table 17.1). Similarly, higher percentages of Black and Hispanic students (4 percent each) than of White students (2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. Higher percentages of 6th-graders (5 percent) and 7th-and 10th-graders (4 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than did 12th-graders (2 percent) in 2013. Likewise, higher percentages of 6th-, 9th-, and 10th-graders (3 to 4 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school than did 12th-graders (1 percent). In 2013, higher percentages of students in urban areas than of students in suburban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm both at school and away from school (figure 17.2). Specifically, 4 percent of students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, compared with 3 percent of students in suburban areas. Similarly, 4 percent of students in urban areas reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school, higher than the 2 percent of students in suburban areas. In addition, a higher percentage of students in urban areas than of students in rural areas reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school (4 vs. 2 percent). There were no measurable differences between the percentages of public school and private school students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school or away from school in 2013. Starting in 2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 onward are comparable to previous years.

The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages 12-18 whether they avoided school activities or classes 56 or one or more places in school 57 because they were fearful that someone might attack or harm them. 58 In 2013, about 5 percent of students reported that they avoided at least one school activity or class or one or more places in school during the previous school year because they feared being attacked or harmed. Specifically, 2 percent of students reported avoiding at least one school activity or class, and about 4 percent reported avoiding one or more places in school (figure 18.1 and table 18.1). There was no overall pattern of increase or decrease between 1999 and 2013 in the percentage of students who reported that they avoided at least one school activity or class or one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm. The percentage in 2013 (5 percent) was lower than the percentage in 1999 (7 percent) but not measurably different from the percentage in 2011.

With respect to avoiding specific places in school, 2 percent of students reported that they avoided the hallways or stairs in school, and 1 percent each reported that they avoided parts of the school cafeteria, any school restrooms, the entrance to the school, and other places inside the school building. Students' reports of avoiding one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm varied by some student and school characteristics in 2013 (figure 18.2).

The percentage of Black students receiving out-of-school suspensions (15 percent) was higher than the percentages for students of any other racial/ ethnic group. This indicator uses two different universe data collections to provide information on discipline in public schools. First, data from the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) are used to discuss the number and percentage of students receiving various disciplinary actions (e.g., suspensions, expulsions, school-related arrests). The indicator then uses state data from the EDFacts data collection to discuss the number and rate of discipline incidents related to alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession that resulted in a student being removed from the education setting for at least an entire school day. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. The CRDC provides data on the number of students who were disciplined during the 2011-12 school year by the type of action taken: suspensions (both inschool and out-of-school), expulsions, referrals to law enforcement, 59 school-related arrests, 60 and corporal punishments. 61 During the 2011-12 school year, 3.4 million students in the United States received in-school suspensions and 3.2 million received outof-school suspensions (table 19.1). The number of students who were suspended can also be expressed as a percentage of students enrolled. 62 Seven percent 59 Referral to law enforcement is an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. 60 A school-related arrest is an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off-campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. 61 Corporal punishment is paddling, spanking, or other forms of physical punishment imposed on a student. 62 The percentage of students receiving a disciplinary action is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of students receiving that type of disciplinary action for the entire 2011-12 school year by the student enrollment based on a count of students taken on a single day between September 27 and December 31. The CRDC provides a count of students who received disciplinary actions; thus, a student who was suspended multiple times during a school year might be counted only once in the CRDC. of students received an in-school suspension and 6 percent received an out-of-school suspension in 2011-12 (table 19.2). Less than 1 percent of students received each of the following disciplinary actions: referral to law enforcement, corporal punishment, expulsion, and school-related arrest. The CR DC a lso provides information on characteristics of students receiving disciplinary actions, including students' sex and race/ethnicity. 63 There were differences by both sex and race/ethnicity in the percentage of students who received out-ofschool suspensions in 2011-12. The percentage of Black students receiving out-of-school suspensions (15 percent) was higher than the percentages for students of all other racial/ethnic groups (figure 19.1). In contrast, a lower percentage of Asian students (1 percent) received out-of-school suspensions than students from any other racial/ethnic group. A higher percentage of male students (9 percent) than female students (4 percent) received an outof-school suspension in 2011-12. This pattern of higher percentages of male than female students being suspended held across all racial/ethnic groups. In addition, differences by race/ethnicity for male and female students were similar to the overall differences by race/ethnicity. Among males, the percentage of Black students who received an out-ofschool suspension (20 percent) was almost twice the percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students (10 percent), and more than twice the percentages of students of Two or more races (9 percent), Hispanic students (8 percent), White students (6 percent), Pacific Islander students (5 percent), and Asian students (2 percent). Similarly, the percentage of Black female students who received an out-of-school suspension (11 percent) was more than twice the  percentages of female students of any other race/ ethnicity. The pattern of greater percentages of Black males and females receiving disciplinary actions than males and females of any other race/ethnicity was also evident for student expulsions. The CRDC allows for state-level comparisons of the percentage of students who received various disciplinary actions. In the majority of states, between 3 and 10 percent of students received an out-of-school suspension during the 2011-12 school year (table 19.3). In Hawaii, North Dakota, and Utah, the percentage of students receiving an outof-school suspension was less than 3 percent. More than 10 percent of students received an out-of-school suspension in the District of Columbia, Florida, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Delaware. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies (SEAs) report the number of discipline incidents resulting in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day for specific reasons: possession or use of alcohol on school grounds, possession or use of tobacco or illicit drugs on school grounds, a violent incident with or without physical injury, and weapons possession. Unlike the CRDC, where the reasons for disciplinary actions are not available, the EDFacts data can be used to examine the magnitude of the specific types of discipline incidents listed above. 64 SEAs compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. 65 SEAs are not required to report discipline incidents that are not a result of alcohol, drugs, violence, or weapons possession. 64 EDFacts data represent a count of specific discipline incidents, while the CRDC provides a count of students who received disciplinary actions. Thus, a student who was suspended multiple times during a school year might be counted once in the CRDC, but multiple times in EDFacts provided each incident met the inclusion criteria. 65 EDFacts is compiled by state education agencies, while the CRDC is generally filled out by district-or school-level staff."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 20 Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools", "text": "In the 2013-14 school year, about 88 percent of public schools reported they had a written plan for procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting, and 70 percent of these schools had drilled students on the use of the plan. Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students, faculty, and staff. Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors and gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as the use of metal detectors and security cameras, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. In the 2013-14 school year, principals of public schools were asked about their schools' use of safety and security measures and procedures in the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school safety and discipline. Another measure of safety and security, collected in the FRSS survey of school safety and discipline, is the presence of security staff in public schools during the school year. Principals were also asked to report whether their school had a written plan for procedures to be performed in selected crises, as well as whether they had drilled students during the current school year on the use of a plan. In prior years, data on safety and security measures and procedures, presence of security staff at school, and written and drilled plans for selected crises were collected from the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). In the 2013-14 school year, 93 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security measures reported by public schools included the use of security cameras to monitor the school (75 percent), a requirement that faculty and staff wear badges or picture IDs (68 percent), and the enforcement of a strict dress code (58 percent). In addition, 24 percent of public schools reported the use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, 20 percent required that students wear uniforms, 9 percent required students to wear badges or picture IDs, and 4 percent used random metal detector checks. Use of various safety and security procedures differed by school level during the 2013-14 school year (figure 20.1 and table 20.2). For example, higher percentages of public primary schools and public middle schools than of public high schools and combined elementary/secondary schools (referred to as high/combined schools) controlled access to school buildings and required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. Additionally, a higher percentage of primary schools required students to wear uniforms (23 percent) than high/combined schools (15 percent). Conversely, higher percentages of high/combined schools and middle schools than of primary schools reported the enforcement of a strict dress code; a requirement that students wear badges or picture IDs; and the use of random metal detector checks. A higher percentage of high/combined schools reported the use of security cameras to monitor the school (89 percent) than middle schools (84 percent), and both of these percentages were higher than the percentage of primary schools (67 percent) that reported the use of security cameras.

The number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students also decreased, from 19.8 in 2012 to 18.4 in 2013. Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings about crimes to students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus safety and security have been reported by institutions through the Campus Safety and Security Survey. These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general public. Reports on referrals for disciplinary action primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff). In 2013, there were 27,600 criminal incidents against persons and property on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing an 8 percent decrease from 2012 (29,800 incidents; table 22.1).

Other commonly reported crimes included forcible sex offenses (5,000 incidents, or 18 percent of crimes) and motor vehicle theft (3,000 incidents, or 11 percent of crimes). In addition, 2,100 aggravated assaults and 1,300 robberies 73 were reported. These estimates translate to 10.3 burglaries, 3.3 forcible sex offenses, 2.0 motor vehicle thefts, 1.4 aggravated assaults, and 0.9 robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 22.2). 71 The base of 10,000 FTE students includes students who are enrolled exclusively in distance learning courses and who may not be physically present on campus. 72 Unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. 73 Taking or attempting to take anything of value using actual or threatened force or violence.  2006, both enrollment and the number of on-campus crimes increased. However, because enrollment increased by a larger percentage than the number of crimes, the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students was actually lower in 2006 (33.3) than in 2001 (35.6). Between 2006 and 2013, the number of reported on-campus crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 33.3 to 18.4. The rates per 10,000 students for all types of reported on-campus crimes, other than forcible sex offenses and murder, were lower in 2013 than in 2001. In the case of forcible sex offenses, the rate increased from 1.9 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 3.3 in 2013. The rate per 10,000 students for murder was the same in 2013 and in 2001 (0.015).

Some institutions that report Clery data-specifically, non-degree-granting institutions and institutions outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia-are excluded from this figure. Crimes include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes offcampus crimes even if they involve college students or staff. In 2013, the number of crimes committed on college campuses differed by type of institution, though to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the types and the presence of student residence halls. Crimes involving students on campus after normal class hours, such as those occurring in residence halls, are included in campus crime reports, while crimes involving students off campus are not. In 2013, more on-campus crimes overall were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (24.2 vs. 6.2 per 10,000 students; table 22.2). Rates for most types of crime were also higher for institutions with residence halls. For example, more burglaries were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (13.9 vs. 2.9 per 10,000 students), and more forcible sex offenses were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without them (4.6 vs. 0.5 per 10,000 students). Although data for different types of institutions are difficult to compare directly because of the differing structures of student services and campus arrangements, there were decreases in the numbers of on-campus crimes at all types of institutions between 2006 and 2013. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus crimes decreased from a high of 20,600 in 2006 to 13,200 in 2013, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 35.5 to 19.6 during this period (tables 22.1 and 22.2). Similarly, at nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased from 16,900 in 2006 to 10,400 in 2013, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 57.7 to 31.3. At public 2-year institutions, the number of crimes decreased from 5,700 to 3,100 between 2006 and 2013, and the number of crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 15.4 to 8.0.  2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009  There were some differences among institution types in the patterns of on-campus arrests made for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations. At public 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students was lower in 2013 than in 2001 (57.4 vs. 60.1; table 22.2). At nonprofit 4-year institutions, the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students decreased from 24.5 in 2001 to 17.2 in 2013. In contrast, the number of on-campus arrests per 10,000 students at public 2-year institutions was higher in 2013 than in 2001 (8.0 vs. 7.8)."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "A school belonging scale was constructed based on the extent to which students agreed or disagreed that they felt safe at school, that they felt proud of being part of the school, that there were always teachers or other adults at school they could talk to if they had a problem, that school was often a waste of time, and that getting good grades was important to them.

The 2013-14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and change in survey administration may have impacted 2013-14 results. 2 Because the 2013-14 survey did not collect school enrollment counts, the rate per 1,000 students was calculated by dividing the number of incidents by the total number of students obtained from the Common Core of Data.\nTheft/larceny (taking things worth over $10 without personal confrontation) was defined for respondents as \"the unlawful taking of another person's property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm.\" This includes pocket picking, stealing a purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vending machine, and all other types of thefts.\nThe 2013-14 survey collected neither school enrollment counts nor data on the percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch.

A more recent report from this data collection identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999(Anderson et al. 2001. Other publications from this study have described how the number of events change during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes trends in school-associated homicide from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2006(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008. The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present are flagged as preliminary. For some recent data, the interviews with school and law enforcement officials to verify case details have not been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be identified because of the expansion of the scope of the media files used for case identification. Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier data years using the independent case finding efforts (which focus on nonmedia sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally be identified while the law enforcement and school interviews are being conducted to verify known cases.

For states with a first-stage weight greater than 2-that is, the state reported SHR data for less than half of the FBI's estimated number of murder victims in the state-the first-stage weight is set to 1. The second-stage weight uses the FBI's annual national estimates of murder victims in the United States and the sum of the first-stage weights for each state. The second-stage weight for victims in all states in year Y is-FBI's estimate of murder victims in the United States (year Y) Sum of the first-stage weights of all states (year Y) There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009,2011, and 2013, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data are known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999 and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and Hispanic origin variable in the NCVS interview response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only the age and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the age 14 and the west region categories showed positive response biases that were significantly different from some of the other categories within the age and region variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias seems to have little impact on the SCS results. Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high-typically over 97 percent of all eligible respondents, meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years.

The YRBSS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) as well as surveys conducted in states and large urban school districts. This report uses 1993uses , 1995uses , 1997uses , 1999uses , 2001uses , 2003uses , 2005uses , 2007uses , 2009uses , 2011uses , and 2013 The national YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013, three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. In 2013, only selection of two classes per grade was needed to achieve an adequate precision with minimum variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007 survey, 16,400 students participated in the 2009 survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, and 13,600 participated in the 2013 survey. The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, 71 percent for the 2011 survey, and 68 percent for the 2013 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state samples, and all district samples, include only public schools, and each district sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2013, a total of 42 states and 21 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 42 states. For example, California was not one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data but it contained several districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts, please see http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation. htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,107 to 53,785. School response rates ranged from 70 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 60 to 94 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 87 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the 2005, 2007, and 2009 2007,2009,2011, and 2013 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and (2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students. Eaton et al. (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Data reported by districts, schools, principals, and teachers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policymakers and the general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS has been conducted by the Census Bureau for NCES since the first administration of the survey, which was conducted during the 1987-88 school year. Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in 1990-91, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12. SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and school library media centers; and national and regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as principals, teachers, and school library media centers within these schools. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. From its inception, SASS has had four core components: school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and school district (prior to 1999-2000, \"teacher demand and shortage\") questionnaires. A fifth component, school library media center questionnaires, was introduced in the 1993-94 administration and has been included in every subsequent administration of SASS. School library data were also collected in the 1990-91 administration of the survey through the school and principal questionnaires. School questionnaires used in SASS include the Public and Private School Questionnaires; teacher questionnaires include the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaires; principal questionnaires include the Public and Private School Principal (or School Administrator) Questionnaires, and school district questionnaires include the School District (or Teacher Demand and Shortage) Questionnaires. Although the four core questionnaires and the school library media questionnaires have remained relatively stable over the various administrations of SASS, the survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues in elementary and secondary education. Some items have been added, some have been deleted, and some questionnaire items have been reworded. During the 1990-91 SASS cycle, NCES worked with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a part of SASS through 2007-08. The Indian School Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues that the Public and Private School Questionnaires explore, allowing comparisons among the three types of schools. The 1990The -91, 1993The -94, 1999The -2000The , 2003The -04, and 2007 administrations of SASS obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but the 2011-12 administration did not obtain BIE data. SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates in this report may differ from those in previously published reports. School library media center questionnaires were administered in public, private, and BIE schools as part of the 1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS. During the 2003-04 administration of SASS, only library media centers in public schools were surveyed, and in 2007-08 library media centers in public schools and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed. The 2011-12 survey collected data only on school library media centers in traditional public schools and in public charter schools. School library questions focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised topics included access to online licensed databases, resource availability, and additional elements on information literacy. The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in 1993-94. As part of the 1999-2000 SASS, the Charter School Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter schools in operation in 1998-99. In 2003-04 and in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools were included in the public school sample as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change in the 2003-04 administration of SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a primary in-person contact within the school intended to reduce the field follow-up phase. The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/ ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2015\nCity A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas) and inside a principal city (defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a \"core\" area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly integrated economically or socially with the core). Elementary teachers See instructional level. Instructional level Teachers are divided into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of their classes. Those with only ungraded classes become elementary level teachers if their main assignment is Early childhood/Pre-k or Elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers generally teach any of grades Pre-k-5; report an Early childhood/ Pre-k, Elementary, Self-contained special education, or Elementary enrichment main assignment; or the majority of grades taught are K-6. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades 7-12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7-12 than lower level grades. Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas). Secondary teachers See instructional level. Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined as a city that contains the primary population and economic center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a \"core\" area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that are highly integrated economically or socially with the core) and inside an urbanized area (defined as densely settled \"cores\" with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas).

These teacher-reported data may be combined with related information on their school's characteristics, such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, private other religious, and private nonsectarian), community type, and school enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask for information on teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching environment. In 1993-94, about 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, about 52,500 public school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, about 48,400 public school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled. In 2011-12, about 51,100 public school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011-12 were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent for private school teachers. The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years of experience, highest degree attained, perceived influence on decisions made at the school, and hours spent per week on all school activities. These data on principals can be placed in the context of other SASS data, such as the type of the principal's school (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. In 2003-04, about 10,200 public school principals were sampled, and in 2007-08, about 9,800 public school principals were sampled. In 2011-12, about 11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private school principals were sampled. Weighted response rates in 2011-12 for public school principals and private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. The SASS 2011-12 sample of schools was confined to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. The SASS 2011-12 sample included 10,250 traditional public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000 private schools. The public school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was based on an adjusted public school universe file from the 2009-10 Common Core of Data (CCD), a database of all the nation's public school districts and public schools. The private school sample for the 2011-12 SASS was selected from the 2009-10 Private School Universe Survey (PSS), as updated for the 2011-12 PSS. This update collected membership lists from private school associations and religious denominations, as well as private school lists from state education departments. The 2011-12 SASS private school frame was further augmented by the inclusion of additional schools that were identified through the 2009-10 PSS area frame data collection.

SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted in school years 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08, and 2009-10. SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education. The 2009-10 SSOCS (SSOCS: 2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable\nAt school/at your school Includes activities that happened in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that held school-sponsored events or activities. Unless otherwise specified, respondents were instructed to report on activities that occurred during normal school hours or when school activities/events were in session. City As collected by the Common Core of Data and appended to the SSOCS data file, city includes territories inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city and includes large cities (populations of 250,000 or more), midsize cities (population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000) and small cities (population less than 100,000). Combined schools Schools that include all combinations of grades, including K-12 schools, other than primary, middle, and high schools (see definitions for these school levels later in this section).

Length of stay is generally longer than detention but shorter than most long-term commitments. Ranch/wilderness camp A long-term residential facility for persons whose behavior does not necessitate the strict confinement of a long-term secure facility, often allowing them greater contact with the community. Includes ranches, forestry camps, wilderness or marine programs, or farms. Residential treatment center A facility that focuses on providing some type of individually planned treatment program for youth (substance abuse, sex offender, mental health, etc.) in conjunction with residential care. Such facilities generally require specific licensing by the state that may require that treatment provided is Medicaid-reimbursable. In data years 1997, 1999, and 2001, these facilities are included in the group home category. Long-term secure facility A specialized type of facility that provides strict confinement for its residents. Includes training schools, reformatories, and juvenile correctional facilities.

The FRSS, whose surveys collect and report data on key education issues at the elementary and secondary levels, was designed to meet the data needs of Department of Education analysts, planners, and decisionmakers when information could not be collected quickly through NCES's large recurring surveys. Findings from FRSS surveys have been included in congressional reports, testimony to congressional subcommittees, NCES reports, and other Department of Education reports. The findings are also often used by state and local education officials. Data collected through FRSS surveys are representative at the national level, drawing from a sample that is appropriate for each study. The FRSS collects data from state education agencies and national samples of other educational organizations and participants, including local education agencies, public and private elementary and secondary schools, elementary and secondary school teachers and principals, and public libraries and school libraries. To ensure a minimal burden on respondents, the surveys are generally limited to three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. Sample sizes are relatively small (usually about 1,000 to 1,500 respondents per survey) so that data collection can be completed quickly. The FRSS survey \"School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14\" (FRSS 106) collected information on specific safety and discipline plans and practices, training for classroom teachers and aides related to school safety and discipline issues, security personnel, frequency of specific discipline problems, and number of incidents of various offenses. The sample for the \"School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14\" survey was selected from the 2011-12 Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe file. Approximately 1,600 regular public elementary, middle, and high school/combined schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia were selected for the study. (For the purposes of the study, \"regular\" schools included charter schools.) In February 2014, questionnaires and cover letters were mailed to the principal of each sampled school. The letter requested that the questionnaire be completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school, and respondents were offered the option of completing the survey either on paper or online. Telephone follow-up for survey nonresponse and data clarification was initiated in March 2014 and completed in July 2014. About 1,350 schools completed the survey. The weighted response rate was 85 percent. One of the goals of the FRSS \"School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14\" survey is to allow comparisons to the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) data. Consistent with the approach used on SSOCS, respondents were asked to report for the current 2013-14 school year to date. Information about violent incidents that occurred in the school between the time that the survey was completed and the end of the school year are not included in the survey data.

Since 1990, all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. Originally, Congress enacted the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, which was amended in 1992, 1998, and again in 2000. The 1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires schools to give timely warnings of crimes to the student body and staff; to publicize campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by campus security authorities. These authorities include campus police; nonpolice security staff responsible for monitoring campus property; municipal, county, or state law enforcement agencies with institutional agreements for security services; individuals and offices designated by the campus security policies as those to whom crimes should be reported; and officials of the institution with significant responsibility for student and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for offenses committed at geographic locations associated with each institution. For on-campus crimes, this includes property and buildings owned or controlled by the institution. In addition to on-campus crimes, the act requires disclosure of crimes committed in or on a noncampus building or property owned or controlled by the institution for educational purposes or for recognized student organizations, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. There are three types of statistics described in this report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal offenses include homicide, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Only the most serious offense is counted when more than one offense was committed during an incident. The two other categories, arrests and referrals, include counts for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Arrests and referrals relate to only those that are in violation of the law and not just in violation of institutional policies. If no federal, state, or local law was violated, these events are not reported. Further, if an individual is arrested and referred for disciplinary action for an offense, only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons, including those arrested and released without formal charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action is defined to include persons referred to any official who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record is kept and which may result in the imposition of a sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police or other law enforcement agencies. All criminal offenses and arrests may include students, faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses may or may not involve students that are enrolled in the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, staff). Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have been reported and recorded by campus security and/ or local police. The process of reporting and recording alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First, the victim or some other party must recognize that a possible crime has occurred and report the event. The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded, the nature and type of offense must be classified. This classification may differ from the initial report due to the collection of additional evidence, interviews with witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date an incident is reported may be much later than the date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may not realize something was stolen until much later, or a victim of violence may wait a number of days to report a crime. Other factors are related to the probability that an incident is reported, including the severity of the event, the victim's confidence and prior experience with the police or security agency, or influence from third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable about the incident). Finally the reader should be mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security and/or local police within a given year, and they do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime.

All data in EDFacts are organized into \"data groups\" and reported to ED using defined file specifications. Depending on the data group, state education agencies may submit aggregate counts for the state as a whole or detailed counts for individual schools or school districts. EDFacts does not collect studentlevel records. The entities that are required to report EDFacts data vary by data group but may include the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More information about EDFacts file specifications and data groups can be found at http:// www.ed.gov/edfacts. EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject to sampling error, but nonsampling errors such as nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The U.S. Department of Education attempts to minimize nonsampling errors by training data submission coordinators and reviewing the quality of state data submissions. However, anomalies may still be present in the data. Differences in state data collection systems may limit the comparability of EDFacts data across states and across time. To build EDFacts files, state education agencies rely on data that were reported by their schools and school districts. The systems used to collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ from state to state. For example, there is a large shift in California's firearm incident data between 2010-11 and 2011-12. California cited a new student data system that more accurately collects firearm incident data as the reason for the magnitude of the difference. In some cases, EDFacts data may not align with data reported on state education agency websites. States may update their websites on different schedules than those they use to report to ED. Further, ED may use methods to protect the privacy of individuals represented within the data that could be different from the methods used by an individual state.

The study focuses on understanding students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce, and beyond. The HSLS:09 questionnaire is focused on, but not limited to, information on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. It is designed to provide data on mathematics and science education, the changing high school environment, and postsecondary education. This study features a new student assessment in algebra skills, reasoning, and problem solving and includes surveys of students, their parents, math and science teachers, and school administrators, as well as a new survey of school counselors. The HSLS:09 base year took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomly selected sample of fall-term 9th-graders in more than 900 public and private high schools that had both a 9th and an 11th grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. Students' parents, principals, and mathematics and science teachers and the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or online. The HSLS:09 student questionnaire includes interest and motivation items for measuring key factors predicting choice of postsecondary paths, including majors and eventual careers. This study explores the roles of different factors in the development of a student's commitment to attend college and then take the steps necessary to succeed in college (the right courses, courses in specific sequences, etc.). Questionnaires in this study have asked more questions of students and parents regarding reasons for selecting specific colleges (e.g., academic programs, financial aid and access prices, and campus environment). The first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in the spring of 2012, when most sample members were in the 11th grade. Data files and documentation for the first follow-up were released in fall 2013 and are available on the NCES website. A between-round postsecondary status update survey took place in the spring of students' expected graduation year (2013). It asked respondents about college applications, acceptances, and rejections, as well as their actual college choices. In the fall of 2013 and the spring of 2014, high school transcripts were collected and coded. A full second follow-up is planned for 2016, when most sample members will be 3 years beyond high school graduation. Additional follow-ups are planned, to at least age 30. Parents were asked to provide a response about their child's suspension and expulsion status on both the base-year (2009) questionnaire and on the first followup (2012) questionnaire. in facilities and can differ substantially from the annual admission and release data used to measure facility population flow. One-day count statistics are overrepresentative of those youth with longer lengths of stay (e.g., more serious offenders or those in longterm placements) and underrepresentative of youth with short lengths of stay (e.g., those in detention). Facility information can be generalized to juvenile residential placement facilities (except those for drug treatment or mental health only, or for dependents). The CJRP does not capture data on juveniles held in adult prisons or jails; therefore, in the CJRP data, juveniles placed in juvenile facilities by criminal courts represent an unknown proportion of juveniles incarcerated by criminal courts. In mid-October, the Census Bureau mails data requests to respondents representing public, private, tribal, and U.S. territory residential juvenile facilities. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The CJRP allows for electronic submission of the data by larger facilities and central reporters. As part of this program, the Census Bureau provides data specifications and a spreadsheet format to participating respondents so that these respondents can also complete the form through common spreadsheet programs. Using the number of in-scope facilities as a base, the CJRP facility response rate was 96 percent in 1997, 100 percent in 1999, 99 percent in 2001, 100 percent in 2003, 100 percent in 2006, 100 percent in 2007, 93 percent in 2010, 95 percent in 2011, and 92 percent in 2013. Some facilities are not able to provide all the information requested for all juveniles meeting CJRP inclusion criteria. In such cases, data are imputed from complete records to fill in incomplete records. Therefore, reported CJRP estimates regarding the characteristics of juveniles in custody may differ from their actual characteristics. To make data available to a wide variety of users, online access to the CJRP is provided in the Easy Access to the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (EZACJRP) data analysis tool (http://www.ojjdp. gov/ojstatbb/ezacjrp/), developed and maintained by The National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ) for OJJDP. The EZACJRP data analysis tool allows users to perform custom crosstabs of national data on the characteristics of youth held in residential placement facilities, including detailed information about the youth's age, sex, race/ethnicity, placement status, length of stay, and most serious offense. By statute and regulation, OJJDP must protect the privacy of individuals included in its surveys. To comply with this requirement, OJJDP has adopted a policy that requires all published table cells to be rounded to the nearest multiple of 3. The table cells are rounded after the table has been produced from the underlying data. Each cell is rounded independently, without consideration of row or column totals. As a result, in many state tables the internal cells will not add to the marginal totals.

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The coefficient of variation (C V ) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the C V is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the exception of Indicator 2, the C V was calculated for all estimates in this report, and in cases where the C V was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the C V was 50 percent or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula: \u221ase 2 + se 2 -(2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared to the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared to published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person or household. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident. Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among a specific population group. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. Each victimization that is reported by the respondents is counted, so there may be one incident with two victims, which would be counted as two victimizations. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident.
