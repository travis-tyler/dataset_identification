Th e 2010 Summit brought together postdocs, faculty, administrators with oversight of postdoctoral aff airs and other advocates with an interest in postdoc gender issues. It provided a forum for examining what we know about postdoc women and their career trajectories, as well as an initial platform for sharing of promising practices to help advance postdoc women's careers. 2 Th e NPA hopes that the information found in this resource book will assist institutions in their eff orts to reduce the obstacles faced by postdoc women as they seek to advance their careers as academic professionals. In reducing these obstacles for women we anticipate that postdoc men, who also need policies and programs that support their careers and foster family formation, will benefi t as well.

Since its founding in 2003, the NPA has assumed a leadership role in addressing issues confronting the postdoctoral community that are national in scope and require action beyond the local level. Th e NPA supports postdoctoral scholars and the greater postdoctoral community mainly through resource development, building community, and education of the public. Each spring the NPA hosts its Annual Meeting, where many topics pertinent to the education and training of the U.S. research workforce are discussed and debated on a national level. One of the NPA's strategic priorities is to promote and support diversity throughout the U.S. postdoctoral community, and the NPA ADVANCE project is part of this eff ort. Th e NPA membership includes some 2,500 individuals and nearly 190 institutions, whose research is supported by more than 60,000 postdocs. Of the 108 research universities classifi ed as \"very high activity\" research institutions by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, nearly two-thirds are members of the NPA. Of the 62 members of the Association of American Universities, 52 are NPA members. As a member-driven organization, the NPA's work is largely done by standing committees.

Th is resource book provides an overview of this metaanalysis and an introduction to these recommended practices. Th e goal is to help focus institutions' eff orts to support postdoc women to foster career advancement. As a companion to this book, an expanded compendium is available as an online clearinghouse at www.nationalpostdoc.org/ advance/clearinghouse which includes more detailed examples of adaptable models from the community. A continuing challenge in serving the postdoc population is a dearth of robust data. Although datasets on postdocs have substantially expanded in recent years, they are still incomplete, resulting in uncertainty in even the total number of postdocs working in the United States. 1 Th e supporting data discussed in this resource represent the best available. Several of the most signifi cant limitations are a lack of data on postdocs who are not U.S. citizens (often referred to as international postdocs, who the data suggest outnumber domestic postdocs), data on postdocs who are from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and data on postdocs with disabilities. With little information on the factors infl uencing the career paths of these important sub-populations, we are severely limited in our understanding of how best to serve them. Given the limited data and the complexities of the scientifi c workforce, there are no defi nitive answers about which practices are the best for retaining postdoc women in academic careers. Th ere are few studies that measure the impact of specifi c interventions on postdoc career outcomes, since long-term tracking of postdocs' careers after they leave an institution is challenging and rarely practiced. For example, among the 72 research institutions surveyed by NPA ADVANCE in fall 2009, only three institutions responded that they formally track their postdocs' subsequent career steps. 2 Moreover, understanding postdoc outcomes and retention within academia can be diffi cult when some postdocs may not be able to get the academic job they want for a variety of reasons whereas others may have opted against an academic job for any number of conscious or unconscious reasons. Th erefore, the practices discussed in this resource and included in the online clearinghouse are primarily based on success stories and a growing understanding of the factors that diff erentially impact postdoc women's career choices. Despite the absence of research regarding these impacts, the recurrence of patterns in the insights of people experienced in the fi eld give us a strong sense of the validity of this overview. What is a promising practice? As a result of the lack of data on postdoc outcomes, the practices discussed in this volume often have only limited objective evidence upon which their past eff ectiveness has been assessed. Criteria adapted from Identifying and Promoting Promising Practices from the Compassion Capital Fund National Resource Center 5 were used as a general guideline for inclusion of a practice: 1. Suggested eff ectiveness for fostering postdoc women's career advancement. 2. Successful use in one institution and context. 3. Potential for replicability and/or adaptability. 4. When possible, limited supporting data from comparison to objective benchmarks with positive results. 5. Limited supporting data from internal assessment. Because so many success stories do not have objective benchmarks for comparison, the majority of the practices noted in this resource book do not meet the fourth criteria. Also, in a few cases practices have been included that have not been utilized specifi cally with postdoc women, but may show promise for adaptation from their use with similar groups, for example, faculty women or postdocs in general. Ultimately, leaving or continuing on the academic career path is the result of a complex combination of factors. Rather than imagining that any one intervention would be able to ensure that all factors work in favor of success, the goal of this resource book is to present interventions that help women avoid or overcome one or more of the common obstacles in that path. Although attention to the obstacles may have originated in concern about women's relative lack of persistence in academia, the interventions that have been developed will be helpful to men as well, who will benefi t from general professional development as well as supportive postdoctoral policies that foster family formation and career advancement."}, {"section_title": "Who should use this resource?", "text": "Th e goal of this resource book is to summarize the available data about postdocs and gender and to bring forward success stories for aiding institutions in their eff orts to advance postdoc women's careers into the professoriate. It is primarily intended for individuals at research institutions who have a role in postdoctoral training or oversight at the institutional level, for example, those working in: \u2022 An offi ce of postdoctoral aff airs; \u2022 Graduate schools that include postdocs in their purview; \u2022 Career centers that serve postdocs; \u2022 Training offi ces or programs that off er programming for postdocs; \u2022 NSF-funded ADVANCE programs that include postdocs in their activities; \u2022 Offi ces of international services; and \u2022 Postdoctoral associations or similar groups that provide information or programming for postdocs. Other stakeholders at research institutions who might fi nd this resource useful include faculty or other researchers who supervise and mentor postdocs and institutional leaders who would like an overview of the key gender issues for postdoctoral scholars. Beyond institutions, there are a number of other important stakeholders in the postdoctoral community who may fi nd this resource useful. Th ese include the federal funding agencies that provide the primary source of funding for postdoctoral scholars, both through research grants and individual fellowships. Various federal policies managing these funds often frame the local institutional policies on postdoctoral appointments, such as employment classifi cation, and therefore, conditions of employment and benefi ts. In particular, federal policy and guidelines can often set a template for these institutional policies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Research Service Award (NRSA) stipend scale that is used as the salary scale for postdocs by many institutions. Another important group of stakeholders are the professional societies. Th ese organizations not only provide an important source of professional development and support for the individual postdoc, they also can play important leadership and dissemination roles within the communities they serve. Moreover, disciplinary societies can be an important venue for sharing of promising practices that are more discipline appropriate. Finally, individual postdocs may fi nd this resource informative where it is pertinent to their own career decisions. Postdocs need to be proactive and take control of their own careers. Th e information in this guide, and in particular, the appendices, may provide a starting point for postdocs developing a career plan. Above all, this book has been designed to allow readers to take away some promising ideas for institutional programs and policies that can promote postdoc women's career advancement. A number of these ideas will need to be creatively adapted for diff erent institutional types, cultures and needs. Ideally, the suggestions in this resource book will also provide a framework for new initiatives and ideas. Additional examples can be found at the NPA ADVANCE online clearinghouse at www.nationalpostdoc.org/advance/clearinghouse.

Often called the \"leaky pipeline,\" the typical academic career path from graduate school to postdoctoral scholar to tenure-track faculty tends to \"leak\" both men and women along the way, but these losses are most signifi cant for women. Th e point at which the greatest losses occur is between receipt of the Ph.D. and the fi rst tenuretrack position. 2 Th e 2007 National Research Council report, Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfi lling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering, points out that this decrease appears to be particularly acute in those fi elds where the postdoc position is most common. 3 A more recent National Academies study, Gender Diff erences at Critical Transitions in the Careers of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Faculty, 4 examined the faculty hiring and promotion practices at the top U.S. research universities and found that the fraction of women dropped between the Ph.D. recipient pool and the faculty applicant pool. Moreover, these drops were greatest in those fi elds that employ large numbers of postdocs, namely chemistry and the biological sciences. While the underrepresentation of women in the sciences, particularly in the faculty ranks, has been the subject of numerous studies, papers and reports, 5 there are fewer defi nitive answers regarding the reasons for this imbalance."}, {"section_title": "C H A P T E R O N E", "text": "The Reasons that Postdoc Women Leave Science Market pressure is likely one of the most signifi cant factors in the departure of postdoc womenand men-from academic science. Th e number of tenure-track faculty positions has not kept pace with the growth in the number of postdoc positions, and overall less than a third of postdocs continue into the tenure track 6 (for an overview of the postdoc career life cycle and current data on the postdoc population, see Appendix A). Yet postdoc women are more likely than men to leave science, suggesting that there are additional factors at play. Th e general types of reasons cited by the women themselves for leaving science are nicely described by Anne Preston in her book Leaving Science: Occupational Exit from Scientifi c Careers. 7 In a study of the reasons stated by women for leaving academic science, utilizing surveys and targeted interviews, Preston found three general factors: (1) Diffi culty combining family with a scientifi c career; (2) Lack of mentoring; and 3Mismatch of respondents' interests and the requirements of a scientifi c job. Th e fi rst echoes many fi ndings that the institutional environment in academia makes starting and maintaining a family diffi cult. Th e second refl ects Preston's fi nding that mentors played an important role in her respondents' occupational exit, most often due to a lack of mentorship, encouragement, and role models. Preston's third factor encompasses the range of issues involved in women potentially choosing so-called \"alternate careers\" or career paths outside academic science that have not been traditionally taken by Ph.D.-trained researchers. Th is factor may involve market pressure as well as a loss of interest in the academic science career path. Recent studies on the factors that infl uence postdoc women's decisions to leave science fi nd that those factors fi t into Preston's general framework. For postdoc women, the top factors appear to be: (1) Issues related to family formation; (2) Feelings of isolation; (3) Low self-confi dence; and (4) Lack of mentoring and encouragement."}, {"section_title": "Family Formation", "text": "One leading factor in women's departure from the STEM career pipeline appears to be challenges women face in juggling career and family. 8 Recent studies, such as Mason and Goulden, 9 Goulden, Frasch and Mason, 10 and Ginther and Kahn, 11 fi nd that women who have small children have a decreased likelihood of obtaining their fi rst tenure-track faculty job, in contrast to men with children or women without children. In fact, Ginther and Kahn 12 fi nd that the eff ect is actually the opposite for men, that getting married and having children actually advantages their careers. Demographically, postdoc women are on average at a life stage where they are partnering and having children, and these changes in family situation in turn infl uence their career paths. Th e postdoc has long been considered a type of \"itinerant journeyman,\" where Ph.D. recipients are encouraged to move from institution to institution for short-term, low-paying temporary training positions with a string of new supervisors. Th e transience of this lifestyle, however, can create signifi cant obstacles for postdocs trying to start families and \"put down roots.\" Th is transience has been cited by graduate student women in chemistry in the United Kingdom, for example, as a reason they lose interest in becoming a postdoc. 13"}, {"section_title": "Partnering and Dual-Career Concerns", "text": "For postdoc women partnered with other professionals, often called \"dual-career\" couples, fi nding positions together is challenging, especially when both partners are in academia. 14 Academic women tend to partner with other academics, and academic women in the natural sciences tend to partner with other natural scientists. 15 Same sex couples tend to have similar partnering patterns. 16 With the majority of postdocs being partnered, dual-career issues loom large for these researchers. i NPA ADVANCE Focus Groups http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/advance-focus-groups (accessed  In September and October 2010, NPA ADVANCE staff held a series of four focus groups with current and former postdoc women. i The goal was to examine the factors infl uencing the career choices of female postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) in order to learn more about potential strategies that could help them continue an academic research career. Selected participants' covered a range of disciplines, consistent with the distribution nationally, and, among former postdocs, a range of nationalities and career sectors from academia to science policy to homemaker. The discussions focused on aspects of postdoctoral training that could be benefi cial for their careers as well as other aspects of \"life\" as a postdoc, such as family and visa requirements, that are signifi cant factors in their career decisions. Participants shared success stories, highlighting institutional and individual practices they felt were benefi cial, and illustrated a number of challenges they face in continuing their academic careers, many of which follow from structural aspects of the postdoctoral position. These structural aspects, many of which are interrelated, included: the temporary nature of postdoctoral positions; the duration of postdoctoral training; the relative isolation and lack of status of postdocs who have closer ties to their research group or supervisor than to the institution at large; and the typically low salaries. Another distinct challenge for postdoc women is the fact that most are international and so face additional constraints on their work-family balance, and on the dual-career issue in particular, due to extreme geographical constraints and immigration issues. Participants had already experienced a number of practices that had helped them advance their careers. These came from their institutions, professional societies, supervisors, mentors and colleagues. A continuing challenge will be encouraging participation in these promising practices, such as training-related programs and mentoring, that for many are still viewed as taking time away from core research activities."}, {"section_title": "NPA ADVANCE Focus Groups", "text": "In 2010, NPA ADVANCE conducted a series of focus groups with current and former postdoc women to examine the factors involved in their career decisions. 17 During the screening survey, the vast majority of respondents indicated that family concerns infl uenced their career decisions. Most of these concerns could be characterized as geographic constraints on career mobility, where respondents wanted positions in relative proximity to their partner's job or to other family and were concerned about strategies for accommodating these constraints. Other studies have found that postdoc women are more likely than men to cite family considerations as important in their career planning and decisions 18 and can be more likely to choose a postdoc position for the purpose of being near their partner's job. 19 A study of National Institutes of Health (NIH) intramural postdocs in 2007 found that, while married postdoc men were more likely than women to expect career concessions from their spouse on behalf of the family, postdoc women indicated they were more likely to make such career concessions themselves. 20 As for anyone in a dual-career couple, the logistical challenges of fi nding jobs together are signifi cant, and for postdoc women these family concerns also infl uence their career choices and outcomes. While dual-career assistance from institutions grows in availability, there are few incentives for institutions to extend special recruitment eff orts for contingent hires like postdocs, and special dualhire initiatives at institutions are usually focused at the faculty level. Th e fl ip side of this is that, at least for postdocs partnered with other postdocs, fi nding temporary postdoc funding is often easier than fi nding a permanent faculty position for a partner. For some, the fl exibility of the postdoc position may make it easier to fi nd two jobs together, 21 whereas for others the postdoc's temporary nature may make certain tradeoff s, such as living apart, seem more feasible. NPA ADVANCE focus group participants also brought up the challenge of partners who are professionals but not in academia. Among faculty, approximately a third of both men and women are partnered with someone employed outside of academia. 22 In this case, there are even fewer incentives for either employer to help the partner get a job. In one participant's case, she pointed out: Other considerations in career planning for dual-career postdocs are related to the nature of the postdoc position itself. Participants in the NPA ADVANCE focus groups expressed concern about moving their whole family for a postdoc position which was temporary and low paying. For example, one participant said of her own decision process when choosing a postdoc, My husband was making a lot more money than I was making as a postdoc, and we had a young child while I was doing my postdoc. And so it just didn't make any sense for me, for practical reasons and fi nancial reasons, to kind of venture out. \u2026and with the postdoc current NIH pay scales it's just impossible for a female postdoc to take a stand saying that, no, I want to run the family and let's move and do what I want to do. Th ese types of fi nancial tradeoff s, where a female postdoc chooses not to prioritize her own career over her partner's, may be common for postdoc women partnered with male academics given that for the average academic couple, men tend to be older and more advanced in their careers than their partners, and men are more likely than women to prioritize their own career, particularly when they are the higher earners. 23"}, {"section_title": "Children", "text": "Another dimension of family formation is the introduction of children, which appears to play an even larger role than partnering in the careers of postdoc women. In order to look at the reasons cited by postdoc women for changing their career goal away from academia, a 2009 study by Goulden, Frasch and Mason 24 surveyed postdocs in the University of California system. Consistent with other studies, 25 most postdocs initially had the goal of becoming a professor with a research emphasis-typically the tenure-track faculty position-upon starting their postdoc position. Th e study found however that the fraction of both men and women who had this career goal dropped over the course of their postdoc, with the drop being more pronounced for women. An examination of the factors infl uencing this decision revealed some strong trends with gender. Both men and women were concerned about the career advancement aspects (e.g. salary, security, promotion) in academia, but the top factor for women was issues related to children while for men it was concern about compensation. Additional disaggregation revealed that postdoc women with children were more likely to change their goal away from professor with a research emphasis than postdoc men with children or postdoc men and women without children. Of signifi cance, women who had had children since starting their postdoc were twice as likely to make this change of career goal as men who had had children during their postdoc and as women who had no children or plans to have children. Overall, these studies suggest that issues related to children play an important role in postdoc women's choices to leave academia and that actual experience with having children during the postdoc may have an even greater impact. Given the coincidence of childbearing years with the postdoc, the timing of these events is a considerable source of stress for postdoc women. While there is no set number for the years one should be a postdoc, the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) has long recommended a maximum term limit of fi ve years on postdoctoral positions-not counting family leave time-in order to encourage postdocs' transition to independence, 26 and many institutions have adopted this recommendation. Nevertheless, the actual total length of the postdoctoral experience varies widely, with the typical individual appointment lasting two years. 27 Family planning therefore can be a challenge on such short timescales. Th e conundrum of the \"ideal\" duration of the postdoc is that it should be long enough for a postdoc to accomplish enough to obtain the next position but short enough so that there are no concerns about the postdoc's lack of advancement to the next position. Many NPA ADVANCE focus group participants had a sense of what was \"too long\" and commented on how they had been postdocs for longer than they had intended, in some cases explicitly because of their children. Other participants expressed anxiety over aligning their family planning with their postdoc timing. One participant captured this by saying, Being a postdoc for too long or experiencing career delays can have far reaching eff ects for the early-career researcher. Postdocs funded on grants and fellowships have a certain time-limited period of funding that typically has no guarantee of an extension. Moreover, a perception of lack of research productivity during a grant-funded project can infl uence future funding prospects. Delays can also aff ect a postdoc's eligibility for funding designated as early-career and can be diffi cult to explain on a curriculum vitae."}, {"section_title": "Limited Access to Family-Friendly Benefi ts", "text": "Th e Goulden study 28 results suggest that actual experience with having children and balancing family and career plays an important role in the career decisions for these women. Th e limited family-friendly benefi ts available to postdocs may be a contributing factor. For example, a minority of research institutions off ers guaranteed paid maternity leave to postdoc women. Th e Goulden study also found that of the Association of American Universities (AAU) universities, which include the 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada, only 23% off ered postdocs baseline, guaranteed paid maternity leave without restrictions. 29 An even smaller fraction off ers more general parental leave for either parent. 30 A recent 2011 survey of NPA member institutions 31 found that while a majority of the 74 responding institutions off ered all their postdocs family health insurance (76%), paid time off (68%), and unpaid maternity leave (55%), fewer than half of institutions off ered all postdocs paid maternity leave (outside of sick/vacation leave or disability insurance; 40%), paid paternity leave (28%), unpaid paternity leave (49%) or subsidized child-care costs (12%). Moreover, in all cases, postdocs who were not classifi ed as employees were less likely to have each of these benefi ts and were less likely to have benefi ts that were comparable to those provided to non-postdoc, non-supervisory employees at the same institution. Th ese discrepancies across postdoc classifi cations were also highlighted by the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) in its report from the taskforce on trainee family benefi ts. 32 Even federal laws like the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides for unpaid leave for the purpose of dependent care such as child birth, adoption or family illness, has eligibility limitations that disadvantage short-term workers like postdocs, requiring participants to be employees and to have worked at the institution for at least a year. Postdoc access to family-friendly benefi ts varies widely across and within institutions, since that access typically depends upon a postdoc's source of funding and institutionally-based employment classifi cation. In addition, those without formal benefi ts like parental leave will have to negotiate any leave on a case-by-case basis, which leaves signifi cant room for unequal treatment."}, {"section_title": "Low Salaries and Childcare", "text": "For a working postdoc, an important dimension of having small children is the aff ordability of childcare. Th roughout the NPA ADVANCE focus groups, participants mentioned salary and fi nances as important secondary issues, primarily when discussing the aff ordability of childcare and other family expenses like mortgages as well as when assigning value to the postdoc over other family career choices. Virtually every time that childcare came up during the discussion, the expense of it was also mentioned. Th ese comments are unsurprising when looking at the average monthly cost of childcare, which for postdocs in the Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey was higher than their monthly housing cost. 33 Moreover, compared to postdoc men, postdoc women on average pay almost twice as much each month in childcare 34 and are less likely to have family-based childcare or aftercare available to them. 35 Focus group participants' concerns about salary contrast with the fi nding from the Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey that low salaries showed no correlation with lower satisfaction or success for postdocs. 36"}, {"section_title": "Isolation", "text": "Another characteristic of the postdoc position is its isolation compared to students and faculty at research institutions. As trainees primarily hired to work on a specifi c, time-delineated project, postdocs typically are more closely affi liated with their postdoctoral supervisor (often the principal investigator, or PI, on the grant funding their project) than with their department or institution. Th is strong reliance upon the workgroup, lab or supervisor often results in isolating postdocs from the rest of the institutional community, especially given that the number of postdocs in a given workgroup is usually small. Th is relative isolation is one of the reasons postdocs long have been termed the \"invisible university.\" 37 Th ese feelings of isolation or alienation are experienced by both postdoc men and women and have been cited by both as reasons for changing their career goal away from research-focused professor, but this factor was more signifi cant for women. 38 When discussing the isolation of the postdoctoral appointment, NPA ADVANCE focus group participants described it as being \"in limbo\" or a \"grey area,\" primarily stemming from a perceived lack of status at their institution. One participant described it like so: Being neither student nor faculty, some participants felt less supported by the institution, as well as uncertain about how they were perceived or even how they should perceive themselves. Another participant wondered, \"Should we be acting more like graduate students or are we closer to faculty members ... sort of, which lunch table to sit at when you walk into the cafeteria?\" A complementary dimension to this isolation was felt by some focus group participants who had children and felt that they couldn't commit the same number of hours to work as those without children, so felt they couldn't be as \"visible\" or \"aggressive.\" As one participant described her experience, \"I felt abandoned during my postdoctoral years, especially when raising kids . . . I was feeling very, very isolated.\""}, {"section_title": "Lack of Confi dence", "text": "Postdoc women may also suff er from a lack of confi dence in their abilities. Some NPA ADVANCE focus group participants felt that their uncertainties in their status at their institutions engendered confi dence issues, for example, being concerned about how their work was perceived by senior colleagues or being uncertain even how to introduce one's self in a meeting. Th ese fears of not being \"good enough\" despite appropriate preparation may refl ect a case of the imposter syndrome, 39 which for example has been found among both men and women graduate students in astronomy, but with greater prevalence in women. 40 A key fi nding of the Martinez study 41 of biomedical postdocs was that women lacked confi dence in their abilities to a greater degree than men. For example, the study found that biomedical postdoc women had less confi dence in their ability to obtain a principal investigator position than postdoc men, despite each group indicating that they felt they were qualifi ed for such a position. Compared with male respondents, postdoc women were also less likely to apply again if their fi rst application did not succeed and were less confi dent that, upon obtaining such a tenure-track position, they would achieve tenure."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Mentoring", "text": "Mentoring is a key part of the structured oversight that was found by the Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey to correlate with postdoc success and satisfaction, 42 underscoring its importance in the postdoctoral experience. For postdoc women, however, mentoring is often inadequate. NPA ADVANCE focus group participants reported that, while mentoring was one of the most benefi cial aspects of their postdoctoral training, it was often lacking in their own experience. A study of chemistry postdocs found that postdoc women are more likely than postdoc men to perceive a lack of mentoring. 43 Furthermore, postdoc women have noted that lack of mentorship has played a part in their decisions to leave the academic pipeline. 44 A limited mentoring model may contribute to the perception of a lack of mentoring. A postdoc's supervisor is commonly her primary, and sometimes only, mentor. 45 NPA ADVANCE focus group participants typically used the words PI, supervisor, and mentor almost interchangeably when discussing their postdoctoral supervisor, independent of the amount of mentoring that was actually taking place, suggesting that postdoctoral supervisors essentially become the de facto mentor. Th is role has long been considered fundamental for the supervisor as he or she shepherds a postdoc's research and helps her prepare for her next career steps. Th ere may be some areas, however, where a postdoc could benefi t from complementary perspectives and information. Best practices today in mentoring recommend multiple mentors that can provide the variety of professional and psychosocial advice needed by the mentee and note that this is particularly important for women. 46 With the growing diversity of the postdocs and their career needs, a circle of mentors can provide broader support as well as minimize possible confl icts of interest in certain arenas. While mentoring from a postdoctoral supervisor is an important part of the postdoctoral experience, postdoc women need to be encouraged to expand their network of mentors. (See the chapter on mentoring for more information.) Regardless of access to eff ective mentors, postdocs can be reluctant to participate in designated mentoring activities. Like most academics, postdocs report working long hours, and most of this time is dedicated to research. 47 Based on the NPA's experience, postdocs can be reluctant to spend work time on activities outside of the lab or offi ce, even training activities, because the unspoken expectation is that they should focus their eff orts on research to the exclusion of other activities, despite the potential career benefi ts. Th is expectation has been a particular concern for postdocs funded on NIH R01 grants, since their grant eff ort reporting often requires 100% of their time assigned to research. Th is concern has eased in recent years, since the NIH acknowledged in 2007 that mentoring, for example, is often indistinguishable from research and therefore allowable as part of research eff ort reporting. 48 Nevertheless, for most postdocs, mentoring and other professional development are not considered core research activities and therefore continue to take low priority. For example, some NPA ADVANCE focus group participants indicated they were less likely to participate in mentoring or grant writing programs because they took time away from research, in spite of the fact that they highly valued such programs."}, {"section_title": "Other Factors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Defi ciencies in Professional Record", "text": "In addition to family formation, isolation, and mentoring concerns, which may impact both women's ability to persist in their current academic position as well as their choice to apply for the next academic position, there is also evidence that some postdoc women face additional obstacles in obtaining that next position. Th e Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey fi ndings include evidence that women have lower levels of subjective success and fewer publications than men, 49 consistent with other studies. 50 Findings about unconscious bias in the writing and evaluation of letters of recommendation 51 may also hinder these women's career prospects given the importance of such recommendations in the job selection process. Another important part of a researcher's marketability stems from their visibility within their community, often leveraged by giving talks at meetings. Mason and Goulden, however, found that postdoc women who were married with children tended to spend less time in the lab or offi ce and to attend fewer conferences. 52"}, {"section_title": "Implicit Gender Bias", "text": "Another leading factor in women's persistence in academic science discussed in the literature is implicit gender bias in the workplace that disadvantages women's advancement. Th ese biases arise when people unconsciously use assumptions about sex diff erences in their evaluation of the world (called gender schemas by Virginia Valian's widely-cited work on this subject 53 ). In academia, these gender biases have been shown to infl uence hiring, 54 promotion, resource allocation, and other peer reviewed processes, such as journal and grant review, 55 as well as infl uence institutional policymaking, for example, with a bias against caregiving for both women and men. 56 An important aspect of these biases is that they are typically unconscious, but unexamined, ways of viewing the world as opposed to overt or intentional discrimination. Th eir infl uence, however, can be far-reaching and creates an institutional environment that does not provide equal opportunity for women to succeed, often called a \"chilly climate.\" It has been argued that institutions have made considerable strides on these issues in recent years, with the advent of federally funded interventions such as NSF's ADVANCE institutional transformation awards 57 in addition to local institutional eff orts such as that at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 58 Th e National Academies' Gender Diff erences study 59 found no evidence of bias against women once they were in the applicant pool for faculty positions at the top research institutions. Another recent meta-analysis of the evidence for unconscious bias suggests that the situation has so greatly improved that institutions should focus their attentions instead on promoting a family-friendly work environment, 60 although another more recent study in 2012 demonstrates that gender bias is still a factor in the evaluation, hiring and mentoring of early-career women in academic science. 61 Th ese studies suggest that things have improved but that there is still considerable work left to do, particularly at the early-career stages."}, {"section_title": "Additional Concerns for International and URM Postdocs", "text": "International postdocs and postdocs who are underrepresented minorities (URM) face these same challenges and in some cases, to a greater degree. For example, postdoc women from underrepresented groups will experience an additional degree of isolation due to their small numbers, creating a greater need for mentorship and role models. While there are no empirical studies of postdoc women of color, 62 there are some trends from studies of students and early-career women that may inform thinking about the postdoc stage. Maria Ong and collaborators, in a review of the empirical literature on women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), fi nd several factors that infl uence these women's advancement. 63 For students, these include the diffi culties of transitioning between academic stages, such as from college to graduate school, and transitioning from minority serving institutions to primarily white institutions. Another critical factor is the social climate of an institution such as issues with isolation and tokenism, diffi culty navigating informal processes, and learning institutional culture, all of which infl uence a woman's retention in STEM. In addition to these features of the training environment, women of color still face issues of racial stereotypes and cultural or racial discrimination in hiring and promotional decisions. All of these may play a role in the transition of postdoc women of color into the professoriate. For additional discussion, see the commentary by Anderson-Th ompkins and Stroman. International postdoc women also experience additional challenges. In contrast to the small numbers of URM postdocs, international postdocs are the largest group in the U.S. postdoc population, and yet these individuals can be isolated from their cohort in terms of their cultural background and experience. International postdoc women may face heightened family-related geographical constraints relative to domestic postdocs, since international women's partners or extended family may be abroad, possibly requiring a return to their home country. As one participant commented, the primary career constraint she had experienced was whether or not \"family demands (old parents, sick parents etc.) will interrupt or infl uence your decision to stay in the [United States].\" Foreign postdoc women therefore face the same concerns as domestic women, but, in some cases, these concerns are amplifi ed. International postdocs also encounter visa-related issues. Th e short-term nature of the visa can make long-term career and family planning a challenge, as can lengthy and unpredictable visa processing procedures. Th ese vagaries can create additional constraints on postdoc career mobility, for example, needing to stay in place during permanent residency processing, being limited to certain types of jobs on a given visa, or having a job search cut short due to visa expiration. Such restrictions can compound the mobility limitations on partnered postdocs who may already have geographic constraints due to their partner's job. One participant said: Why I took the job was basically, I am married with a husband and he has a very good job. And this was the only postdoctoral position here at the time, and I was bound to having an H1 visa somewhere in this area. And that was the main reason I took the job, because nobody else would hire me as a foreigner. An additional complication for some partnered postdocs is that the associated visas for spouses may not permit their holders to work in the United States. Th e two most common types of visas among postdocs are the H1-B and the J-1, and each have an associated dependent visa that allows the postdoc to sponsor eligible spouses and dependents to enter the country, the H-4 and J-2, respectively. Th e H-4, however, does not allow its holder to work, whereas the J-2 does in most cases. "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Overall, postdoc women face a range of challenges as they navigate the academic career pipeline. Chief among these are challenges related to family formation and having children, as well as isolation, low self-confi dence, and a lack of mentoring and encouragement. Many of these are common challenges for professional women while some are unique to the postdoctoral appointment. Th e structure of the postdoctoral position adds its own complications, such as the short tenure of the postdoc that makes family planning diffi cult, dual-career job constraints with little assistance from institutions, limited family-friendly benefi ts, low salaries, a reluctance to participate in non-research activities, and a limited mentoring model. Th e following chapters will look at the ways in which robust postdoctoral policies and practices can help ameliorate some of these challenges. Ibid. 2011 NPA Institutional Survey Pilot http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/images/stories/Documents/Other/npa-survey-report-april-2012.pdf (accessed December 1, 2012) A partnership of 119 federally-funded institutions and 10 federal agencies, the FDP examined the availability of these benefi ts for graduate students and postdocs as well as the mechanisms used by institutions to provide them. Th e report fi nds that there can be large discrepancies between postdocs at the same institution based on their source of funding, and that part of this discrepancy stems from a requirement of OMB Circular A-21 to treat those within a certain employment class the same. Since some postdocs, for example, NRSA fellows, cannot be considered employees, they necessitate a separate classifi cation from employees and therefore allow the possibility of diff erent benefi ts between classifi cations.  3 Facing similar obstacles of majority females, women of color postdoctoral scholars have challenges that limit their educational and career attainment in the fi elds of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Th ese diffi culties include the absence of mentoring or support, encountering isolation, gender bias, low salaries, and a lack of work-life balance. More disturbingly, there are several structural features specifi c to the postdoctoral scholar position at research universities with very high research activity (RU/VHs, i.e., Carnegie Foundation's updated categorization of Research I institutions) that make these challenges even more diffi cult to navigate for women of color such as the lack of positional status within the institution, duration of postdoctoral scholar training, temporary nature of postdoctoral scholar positions, and racial bias and discrimination in the postdoctoral hiring process. It is imperative that major research universities continue to support and promote women of color postdoctoral scholars through innovative strategies and the execution of best practices in postdoctoral education. Various public and private sector reports, policymakers, and national business, education, political, and science leaders have expressed the importance of the United States increasing its production of researchers and workers skilled in STEM to remain competitive in the global economy. According to the CIA World Factbook, America is currently ranked 7th in literacy, 27th in math, and 22nd in science. It is evident that now is the time for intervention and reform in our educational strategies to compete and off er solutions to the world's problems. Th e STEM fi elds are critical to America's stability and additionally often off er prestige and very attractive remuneration.\nRecent advancements in postdoctoral policies and services, largely spearheaded by the rapid increase in the number of postdoctoral offi ces, have greatly improved the postdoctoral experiences at many institutions. Th ese successes underscore the importance of the institution in further enhancing the conditions of appointment for postdoc women. Institutions should consult the NPA's recommended practices as a baseline for their postdoctoral services. Additional consideration should be given to family-friendly policies for postdocs, such as parental leave, Title IX compliance on pregnancy discrimination, fl exible work schedules, dependent health coverage and pre-tax fl exible spending accounts that can be used for health or dependent care. In addition, institutions should consider off ering assistance such as childcare subsidies and dual-career accommodation assistance. Postdoctoral supervisors can also benefi t from support in their mentoring activities (a topic discussed further in Chapter 3), performance evaluations, and clear guidance on postdoctoral policies and procedures for accommodating their postdocs' pregnancy and family leave. Finally, the institution as a whole can support postdocs by explicitly including them in any assessments of climate and federal compliance, as well as in leadership training for institutional management. Institutions set local personnel policy and so would benefi t from additional attention to the ways in which postdocs can be treated equitably as a class and yet still comply with the panoply of regula- Women now represent a large part of the talent pool for research science, but many data sources indicate that they are more likely than men to \"leak\" out of the pipeline in the sciences before obtaining tenure at a college or university. 1 Here at the University of California at Berkeley, our national study of the dropout rates of women in the sciences, based on NSF's Survey of Doctorate recipients, shows that family formationmost importantly marriage and childbirth-account for the largest leaks in the pipeline between Ph.D. receipt and the acquisition of tenure for women in the sciences. Specifi cally, women who are married with children in the sciences are 35 percent less likely to enter a tenure track position after receipt of their Ph.D. than married men with children, and they are 27 percent less likely than their male counterparts to achieve tenure upon entering a tenure-track job. Most of this dropout occurs before attaining a tenure track job. It is the young women scholars, the graduate students and particularly postdoctoral fellows who decide to change their career direction based on family concerns. 2 It is imperative that we keep our talented young scholars in the pipeline. It is a great loss of talent and investment when a young scholar diverts from his or her career path. A mass of bureaucratic and regulatory blockages must be pushed through in order to achieve a fl exible workplace in which having both a family and a career is possible. A critical block is that while federal agencies largely fi nance the graduate students, postdocs, and faculty members who create new scientifi c breakthroughs, it is universities that determine personnel issues. For instance, the National Institutes of Health off ers a generous eight weeks of paid leave to postdoctoral fellows who receive the National Research Service Award. However, recipients may take that paid leave only \"when those in comparable training positions at the grantee organization have access to this level of paid leave.\" In other words, every postdoc at that university must also be eligible for eight weeks of paid leave-an unlikely circumstance for postdocs who are supported by a wide variety of sources.\nMentoring is the cornerstone of the postdoctoral experience and as such should not be the sole responsibility of the postdoctoral supervisor. Eff ective postdoctoral mentors should take advantage of any institutional resources available for postdocs as well as foster other avenues for postdocs to identify complementary sources of mentorship and role modeling. Formal mentoring programs and tools can catalyze some of these relationships as well as broaden the circle of mentoring for postdocs. A number of models for these programs exist, from one-on-one mentoring and mentoring orientation activities to group-based mentoring with a committee of mentees or of mentors and peer mentoring. Other tools and resources can help provide structure for mentoring, such as mentoring plans. Importantly, institutions should also support the needs of the mentors through training in eff ective mentoring techniques, particularly where mentors are overseeing a diverse group of postdocs. Above all institutions must treat and reward mentoring as a core part of research.\nPostdocs receive considerable professional development through the course of their postdoctoral research, but every individual postdoc will need to conduct a self-assessment to understand their areas for potential improvement. Institutions can help postdocs, and postdoc women in particular, build their professional record through the provision of resources and programming that strengthens their skills and broadens their career potential. Institutions can establish a framework for further professional training through the use of postdoctoral training curricula and tools like the NPA core competencies. Postdocs may benefi t from other development sources such as networking within the postdoctoral community, which can mitigate postdoc isolation as well as further their professional careers. Postdocs can also benefi t from access to career development tools, such as thoughtful career planning, access to institutional career counseling and other services, as well as programs that provide insight into the faculty search process. Th e postdoctoral position is a career stage that allows opportunity for incredible scientifi c discovery while also maximizing an individual's preparation for the next career step.\nTh e postdoc is an important career juncture for retention of women as academic career professionals. It becomes increasingly common for recent Ph.D.s to do at least one postdoc, and the total number of postdocs working in the United States at any given time is also increasing, while the number of tenure-track faculty positions has not increased correspondently. Th e coincidence of the postdoc years with the years of family formation for many postdocs means that postdocs are taking steps like partnering, having children, and buying houses with little fi nancial or career stability and limited employment benefi ts. Th ese factors play a signifi cant role in the continuation of postdoc women in this career path."}, {"section_title": "Before the Postdoc", "text": "Not surprisingly, many racial and ethnic underrepresented students matriculate to college with a genuine interest and intention to pursue STEM majors and biomedical research. Th ey are fi lled with hope and dreams as undergraduates ready to learn and apply the necessary competencies and skills to change the world. Th e fact that many of their classmates at RU/VHs do not look like them or share the same cultural experiences is not a signifi cant obstacle to overcome. Most underrepresented minorities readily adapt to their environment and even increase their desire to succeed in the STEM courses. Students of color have prior experiences that have prepared them to accept challenges and to be prepared for situations where they face being the \"only one\" in the classroom. However, by their senior year (similar to their majority peers) most have changed their majors to a non-STEM curriculum. What happened to the students of color who were so excited about a STEM career? Did they fi nd the curriculum too diffi cult? No. In fact, research clearly states that in most cases there are intervening factors that deter outstanding students of color from academic success at predominately white institutions. Th ese dynamics include a lack of faculty of color, academic support systems, access to resources, and mentoring. When one considers the journey of women of color students interested in STEM, this plight can be even more overwhelming. Far too many of these students, during their fi rst and second year of taking STEM courses, encounter unnecessary challenges whereby they lose confi dence in their abilities. Few faculty or administrators are there to identify their struggle and off er another plan of action to achieve success. (Quite possibly, there is a need for more empirical research and assessment of the pedagogical models used to instruct minorities and underrepresented ethnicities in STEM.) Th is woeful situation is far too common at our major research institutions. According to Palmer, Maramba and Gasman, 1 Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) have shown effi cacy in facilitating the success of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM and are collectively responsible for producing nearly one-third of the nation's minority STEM graduates. In Fostering Success of Racial and Ethnic Minorities in STEM, 2 the authors share salient institutional characteristics and unique aspects of climate, pedagogy, and programmatic initiatives at MSIs that are instrumental in enhancing the success of racial and ethnic minority students in STEM education. Can the nation aff ord to rely solely on the MSIs to support and nurture the STEM pipeline of students of color? Given the rapidly increasing underrepresented minority population in the United States, it is critical that higher education policies, pedagogies, climates, and initiatives are effi cient and eff ective in promoting racial and ethnic minority scholars' educational and career attainment in STEM. Otherwise, the very limited current pool of women of color STEM graduates at RU/VHs will shrink further and lessen the country's ability to be competitive."}, {"section_title": "The Juncture of the Postdoc", "text": "It is laudable that women of color do rise above the undergraduate challenges as STEM graduates and continue on to achieve their master's and doctorate STEM degrees. Choosing to stay in academia, these determined women are again full of hope as they consider postdoctoral positions at RU/VHs. However, it is critical that women of color choose and approve their postdoctoral appointments, their mentors, and their research projects wisely. Th e hope is that there will be resources and signifi cant advantages to completing additional research, demonstrating competence and collegiality, and making contacts within their departments and disciplines that will ultimately lead to a potential job. Still, the complex challenges associated with race, ethnicity, and gender are made even more clear and magnifi ed at this critical juncture. Th e isolation is extreme and can become an overpowering barrier that derails a promising career. Malcolm, Hall & Brown 3 refer to this phenomena as \"the double bind,\" the intersectionality of gender, race and ethnicity which interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels, contributing to systematic social inequality. 4 Th e scholars and the institutions both suff er from this disturbing cycle of engagement and discouragement. Typically, the interest in women of color postdoctoral scholar rests solely with the postdoctoral offi ce on campus. To address the sense of isolation and lack of support, it is strongly suggested that the postdoctoral scholar maintain consistent communication with this dedicated staff . Th e postdoctoral offi ce can also serve to complement or initiate the necessary training women of color need to navigate the demands and rigor of the academy. As a \"guest\" in a faculty member's lab or an academic department dominated by white males, there is a strong probability that the woman of color postdoctoral scholar will not receive all the attention and support that her male counterparts would garner. To avoid and reduce unnecessary stress, the postdoctoral offi ce should off er seminars and programs for women of color to facilitate mentoring, research strategies, and special topics of interest such as work-life balance, getting the mentoring you need, cultivating relationships with potential sponsors and collaborators, or navigating the academy as the \"only one.\" It is important that the scholar stays committed to her career goals and actively participates in professional development seminars and programs when possible. Th e postdoctoral offi ce can be instrumental in establishing unique and customized support for women of color to ensure their professional and research success. Th is offi ce has both structural and program design to assist the postdoctoral scholar in all stages of her development. Recognizing the importance of partnership, the committed staff will make connections with the offi ces of equal opportunity, human resources, multicultural and diversity aff airs, student aff airs, international center, and women's center to gain insight, feedback, and opportunities to share best practices. Regardless of the resources available though, postdoctoral scholar women of color may have a more diffi cult time fi nding role models and mentors, especially at RU/VHs. Th ere are fewer faculty of color to possibly network with and share interests. Also, the duration of the postdoctoral appointment does not lend itself to the participation in many activities outside of research to meet majority or underrepresented minority faculty. However, the importance of cultivating relationships with several faculty mentors, especially connecting with senior faculty, cannot be understated for women of color postdoctoral scholars. Further, cross-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary relationships may prove to be instrumental in collaborative research and the identifi cation of possible mentors and sponsors. Th ough many institutions understand and articulate the benefi ts of diversity, clearly there is a need for greater support and mentoring at RH/VUs to encourage both participation and achievement by racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral women in STEM. Having multiple mentors and sponsors can assist the postdoctoral scholar in the understanding of the nuances of success and the best timeline for the completion of the necessary milestones. Progress in retaining women of color has been easier to accomplish in certain academic fi elds, yet the STEM areas lag behind. Th ere have been a few positive changes in diversifying the pipeline of students into the STEM fi elds at RU/VHs; however, this advancement has not translated into satisfactory diversifi cation at the postdoctoral or faculty level, which is imperative to increase the diversity of the STEM workforce. In order to achieve this signifi cant feat, exacting steps need to be taken to ensure that an attractive and supportive pathway is created for women of color to progress through undergraduate programs into graduate programs through a postdoctoral scholar appointment and into a tenured faculty position. Still, \"the postdoc\" is a tenuous bridge between graduate education and faculty, whereby we lose talented women of color. Major research universities need to reexamine their postdoctoral hiring policies and practices. Unlike formal admission policies that promote and foster student diversity, the institutional reliance on informal networks or relaxed procedures that bypass equal opportunity employment requirements often leads to racial bias and discrimination and the exclusion of women of color at this critical period. Ong's recommendations 5 provide a foundation to support the promotion and retention of women of color in STEM: Promote undergraduate research opportunities for women of color in STEM. Many undergraduate research programs are available to nurture and motivate young students to explore STEM without a major commitment. Many institutions implement these research opportunities within their senior honors curriculum or formal institutes. In addition, these offi ces and programs are wonderful resources for postdoctoral scholars to mentor young people and obtain their own research assistants. Identify graduate and postdoctoral scholar fellowships in STEM where women of color are most underrepresented such as physics, astronomy, computer science, and some areas of engineering. Attend workshops and conferences for critical stakeholders (i.e., professional societies, university deans and department chairs in STEM, honor societies) to discuss preparation of underrepresented women in STEM. Off er professional development programs for women of color on their writing and publishing, as well as grant money and protected time for faculty to work on scholarship. Th e doctoral experience varies for each scholar. Many are fortunate to work with dissertation advisors who are extremely gifted at writing. Others may have an advisor that is a better researcher or presenter. It is important that postdoctoral scholars assess their strengths and align themselves with the necessary persons and resources to overcome areas of weakness. Off er skill-building seminars on interviewing, salary negotiation, and proposal submission. Th ese skills would help women successfully navigate the fi nancial puzzle and instill confi dence in their performance review meetings. Off er leadership and career development workshops for women of color in STEM. We fi nd that these seminars are most eff ective when facilitated by women of color in STEM at RU/VH institutions. In addition to these recommendations, women of color postdoctoral scholars should adopt an entrepreneurial mindset of responsibility. Th e postdoctoral scholar must fully grasp the importance of developing a roadmap of success, identifying and contacting research partners, networking, and communication early and often with mentors and the postdoctoral offi ce. Th is entrepreneurial attitude may be the diff erence in their exposure on campus to potential mentors and sponsors and their receiving a faculty appointment off er. Institutions must also be mindful of abstract or ambiguous meanings when articulating affi rmative action strategies to assist the postdoctoral offi ce. Undoubtedly, a university can best achieve its mission if the student, faculty, and staff community is diverse. Historically, this eff ort on college campuses focused on American diversity and domestic-minority underrepresented groups. It is apparent that the diversity defi nition has since been redefi ned and expanded to include many types of people such as religion, language, and international affi liation. Senior administrators must be clear on their characterization and support of those who continue to receive little support in their attempt to become postdoctoral scholars and faculty members. In addition, their positional power requires them to take the lead in directing a collective reinforcement of those STEM postdoctoral scholars and anyone (formal or informal) working towards their success. With this clarity of nomenclature and mandate from senior administrators, the women of color (and their unique and remarkable journey) will not be overlooked in this noble quest to fulfi ll the diversity objective. In summary, research universities must enhance the understanding of the impact of intersectionality on the STEM careers of women of color through program evaluation and empirical research on their experiences. Women of color face daunting challenges such as isolation, unconscious bias, absence of underrepresented faculty as mentors and role models, and inadequate academic or insuffi cient social support at each stage of their academic careers. Th us, it is imperative that institutions examine closely the transition points between each stage of transition and dedicate resources to \"seal the gaps\"-those critical points where underrepresented STEM researchers often leave the career path or job. At each stage, the importance of oversight, early intervention, mentoring, sponsorship, and academic and social support must be reinforced. "}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Benefi ts and Policies", "text": "Th is chapter discusses institutional practices and policies that promote the academic career advancement of postdoc women. Research institutions play a vital role in the postdoctoral experience. While an individual postdoc may feel closer ties to an individual project, lab or group, it is the institution that provides the critical infrastructure to facilitate both their research and their conditions of appointment. Moreover, since postdocs are supported by a wide variety of funding sources, including both federal and private, U.S. and non-U.S. based, there are few broad national policies governing postdocs, leaving authority over their appointments primarily with the institutions. As a result there is wide variety in how postdoctoral services and policies are implemented in practice. Th ere are, however, some trends in postdoctoral practices that cut across institutions. Th e Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey sought to identify these trends and found that postdocs with the greatest structured administrative oversight showed the highest levels of subjective success and satisfaction. 1 Th e components of this structured oversight are some combination of recommended institutional practices, such as the existence of an offi ce of postdoctoral aff airs, postdoctoral policies, letters of appointment, performance evaluations, grievance procedures, and research plans. Changing practices and policies to increase structured oversight has the potential to increase postdoc success overall as well as to address many of the specifi c shortcomings discussed in the previous chapter."}, {"section_title": "C H A P T E R T W O", "text": "The majority (61%) of academic postdoctoral research is funded by federal agencies. i One of the strengths of the federal role in postdoctoral funding is that the agencies can provide standards for postdoctoral training and compensation. For example, although only a limited number of National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Research Service Award (NRSA) individual fellowships are awarded each year, the NRSA stipend scale has been widely adopted by institutions as a salary guideline for all postdocs, in all disciplines. ii Many institutions set a minimum stipend based on the NRSA minimum, and some institutions even adopt the experience-based stipend tiers of the NRSA scale as well. In this way, NIH has had enormous infl uence on the postdoctoral training experience, even for those outside the biomedical sciences. In recent years, a new wave of family-friendly policies has been championed by NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the primary funders of postdocs. The NIH has established expanded family leave policy for NRSA fellows, providing clarifi cations about dependent care benefi ts on grants, supplements to support technical assistance during the absence of key personnel, and no-cost extensions for reasons such as family-related absences of key personnel. The NSF established the Career-Life Balance initiative, announced in 2011, that has many of the same policies. iii The June 2012 report by the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group may further impact family-friendly policies. One of the recommendations was that the \"NIH should require and adjust its own policies so that all NIH-supported postdoctoral researchers on any form of support (training grants, fellowships or research project grants) receive benefi ts that are comparable to other employees at the institution. Such benefi ts include paid time off, health insurance, retirement plans, maternity leave etc.\" iv This report was followed by the development of implementation plans for many of the recommendations, including specifi c steps towards policies that support comparable benefi ts. v The impact of the working group's report remains to be seen. Hopefully, this NIH effort will foster increased establishment of institutional family-friendly policies as well as other policies that will benefi t not only NIH-funded postdocs but all postdocs across all sources of funding. According to a survey conducted by Marc Goulden, Karie Frasch, and Mary Ann Mason, vi other federal agencies that support postdocs are signifi cantly more limited in their explicit familyfriendly benefi ts than the NIH and NSF and, in most cases only offer no-cost extensions.

Where possible, institutions should establish family-friendly benefi ts for all of their postdocs, ensuring that postdocs with diff erent sources of funding have equitable benefi ts. Some challenges for establishing uniform benefi ts are the variety of funding sources that will have multiple guidelines and policies. Institutions are encouraged to seek out creative solutions within their own personnel structure to standardize benefi ts across these classes, which in some cases may require additional funding to supplement non-employee benefi ts. A similar recommendation comes from the recent report on research trainee family benefi ts from the Federal Demonstration Partnership. 3 Some institutions have designated separate postdoctoral classifi cations for both employee and non-employee postdocs in order to standardize their benefi ts, for example, the University of Pennsylvania has three payroll classes of postdoctoral trainees that depend upon funding source. 4 An advantage of this standardization is that postdocs may seek out prestigious individual fellowships to support their research without fear of losing benefi ts by switching between classifi cations. NPA ADVANCE expanded recommendations for family-friendly policies are: Provide clear guidance on family-friendly policies and practices in order to avoid case-by-case implementation, especially where there are diff erences by postdoc funding source. Th is guidance should include basic policies such as sick or annual leave, as well as paid and unpaid parental leave and fl exible work schedules. A particular advantage of written policies and guidelines on these topics, particularly for family-related leave, is that it provides a formal framework for discussions between postdocs and their supervisors."}, {"section_title": "Provide baseline paid parental leave provisions for all postdocs for the birth or adoption of a child.", "text": "Th e policy for maternity leave should ideally provide for a guaranteed minimum of six weeks, independent of leave accruals or time in service to the institution. Provide a provision for unpaid family leave for those postdocs who may not be covered by FMLA and may require leave beyond that provided by available paid benefi ts. In particular, institutions receiving federal funding should ensure their compliance with Title IX's provisions on pregnancy discrimination, which requires that students and employees, at a minimum, be allowed an unpaid, job-protected leave of absence for a \"reasonable period\" if no other pregnancy-leave benefi t is available. 5 Work pro-actively with the institution's Title IX offi ce to ensure compliance regarding pregnancy protections for postdocs. In particular, examine maternity leave off erings, pregnancy safety protocols, and accountability for equal treatment of pregnant postdocs. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a law that has long been applied primarily to women's sports but also has provisions protecting against pregnancy discrimination for students and employees of federally-funded institutions. The law says that pregnancy must be treated as any other temporary disability and requires that institutions allow unpaid pregnancy leave for those students and employees without an applicable leave policy and for employees without suffi cient leave accrued. The duration of such leave, however, is not specifi ed for either group, calling for \"a reasonable period of time\" for employees and for \"as long as is deemed medically necessary\" for students. i While discussions continue regarding whether postdocs are more like students or employees under the law, ii both groups are protected from pregnancy discrimination under Title IX. According to an analysis by Marc Goulden, Karie Frasch, and Mary Ann Mason, this therefore suggests that postdocs should also be protected by Title IX, iii although this has yet to be tested in court. Nevertheless, federal agencies have begun to conduct compliance audits for the various issues covered by the law. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has begun periodic compliance reviews of its grantees in accordance with the agency's Title IX regulations as well as advice from the General Accounting Offi ce. iv The compliance checks have yielded a number of promising practices the agency has shared v but also underscore the need to ensure postdocs are included, both in the audit process and in an institution's efforts to become compliant."}, {"section_title": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972", "text": "i The section on students for the agencies DOE, NASA, NSF and NIH, for example, can be found in 10 CFR 1040. 43 Ensure that extended family leave or leaves of absence qualify a postdoc for an extension of her postdoc clock at the institution. As included in the NPA's recommended institutional practices, a postdoc's tenure at an institution should allow for extensions for appropriate circumstances, such as family-related leaves of absence. Inevitably, any extension of the postdoctoral appointment is also dependent upon a postdoc's funding; therefore institutions should aid postdocs and principal investigators to obtain the necessary no-cost extensions on their funding. Ensure any health insurance benefi t includes an aff ordable option for dependent care for all postdocs. Th e most common benefi t available to postdocs is health insurance and typically includes dependent care. Nevertheless, the availability is still not universal, particularly for postdocs on individual fellowships who may not be eligible for the institution's group plan or for postdocs on student health plans that may not have an aff ordable dependent care option. Consider establishing formal fl exible work arrangements or part-time appointments. Establishing a guideline or policy on fl exible work arrangements, such as teleworking, or part-time appointments for postdocs can formalize the terms for such arrangements. Such policies can provide safeguards for the postdoc, the postdoctoral supervisor and the institution against potential misunderstandings or abuses. For example, at Washington University in St Louis, a postdoc can apply for a temporarily reduced schedule for a period not to exceed a year for personal or medical reasons or extenuating circumstances.

Because the deduction is pre-tax it reduces a postdoc's taxable income and for some postdocs, may off er greater federal tax benefi t than the childcare tax credit. For example, the J.

Dean and department chair training often includes gender issues and is generally faculty-focused. Expanding the focus to include postdocs could increase awareness of the issues surrounding the transition from postdoc to faculty. Include postdocs in any institution-wide assessment of climate for women. Recent years have seen a number of such assessments that have provided important data for evidence-based decisionmaking on gender equity at many institutions. Often focusing on faculty and students, such assessments should make a special eff ort to include postdocs as well (as did the seminal report at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999 19 ). Proactively examine and seek clarifi cation of governmental policies and practices at the institution-agency interface for postdocs. Federal agencies, as the primary funders of postdocs, are critical partners for research institutions, particularly since each play a role in setting policies that aff ect postdoc working conditions. For postdocs funded on federal grants, approximately half of postdocs, 20 the Offi ce of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 provides some uniform guidelines for institutions, but the necessarily general nature of these guidelines often leave much open to the interpretation and local implementation of the institution. In addition to these requirements on grantee institutions, there are postdocs funded off of individual fellowships that respond to diff erent guidelines altogether since often the postdoc him or herself typically is the grantee organization in this case. Th e institution carries the responsibility to set local personnel policy that simultaneously adheres to these multiple guidelines. Consider \"permanently\" hiring the institution's postdocs. Th e predominant model of the postdoc position continues to encourage postdocs to move from institution to institution in order to gain scholarly breadth and visibility. Research institutions typically do not hire their own postdocs into permanent jobs; it is slightly more common at government-funded national labs than universities. Hiring these newly trained postdocs would mean that the institution is hiring a \"known quantity,\" individuals who are already familiar with the organizational culture. Moreover, postdocs with families or dual-career concerns are already settled, so require no dual-career considerations or moving costs, and enjoy limited personal disruptions."}, {"section_title": "C O M M E N T A R Y", "text": "Childbirth takes a high toll on the career aspirations of female scientists. In our survey of all University of California postdocs we found that of those who had children while they were postdocs at the University of California, 41 percent indicated that they had shifted their career goals away from becoming a research professor at a university. Focusing on the dropout rates of women in the sciences our Berkeley researchers looked at the 61 members of the Association of American Universities (the top research institutions in the country). We found that only 23 percent of them guaranteed a minimum of six weeks' paid leave for postdocs, and only 13 percent promised the same to graduate students. 3 Postdocs in particular have grant money from many sources and therefore often receive diff erent benefi ts. At one university, a postdoc may receive paid parental leave because he or she is considered an employee, while someone else in the same lab may receive nothing at all, including the right to unpaid leave, if his or her work is paid for from an outside source. Postdocs may not qualify for the national Family Medical Leave Act, which guarantees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth but requires that the employee have been employed for at least a year at the institution. And there are yet diff erent rules dealing with international students. According to the Federal Demonstration Partnership report, of the 48,000 postdoctoral researchers in the United States in 2005, 55 percent were non-U.S. citizens. Th eir status and access to parental and family benefi ts are generally handled diff erently from those of U.S. citizens, and with an alternate cast of offi cials and regulations. Th ose foreign postdocs, if treated well, would be more likely to remain in the United States and become major contributors to our pre-eminence as innovators in science and technology. Th en there are the big discrepancies in providing any kind of family support across the more than a dozen federal agencies that award grants to scientists. Th e NIH and the NSF give the most money and have gone further than other agencies in off ering a variety of family accommodations. Among the top 10 agencies, however, we found that most off er recipients only a no-cost extension of a grant to accommodate childbirth. Two off er nothing at all. In its newly issued report, \"A Forgotten Class of Scientists,\" the Federal Demonstration Partnership 4 and its Task Force on Parental and Family Leave for Research Trainees focus on graduate students and postdocs, the most vulnerable class of scientists, with the fewest benefi ts. Th ese are the young female trainees, in their peak childbearing years, who are most likely to abandon a career in research science when they have a child. Th e partnership, sponsored by the National Academies, is a cooperative project among 10 federal agencies and 119 academic institutions that receive federal research money. Its study looked closely at the diff erent policies pursued by leading granting agencies and at the laws and regulations that bind the organizations. It also examined how several universities interpreted those laws and regulation. What it found was a tangle of rules and policies at diff erent universities. \"Th ere appears to be little collaboration across academic institutions or with federal agencies to make active eff orts to improve the process,\" the report said, \"although many institutions are independently addressing these issues. At the least, this is a case of wasted resources. It creates confusion and multiple interpretations of already complicated policies. For example, although Title IX requires that institutions provide unpaid, job-protected leave to birth mothers 'for a reasonable period of time,' the absence of a formal policy could lead to the institution being in violation of Title IX if a postdoctoral scholar was informally granted less than what could be considered reasonable.\" According to fi ndings from our AAU survey, some universities may not be complying with Title IX, which requires that research universities receiving federal funds (1) treat pregnancy as a temporary disability for purposes of calculating job-related benefi ts, including any employer-provided leave, and (2) provide unpaid, job-protected leave for \"a reasonable period of time\" if the institution does not maintain a leave policy for employees. 5\n\u2022 Will introduce prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to professionals in industry, academia, and other work sectors to further the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's career or knowledge about the specifi c area of concentration; \u2022 Will help prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to become great mentors themselves; \u2022 Are positive role models; and \u2022 Are consistent, honest, and trustworthy. We start from the premise that postdoctoral supervisors assure that their postdocs are mastering the core intellectual and professional skills within their chosen discipline. Most importantly, institutions and postdoc women themselves should not assume that the postdoctoral supervisor should, or will, meet all the mentoring needs of any given individual. In fact, a postdoctoral supervisor's own scientifi c career productivity is directly impacted by the postdoc's work performance, and therefore this interdependence has the potential for confl ict of interest. Th ose who have devoted their careers to studying the principles and practices of eff ective mentoring strongly recommend that mentors are not the direct boss or manager of the person being mentored, regardless of the work sector. 3 Yet, in this context, it is important to note that some postdoctoral supervisors are mentors in the best sense of the word. Th e most prudent course is to acknowledge that not all postdoctoral supervisors can fulfi ll these high expectations, as their own experience, temperament, and perspectives will not likely map to every mentoring need of a postdoc. Hence, it is essential that institutions affi rm the importance, and acceptability, of multiple mentors who can adapt to the needs of a specifi c individual. A postdoc woman at this relatively vulnerable career stage is seeking her own \"best fi t\" for a career that melds her intellectual interests with her own life values. Th e experts who study the theory and practice of eff ective mentoring approaches recommend a \"network of mentors,\" as no one person is likely to meet all of an individual's mentoring needs. 4 It is not likely that formalized institutional frameworks can be developed or adapted to meet all the needs of every postdoc, but institutions can clearly convey the message that the norm should be a panoply of mentors. Eff ective mentoring from a number of mentors can lead postdoc women to take active steps to assess their needs and interests; develop, enhance, and sustain productive interactions with their mentors; and maintain a meaningful life and career in the context of family, culture, and workplace change. 5 Because few will have a perfect pathway to a career or a seamless meshing of career with away-from-work life, the perspectives of others can be particularly helpful in minimizing the inevitable times of discouragement that occur during the postdoctoral period. With honest, respectful, and sensitive guidance gleaned from their own experience, mentors should provide perspectives to help these prot\u00e9g\u00e9s: (1) acquire the appropriate professional credentials, (2) recognize when a rich opportunity arises; (3) learn from mistakes or missteps; (4) deal with biases and misconceptions; (5) develop a sense of their career directions and timing; (6) select appropriate role models; (7) mesh their values and interests with the right workplace; (8) obtain a healthy balance in their lives; (9) create opportunities for others; (10) know when it is time to move on; and (11) stretch beyond their normal comfort zone in taking strategic risks. Th e young scientist, in particular, can learn to balance the diff erent roles that lie ahead in both career and life. Th ese changing needs will infl uence the types of mentoring sought in the framework of long-term strategies for career planning. Mentors can be people who infl uence facets of life and career during interactions that can last a lifetime or just a minute. Organizations should encourage their postdocs to look for mentors who are savvy, consistent, honest, and patient and who can help with personalized mentoring needs. Each element in a successful mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship is a refl ection of the temperament, interests, experience, and perspectives of the individuals involved. Not every encounter with mentors will be uniformly positive. Sometimes a mentor may be distracted by concerns about her/his own life/career and not able to focus on what an individual needs at that particular moment. Institutions can help facilitate an environment in which both mentors and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are expected to recognize some basic premises of good mentoring relationships: \u2022 Being honest with one another; \u2022 Not putting one another in an awkward position; \u2022 Looking for patterns in life and in career; \u2022 Having a sense of humor; \u2022 Recognizing that one's actions, whether good or bad, will often have consequences; and \u2022 Seeking the hidden, unwritten, and inside rules that operate in organizational cultures. Good mentors will ask hard questions of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. In turn, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s should recognize that dedicated mentors will help them uncover critical truths. Th e roles of organizational culture and workplace will also exert an important infl uence on the postdoc's mentoring needs. In some fi elds, and many workplaces, it is likely that females have diff erent expectations about mentoring than males. Of particular note, it is imperative to ensure that careers are not sidetracked when scientists interrupt their careers in order to fulfi ll family obligations. Hence, it becomes critical to seek out and identify mentors who meet the needs of particular circumstances and times and who have knowledge of career tracks that may not be part of the postdoctoral environment. Organizations should remain cognizant that, as with all human relationships, mentoring relationships are not likely to be perfect. Having this awareness can be of great help when it may be time to terminate a specifi c mentoring relationship. Keeping in mind some critical points may make this process easier. On one hand, not all mentor/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships start out positive, or remain a positive interaction. On the other hand, it takes time to develop a strong mentoring relationship between two individuals. Too often, mentors try to set the tone for the mentoring relationship rather than approaching it as a partnership that depends upon eff ective and timely two-way communication. Some general concepts that can work here include being honest, forthrightly confronting the sometimes painful realities; not trying to redesign the past; and following through and closing the loop. Whether a mentoring relationship is part of an institutional program or one that arises independently, establishing expectations early on is essential. Not only will this make the interactions more productive but also will serve to minimize possible misunderstandings. Both the program and individual mentors should mutually set goals with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s for the desired outcomes of the mentoring relationship(s). It is also important to set guidelines for the mentoring process that include, for example, modes of interaction and topics that may be \"off bounds\" during the mentoring experiences. Such guidelines do not have to be rigid but provide a straightforward way to articulate realistic expectations about what is to be encompassed and accomplished. Finally, mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s should determine an interval and mode for contact and interaction that responds to issues of concern and of the mentoring support that is needed."}, {"section_title": "Early Steps at Family-Responsive Policies, Benefi ts, and Resources", "text": "Although much remains to be done, some AAU institutions have put in place family responsive policies, benefi ts, and resources, including time-based policies and benefi ts such as stopping the clock (i.e., tenure-clock extension), various child care supports such as on-and off -campus centers, monetary supplements such as tuition remissions, and other resources such as lactation rooms.

Mentoring has been highlighted in recent years as an important component of the trainee experience and features in the NIH/NSF defi nition of a postdoctoral scholar (emphasis added) 1 : An individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defi ned period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path. Built into the apprenticeship model, mentoring can have signifi cant benefi ts for the mentee's success in his or her current position as well as future career. Th e career benefi ts of mentoring have been widely catalogued in the literature. For scientists, guidance and good mentoring are associated with increased career satisfaction and success. 2 Mentoring can foster professional development, such as improved grant writing success 3 and expanding a mentee's network. 4 In addition to these career building functions, mentoring has a psychosocial function in providing role modeling, personal support and encouragement, 5 which in turn infl uence career choice and decision making. 6 For postdocs, who often feel isolated from the rest of their institution, mentoring can help mitigate these feelings and foster increased engagement. In fact, postdocs often point to mentoring as one of the most useful aspects of the postdoctoral training experience. Mentoring is particularly important for women, who often lack the early-career support and organizational knowledge of their male peers. 7 Yet, trainee women are often less satisfi ed than men with the mentoring they receive, 8 and a lack of mentoring has been noted as a factor in decisions to leave science. 9 As noted earlier, evidence suggests similar trends for postdoc women of color: Strong mentors and role models are lacking, but when available they play an important role in the retention of these women in the science career pipeline. 10 Early-career women and underrepresented minorities are often interested in mentors and role models who are like them 11 but typically have few available among more senior scientists and have limited informal networks through which to fi nd other potential mentors. 12 Women may also benefi t more from mentor-initiated or"}, {"section_title": "C H A P T E R T H R E E", "text": "mutually-initiated mentoring relationships 13 over self-initiated ones, suggesting that mentors may need to play an active role in fostering these relationships."}, {"section_title": "Mentoring postdocs", "text": "Th e postdoc position should be the fi rst step toward independence for the newly minted Ph.D. researcher and usually requires less direct oversight than graduate work. For this reason, some postdocs may have diffi culty recognizing the need for continued mentorship. Th is attitude, when combined with the previously mentioned concerns about mentoring not being a core research activity, can make postdocs reticent to commit time to mentoring. Despite the burgeoning independence of the postdoc, mentoring remains, however, a foundation of postdoctoral training. Postdocs' primary mentoring relationships tend to be with their postdoctoral supervisor, with a majority of postdocs considering their supervisor to be a mentor. 14 In fact, during the NPA ADVANCE focus groups, the term mentor was often used interchangeably with the terms PI, boss, or supervisor. Th e postdoctoral community has struggled with what to call the postdoctoral supervisor, most often using the term PI which is widely used in the numerically dominant biomedical fi elds for the principal investigator on the postdoc's project, whereas the Sigma Xi Postdoc survey elected to use the more discipline-neutral term advisor. Th e variation in terminology refl ects the multiple hats worn by postdoctoral supervisors, which include supervisory functions, like hiring, fi ring, and performance evaluation, as well as advisory functions, like research training, mentorship, and career development. In some cases these functions can come into confl ict, as discussed in the commentary by Donna Dean and Cynthia Simpson, when the best interests of the research do not coincide with the best interests of the postdoc's career. Th is situation can be particularly thorny for international postdocs whose visa status also can depend upon their relationship with their supervisor, creating additional confl icts of interest when postdocs become overly dependent upon the goodwill of one individual. Th us, while postdoctoral supervisors fulfi ll many important roles, including that of mentor, postdocs may also need to seek out multiple mentors to ensure all their mentoring needs are met. International postdocs can have distinct mentoring needs from domestic postdocs as they come to the United States from a range of training backgrounds and research cultures. International postdocs may need guidance on U.S. research norms, funding agencies, and procedures, as well as assistance building up their professional networks in the United States and navigating the immigration process. Mentors, particularly postdoctoral supervisors, can be instrumental in providing these types of support but need not be the only source of information, especially for complicated legal issues like visas. Many institutional resources, such as those provided by an offi ce of international aff airs, can provide complementary support to international postdocs, and mentors should be made cognizant of these available support structures. Like international postdocs, those from underrepresented groups will often work with mentors from a diff erent background or gender. According to some thirty postdocs in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences attending an NPA-organized workshop, 15 that is not always a negative option. Having an eff ective mentor of the same cultural identity is benefi cial but there are at least two other factors to consider: \u2022 A mentor of the same cultural identity may have little resources or power within an institution; if so, the postdoc should seek an additional mentor with those resources and power. \u2022 A mentor who understands and respects a postdoc's personal or social background and the ways in which that background informs the postdoc's research is not always someone who shares the postdoc's ethnic background, as discussed in the commentary by Anderson-Th ompkins and Stroman. For example, for a postdoc married or with children, it may be as benefi cial to have a mentor who is married or with children (or who understands the challenges of balancing career and family needs) as having a mentor from the same ethnic background. Such factors show the value of building a network of multiple mentors."}, {"section_title": "NPA ADVANCE Recommendations", "text": "Institutions can support postdocs and their supervisors by nurturing their communication and mentorship strategies with diverse mentees, while also off ering resources that broaden a postdoc's access to mentors and role models beyond the supervisor. Treat, and reward, mentoring as a \"core\" part of research. An important part of creating a culture of mentoring is establishing meaningful mentoring expectations and incentives at the departmental level. As an integral part of research, eff ective mentoring is often overlooked as an achievement in itself. Institutions can recognize the value of mentoring by taking it into consideration during promotion and tenure considerations alongside research, teaching, and service. Similarly, some institutions have established awards for outstanding postdoctoral mentors, in some cases off ered by the institution (for example, the University of Southern California) and in others organized by the postdoc association (for example, Harvard School of Public Health). Another way to encourage and formalize mentoring is the use of a compact between postdoctoral appointees and their mentors that can lay out some of the responsibilities of both the postdoc and the mentor for their working relationship. A template for this compact was developed by the Association of American Medical Colleges' Group on Graduate Research, Education, and Training (GREAT) 16 and has since been adapted by institutions like University of Michigan Medical School, as a non-binding pledge agreed to by postdocs and their supervisors upon the start of any appointment.\nEstablish a coherent postdoctoral training program or curriculum. By establishing resources or a curriculum for postdoctoral training, an institution provides a framework for the provision of professional development. A coherent program or curriculum establishes standards and guidance for postdocs seeking ways to broaden their professional skills in preparation for the varied needs of the global workforce. For example, while some postdocs may have the opportunity for on-the-job experience writing grant proposals (a little less than half according to Sigma Xi) a formal program on grant writing can broaden their familiarity with a variety of C H A P T E R F O U R funding sources. 7 A formal curriculum can be cited in a postdoc's CV, in some cases off ering a formal certifi cate of completion, as well as formalizing the supervisor's approval of participation. Encourage networking activities for postdocs. Despite the importance of networking for a professional career, academics are often reluctant to develop this skill. Moreover, studies suggest that women's professional networks may not be as strong as those of men and therefore, may not be as eff ective in furthering their professional careers. 11 Fostering postdoctoral networking not only exposes postdocs to new potential mentors but builds up a constellation of professional relationships 12 and contacts that can foster knowledge sharing, stimulate collaborative research, and provide more psychosocial forms of support. Th e former postdocs participating in the NPA ADVANCE focus groups cited networking as one of the most useful aspects of postdoctoral training but also the aspect that could be most improved, along with mentoring. For this reason, postdocs can benefi t from training in the process of networking, which can help them build professional relationships as well as take optimal advantage of opportunities like conference attendance. Some institutions off er such workshops as part of their postdoctoral professional development off erings, for example, Stanford University off ers \"Networking for Ph.D.s & Postdocs: Networking for those who don't want to.\" Another important network for postdocs to build is with other postdocs at their institution. Given the relative isolation of most postdocs, with only a handful in most research groups, they may need to reach out deliberately to foster these local connections. Postdoc offi ces or postdoc associations can be instrumental in building community for postdocs through both professional and social activities. National Postdoc Appreciation Week, which was established by the NPA in 2009 and was recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, has seen a remarkable series of activities dedicated to celebrating postdocs across the United States. Th ese events are archived on the NPA Web site and can provide examples of many diff erent ways to bring postdocs together. Other types of networks can be established virtually via online communication for postdocs in far fl ung departments. For example, the Emerging Scholars Interdisciplinary Network connects early-career scholars nationwide whose work relates to social inequalities and health disparities among minority populations and provides professional development resources and networking for participants. 13 Such networks can be particularly benefi cial to postdocs in the social and behavior sciences who are often even more isolated than other postdocs due to the small numbers of postdocs in these fi elds.

Women in particular are less likely to have mentors outside of their home department. 18 While there is evidence that informal mentoring relationships may provide greater benefi t than more structured mentorship, particularly for women, 19 women also benefi t more from mentor-initiated or mutually-initiated mentoring relationships, 20 suggesting that mentoring programs can play a role in fostering these relationships. Group-based mentoring. One approach to limiting the time commitments of busy mentors and mentees is to utilize group-based mentoring, either with one mentor and a group of mentees or a mentoring committee for an individual mentee. Th is type of \"collective mentoring\" can provide a diversity of perspectives to mentees as well as potentially reduce the individual time burden for everyone involved. An important aspect of this model is that the team is established by the department or institution instead of leaving that challenge to the mentee. 26 Mentoring committees have been little used for postdocs to date. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute has piloted their use at the department level, allowing each department to design the postdoctoral committee of mentors to best suit their departmental culture. A Goals and Problem-solving for Scientists (GPS) Group is \"a confi dential peer-mentoring group for discussing professional concerns, engaging in analytical problemsolving techniques, and developing individualized plans of action. The private and close-knit nature of the GPS group ensures that members can thoroughly explore concerns in an atmosphere that is both supportive and exacting.\" i Adapted from a group problem-solving model described in Every Other Thursday: Stories and Strategies from Successful Women Scientists by Ellen Daniell, ii GPS groups were reinvented by a group of postdoc women in the life and physical sciences who all had small children. The women have since successfully moved forward in their scientifi c careers and credit their GPS group with fostering these transitions. The group has shared some recommendations for starting a GPS group: iii 1. When selecting members, develop criteria for desirable peer similarities, such as family status or career stage, and recruit four to six people. 2. Make a commitment to meet every other week and try to make the meetings a top priority. 3. Make a commitment to complete confi dentiality. 4. Allocate restricted time blocks during each two-hour meeting to each member based on the requested amount of time to discuss his or her issue(s). 5. Keep discussion topics focused on resolution instead of just \"venting.\" 6. Each member should be prepared to give and receive honest feedback. 7. Develop protocols for the beginning and end of each meeting to address any lingering issues or confl icts in a timely manner. The authors of this promising practice speculate that this peer mentoring model could benefi t the careers of both women and underrepresented minorities and potentially foster their retention in the academic pipeline."}, {"section_title": "GPS Groups: Goals and Problem-solving for Scientists", "text": "i http://evgenyashkolnik.com/gpsgroups/Welcome.html (accessed January 31, 2013) ii Daniell, E. 2006. Peer mentoring. Another type of group-based mentoring is peer mentoring. Peer mentoring has the advantage of providing psychosocial support on topics of mutual interest amongst peers while potentially having greater fl exibility than more formal junior-senior mentoring models. Peer mentoring also has its limitations, since participants lack career experience and may be concerned about competition or diff ering rates of career advancement. 27 Peer mentoring has been used successfully for senior faculty women in chemistry, who are often the sole women at their institution, by forming small horizontal mentoring \"alliances\" with other women across the nation. 28 Th ese alliances meet for a series of in-person retreats of the group for both social and professional development activities, modeled on the approach described in the book Every Other Th ursday: Stories and Strategies from Successful Women Scientists by Ellen Daniell. 29 An example of how this could be adapted for postdoctoral scholars is the peer group of postdoc women with small children who successfully mentored each other as they transitioned into their fi rst independent positions (see sidebar). 30 Increase exposure to potential mentors through networking. Such eff orts can increase a postdoc's access to potential mentors but let the relationship then develop more organically and informally. A common approach is the use of networking receptions and luncheons to expose postdocs to additional mentors. Similarly, greater integration of postdocs into the department by ensuring their inclusion on e-mail distribution lists can expose them to other research groups and other potential mentors. Adaptation of a model like speed mentoring developed by the Georgia Tech University ADVANCE program could provide additional external mentoring for postdocs on their potential for career advancement. 31 Whereas the Georgia Tech model provided a series of short consultations on the CVs of faculty who were going up for tenure, a postdoc model could provide feedback on postdoc CVs and their preparedness for the job market. Th e University of Kentucky has developed a toolkit that could be adapted for use with postdocs. 32"}, {"section_title": "Provide training in mentorship for mentors and mentees.", "text": "A common characteristic of formal mentoring programs is training in mentorship for both mentors and mentees, but such training can also benefi t postdocs and their supervisors independent of a formal program.

Th e NPA has developed a toolkit on postdoctoral mentoring plans with tips for writing a plan as well as other resources for postdoctoral training. 36 For example, the NPA's core competencies 37 can provide a basis both for a postdoctoral training curriculum and assessment of postdoctoral training goals. Another successful mentoring tool is the individual development plan (IDP). A workhorse instrument for corporate career development, the IDP was adapted for use with postdocs by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). 38 Th e IDP is a tool for postdocs to conduct a self-assessment, establish consequent research and career goals, create a plan for achieving those goals, and then discuss these with their supervisor. IDPs, therefore, also serve as a mentoring tool by fostering communication between a postdoc and his or her supervisor on topics related to professional and career development. Th e FASEB IDP template has been widely adapted by institutions for use as a resource, and in some cases, a requirement. Vanderbilt Medical School, for example, has adapted the FASEB IDP and requires that postdocs maintain their IDP as a condition for reappointment each year.

Dean, Ph.D., and Cynthia L. Simpson, CAE, M.Ed. Th e numbers of women and under-represented minorities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical (STEMM) disciplines have greatly improved over the past several decades, but institutional eff orts to recruit, train, retain, and promote their participation and advancement in these fi elds are still inadequate. Being successfully mentored is particularly important for this group, and institutions must step forward to take a leadership role in this regard. Th e emergence of frameworks and formal structures for postdoctoral career support and advancement in institutions is a very encouraging sign. In today's STEMM enterprise, the postdoctoral period is an essential platform for expanding one's knowledge base and skill sets, as a springboard to a fully independent career pathway. As mentoring frameworks, approaches, and strategies are developed, it is essential to keep in mind what women scientists at the early stages of their careers have indicated that which they do NOT want from their mentors: 1 \u2022 Advice based on the mentor's interests that is not necessarily of interest to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9; \u2022 Inability to help with considering all options when prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is making a major decision; \u2022 Lack of interest in the areas the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 chooses to study or pursue; \u2022 No support of major accomplishments; \u2022 No availability to provide assistance; \u2022 Determent of prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from life-long goals; \u2022 Negative impact on prot\u00e9g\u00e9's life; \u2022 Mentoring that does not bring out prot\u00e9g\u00e9's full potential; and \u2022 Bias toward (or against) women.

Th is analysis is easy to do in the laboratory or design studio, but it can be very diffi cult to apply the same principles when it is our own thinking, actions, or frameworks that are \"not working.\" As well-motivated institutions implement eff orts to support the advancement of women postdocs, they will inevitably encounter such diffi culties. Institutions can make a diff erence in the short-term by conducting an aggressive and intensive analysis at each institutional level of the reasons that its programs, approaches, or tactics are not meeting the needs of today's women postdocs.

Professional development is increasingly available at research institutions, although it is not always directed at postdocs, especially in the case of career development services. While often available for students, career services can be diffi cult to off er to postdocs who do not pay the fees that typically support these services. Moreover, postdocs can be reluctant to participate in training activities that take time away from research, and, on average, only a minority of postdoc supervisors actively encourages participation in training beyond the research group. 6 Th erefore, even when programs already exist, whether they are targeted for postdocs or even for a complementary group like faculty or graduate students, postdocs may need additional encouragement and incentives to participate."}, {"section_title": "Off er insight into the faculty search process.", "text": "Since postdoc women can sometimes lack the \"inside\" knowledge of how academic institutions work, they can benefi t from frank sharing of information about the faculty search process, negotiating and interviewing, and advancing to tenure.

According to NSF's 2009 statistics on the science and engineering postdoctoral population, the majority of postdocs are in the biomedical sciences (67%), with the next largest group in the physical sciences with 15%, followed by engineering 11% 4 (see Table 1). Th ese ratios have not changed dramatically over the past fi fteen years. 5 One change during this period, however, has been the hiring of postdocs in other fi elds outside of the sciences. While the numbers in these other fi elds are small, they demonstrate another recent trend: the number of postdocs has been steadily increasing across all disciplines. 6 A P P E N D I X A"}, {"section_title": "The Postdoc Population", "text": "Th e NSF estimates that 38% of postdocs in 2009 were women, a number that has been growing slowly since 1993 when it was 29%. 7 Disaggregating by discipline shows that, while some fi elds were approaching gender parity among their postdocs in 2009, such as psychology with 50% and biomedical sciences at 44%, engineering and physical sciences were still down at 22% and 24%, respectively (see Table 2). For a snapshot of the social demographics of the postdoctoral population we turn to the Sigma Xi Postdoctoral Survey from 2005. 8 Th at survey found that the majority of postdocs surveyed were aged between 30 and 35 (58%) and married or partnered (69%). Approximately a third had children, and this fraction was slightly higher for men than for women (for breakdown within sex, see Table 3). Th ese data underscore the fact that for many postdocs, their postdoctoral years coincide with the years of family formation. Moreover, for postdoc women this period corresponds to the typical childbearing years for college-educated women in the United States. 9 Another important characteristic for postdocs is citizenship status, especially those who are working in the United States on non-immigrant visas. Since the early nineties, such international   The Postdoc Career Life Cycle Career prospects for postdocs have become increasingly uncertain in today's job market. Th e growth in the number of postdocs in the United States has not been accompanied by similar growth in the number of faculty positions. In fact, comparing the type of employment of recent doctorate holders at academic institutions over time, the fraction of those in full-time faculty positions has fallen while the fraction in postdoc positions has grown. In 1973, 74% of doctorates within three years of receiving their Ph.D. were in faculty positions compared to 13% in postdocs, but in 2008, only 42% of recent doctorates were in faculty positions compared to 36% in postdocs. 15 At the start of their postdoc positions, the majority of postdocs have an interest in becoming faculty or principal investigators, 16 but, across all disciplines, less than a third of them obtain tenure-track positions. 17 Not only is the likelihood of starting a postdoc position increasing in most fi elds, many postdocs complete more than one postdoc. Almost a third of the postdocs responding to the 2005 Sigma Xi survey had already completed one or two postdoc positions prior to their current position. 18 Until a few years ago, the best available data showed that the length of the postdoc was also increasing; 19 most recently, it seems to be decreasing. Postdocs responding to the 2005 Sigma Xi Survey reported a median number of 29 months in total as a postdoc, with more than half of them expecting their current postdoc position to last more than 24 months. 20 Th e ideal length of the postdoc is still an open question. Th e purpose of the postdoc, according to a recent NSF survey of current postdocs 21 and the NSF/NIH defi nition of the postdoc, 22 is to obtain additional advanced, mentored training. As a result, the postdoc applying for faculty jobs typically has more experience than newly minted Ph.D.s applying right out of graduate school, potentially making faculty job searches increasingly competitive. While there is no consensus on the ideal length of the postdoc, there seems to be a general sense that it should be long enough to help a postdoc get that next job but not so long that questions are raised about why that postdoc hasn't gotten the next job yet. Postdoc advocates support a limit to the total time spent as a postdoc, 23 arguing that it is important to establish a time scale for transition to independence. Often institutions will place a limit on the total time spent as a postdoc, 24 after which postdocs must leave the institution or transition into another job title. Unfortunately, this uncertainty in how long one should be a postdoc can create challenges for those who may need to take a bit longer for reasons like childbearing or other family responsibilities as well as those making plans for starting families. Because the postdoc is considered a training position, often that position does not enjoy the full range of compensation commensurate with the level of education attained by these researchers. As of 2008, the most recent year for which we have data, the median salary for a postdoc working in academia was $42,000, compared to $75,000 for Ph.D. scientists not working as a postdoc. 25 By another measure, the FY2009 stipend scale mandated for NIH-supported Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA) postdoctoral fellows, which many institutions have adopted as the salary minimum for all postdocs, 26 started at $37,368 for a new postdoc and reached a maximum of $51,552 for the most senior postdocs with seven years or more experience (for FY2012, these have increased to $39,264 and $54,180, respectively). In comparison, in 2009 the overall U.S. median salary of those aged 25 to 34 with only a bachelor's degree was $46,437 and for those with a doctorate degree it was $70,990. 27 International postdocs often face lower salaries on average than domestic postdocs, U.S. citizens, and permanent residents. 28 In addition to having relatively low salaries, postdocs tend to lack robust employment benefi ts. For example, while the vast majority has employer-provided health insurance, only a minority has retirement benefi ts 29 or guaranteed baseline paid maternity leave. 30 Moreover, provision of some benefi ts, for example, eligibility for the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected family leave, depends upon an individual institution's treatment of postdoc employment classifi cation or limitations such as being employed for more than 12 months. Based on a preliminary inquiry conducted by the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) in 2011, the wide variety of funding mechanisms and employment classifi cation of postdocs at the institutional level can often lead to widely disparate benefi ts for postdocs within the same institution or even in the same lab, doing the same work. 31 While postdocs funded by research grants may receive full employee benefi ts at many institutions, postdocs with private funding or fellowships often fall into a special category that may or may not receive equivalent benefi ts.

Some grants and fellowships may have their own guidelines for maternity or family leave. Consult your paperwork. \u2022 Unpaid, job-protected leave, guaranteed by FMLA and/or Title IX. Make a maternity-leave salary plan. Do you want to maximize your salary during leave by supplementing disability benefi ts with sick leave? Do you want to maximize the duration of your leave by taking a fraction of your salary over a longer period with a combination of disability and sick days? Could you also extend this period by you, your partner or both of you working part-time? Decide what you want to do, then make sure you have all the paperwork and instructions in hand. Also, consider having a contingency plan in the case of complications. For example, if you go on bed rest three weeks before the birth, this may shave three weeks off the paid time you spend with your baby after the birth. Parental/spousal leave. Find out if your spouse/partner has a parental leave policy and if there are any limitations. For example, if you both work at the same institution, there may be a cap to the total, combined time you can each take for extended family or child care leave. If you and your spouse or partner work at the same institution and you take 8 weeks of unpaid leave under FMLA, your spouse/partner may only take up to four weeks of FMLA leave, for a combined total of 12 work weeks between the two of you."}, {"section_title": "Make a Maternity Research Plan", "text": "Try to make a general plan for how your research will continue through your pregnancy and maternity leave and write it down. Such a plan can help keep your research on track and address concerns your supervisor or collaborators might have. Some general considerations for that plan are: How much can you get done before your delivery? Try to identify some milestones you can reasonably reach before you go on leave, especially ones that require you to physically be at work. Allow yourself some fl exibility here. Is there anyone who can continue some of your work while you are on leave? \u2022 Collaborators or members of your lab or group might be able to continue some aspects of your project during your leave, so talk to them in advance. \u2022 A specially hired technician might also be able to continue some of your research. Funds for this temporary hire could be available through grants, grant supplements or even from your institution, which might off er transitional support to faculty for career interruptions. Find out if your maternity leave might qualify for such institutional support for your supervisor's project where you are the primary supported researcher. \u2022 In all cases, be sure to discuss in advance how credit for this work will be assigned (e.g. acknowledgement or authorship?) and what will happen upon your return (e.g. who now leads the project? who will continue to work on it?). Consider having these understandings in writing. Are you willing to do any work from home? Being on leave means you are entitled to spend all your time recovering and caring for your newborn, instead of working. When considering how much you might want to do during leave, be mindful of committing yourself to doing work before you know how feasible it might be. Some tasks you might consider are: paper writing; grant writing; literature review; and conference calls. Make a backup plan for pregnancy complications. Despite your best-laid plans, complications can arise. Try to think through some of these in advance. For example: you are put on bed rest before the delivery; the baby comes much earlier than expected; or you need a longer recovery time after the delivery."}, {"section_title": "Make a Plan for Returning to Work", "text": "Gradual return to work. You might be able to extend your formal leave by returning to work from home, or working part time and gradually working up to a full workday. Th is type of fl exibility may be useful as you balance work with your new responsibilities at home and could help you maintain productivity when you are sleep-deprived. Find out if your institution has any type of part-time or fl exible time arrangement available to postdocs. If not, talk with your supervisor about your plans and options. Breastfeeding. Th ere is signifi cant federal and state support for a woman's right to express breast milk at work. 2 Although recent 2010 changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act typically do not apply to postdocs, some state laws will. If you will be breastfeeding, fi nd out about available facilities for pumping at work. Does your institution have lactation rooms? Do you have access to other closed-door space for pumping? Is there a refrigerator available for milk storage? A microwave for sterilization of pump accessories? Also, identifying a support group for working and breastfeeding moms may be helpful. Childcare. Find out about childcare options at your institution (and whether they are available to you as a postdoc). Some institutions off er subsidies, fl exible spending accounts, or other fi nancial assistance for childcare costs. Th ey may also have special programs, such as on-call childcare for emergencies and sick children or networks for parents. Identifying a back-up caregiver such as a relative or friend might be useful if your workday or deadlines are infl exible or you occasionally require after-hours care for your child. Travel. Make a plan for when it is feasible to resume work-related travel. Can your child travel with you, and are there funds to support bringing a caregiver along? Breastfeeding mothers should also consider how pumping will fi t in with your remote work plans."}, {"section_title": "Tips on Talking with your Postdoctoral Supervisor", "text": "First, consider your supervisor's perspective. Regardless of how generally supportive a supervisor may be of your new life change, he or she is likely to experience some concern over the potential research delays that could be caused by your pregnancy and maternity leave. Although granting periods can be extended, lack of research progress can jeopardize grant renewals or new funding requests. Your collective goal will be to limit these risks for all involved. Know your basic rights. Keep in mind that pregnancy discrimination is illegal. Your pregnancy should be treated as any other temporary disability, and you should be able to take, at the minimum, job-protected, unpaid maternity leave. Th e details of how your pregnancy might be accommodated or how to take leave will depend on your funding source and your institution's policies and \"typical\" practices. Choose a time to talk. Deciding when to tell your supervisor about your pregnancy is a personal decision that depends upon your specifi c circumstances and the impact your pregnancy and maternity leave might have on your work. For example, many expectant parents wait until after the fi rst trimester, when the risk of miscarriage decreases signifi cantly. In some cases, fi rst trimester safety or health concerns (like workplace hazards or extreme \"morning\" sickness) may warrant an earlier declaration. Ideally, you would like the timing of your declaration to allow suffi cient time for any advance preparations needed for your maternity leave or other work accommodations. Once you"}]
