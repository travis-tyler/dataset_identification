Epidemiological studies suggest that the incubation period was estimated to be 1-14 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days. It takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in the number of infections [3] . In addition, recent study demonstrated that there was about 5% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among other patients with mild influenza-like"}, {"section_title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Coronavirus Invasion", "text": "The coronavirus (CoV) family has a large homogeneous \"spike protein\". This spike protein (S protein) is responsible for interacting with the host cells, such as the pulmonary and parabronchial epithelial cell, and helps the coronavirus get through the epithelial cell membrane [26] . In addition, the alveolar epithelial cells have abundant expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is targeted by the virus. The recognition of ACE2 by the S protein of the virus enables the invasion of the coronavirus into the human circulation system [27] . Recent study demonstrates that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, which is required for cell entry [28] . Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses such as the coronavirus family replicate the virus genomes by taking advantage of host cells. For example, after coronavirus approaches the ribosome of the epithelial cells or other host cells, it uses the ribosome of the host cell to replicate polyproteins. The replication and subsequent processes of precursor polyproteins can occur in the epithelial cells [29] . After the coronavirus' polyproteins are expressed, two enzymes -specifically, coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) -are thought to be involved in cleaving the polyproteins into smaller products used for replicating new viruses [30] . In order to generate the daughter RNA genome, the coronavirus expresses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is a crucial replicase that catalyzes the synthesis of a complementary RNA strand using the virus RNA template as shown in Figure 1 [31] . "}, {"section_title": "Factors Involved in Transcription and Release of Coronavirus Particles", "text": "Although genome replication and transcription are well known to be regulated by the viral RdRp, several host factors have been implicated in this process. RNA chaperones are usually nonspecific nucleic acid binding proteins, which have long disordered structures that promote RNA molecules to adjust conformational changes. For example, coronavirus nucleoproteins (N protein) have RNA chaperone activity and function as an RNA chaperone, which could help template switching [32] [33] [34] . In addition, recent studies demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylates the N protein of SARS-CoV and further inhibition of GSK3 can effectively inhibit viral replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV [35] . Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is involved in the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the host cells. Importantly, it has been shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV had binding ability to human hnRNP A1 with high affinity by using kinetic analyses with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach. These studies suggest that hnRNPA1 is able to bind to SARS-CoV N protein to form a replication/transcription complex and control viral RNA synthesis [36] .\nIn addition, several virus proteins and host factors are essential for the assembly and release of coronavirus. Homotypic interaction of M protein serves as the scaffold for the virus assembly and morphogenesis in the infected cells, specifically, both the interaction between the membrane (M) and S protein and the interaction between M and N protein promote the recruitment of structural components to the assembly location of host cells [37, 38] . For example, both envelope (E) protein and N proteins are required to be co-expressed with M protein for the formation and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) after transfection of Vero E6 cells. Two crucial structural proteins, the M protein and E protein, play important roles in the coronavirus assembly. In addition, the E protein is involved in particle assembly by binding with M and further inducing membrane curvature [39] . Subsequently, coronavirus particles can be budded into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) of host cells, then trafficked in a smooth-wall vesicle and transported through the secretory pathway for assembly and release by exocytosis [40, 41] ."}, {"section_title": "Current Treatment of Coronavirus", "text": "There are two subunits of S protein, including the S1 subunit with a receptor-binding domain that engages with the host cell receptor ACE2, and the S2 subunit involved in regulating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes [42] . The S protein plays important roles in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and leads to T cell responses, so it is involved in protective immunity during infection with SARS-CoV [42] . Vaccines can be developed to specifically recognize the spike protein for SARS and ACE2 receptor [42] . However, mutations of the virus gene and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect might affect the efficacy of previously developed biological vaccines, or even spur a counterproductive immune response, although spike protein sequences in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS exhibit some overlap [43] [44] [45] . Although it is of importance to develop vaccines and biological therapeutics to prevent the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2, a careful evaluation of possible immune complications is required before applying the vaccine to the public. Therefore, it may take several months or a few years to generate effective vaccines to prevent outbreak. Recent study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 has very similar genome sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and there is more than 90% sequence similarity in several essential enzymes, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, papain-like proteinase (PLpro), 3CL-protease (3CL-pro) and spike glycoproteins [31] . Dissecting the structure of RdRp may provide new insights into the mechanisms of RNA replication as shown in Figure 2 [23] . Several drug candidates including ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir, have been used previously to treat SARS or MERS, and these compounds may have potential in treating patients with SARS-CoV-2 from this current outbreak [31] . .

Recent studies have found that small molecules of remdesivir and chloroquine effectively suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [24] . According to comparison of genome sequences of SARS-Cov-2 with SARS sequence, the catalytic domains of enzymes such as RdRp are highly conserved in these coronaviruses as shown in Figures 3 and 4 . More importantly, it is predictable that the protein sequence of the drug binding pocket of the enzymes is highly conserved [56] . Therefore, these enzymes and spike protein could be very promising drug targets for developing a therapeutic approach for COVID-19 as shown in Table 1 [57, 58] . RdRp, also known as nsp12, which catalyzes the synthesis of coronavirus RNA, is an essential enzyme of the coronaviral replication/transcription machinery complex. Recent study revealed the structure of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 using cryo-EM [59] . Remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead) was initially developed to examine its effect on inhibition of Ebola virus (EBOV) replication [60] . RdRp can incorporate remdesivir, which resembles an RNA building block ATP, into new RNA strands. After binding of remdesivir, RdRp stops being able to incorporate RNA subunits. This puts a stop to the coronavirus genome replication. Enzyme kinetics demonstrated that EBOV RdRp incorporated ATP and remdesivir-TP with comparable efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP for EBOV RdRp is four times against remdesivir-TP.

The structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and its complex with an alpha-ketoamide inhibitor have been recently revealed [52] . Comparison of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS sequence indicates that the catalytic domains of proteinase are highly conserved in these coronaviruses. Therefore, it is plausible to repurpose the compound library for treatment of SARS-CoV for developing potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. Computational analysis was also used to screen the effective and potent cysteine protease inhibitors for malaria and SARS infection [63] [64] [65] . Recently, a series of N-(tert-Butyl)-2-(N-arylamido)-2-(pyridin-3-yl) acetamides (ML188) were identified as potent noncovalent small molecule inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV 3CL protease [66, 67] .

One of the main derivatives of quinine, mefloquine, was discovered to suppress the uptake of chloroquine in infected cells by blocking ingestion of hemoglobin to prevent parasite infection [82, 83] . Previous study demonstrated that chloroquine inhibited the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in vitro [84] .

The exclusion criteria include: patients with SaO2/SPO2\u226494% in room air condition; severe liver disease and severe renal impairment; and patients with any experimental treatment for COVID-19 (off-label, compassionate use, or trial related). 308 participants have been recruited and the clinical trial outcome will be released at the end of April 2020. There are no therapeutics proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, so a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the efficacy of remdsivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease. The clinical trial There are no therapeutics proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, so a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the efficacy of remdsivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease. The clinical trial is sponsored by Capital Medical University and China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The inclusion criteria include: (1) confirmation of COVID-19 by using laboratory RT-PCR; (2) less than 12 days since symptom;\n(3) lung involvement confirmed with CT chest imaging; (4) patients with a SaO2/SPO2 \u2264 94% in room air condition. The exclusion criteria include: severe liver disease and severe renal impairment; and patients with any experimental treatment for COVID-19 (off-label, compassionate use, or trial related). 452 participants will be recruited and the clinical trial outcome will be released in May 2020. In adults presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19, invasive mechanical ventilation, a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy, and intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) to facilitate protective lung ventilation are necessary for supporting treatment [120] . For severe ARDS cases, the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide is recommended [120] . A randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigation of antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has also initiated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha. These clinical trials will be of significance for therapy involving severe cases of COVID-19 after completion of examining the efficacy of remdesivir to treat COVID-19.\nRecent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells, which provides the rationale that supporting treatment on lung should be emphasized [121] . The expression of ACE2 can be upregulated by smoking in humans [122] , therefore, smoking status should be included for information of identified cases of COVID-19. In addition, it is crucial to manage patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT syndrome and short QT syndrome in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic [123] . Patients with inherited arrhythmia may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic factors of COVID-19 such as use of antiviral drugs, fever, stress, and electrolyte imbalance [123, 124] . The current studies on potential therapeutic agents, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon, ribavirin, tocilizumab and sarilumab are important for management of COVID-19 [51, 125] . More clinical trials are being conducted for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating COVID-19 [126] ."}, {"section_title": "Coronavirus and Host Interaction", "text": "Several host factors regulate the replication of coronavirus and induce dramatic changes in the host cellular structure and function, simultaneously. Induction of critical signaling proteins is crucial for the pathogenesis of CoV and is also involved in the activation of the innate immune response during CoV infection. Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of viral infection. Recent studies demonstrate that excessive recruitment of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps results in acute lung injury of influenza pneumonitis [127] . In addition, neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) serves as a potent tissue damage factor and also contributes to influenza pneumonia in mice infected with influenza virus [128] [129] [130] [131] . In addition, coronavirus infection is able to induce stress response, autophagy, apoptosis, and activate innate immunity [40] . Host cell apoptosis caused by CoV infection has been extensively studied, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect and induce apoptosis in a variety of tissues including lung, spleen, thyroid tissues, and a variety of cell types, such as respiratory epithelial cells, neuronal cells, primary T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells [132, 133] . In addition, overexpression of SARS-CoV S was shown to induce a potent ER stress response, and the re-arrangement of DMV production and membrane alteration for the assembly of the virus may contribute to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during CoV infection [40] . Unfolded protein response (UPR) -mediated signaling pathway was induced to maintain ER homeostasis [134, 135] . The IRE1 branch of UPR promotes cell survival during CoV infection and CoV infection activates JNK to modulate apoptosis induction [136, 137] . Induction of cell apoptosis provided the possible explanations for the fact that lymphopenia was observed in some patients with CoV infection, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Immune cell apoptosis may lead to the suppression of host immune response and promote the occurring of ARDS.\nCoronavirus infection promotes the activation of inflammasome in host cells and activates innate immunity [138, 139] . In macrophages, ORF8b provides a potent signal 2 required for activation of inflammasome and activates the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) to form the inflammasome complex. Specifically, ORF8b is able to interact directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3 and bind with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) in cytosolic dot-like structures [140] . ORF8b induces cell apoptosis and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages, while in those cells lacking NLRP3, accumulating ORF8b cytosolic substances lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of inflammasome and caspase-independent cell death [140, 141] . Recent genome-wide and transcriptome-wide complementary network analysis of SARS-CoV-2/human interaction provided a new network of host proteins affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection [141] . It has been shown that ACE2 is downregulated in the presence of viral infection, therefore application of recombinant ACE2 has been shown to be effective in treating severe pulmonary infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome [142] . Recent studies demonstrate that soluble forms of ACE2 are beneficial to SARS patients, due to its competitive binders of SARS-CoV Spike proteins, preventing binding to the host cell ACE2 [143] ."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "Recent study indicate that there is a substantial number of undocumented infections and this facilitates the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV2 [144] . These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV2 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. It is also informative to help understand the potential for infection by non-symptomatic subjects. Therefore, one of the most important strategies of management of COVID-19 infection is to effectively reduce the possibility of constant human-to-human viral transmission [145] . Keeping social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine are necessary for preventing substantial human to human transmission of COVID-19 [146] [147] [148] . Recent study demonstrated that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ACE2 was 10-to 20-fold higher than the SARS-CoV S protein as shown in Figure 5 [30] , which explains the observations of rapid transmission from human-to-human in COVID-19 infection. Genetic analyses of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that there were two major types, L type and S type [149] . It seems that the L type (\u223c70%) was more dominant than the S type (\u223c30%). The L type was more common in the early stages of the outbreak in China. Artificial intervention may have put selective pressure on the L type, which might be more susceptible to mutate and spread more widely [149] . It is very challenging to makes an effective vaccine because of the rapid mutation of ssRNA and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect [149] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective medicine for treatment of moderate and severe patients with low SpO2. Remdsivir may be potentially developed for treatment of COVID-19 after completing the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine its efficacy in patients with COVID-19. In addition, better understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus invasion into host cells could accelerate discovery of new inhibitors of interaction of spike glycoproteins and ACE2 and promote the development of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. Finally, by drawing lessons from mechanisms of replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, development of potent and effective RdRp inhibitors will provide new insights required for putting RdRp targeted therapeutics into full gear.
