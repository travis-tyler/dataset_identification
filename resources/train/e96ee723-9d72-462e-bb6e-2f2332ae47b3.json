[{"section_title": "", "text": "'In this report, \"attrition,\" \"departure,\" and \"leaving college\" all refer to 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students departing without receiving a credential and not returning by spring 1998. This pattern is also described as \"early attrition\" or \"short-term enrollment.\" 2Total (or system) departure, in which students leave postsecondary education altogether, is distinct from institutional departure, in which students leave one institution but enroll at another (Tinto 1993). This report only examines departure from postsecondary education entirely (i.e., total departure). What proportion of students left college without a credential and did not return in the first 3 years? While almost one-third (32 percent) of beginning postsecondary students left without a credential within 3 academic years (figure A), students who began at 4-year institutions were less likely than those who began at 2-year institutions to do so (17-19 percent versus 35-44 percent). The percentage of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who left without a credential and did not return by spring 1998 was greatest in the first year of enrollment and smallest in the third year of enrollment. Among students who began at public 4-year institutions, fewer left in the third year than in the first or second year of enrollment, but no differences were detected between departure rates in the first 2 years. No differences were detected by year in the percentages of students beginning at private notfor-profit 4-year institutions who left. The percentage of public 2-year college students who left school within the first year was larger than that from any other type of institution. What factors were associated with early departure from postsecondary education by institution type? A number of student characteristics were associated with departure from public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions. While many characteristics were Figure A.Percentage of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who left without a credential and did not return by spring 1998, by first institution type and last year of attendance associated with departure from all three types of institutions, some differences were detected only among students from public and private not-forprofit 4-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Students' Educational Expectations", "text": "Not all students plan to complete a degree when they enter college. Among all beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96, the expectations and objectives of students who began at public 2-year institutions differed from those of students who began at 4-year institutions. Even among students who began at public 2-year institutions, educational expectations were relatively high (i.e., higher than could be accomplished at a 2-year institution): 33 percent eventually expected to complete a bachelor's degree, and another 29 percent expected to complete an advanced degree, i.e., a degree beyond the bachelor's. But students who began at public 2-year institutions were less likely than students who began at 4-year institutions (59 percent at both public and private not-for-profit 4year institutions) to expect to complete an advanced degree. They were also more likely to expect that their eventual educational attainment would be less than a bachelor's degree (16 percent versus 1-2 percent of those who began at 4-year institutions). Finally, students who began at community colleges expressed a range of reasons for enrolling at such an institution: 38 percent indicated that they chose that institution to prepare for transfer to a 4-year college or university; 22 percent chose the institution to gain job skills; and another 16 percent enrolled for personal enrichment. Among students at all three types of institutions, both the eventual educational iv 6 expectations of students and their initial degree objectives at the first institution attended were associated with departure from postsecondary education within 3 years. Among students who identified the level of education they ultimately expected to complete, those who identified higher expected levels of education were less likely than those who identified lower expected levels to leave college (figure B). In addition, those who did not know their expected eventual educational outcome were more likely than those who expected to complete advanced degrees to leave within 3 years. Furthermore, initial degree objectives from the first institution at which the student enrolled were associated with departure from postsecondary education among students at all three types of institutions, with lower objectives generally associated with a higher rate of departure. For example, among students who began at public 4year institutions, 40 percent of those whose degree objectives at their first institution did not include a bachelor's degree left postsecondary education within 3 years, compared with 16 percent of those who did plan to get a bachelor's degree there. This relationship was found even after taking into account many other factors associated with departure. #Too small to report.

Transfer between institutions and changes in number of dependents from their initial entry into college until 1998 were also associated with their departure among students who began at public institutions, even when other variables were taken into consideration. Those who transferred to another institution were less likely to have left college. In addition, students from all three types of institutions who had more dependents in 1998 than when they began college had higher rates of attrition than those who never had dependents. For example, among students who began at public 2year institutions, 61 percent of those who subsequently had children left college by 1998, compared with 37 percent of those who never had children. Thus, changes such as these that can occur during students' postsecondary enrollment may supersede the effects of their initial enrollment characteristics. Furthermore, when examining nontraditional student characteristics,3 students with nontraditional characteristics were often more likely to leave within 3 years than their counterparts without these characteristics. For example, among students who began at public 4 year institutions, those who delayed postsecondary enrollment more than a year after high school were more likely than those who had gone directly to college (33 versus 15 percent) to depart. Among 3Nontraditional student characteristics include the following: being 24 years old or older, delaying postsecondary enrollment by more than a year after high school, enrolling less than full time, being independent, working full time, being currently or previously married, being a single parent, having dependents, or not having a regular high school diploma. students who began at private not-for-profit 4-year colleges and universities, 62 percent of those who had ever been married when first enrolled had departed within 3 years without a credential, compared with 15 percent of those who had never been married. At public 2-year institutions, students who worked part time or did not work while they were enrolled were less likely than those who worked full time (33 and 43 percent, respectively, versus 59 percent) to leave college. These relationships were found even when taking into account other factors associated with departure. Some characteristics, however, were associated with departure from 4-year institutions, but not public 2-year institutions. Students facing a lower price of attendance were more likely to depart from 4-year institutions, while this relationship was not found among students who began at public 2-year institutions after taking other factors into account. In addition, among students who began at 4-year institutions, attending colleges with higher graduation rates was associated with lower attrition. However, this relationship was not detected among students who began at public 2year institutions. What reasons did these short-term enrollees give for their departure? The 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who left by 1998 without a credential gave a variety of reasons for their departure (figure C). Students were generally more likely to say that they left because they needed to work or to give other financial reasons for their departure than to give other types of reasons. About one-quarter (26 percent) of short-term enrollees cited needing to work as a reason for their departure, and 16 percent identified other financial reasons. Ten percent said that they had completed their desired Other financial reasons NOTE: Respondents could give up to three reasons, including other reasons not listed here. Sixty-one percent identified only one of these reasons, and 24 percent did not cite any of these reasons.

Those who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to say they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted (12 versus 5 percent) or because they needed to work (29 versus 17 percent). What other characteristics of shortterm enrollees were associated with their reasons for departure? Among beginning postsecondary students who left early, women were more likely than men to say that they left because of a change in family status or because of conflicts at home or personal problems. In contrast, men were more likely than women to say they left because of academic problems or because they needed to work. Higher income students who left were less likely than their lower income counterparts to say that they left because of a change in family status. In addition, students in the middle two income quartiles were more likely than those in the highest quartile to leave because they needed to work (30 versus 13 percent). Although short-term enrollees cited academic problems relatively infrequently as a reason for their departure, the evidence above showed that first-year grades were consistently associated with vii early attrition in all institution types. There was some evidence that students without nontraditional characteristics were more likely than those with these characteristics to cite academic problems as a cause of departure from postsecondary education. Students who enrolled full time during their first year were more likely than students who had mixed patterns of attendance or who attended part time to report academic problems as a cause of their early departure (7 versus 0.2 and 2 percent, respectively). In addition, short-term enrollees who worked more hours while enrolled during their first year of postsecondary education were less likely than those who worked fewer hours to say they left because of academic problems. Were differences in reasons for departure by institution type found after controlling for other characteristics? The results suggest that the reasons for leaving differ between students who began at public 2-year institutions and those who began at 4-year institutions. These differences may be related to the different student populations at 2-year compared with 4-year institutions. For example, reasons given for departure varied between students with and without various nontraditional characteristics, and these students also differed with respect to the types of institutions in which they began their postsecondary education. Students with nontraditional characteristics (such as not having a regular high school diploma or being financially independent) who left were less likely than students without these characteristics to report that they left because of academic problems, as did short-term enrollees who began at 2-year institutions compared with those who began at 4year institutions. On the other hand, students with nontraditional characteristics who left postsecondary education without a credential were more likely than those without these characteristics to say they were done taking the classes they wanted, as were short-term enrollees who began at public 2-year institutions compared with those who began at 4-year institutions. Among all beginning students as well as among those who left early, students from public 2-year institutions were more likely than those from 4year institutions to have nontraditional student characteristics. After taking into account other factors associated with various reasons for departure, short-term enrollees who began at public 2-year institutions were still less likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to say they left because of a change in family status and more likely to say they left because they needed to work. In the multivariate analyses, no differences were found in the rates at which short-term enrollees from different types of institutions reported leaving because of academic problems or because they had completed the classes they wanted. However, in both cases, initial degree objectives were related to leaving: those who planned to complete a bachelor's degree at their first institution were more likely to leave for academic reasons than those who planned to complete an associate's degree, and those who did not plan to obtain any credential from their first institution were more likely than others to leave because they were done taking the classes they wanted."}, {"section_title": "Other Results", "text": "Among students who left college within 3 years of first enrollment, some of the reasons they gave were consistent with their characteristics. For example, middle-income students were more likely than high income students to say they left because they needed to work. Students who had never intended to complete a credential of any kind from the institution where they began were more likely than those seeking a degree or certificate to indicate that they left because they were finished. However, this reason was not given by even a majority of those with no degree goals, suggesting that other factors may have deterred them. Relatively few student characteristics were associated with leaving because of a change in family status. However, students who had more dependents in 1998 than when they began postsecondary enrollment were more likely than others to say they left because of a change in family status. In addition, women were more likely than men to cite this cause. These results are consistent with other literature on this reason for leaving college (Bonham and Luckie 1993). While academic problems were not frequently cited as a cause for student departure, students who had lower grades were more likely to give this reason than those with higher grades. However, this relationship was not found once other factors were taken into account. In the multivariate model, not working while enrolled and full-time enrollment were associated with leaving for academic reasons. These results suggest that leaving because of academic problems is more common among students who do not have nontraditional characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report describes short-term enrollment in postsecondary educationthat is, students who left within 3 academic years of their first entry into postsecondary education without earning a credential and without returning.

In addition, this report examines the reasons that students who left gave for their departure. It also explores how these reasons are related to background characteristics such as demographic, academic, financial aid, and institutional characteristics. This report uses data from the 1996-98 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98). The BPS survey is the longitudinal component of the 1996 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96), a nationally representative sample that includes students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from 4-year colleges and universities to less-than-2-year vocational institutions. The BPS:96/98 cohort consists of students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time during the 1995-96 academic year. The cohort was followed up in spring 1998. This and other reports using this data set can be accessed and downloaded from the NCES Web Site (nces.ed.gov). The estimates presented in the report were produced using the NCES Data Analysis System (DAS), a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate tables, for the BPS:96/98 study. The DAS produces the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences among estimates. Researchers are encouraged to use the BPS:96/98 data for their own analysis as well.

While many of these students later return to postsecondary education and complete certificates or degrees, others do not re-enroll (Horn 1998). Students at public 2-year institutions leave postsecondary education in the early years at higher rates than students in 4-year institutions, even when controlling for background and educational expectations (Tinto 1993). Although institutions themselves, and their impact on students, are considered to be important in the process of college completion (Tinto 1993;Astin 1993), the vast literature on attrition (e.g., Tinto 1993;Mallete and Cabrera 1991;Bean 1980) recognizes that the process of departure from postsecondary education may differ for community college students and students at 4-year institutions (Dougherty 1994;Feldman 1993;Conklin 1993). Despite extensive exploration of various factors that are associated with attrition, there has been relatively little study of students' own accounts of their reasons for leaving college. The studies that have been conducted are generally case studies of individual institutions, which are not generalizable to the national student population. Their wider applicability is further limited by their nearly exclusive focus on community colleges (e.g., Bonham and Luckie 1993;Conklin 1993;Lee 1996). Using the 1996-98 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98), this report poses two questions: what student background characteristics are associated with departure from postsecondary education without a credential; and among those who do leave, what reasons do they give for their departure? In addition, both questions focus on understanding how the process of departure from college differs for students who began at 2-year institutions rather than 4-year institutions. The literature on postsecondary attrition and persistence is extensive and has revealed many factors consistently associated with departure. Such factors range from student demographic characteristics, to academic performance and enrollment characteristics, to factors related to the institutions students attend (Tinto 1993). The most comprehensive models of persistence in or attrition from college focus on the complex ways in which institutional conditions interact with students' backgrounds and experiences (Astin 1993;Tinto 1993). For example, students' academic and social integration into campus life and their satisfaction with the institution are important in the process of attrition (Bean 1980). Students' educational plans may change as a result of their experiences at college, and other changes in students' personal circumstances may affect their propensity to leave college (Astin 1993;Tinto 1993). In addition, students' ability to pay has been found to increase their persistence in college (Cabrera, Stampen, and Hansen 1990). The literature that describes the reasons departing students leave college, according to their self-reports, is less comprehensive and is based largely on case studies of individual institutions, particularly community colleges (e.g., Lee 1996;Moore 1995). A survey of these reports reveals that students identify reasons ranging from the most common across institutions, such as financial difficulties or work conflicts, to those that may be specific to the institution, such as insufficient parking (Luan 1996). Several reasons that have appeared in multiple case studies include financial problems, work conflicts, and changes in marital or parental status (Lee 1996;Moore 1995;Adams 1994;Conklin 1993;Bonham and Luckie 1993). These studies, while useful for individual institutions, do not provide any description of nationwide patterns or a baseline for comparing individual institutions. In addition, many of these studies either do not explore how these reasons vary by students' characteristics and experiences or include only a few student characteristics in their analyses. The relationships that have been observed suggest that the reasons students give for leaving college may be associated with many factors. For example, a change in their marital or parental status might be particularly salient for women, for whom there are greater expectations regarding family responsibilities (Bonham and Luckie 1993). In contrast, men may be more likely to leave because they need to work (Lee 1996). Students who enroll part time may be particularly likely to have short-term nondegree goals and leave because they have achieved those goals (Lee 1996). These results, while not generalizable to a wider population, suggest some relationships that may be observed with more representative data. What reasons did these short-term enrollees give for their departure, and how were these reasons associated with the type of institution that students first attended? What other characteristics of short-term enrollees were associated with their reasons for departure? Were differences in reasons for departure by institution type found after controlling for other characteristics?"}, {"section_title": "Data and Measurement Issues", "text": "The 1996-98 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) is well suited to examine attrition in the first 3 years of postsecondary education. This data set consists of a nationally representative sample of all students who first enrolled in postsecondary education in the 1995-96 academic year, with a follow-up conducted 3 academic years later in spring 1998. This data set is particularly useful for investigating total departure,[ in which a student withdraws from postsecondary education entirely, as distinct from institutional departure, in which a student may leave one institution but enroll in another (Tinto 1993). Influences on and reasons for these distinct types of departure are likely to vary, but institutional case studies of attrition and reasons for it are unable to distinguish the difference. Thus, this report focuses on the phenomenon of total departure, an area in which the BPS data set has a strong advantage. Both \"departure\" and \"attrition\" are used to refer to this process in this report. Students who leave without a credential are described as \"departing students\" or as \"short-term enrollees.\" This group includes some who achieved their postsecondary goals even without a degree or whose departure is only temporaryboth groups that may not be appropriately referred to as dropoutsin addition to others who have abandoned or changed their objectives. The initial component of the analysis explores factors associated with attrition during this time period and therefore includes all students. The outcome of interest here is whether students left postsecondary education without a credential between the base year and first follow-up interviews and did not return during this period. Of course, it is possible that some of the students who left postsecondary education during this time, particularly those who left later during the study period, are in fact stopoutstemporary dropouts who will return to college later (Horn 1998). Students who stopped out and returned by the time of the first follow-up (that is, known stopouts) are not included with short-term enrollees in this analysis. On the other hand, finding that a majority of the community college students they studied planned to return to school at some point in the future, Bonham and Luckie (1993) postulated that further changes may take place such that \"intended stopouts [may become] actual dropouts\" (p. 260). Because the time frame of the BPS data collection is relatively short for capturing students who may later return, this potential overlap with stopout behavior should be kept in mind. The subsequent analysis is restricted to students who left postsecondary education and had not returned in the 3-year period, and examines their reasons for doing so. Bonham and Luckie (1993) pointed out that a \"web of circumstances,\" rather than a single cause, is often more accurate to describe why students leave college (p. 259). Most studies of reasons for departure allow respondents to indicate multiple reasons for leaving, and BPS, which allowed respondents to indicate up to three reasons for leaving college, is no different. Fourteen specific reasons were identified in BPS, along with an \"Other\" reason option, for respondents who had left college without a credential and without returning by the time of the first follow-up. The most common nine reasons are included in the public-use Data Analysis System (DAS) used to conduct the analyses for this report.2 Most of the analyses in both sections of the report are conducted on subsamples, either by institution type or by departure status. This approach considerably limits the base sample upon which percentages can be calculated, and thus inflates the standard errors used in statistical tests, decreasing the tests' ability to detect small population differences. Therefore, only the institutional sectors that serve large numbers of postsecondary students are included. The analysis includes only students who began at 2-year or 4-year degree-granting institutions and does not include those who started at less-than-2-year institutions (although students at 2-year and 4-year institutions may be seeking credentials below the highest level offered at their institution). It is also restricted to students at public or private not-for-profit institutions, rather than the for-profit sector. These limitations permit comparisons within institution type and also focus comparisons across sectors. In addition, most of the analyses also exclude students who began their postsecondary education at private not-for-profit 2-year institutions (due to small sample sizes that preclude detailed analysis among these students)."}, {"section_title": "Organization of This Report", "text": "The remainder of this report is organized as follows. The next section examines early departure from postsecondary education, first by determining the prevalence of early attrition for the 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students as of spring 1998 and then by making comparisons by institution type. Next, other background characteristics that may be associated with short-term enrollment are explored, including demographics, nontraditional student characteristics, academic factors, financial aid, institutional characteristics, and changes in educational plans and family status. These factors are considered separately for students who began in public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions. Multivariate analyses of departure for each institution type conclude the section. The subsequent analyses are restricted to those students who left postsecondary education without a credential and did not return by 1998. This section addresses the reasons cited by students for their departure and investigates how these reasons vary by institution type. It then considers the same background factors in relationship to the reasons cited by short-term enrollees. The report concludes with multivariate analyses of those reasons that differed by institution type. About one-third (32 percent) of beginning postsecondary students had left without a credential within 3 academic years (table 1 and figure 1). Students who began at 4-year institutions were less likely than those who began at 2-year institutions to do so (17-19 percent versus 35-44 percent). The proportion of students who left without a credential was greatest in the first year of enrollment and smallest in the third year of enrollment.3 This result is consistent with evidence from other studies (Horn 1998). Among students who began at public 4-year institutions, fewer left in the third year than in the first or second year of enrollment. Among students who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, no differences were detected in the proportions leaving 3The percentage who left in each year is calculated as a proportion of the total number of students in the beginning cohort, rather than as a proportion of the number of students remaining."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "!J Figure 1.Percentage of 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who left without a credential and did not return by spring 1998, by first institution type and last year of attendance in each of the first 3 years.

Because the private not-forprofit 2-year sector is relatively small, this analysis could not produce reliable estimates of factors associated with departure exclusively in this sector. Thus, estimates are presented only for students beginning at public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions."}, {"section_title": "Student Background Characteristics", "text": "Several demographic factors were associated with early attrition among students who began at public 4-year institutions (table 2-A). Black students who began at public 4-year institutions were more likely than their Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander peers to leave within 3 academic years (25 percent versus 14 and 11 percent, respectively). Those from higher income families were less likely than those from lower income families to leave within 3 years of first enrollment. For example, 24 percent of students from the lowest income quartile left, while 15 percent of those from the highest income quartile did so. Also, students whose parents did not go to college were more likely than those whose parents did attend college to leave without a credential within 3 years of beginning their postsecondary education (25 versus 15 percent). "}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "Many of the same results were found among students who began at private not-for-profit 4year institutions (table 2-B). Black students were more likely than Asian/Pacific Islander students to leave within 3 academic years. While it appeared that Hispanic students were also more likely than Asian students to leave during this time frame, the standard errors were large and the difference was not statistically significant. Among those who began at private not-forprofit 4-year institutions, smaller proportions of higher income students left than lower income students. Like those who began at public 4-year colleges and universities, first-generation college students (those whose parents did not attend college) at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than others to leave without a credential within 3 years of beginning their postsecondary education. Although differences in leaving school by income, race/ethnicity, and first-generation status were found among public and private not-for-profit 4-year students, these differences were not observed among students who began at public 2-year institutions (table 2-C). Several characteristics were used to define those who were considered \"nontraditional\" among postsecondary students: being age 24 or older, delaying enrollment in postsecondary education by a year or more after high school, enrolling part time, being an independent student, working full time while enrolled, having been married, having any dependents or being single parents, and not having a regular high school diploma (Horn 1996). While these characteristics are considered nontraditional, they are not necessarily rare. For example, Horn (1996) found that, among all undergraduates (not just beginning postsecondary students) in Fall 1992, 59 percent were older than typical for their class year; 43 percent had delayed enrollment; 42 percent attended part time; 48 percent were independent; 28 percent worked full time while enrolled; 20 percent had dependents; 7 percent were single parents; and 4 percent had a GED or high school completion certificate instead of a high school diploma. Students with nontraditional characteristics who began at public 4-year institutions were generally more likely than those without these characteristics to leave within 3 years (table 3-A). Older students left with greater frequency than younger ones (46 versus 16-22 percent). Similarly, students who delayed enrollment in postsecondary education were more likely to leave college (33 versus 15 percent). Students who enrolled part time were more likely than those who enrolled full time for at least part of the first year to leave postsecondary education within 3 years. In addition, 42 percent of independent students left without a credential within 3 years, while 17 percent of dependent students did so. The more hours students worked while enrolled during their first year of postsecondary education, the more likely they were to leave within 3 years. Students who worked full time were especially likely to leave within this time period: 39 percent of them departed within 3 years, compared with 13 percent of those who did not work and 19 percent of those who worked part time while they were enrolled during the 1995-96 academic year. In addition, 47 percent of students who had ever been married or had dependents when they enrolled had departed within 3 years, compared with about 17 percent of students who had never married or did not have dependents. Similarly, single parents were more likely than their counterparts to leave postsecondary education within 3 years (40 versus 18 percent). Students with nontraditional characteristics who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were also more likely than those without these characteristics to leave without a credential (table 3-B). Age, delayed enrollment, initial attendance intensity, dependency status, employment intensity, marital and parental status, and high school completion type were all associated with early departure from postsecondary education. For example, students who delayed enrollment in postsecondary education by more than a year after completing high school were more likely to leave within 3 years (34 versus 14 percent). Also, students who enrolled full time for their first year of postsecondary education were less likely to leave than those who enrolled part time for part or all of the year (14 percent for full-time enrollment versus 31 percent for mixed enrollment and 51 percent for part-time enrollment). Similar to the pattern among students from 4-year institutions, students with nontraditional characteristics who began at community colleges during 1995-96 were generally more likely than their counterparts without these characteristics to depart without a credential within 3 academic years (table 3-C). For example, older students were more likely than younger students to leave without a credential within 3 years. Similarly, those who delayed postsecondary   enrollment after high school were more likely than those who did not delay to leave without a credential within this time period (55 versus 33 percent). Independent students who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than dependent students to leave without a credential (59 versus 36 percent). In addition, students who had ever been married (60 percent) or who had dependents (55 percent) when they began college were more likely to leave than those who had not married or had dependents (39-40 percent). Finally, while a majority (59 percent) of beginning postsecondary students at public 2-year institutions who worked full time while enrolled in their first year left without a credential, the same was not true for those who did not work (43 percent) or for those who worked fewer hours (33 percent). In addition to students' employment status while enrolled, among those students who were employed, the role that they considered primary was also associated with short-term enrollment that did not result in a credential (table 4). Among beginning postsecondary students from all three types of institutions who were employed while enrolled in 1995-96, those who considered themselves to be primarily employees who were enrolled in school were more likely than those who considered themselves to be primarily students to leave without a credential within 3 years. For example, among those who began at public 4-year institutions, 44 percent of employed students who considered themselves primarily employees left within this time frame, while 19 percent of those who considered themselves primarily students did so."}, {"section_title": "Students' Educational Expectations and Other Academic Characteristics", "text": "While the family and employment situations of students are often related to how likely they are to leave postsecondary education, much literature on short-term enrollment, particularly that on community college students, suggests that students' own reasons for enrolling and their overall educational plans and expectations must be taken into account when considering who leaves (Conklin 1993;Bonham and Luckie 1993). That is, students without plans to complete a degree when they enter college may differ considerably from those with such plans. Because of the broader missions and range of students they serve, public 2-year institutions may be particularly attractive to students with these shorter-term goals, and students who leave these institutions without credentials often indicate that their goals were met (Lee 1996;Moore 1995). In the 1995-96 survey, students were asked to identify what degree, if any, they planned to complete at their first institution,4 as well as the highest educational level they ever expected to 4This variable was based on students' responses to the question, \"What is the highest degree you expect to complete at [this institution]?\" Response options included plans to transfer to 2-year or 4-year institutions, degrees ranging from undergraduate certificates to doctoral and first-professional degrees, and no plans to transfer or complete a degree. Responses for any degree of BA or higher plus those planning to transfer to a 4-year institution were coded as bachelor's/transfer. Those planning no degree at complete. In this report, these are referred to as \"initial degree objectives\" and \"eventual educational expectations,\" respectively. Students' initial degree objectives differed by the type of institution they attended (figure 2). Relatively few students did not plan to get any sort of credential from their first institution, but those at public 2-year colleges were more likely to have no immediate degree plans than those at 4-year institutions (14 versus 5-6 percent). On the other hand, students who began at 4-year institutions had higher initial degree objectives: 90 percent of students who began at 4-year institutions planned to get a bachelor's degree from the institution where they began. In comparison, 25 percent of students who began at community colleges planned to transfer from their first institution to a 4-year institution or otherwise indicated that they planned to complete a bachelor's degree immediately. that institution or planning to transfer from one less-than-4-year institution to another were also coded as having no degree expectation. Responses of higher degrees than were offered at the institution were assumed to be planning to transfer.   Eventual educational expectations were relatively high, even among students who began at public 2-year institutions (figure 2). Among students who began at community colleges, 33 percent eventually expected to complete a bachelor's degree, and another 29 percent expected to complete an advanced degree beyond the bachelor's. But they were less likely to expect an advanced degree in the future than students who began at 4-year institutions (59 percent for those 18   36BEST COPY AVAILABLE at both public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions). Students who began at public 2-year institutions were also more likely to have eventual educational expectations below a bachelor's degree (16 versus 1-2 percent of those who began at 4-year institutions). Students who began at public 2-year institutions were also asked to indicate their primary reason for enrolling in a community college (figure 3). Thirty-eight percent of public 2-year students indicated that their primary reason for enrolling in a community college was to transfer to a 4-year institution, a reason that was reported more often than any other. About one-fifth (22 percent) indicated that they enrolled in a public 2-year college primarily to obtain job skills, and another fifth said they selected the institution so they could complete an associate's degree or certificate.  Students' eventual educational expectations and their initial degree objective at their first institution were both associated with their departure from postsecondary education within 3 years. For example, among beginning postsecondary students at public 4-year institutions, those with higher expectations for their eventual education were less likely to leave within 3 years without a credential (figure 4 and table 5-A). In addition, those who did not know their eventual NOTE: Refers to student's response to the question, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" when asked during the base year (1995-96) interview. education outcome were more likely than those who expected to complete an advanced degree to leave within this time frame (24 versus 13 percent). However, students with uncertain education outcomes were less likely than those who did not expect to complete a bachelor's degree to leave (24 versus 58 percent). Furthermore, those who did not plan to get a bachelor's degree from their first institution were more likely than those who did to leave within 3 years (40 versus 16 percent). Other academic and enrollment characteristics were also associated with departure within 3 years. Students who began at public 4-year institutions in the fall term were less likely to leave within this time period than those who started later in the academic year (18 versus 36 percent). In addition, students with lower academic performance in their first year of enrollment were more likely to leave within 3 years than others. Twenty-four percent of students who took any remedial classes left, compared with 18 percent of those who did not take remedial courses, and attrition was also higher among students whose first-year grade-point average (GPA) was below 'Refers to the degree the student expected to complete at the first postsecondary institution attended as of the 1995-96 base year interview. 2 Refers to student's response to the question, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" when asked during the base year (1995-96) interview. 3SAT scores are derived from agency, institution, or student-reported SAT or ACT scores, when available.

Finally, those with combined SAT scores of 1,000 or below were more likely than those with higher scores to leave without a credential (13 versus 20 percent). For those students who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, academic characteristics were related to departure from postsecondary education within 3 years in much the same way as for students who began at public 4-year institutions (figure 4 and table 5-B). For example, those who eventually expected to get an advanced degree were less likely to leave than those who did not expect to obtain more education beyond a bachelor's degree (12 versus 26 percent). Here, too, students who planned to complete a bachelor's degree at the private 4-year college or university at which they first enrolled were less likely than those who did not have such plans to leave postsecondary education altogether (13 versus 46 percent). Students who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions in the fall term were less likely to leave within 3 years than those who started later in the year (16 versus 43 percent). Higher first-year GPA and SAT scores were also associated with a lower likelihood of leaving postsecondary education without a credential at private not-for-profit institutions. These results were also consistent with those for students who began at public 4-year institutions. Among students who began postsecondary education at community colleges, those with higher educational goals (in terms of both eventual educational expectations and degree goals at the first institution) were less likely than others to depart within 3 years without a credential (figure 4 and table 5-C). For example, 64 percent of those who did not plan to obtain any credential at the community college where they first enrolled had ceased enrollment within 3 years, compared with 33-44 percent of others. Furthermore, among beginning postsecondary students at community colleges, those indicating that their primary reason for enrolling was to transfer to a 4-year institutionthe most frequent reason citedwere less likely than those giving any other reason (such as gaining job skills or a less-than-4-year credential) to leave within 3 years. However, 29 percent of them still departed, a higher rate than that among students who began at 4-year institutions. First-year GPA was associated with departure without a credential among students who began at public 2-year institutions as well. Unlike the pattern among students at public 4-year institutions, however, no differences were observed in the rate of departure by enrollment in remedial courses. Although SAT scores were not available for most students beginning at public 2-year institutions, those who had SAT scores were less likely than those who did not to leave postsecondary education without a credential within 3 years. This pattern may have occurred because those who had taken a college admissions test already had plans to transfer to 4-year  'Refers to the degree the student expected to complete at the first postsecondary institution attended as of the 1995-96 base year interview. 2 Refers to student's response to the question, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" when asked during the base year (1995-96) interview. 3SAT scores are derived from agency, institution, or student-reported SAT or ACT scores, when available.

Alternatively, younger students (who were less likely to leave; table 3-C) may have been more likely to have taken a college admissions test during high school to prepare for any postsecondary education. While rates of attrition differed among students who began at 4-year institutions according to whether or not they entered college in the fall semester, such differences were not found among those who began at public 2-year institutions.\nConsistent with their stated educational goals, among those who knew their educational expectations, those leavers with lower educational expectations were more likely to say that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted (table 16). This was true both for eventual educational goals and for the degree objective at the first institution at which the students enrolled. Among students leaving postsecondary education who began at community colleges, those whose primary reason for enrolling initially was to obtain job skills were more likely than those who enrolled for other reasons to say they left because they were done with the classes they wanted (30 versus 3-8 percent). In addition, leavers who had identified their initial degree objective as an associate's degree or higher were generally more likely to say that they left for other financial reasons than those who planned to complete a certificate or no degree (21 versus 7-8 percent). While it appeared that the same association was found for eventual educational expectations, the relationship was not statistically significant. Other academic characteristics were also associated with the reasons that short-term enrollees gave for their departure from postsecondary education. Students leaving postsecondary education who had lower first-year grades were more likely to leave for academic reasons (6 versus 1 percent). In addition, those who began in the fall term were more likely to leave for academic reasons than those who began later in the year (5 versus 2 percent). Students who had #Too small to report.

Among students who received financial aid in their first year of college, those who received more aid were less likely than those who received less aid to depart within 3 years, although there was no difference detected by the type of aid package that aided students had. However, no difference was detected between the proportion of all financial aid recipients and the proportion of non-recipients who left postsecondary education within this time frame. Students' price of attendance refers to their attendance-adjusted student budget (tuition and fees plus housing and other expenses). This provides a measure of the costs of attending postsecondary education that must be paid by the student or by financial aid, and reflects variation among institutions even within a particular type of institution. Students with a higher price of attendance were less likely to leave than those with a lower price. This was also true when considering full-time students only. Similar results were found among students who began at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions (table 6-B). Among financial aid recipients, those who received more aid were less likely than those who received less aid to depart within 3 years. However, no difference was detected between aided students and non-aided students in rates of departure, and among aided students, the type of aid received was not found to be associated with departure. Students beginning at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions who had a higher price of attendance were less likely to leave than those with a lower price, even when examining full-time students only. Price of attendance was negatively associated with departure within 3 academic years for students who began at public 2-year institutions: the higher the price of attendance, the less likely the students were to leave without a credential, both among all students and among full-time students (table 6-C). This result paralleled the relationship of price of attendance to departure among students who began at 4-year institutions. No differences in departure rates were observed by receipt of financial aid and, for aided students, by the type and amount of aid received.    Tinto (1993) suggests that satisfying social and academic experiences in college serve to integrate students more fully into the life of the institution. The BPS survey provides a measure of social integration with questions asking students how frequently they did such activities as attending concerts, participating in clubs or sports, or going places with friends from school. Similarly, academic integration is assessed by the frequency with which students participated in study groups or had contact with faculty.5 Students beginning at public 4-year institutions who experienced lower social and academic integration into campus life during their first year of postsecondary education were more likely than others to leave within 3 years (table 7-A). 5Responses to individual items were combined into indices of social and academic integration, with low and high groups determined by splitting the sample at the overall mean (see the glossary for details on variable construction). Students at 4-year institutions were more likely than those at public 2-year institutions to have high integration: 68-79 percent of 4-year students had high social integration, compared with 24 percent of public 2-year students, and 76-84 percent of 4-year students had high academic integration, compared with 41 percent of public 2-year students. Twenty-eight percent of those with low social integration left within 3 years, compared with 15 percent of those with high social integration. Similarly, 31 percent of students with low academic integration left, compared with 15 percent of students with high academic integration. In addition, students who lived in school-owned housing in their first year at public 4-year colleges and universities were less likely than those with other living arrangements to leave within this time frame. Students living in school-owned housing may be more integrated into campus life than those who live with their parents or on their own. Alternatively, students in school-owned housing may also be younger, and therefore less likely to leave. The persistence behavior of peers was also related to their departure. Students who began at public 4-year institutions with higher graduation rates (calculated for first-time, full-time students) were less likely than their counterparts at institutions with lower graduation rates to leave postsecondary education within 3 years. That is, when persistence at the institution was generally high among full-time beginning students, individual students were less likely to leave postsecondary education. Paralleling students who began at public 4-year institutions, social and academic integration, residence arrangement, and institutional graduation rates were associated with departure from postsecondary education among students who began at private not-for-profit 4year institutions (table 7-B). For example, 12 percent of students at private 4-year institutions who lived in school-owned housing during their first year left within 3 years, compared with 28 percent of those who lived with their parents and 43 percent of those who lived elsewhere. Higher social and academic integration were also associated with persistence among students who began at public 2-year institutions (table 7-C). About one-half (49 percent) of students with low social or academic integration left without a credential within 3 years, compared with 30 percent of students with high social integration and 37 percent of students with high academic integration. While school-owned housing is relatively uncommon at community colleges, beginning postsecondary students at these institutions who did live in school-owned housing were less likely than those who lived somewhere else other than with their parents to leave within 3 academic years (31 versus 52 percent). The graduation rate of the institution where students began was associated with attrition rates at 4-year institutions, but this relationship was not detected among students who began at public 2-year colleges. As described in the introduction, students' educational goals may change during college (Astin 1993). Transfer between institutions as well as changes in educational expectations were assessed in BPS:96/98. Among students who began at public 4-year institutions, those who had transferred to another institution within 3 academic years were less likely than those who remained at their initial institution to have left postsecondary education altogether (15 versus 20 percent; table 8-A). Change in overall educational expectations6 was also associated with whether students left postsecondary education. Those 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who increased their expectations to include a graduate degree by 1998 or who had always expected to get a graduate degree (8 percent) were less likely than students in other groups (24-41 percent) to have departed from postsecondary education during the same period. 6This variable combines reports of the highest degree respondents expected to complete when asked in 1996 and in 1998. See the glossary for further details about the categories of this variable. Other changes in students' personal lives have also been cited as factors in their leaving postsecondary education (Bonham and Luckie 1993). Among students beginning at public 4-year institutions, those who had more dependents in 1998 than when they began postsecondary education had a higher rate of attrition during the 3-year period than those who had never had dependents (60 versus 16 percent). 3.9 3.3 8.8 *Combines reports of the highest degree respondents expected to complete when asked in 1996 and in 1998. The category \"Clarified expectations\" refers to students who said \"don't know\" in 1996, but gave a determinate answer in 1998. See the glossary for further details. Some of these relationships were also observed among students who began postsecondary education at private 4-year institutions in 1995-96 (table 8-B). While 9 percent of students whose educational expectations always included or increased to earning a graduate degree had left within 3 years of beginning college, 21-34 percent of other students did so. Also, those who had never had dependents were much less likely than others to have left. However, there was no difference found in the attrition rates of students who had transferred institutions and those who had not transferred during the 3-year period (19 and 17 percent, respectively). 3.8 10.4 7.0 *Combines reports of the highest degree respondents expected to complete when asked in 1996 and in 1998. The category \"Clarified expectations\" refers to students who said \"don't know\" in 1996, but gave a determinate answer in 1998. See the glossary for further details. Similar patterns were found among students who began at public 2-year colleges in 1995-96. Those who had transferred to another institution by spring 1998 were less likely than those who did not transfer to have left postsecondary education altogether without a credential (14 versus 54 percent; table 8-C). Public 2-year students who increased their educational expectations between 1995-96 and spring 1998 to include a graduate degree or who expected a graduate degree at both points in time were less likely than those who never expected a graduate degree, who decreased their expectations from a graduate degree, or who did not know their educational aspirations in 1998 to have left without a credential. As among students who began at 4-year institutions, public 2-year students who did not have dependents in 1995-96 or 1998 were less likely than others to have left by 1998 without earning a credential. \nThere were also differences in the reasons that short-term enrollees gave for leaving according to their financial aid characteristics (table 17). Students leaving postsecondary education who had received financial aid during their first year of enrollment were more likely than unaided students to say they left because of a change in family status (10 versus 5 percent). Otherwise, no differences in reasons for leaving were detected between aided and unaided students. Among leavers who received aid, those who had received larger amounts of aid were more likely than those receiving less aid to say they left because they were not satisfied and less likely to say they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. For example, 11 percent of students receiving $3,000 or less in aid said they left because they were done, compared with 1 percent of students receiving more aid. Also, those who received aid without loans were more likely to say they were done with their desired classes than those who received aid with loans (12 versus 2 percent). Finally, those with a higher price of attendance were less likely to say they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. Among students leaving postsecondary education, those with lower social integration at the first institution were less likely than those who were more integrated into the institution's social life to leave for academic reasons and more likely to leave because they were done taking the classes they wanted (table 18). It may be the case that students who had only short-term goals for their postsecondary enrollment did not invest socially in the institutions they attended because they knew they would not be there for a long period of time (Tinto 1993). Alternatively, students with nontraditional characteristics (such as older independent students with families), who were more likely to say they left because they had achieved their goals, may also be less integrated socially into campus life than students who have more age peers on campus (Tinto 1993). Consistent with this possibility, students who initially lived in school-owned housing or with their parents or other relatives were also less likely than those with other housing arrangements to say they left because they were done with their desired classes (5-6 versus 17 percent). Students who began at institutions with higher graduation rates were more likely than students at institutions with lower graduation rates to say they left school because of conflicts at home. These short-term enrollees were also less likely to say they left because they needed to work, compared with those at schools graduating smaller proportions of their students.

Changes in students' educational circumstances were also associated with the reasons they gave for departure from postsecondary education (table 19). Students leaving postsecondary education who had transferred between institutions were less likely than short-term enrollees who had not transferred to say they left because they were done with the classes they sought or because they had job conflicts. Compared with those who did not expect to get a graduate degree or who did not know in 1998 how much education they would complete, short-term enrollees whose eventual educational expectations always included or increased to a graduate degree were less likely to indicate that they left postsecondary education because they had completed the courses they wanted (2 versus 11-15 percent). *Combines reports of the highest degree respondents expected to complete when asked in 1996 and in 1998.

As expected, those postsecondary students leaving within 3 years who gained additional dependents during that time were much more likely than those who had never had dependents, or who had the same or a smaller number of dependents 3 years later, to say that they left because of a change in family status (29 versus 3-6 percent). Those who had never had dependents were more likely than others to say they left because of academic problems (6 versus 0.4-1 percent). They were also more likely than those who increased their number of dependents to say they left because they were not satisfied (8 versus 1 percent)."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Factors Associated With Early Departure After Adjusting for Background Variation", "text": "So far, the analysis of attrition from postsecondary education within 3 years of beginning postsecondary education has examined how departure is related to individual student or enrollment characteristics for each institution type under consideration. Of course, some of the characteristics associated with early departure may be correlated. For example, different nontraditional student characteristics may be associated with each other, and financial aid characteristics may be related to family income. As a result, this approach does not demonstrate the unique relationship between each factor and early attrition. Multivariate analyses were conducted to determine whether student background, academic, and other characteristics were related to departure when controlling for the other factors.

As in the tables above, multivariate analyses of departure were conducted separately for students who began at public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions. For students who began at public or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, variables found in the previous analyses to be associated with departure for students at one or both types of 4-year institutions were included in the multivariate models. Likewise, for students who began at public 2-year institutions, variables that had observed relationships with attrition for public 2-year students were included in the multivariate model. Results for public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and public 2-year institutions are shown in tables 9, 10, and 11, respectively. In each table, the first column shows the unadjusted percentage of students who left college as presented above. Regression coefficients were used to generate the adjusted percentages shown in the second column (holding the other variables in the table constant). For each row variable in the table, the category in italics is the reference category, the one against which the other categories of the variable are compared in tests of statistical significance. Numbers designated with asterisks in the first and second columns indicate that the percentage of students in that category who left college is significantly different from the percentage for the reference category. Rows containing an asterisk in the first but not the second column are cases in which the adjustment procedure leads to a different conclusion than one would reach based on the unadjusted percentages only. Since most of the variables shown in the previous tables were found to be associated with departure among students who began at public 4-year institutions, the model shown in table 9 is quite large. Hispanic students were still less likely than Black, non-Hispanic students to leave college. Students who delayed postsecondary enrollment after high school were still more likely to leave college than those who did not delay, while age was no longer related to attrition once delayed enrollment and other factors were taken into account. Employed students who considered themselves to be primarily employees were more likely than others to depart, while employment status itself (full-time, part-time, or no employment) was no longer related to departure when other variables were controlled. Students' initial degree objective was still related to departure: those who did not plan to get a bachelor's degree at the initial institution were more likely than those who did seek a bachelor's there to leave. However, students' eventual educational expectations were no longer related to leaving once their initial objective and other variables were taken into account. Also, in the multivariate model, lower grades during the first year of enrollment were associated with a greater likelihood of attrition than were higher grades, while admissions test scores were no longer related to departure.

Students whose price of attendance was $9,000 or below were more likely to leave than those whose price of attendance was more than $12,000. However, after taking other variables into consideration, financial aid was not associated with departure. This combination of results suggests that the rate of departure is lower at higher priced public 4-year institutions, after taking financial aid and other variables into account. In addition, low academic integration was still associated with a higher rate of attrition in the multivariate model, as were lower institutional graduation rates. Finally, changes in institution, education expectations, and number of dependents were still associated with departure in the multivariate model. Students who transferred to a different institution were less likely to leave postsecondary education altogether. Students whose educational expectations remained high or increased were more likely than other groups to remain enrolled. And students who had children during the 3-year period were more likely to have dropped out than students who never had dependents. Some of these results were also found among students who began at private not-for-profit institutions (table 10). Beginning postsecondary students who had objectives that did not include a bachelor's degree from the initial institution had a higher rate of attrition, whereas their eventual educational expectations were no longer associated with departure in the multivariate model. Students whose grades averaged less than 2.75 were more likely than those whose grades were higher to leave postsecondary education once admissions test scores and other variables were taken into account. Students who had more dependents in 1998 than when they began college were more likely to leave than those who had never had dependents. In addition, similar relationships between departure and financial aid and price of attendance were found among students who began at private 4-year institutions. Students in the highest category of price of attendance were less likely to leave than those in the lowest category, while no relationship of financial aid to departure was found in the regression analysis. Again, this combination of results suggests that attrition is lower at higher priced institutions, even within institution types. Other results for private not-for-profit 4-year institutions differed from those for public 4year institutions. Low social integration (rather than low academic integration, as was found at public institutions) was associated with a higher rate of attrition among students who began at private 4-year colleges and universities. Students whose attendance intensity during their first year of enrollment was mixed were more likely to leave than those who attended full time after considering other factors. And students who had been married were more likely than those who were never married to have departed by spring 1998 in the multivariate analysis for private 4year institutions. While a number of significant relationships were found in the multivariate models for 4year institutions, relatively few factors were significant for public 2-year institutions. Many of those factors that were related to departure in the multivariate analysis, however, were also found to be significant for public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Initial degree objectives from the first institution were related to departure at community colleges as well as at 4-year institutions. Students who planned to get a certificate or an associate's degree from the community college where they began were less likely to have left within 3 years than students who did not plan to get any kind of credential from the institution. Also, lower grades during the first year of enrollment were associated with a higher rate of departure when other variables were taken into account, and students who had transferred to other institutions by spring 1998 were less likely to have left postsecondary education altogether. Finally, students who had more children during the 3-year period again had a higher rate of departure than did students who never had any dependents. Employment while enrolled was related to departure among students who began at community colleges when other factors were controlled, a relationship that was not detected among students who began at 4-year institutions. Students who did not work or who worked part time were less likely to leave without a credential than students who worked full time during their first year of postsecondary education even after other factors were taken into account."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This section of the report has focused on factors associated with departure without a credential from postsecondary education within 3 academic years of first enrollment. Students who began at public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were less likely than those who began at public 2-year institutions to leave postsecondary education during this period. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, several factors were associated with departure at all three types of institutions. Initial degree objectives from the first institution at which the student enrolled were associated with departure in all types of institutions, with lower objectives generally associated with a higher rate of departure. Educational plans did vary by institution type, with students who began at public 2-year institutions generally having lower expectations or initial degree objectives than those who began at public or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions as well as having a wide range of reasons for enrolling at a community college. Still, students who began at community colleges did have relatively high goals, with approximately one-third (29 percent) expecting to eventually complete an advanced degree and 38 percent claiming that their primary reason for enrollment was to transfer to a 4-year institution. Lower academic performance during the first year of enrollment was associated with a higher rate of attrition at all three types of institutions, even when controlling for the many other factors associated with departure. Finally, transfer between institutions and change in dependents from students' initial entry into college until 1998 were generally associated with departure, even when other variables were taken into account. For example, among students beginning at all three types of institutions, those who transferred to another institution were less likely to have left college altogether, and students who had more children during the 3-year period had higher rates of attrition than those who never had dependents. These relationships demonstrate that changes can occur during students' postsecondary enrollment that may attenuate the effects of their initial enrollment characteristics. Other characteristics, however, were associated with departure from 4-year institutions, but not with departure from public 2-year institutions. A higher price of attendance was associated with a lower likelihood of attrition at 4-year institutions, while this relationship was not found among students who began at public 2-year institutions. In addition, among students who began at 4-year institutions, attending colleges with higher graduation rates was associated with lower attrition. However, this relationship was not detected among students who began at public 2-year institutions. Up to this point, this report has examined factors associated with departure from postsecondary education within 3 years of first entering a postsecondary institution. However, as described in the introduction, most studies of the reasons that students themselves give for leaving college are limited in scope, and an exploration of what student and enrollment characteristics are associated with students' own accounts of their attrition has not been carried out on a nationally representative scale. This section looks only at those students who did leave college without a credential within 3 years of entry, describing the reasons they gave for their departure and the factors associated with those reasons.\nThe institution at which students first enrolledwhether it was a public 2-year or a 4-year institutionwas associated with several reasons students gave for their departure. Students who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who began at public or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions to say they left because they needed to work or were done with their intended courses. Short-term enrollees from community colleges were less likely than their counterparts at 4-year institutions to leave college because of academic problems or a change in 74 family status. Once other factors were taken into account, those who started at community colleges were still more likely than 4-year students to leave because they needed to work and less likely to leave because of a change in family status. In addition, among students who left without a credential, some of the reasons they gave were consistent with their personal and educational circumstances. Among leavers, students in the middle two income quartiles were more likely than those in the highest quartile to indicate that they left because they needed to work. Furthermore, consistent with their stated educational plans, those leavers with lower degree objectives at the first institution were more likely to say that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. However, even among those leavers who had indicated that they did not plan to obtain any degree or certificate from their first institution, those who left because they had accomplished their educational goals constituted a minority (29 percent). In other words, lack of specific degree goals alone was not sufficient to explain even a majority of the departures among these students."}, {"section_title": "What Reasons Did Short-Term Enrollees Give for Their Departure?", "text": "The 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students who had left by 1998 without a credential gave a variety of reasons for their departure (table 12 and figure 5). Students were generally more likely to say that they left because they needed to work or for other financial reasons than to give other reasons. About one-quarter (26 percent) of leavers cited needing to work as a reason for their departure, and 16 percent identified other financial reasons. Ten percent said that they had completed the classes they wanted or that they had conflicts at home or personal problems; 8 percent cited a change in their family status; 7 percent said they were taking time off from their studies; 6 percent indicated conflicts with their jobs or said that they were not satisfied; and 4 percent identified academic problems as a cause of their departure. Although short-term enrollees could identify up to three reasons for their departure, most (61 percent) identified only one of the reasons considered here, and about one-quarter (24 percent) did not cite any of these reasons.' Among students who left, those who began at 4-year institutions were more likely than those who began at public 2-year institutions to say that they left because of academic problems (9 versus 2 percent) or a change in family status (12 versus 6 percent; table 12). Those who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to say they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted (12 versus 5 percent) or because they needed to work (29 versus 17 percent).  Among students who began at 4-year institutions and subsequently left without a credential, students from public institutions were more likely than those from private not-forprofit institutions to say they left because of academic problems (11 versus 5 percent) and less likely to say they left for other financial reasons (17 versus 24 percent). Otherwise, no differences were detected in the reasons given by short-term enrollees from public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions.8 The previous section showed that a greater proportion of students left in the first year of postsecondary enrollment than in subsequent years, at least among community college students. Among beginning postsecondary students who left within 3 years, those who had left more recently were less likely to say that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. While 14 percent of students who left in their first year gave this reason, 1 percent of those who left in the third year of enrollment did so. Other reasons for departure, however, were not found to be associated with the year that students left college."}, {"section_title": "What Factors Were Associated With Reasons for Early Departure? Student Background Characteristics", "text": "Among beginning postsecondary students who left within 3 academic years, women were more likely than men to say that they left because of a change in family status or because of conflicts at home or personal problems (table 13). This result is consistent with observations in the literature that women are more likely to leave for these reasons because of their greater responsibilities for other family members (Bonham and Luckie 1993). In contrast, men were more likely than women to say they left because of academic problems or because they needed to work. White students who left were more likely than Asian students to say they left because of conflicts with their jobs, and Black students who left were more likely than Asian students to say they left because of financial reasons other than needing to work. While it appeared that other reasons for departure were associated with race/ethnicity, the standard errors for several groups were very large and the differences were not statistically significant. Higher income students who left were less likely than their lower income counterparts to say that they left because of a change in family status. For example, 2 percent of high-income 8Because of the relatively few differences in reasons between students from the two types of 4-year institutions and because the sample sizes of students who departed are small, students from public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions are combined in additional analyses below. 53 7 leavers cited this reason, while 12 percent of low-income students did so. In addition, students in the middle two income quartiles were more likely than those in the highest quartile to leave because they needed to work (30 versus 13 percent), and there was some evidence that students in the lowest income quartile were also more likely to cite this reason.9 Finally, students whose parents had not gone to college were more likely to leave because they were done taking their desired classes than those with college-educated parents (12 versus 5 percent). Although short-term enrollees cited academic problems relatively infrequently as a reason for their departure, the evidence from the first section of this report showed that first-year grades 9The difference between students in the lowest and highest income quartiles was significant at the 0.10 level rather than the 0.05 level. were consistently associated with attrition in all institution types. There was some evidence that students with nontraditional characteristics who left were less likely than their counterparts without these characteristics to cite academic problems as a cause of departure from postsecondary education (table 14). Students who enrolled full time during their first year were more likely than other students to cite this reason (7 versus 0.2-2 percent). In addition, those who did not have dependents or who were not single parents were more likely than those with dependents or who were single parents to cite academic problems, and those with regular high school diplomas were more likely than those who had completed high school in some other way to do so. Finally, students who worked more hours while enrolled during their first year of postsecondary education were less likely to say they left because of academic problems. On the other hand, students with nontraditional characteristics who left postsecondary education without a credential were more likely to say they were done taking the classes they wanted. For example, 23 percent of leavers who were 24 years old or more when they began postsecondary education gave this reason, compared with 5 percent of younger students who left. Independent students, those who had ever been married, and those who enrolled part time during their first year of college were more likely than others to indicate that they were done taking classes. Students with nontraditional characteristics who left were also less likely than students without such characteristics to indicate that they had done so because they needed to work. For example, 31 percent of dependent students gave this reason, compared with 19 percent of independent students. Similarly, about 3 in 10 students who had never been married (30 percent) or who had no dependents (29 percent) said that they needed to work, compared with 13 percent of students who had ever married and 15 percent of students with dependents.1\u00b0A mong short-term enrollees who were employed during their first year of enrollment, those who said that their primary role was as an employee rather than as a student were more likely than those who said they were primarily students to say that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted (15 versus 6 percent; table 15). Other differences by primary role were not detected, however. mWhile it appeared that students who went to college within a year of completing high school were more likely than those who delayed entry to leave because they needed to work, standard errors were large and this difference was not statistically significant.

"}, {"section_title": "Did Institution Type Differences in Reasons for Early Departure Persist?", "text": "As shown for the analysis of departure from postsecondary education presented above, many of the factors associated with the reasons that short-term enrollees gave for their attrition may be correlated with one another. Because one purpose of this report is to focus on differences in the process of attrition for students who begin at various types of institutions, the remaining analyses are designed to explore those reasons for departure that differed by first institution type. For example, higher initial degree objectives and eventual educational expectations were associated with a lower likelihood of departing because students said they were done taking their desired courses (table 16). Both degree objectives and educational expectations were associated with the type of institution at which students began postsecondary education. As among all beginning students (including those who did not leave; figure 2), leavers who began at public 2year colleges were more likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to report that their initial degree goals were lower than a bachelor's degree (figure 6). For example, while 19 percent of short-term enrollees who began at public 2-year institutions had planned to transfer to a 4-year institution to complete a bachelor's degree, about three-quarters (77 percent) of students who began at a 4-year institution had planned to complete a bachelor's degree there. Differences in the reasons for departure between students with and without nontraditional characteristics are also consistent with the different types of students served by 4-year compared with public 2-year institutions. Students with several nontraditional characteristics who left were less likely than students without these characteristics to cite academic problems as a cause of departure from postsecondary education (table 14), a reason also cited more often by short-term enrollees who began at 4-year institutions (table 12). On the other hand, students with nontraditional characteristics who left postsecondary education without a credential were more likely to say they were done taking the classes they wanted, as were those who began at public 2year institutions. Among all beginning students as well as among those who left, students from public 2-year institutions were more likely than those from 4-year institutions to have each of the nontraditional student characteristics (figure 7). Some differences in the reasons for leaving given by students at 2-year versus 4-year institutions are not consistent with differences in the types of students these institutions serve. For example, students without nontraditional characteristics (who are more often found at 4-year institutions) who left were more likely than students with nontraditional characteristics to indicate that they left because they needed to work, a reason cited more often by students from public 2-year institutions. The remainder of this section presents multivariate analyses of those reasons for departureincluding academic problems, being done with desired classes, change in family status, and needing to workthat were cited at different rates by students who began at 4-63 Si.  year and at public 2-year institutions. For each reason, a multivariate analysis including the variables found to be related to that reason (as shown in tables 12-19) was conducted. The results are presented in tables 20 through 23, which can be interpreted in the same way as the results in tables 9-11. (For more information about the multivariate analysis strategy used in this report, consult appendix B.)   Table 20 shows the unadjusted and adjusted percentages of short-term enrollees with various characteristics who indicated that they left because of academic problems. Once other variables were taken into account, the model revealed that only a few variables were associated with claiming this reason for departure. Female students who left were less likely than their male counterparts to leave for academic reasons, which is consistent with their generally higher academic performance. Two nontraditional characteristics were also associated with a lower likelihood of giving this reason in the regression analysis: attendance pattern and hours worked. Students with mixed part-time and full-time enrollment during their first year were less likely to give this reason than those who attended full time. In addition, short-term enrollees who worked full time while enrolled were less likely than those who did not work to leave for academic reasons. While no difference by institutional level was detected in the multivariate model, shortterm enrollees whose initial degree objective was an associate's degree were less likely than those who intended to get a bachelor's degree or transfer to a 4-year institution from their first college to cite academic problems as a reason for departure. Many student and institutional characteristics were associated with leaving postsecondary education because one's goals were accomplishedthat is, because the student was done taking the desired classes (table 21). However, once all of these variables were considered together in a regression model, only two characteristics were associated with giving this reason. Consistent with their stated goals, students who never intended to complete a credential at their initial institution were more likely than those seeking a degree or certificate to indicate that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. However, as described above, this reason was not given by even a majority of those with no degree goals, suggesting that other reasons may have deterred them. Short-term enrollees with a lower GPA were less likely to say they left because they were done once other factors were taken into account, while no differences were found in the percentage giving this reason by institutional level in the regression model. Relatively few student characteristics were associated with leaving because of a change in family status (table 22). However, most of these characteristics were also associated with this reason when included in the multivariate analysis. Female students, those from middle or lower income families, and those who attended full time were more likely than male, higher income, or less-than-full-time students to say they left because of a change in family status. Entirely consistent with the reason given, those who had more dependents in 1998 than when they began postsecondary education were more likely than others to say they left because of a change in family status after the adjustment procedure. In addition, even when taking into account other factors, students at public 2-year institutions were less likely than those at 4-year institutions to give this reason for leaving college.  5Adjusted percentage calculated from regression coefficients is below zero, outside the range of possible percentages. 6 Refers to the degree the student expected to complete at the first postsecondary institution attended as of the 1995-96 base year interview. 7SAT scores are derived from agency, institution, or student-reported SAT or ACT scores, when available.

It also focused on how the process of departure differed for students who began at public 2-year institutions and those who began at public or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Students who began at public and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were less likely than those who began at public 2-year institutions to leave postsecondary education. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, initial degree objectives from the first institution at which the student enrolled were associated with departure in all three types of institutions, with lower objectives generally associated with a higher rate of departure. This result underscores the point that not all students plan to complete college degrees when they enter postsecondary education. Educational plans varied by institution type, with students who began at public 2-year institutions generally having lower educational goalsin terms of both initial objectives and eventual expectationsthan those who began at public or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Lower academic performance during the first year of enrollment was associated with a higher rate of attrition at all three types of institutions. In addition, changes in students' educational circumstances and number of dependents from their initial entry into college until 1998 were associated with their departure. Many nontraditional student characteristics were associated with short-term enrollment at all three types of institutions. Many of these relationships were also found when considering other factors associated with attrition. Some characteristics, however, were associated with departure from 4-year institutions, but not from public 2-year institutions. A higher price of attendance was associated with a lower likelihood of attrition at 4-year institutions, while this relationship was not found among students who began at public 2-year institutions after taking other factors into account. In addition, the institution's graduation rate was associated with departure at 4-year institutions, but not at public 2-year institutions. Beginning postsecondary students who left without a credential within 3 years were generally more likely to say that they left because they needed to work or for other financial reasons than to give other reasons. Those who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely than those who began at 4-year institutions to say they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted or because they needed to work. Those who began at 4-year institutions, on the other hand, were more likely to say that they left because of academic problems or a change in family status. Finally, short-term enrollees with lower initial degree objectives were more likely to say that they left because they were done taking the classes they wanted. However, even among those leavers who had indicated that they did not plan to obtain any degree or certificate from their first institution, a minority of those who left said they did so because they had accomplished their educational goals. In other words, lack of degree goals alone did not explain most of these students' departures.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of populations rather than entire populations. Nonsampling errors ,occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all sample members (e.g., some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:96/98 Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the BPS:96/98 data. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors 13 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 1 of this report, and was generated by the DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), the DAS generates the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the BPS:96/98 stratified sampling method. 13The BPS:96/98 samples are not simple random samples, and therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.

Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error,14 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p < .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p < .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p < . 05.16 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females leaving postsecondary education without a degree, only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When respondents are divided into five racial/ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10, and the significance level of each test must be p < .05/10, or p < .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race/ethnicity, there are five racial/ethnic groups (American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; White, non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 4, While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using Student's t statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to 16The standard that p .05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p .05.

These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05.17 Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. Means and Taylorized standard errors were calculated by the DAS. Unweighted sample sizes are not available from the DAS and were provided by NCES."}, {"section_title": "Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation", "text": "Many of the independent variables included in the analyses in this report are related, and to some extent the pattern of differences found in the descriptive analyses reflect this covariation. For example, when examining the propensity to leave postsecondary education without a credential by institution type, it is possible that some of the observed relationship is due to differences in other factors related to institution type, such as nontraditional student characteristics, grade point average, and so on. However, if nested tables were used to isolate the influence of these other factors, cell sizes would become too small to identify the significant differences in patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, other methods must be used to take such variation into account. The method used in this report estimates adjusted means with regression models, an approach sometimes referred to as communality analysis. For the multivariate analyses reported here, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables.18 Each independent variable is divided into several discrete categories. To find an estimated mean value on the dependent variable for each category of an independent variable, while adjusting for its covariation with other independent variables in the equation, substitute the following in the equation: (1) a one in the category's term in the equation, (2) zeroes for the other categories of this variable, and (3) the mean proportions for all other independent variables. This procedure holds the impact of all remaining independent variables constant, and differences between adjusted means of categories of an independent variable represent hypothetical groups that are balanced or proportionately equal on all other characteristics included in the model as independent variables."}]
