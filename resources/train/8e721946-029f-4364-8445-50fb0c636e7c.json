This study investigates the variables that explain teacher self-efficacy in Turkey and South Korea according to TALIS 2008 data. A detailed comparison was conducted and the state of the teaching profession in both countries is discussed.\nThe study aims to compare the teaching profession in Turkey and South Korea in relation to teacher self-efficacy.\nMethod: Data relating to a total of 6194 teachers participating in TALIS 2008 from Turkey and South Korea were re-analyzed and evaluated in relation to teacher self-efficacy. For this purpose TALIS 2008 data were taken from the OECD official web page and subjected to stepwise multiple regression analysis in relation to the variables that can explain teacher selfefficacy.\nFindings: Results indicated that in both countries, the variable that best explains the teacher self-efficacy is teacher-student relations in the school environment (TSRELAT). The second variable that best explains the teacher self-efficacy is the classroom disciplinary climate (CCLIMATE) for Turkish teachers, it is professional collaboration (TCCOLLAB) for South Korean teachers. Third variable is professional collaboration for Turkish teachers, while it is classroom disciplinary climate and teacher's job satisfaction in South Korean teachers. Job satisfaction is the fourth variable that explains the teacher perception of self-efficacy in Turkey. Lastly, while the respect given for the teaching profession within the society appears to be a weak variable for explaining self-efficacy level of Turkish teachers; it appears to be a more effective variable for South Korean * Assist.

These exams are administered by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) of the OECD. South Korea ranks among the top five countries in international examinations, such as PISA exams, held every three years since 2000, and the TIMMS exam, which assesses science and mathematics achievement and has been administered every four years since 1995. The average scores of the South Korean students are well above the OECD average. South Korea was founded in 1948 after World War II. The Civil War between 1950 and 1953 had negative effects on the country. According to Lee, Kim and Byun (2012) , after the Korean Civil War the country had the same per capita income as Kenya. During the period of 20-30 years following the war, the country made great strides both in their economy and democracy. Adams and Gottlieb (1993) underlined the importance of education in this significant progress (in Lee, Kim & Byun, 2012) .\nAccording to 2010 OECD data, South Korea's population was 49,394,000 and the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $28,797. Turkey's population was then 72,698,000 with a gross domestic product per capita of $15,604 (OECD, 2013b) , approximately half the amount of South Korea. The country was founded 25 years after the Republic of Turkey and launched their economic development initiatives at approximately the same time (Calisir & Gulmez, 2010) . Therefore, what is the reason for the success of South Korea in education that has managed to place the country among the major economies in today's world?\nA national curriculum is followed in schools in both Turkey and South Korea. Curricula are prepared by the Ministry of Education in South Korea (MOE, 2015a) and by the Ministry of Education in Turkey. In 2008, when the first TALIS survey was conducted, the age of completion of mandatory education in both countries was 14. Free compulsory middle school education began in 1985 in the South Korean remote island areas and was expanded to county areas between 1992 and 1994. Since 2002, all cities across the nation have adopted the compulsory education system, which spread nationwide after 2004 (MOE, 2015b) . However, in regard to participation in education, the age range is 6-17 in South Korea while it is 6-13 in Turkey (OECD, 2013a) . In other words, while the vast majority of the population in Korea participate in education beyond the mandatory education stage, the mandatory education range in Turkey cannot even be achieved.\nPrivate preparatory centres and private lessons are common in both countries due to the fact that they both have a university matriculation exam and student achievement is assessed through several centralized exams. However, from the viewpoint of student success on international exams, the average student score of Turkey cannot compete with that of South Korea. The high success of the South Korean students on international exams draws attention to the teacher training and teacher qualities. Indeed, much research (Angrist & Lavy, 1998; Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb & Wyckoff 2009; Kang & Hong, 2008) reveals the relationship between student success and teacher quality. Recent studies (Scheerens & Bosker, 1997) have revealed that the quality and methods of teaching impact student success more than the school environment. Being the first large-scale international teacher survey, TALIS 2008 investigated different variables, which may directly or indirectly affect student success (OECD, 2009a, p.90) . Based on the modern teaching view arguing that teachers are not only effective in the classroom, but also active participants in school development (Darling-Hammond et al., 2005 , as cited in OECD 2009a , TALIS investigated teachers' views and participation in in-class and out ofclass activities."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Self-Efficacy as a Factor in Student Success", "text": "The concept of self-efficacy was introduced to the literature by Albert Bandura and has been the subject of many studies. Bandura (1997) describes self-efficacy as \"an individual's self judgment about their capacity to organize and fulfil activities required to demonstrate a particular performance\". Bandura defines individual's perception of efficacy as a principal variable relating to a man's nature. Accordingly, if individuals believe that they cannot affect the result, they prefer not to do anything although they could (1997, p. 3) . According to Bandura (1997) , self-efficacy beliefs are grounded in four main resources: 1) mastery experience, 2) vicarious experiences, 3) social persuasion, and 4) physical and emotional state. Bandura suggests that as an individuals' experiences increase and they overcome some challenges, their perception of self-efficacy grows. Experiences of others and rewards and penalties received for success or failures also indirectly impact growth of self-efficacy. Bandura further states that social persuasion/recognition of their behaviour also impact the self-efficacy belief. Finally, an individual's mental state and physical and emotional state affect the perception of self-efficacy. Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (1993) assumes that an individual's perception of self-efficacy affects one's entire life, including their educational experiences. According to this theory, an individual's belief that he or she will accomplish a job with success impacts motivation, interests and success. Also, as the perceived efficacy level increases, targets go up further, and efforts and resolutions to achieve these targets increase. Student perceptions of self-efficacy and success levels have been the subject of many studies. Dogan and Bar\u0131s (2010) , in their study on the Turkish students who took the TIMMS-1999 and TIMMS-2007 exams, have suggested that students' beliefs of self-efficacy are the most important predictor in explaining success and that their TIMMS exam scores increase as their self-efficacy belief increases.\nExtensive research indicates a positive relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and students' success (Ashton & Webb, 1986; Ross, 1992; Mojavezi & Tamiz, 2012; Caprara et al., 2006) . Mojavezi & Tamiz's research (2012) has revealed that there is a high positive relationship between teacher self-efficacy and student success. Beyond its impact on the student, teacher's self-efficacy determines their behaviour in the classroom, advancing teaching skills and improving enthusiasm and motivation toward the teaching profession (Chan, 2005) . Therefore, improvement of teacher selfefficacy is important not only for increasing student success, but also for making teacher's classroom practices more effective and engaging in the profession more enthusiastically. Bandura (1997, p. 244) suggests that in efficacious schools, the teacher shares the responsibility of student success and accepts their responsibility for student development. He further suggests that in schools with a low success level, the teacher does not expect high academic achievement from students and those teachers at these schools provide less academic education and rather spend effort in ensuring class discipline (p. 245).\nA review of related literature and TALIS 2008 has concluded that the following variables (some index scores in TALIS 2008) may predict teachers' self-efficacy (see Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. TALIS 2008 index values that may explain teacher self-efficacy", "text": "Olafsson and Macdonald's (2012) study with TALIS 2008 data revealed two clusters of teachers from the countries participating in TALIS. The study divided the participating countries into two clusters: those having and those not having a culture of observation and working together. Among these countries, South Korea was found to be the top country with the highest level of observation, feedback and collective work among teachers (p. 8). As a result of the study, in which Turkey and South Korea fell into two opposite clusters (p. 8), it was suggested that political and socio-economic status affected teacher practices and was also suggested to investigate teacher training systems in different clusters. Oettingen (1995) has further recommended that perceived self-efficacy may differ depending on the culture, and therefore, perception of self-efficacy in every culture must be investigated in association with the current culture and also by investigating the school culture. Oettingen (1995, p. 151) indicated the importance of culture on self-efficacy and said it may change depending on the perception of members of a society and their interpretation of the variables that may be associated with self-efficacy.\nIn the present study, which aims to investigate the extent to which some variables of TALIS 2008 data predict teacher self-efficacy in South Korea and Turkey, the status and conditions of teacher profession were discussed."}, {"section_title": "TALIS 2008 Research", "text": "TALIS (Teaching and Learning Survey) 2008 was the first large-scale teacher survey to collect views of teachers and administrators from different countries on schools, programs and practices to provide international comparative data.

The survey was administered to teachers and administrators working at the ISCED 2 education level (starting from age 11-12 and continuing for three years) in the participating countries. This age group corresponds to the last stage of mandatory education in many countries. Twenty-four countries participated in TALIS 2008, and the views of teachers and administrators about topics such as professional development, teaching-learning processes and the teaching profession were identified. Thus, county profiles were identified according to the teacher and administrator views about the education systems (OECD, 2009a) . TALIS 2008 provided data for the following four dimensions in the schooling processes of the participant countries (OECD, 2009b, p. 6).\n1-The role and functioning of school leadership 2-How teachers' work is appraised and the feedback they receive 3-Teachers' professional development 4-Teachers' beliefs and attitudes about teaching and their pedagogical practices\nAs result of TALIS 2008, many indices were developed for these four dimensions.

Each school that participated in the research was assumed to be a separate cluster and teachers at these schools were considered as subsets within these clusters. Thus, the schools may be considered as primary or macro units, and the teachers as micro or secondary units. During the sample determination process, national units of each country in charge of conducting the TALIS research sent a list of schools providing ISCED 2 level education to the Canadian Statistics Institute (Statistics Canada). There the participant schools were grouped in proportion to their size, and a list of teachers teaching at ISCED2 level and eligible to participate in the survey was sent to the national centres. National centres identified the teachers to participate in the research by a random sampling method using IEA DPC program. On average, 200 schools from each country and 20 teachers from each school participated in the research (OECD, 2009b, p. 8) . Sampling weight was used to generalize the findings obtained from samples selected by random sampling method for the entire education system. Sample weight is a method used to reduce the probability of unfit selection of schools or teachers. If group response has a low probability of representation, this is offset by a high sample weight, or reversely, as a response's probability of representation increases, its sample weight decreases (OECD, 2009b, p. 23 ). In the present study teacher weight values were used and also the standard error and standard deviation scores, depending on the teacher weight values, were indicated in the analyses.\nThis study was conducted in line with the views of 6,194 teachers from Turkey and South Korea who participated in TALIS 2008. The TALIS survey was conducted with teachers instructing at ISCED 2 level (starting from age 11-12 and continuing for three years) in the OECD countries. The age group that was administered the TALIS survey in South Korea corresponds to the first part of the secondary education. The survey was administered to teachers at the first level of secondary education (the last three years of the mandatory education). In 2008, when the research was conducted, participants from Turkey were 6th, 7th and 8th grade teachers working at primary schools. Data was collected through questionnaires applied on-line or on paper by the national centres in each country. All of the teachers in Turkey and South Korea completed the questionnaire on-line (OECD, 2010, p. 85) Age groups of the participating teachers are provided in Table 5 . As seen in Table 5 , the age range of the teachers participating in the research from Turkey is younger than those from Korea. While 56.4% of the teachers participating in the research from Turkey were under age 40, 61.7% of those from South Korea were above age 40. Table 6 lists the fields of the teachers that participated in the TALIS research. Of those recruited for the survey, 109 teachers from Turkey and 66 teachers from South Korea did not respond to this question. Fields of study of the 6,019 teachers who did respond are shown in Table 6 . According to this, the majority of the teachers participating in the research from both countries are mother tongue and foreign language teachers. Mathematics, science and social sciences teachers follow them. "}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "The data file that contains the information for Turkish and South Korean teachers' answers in TALIS 2008 was downloaded from http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TALIS#. For secondary analysis of the data IDBAnalyzer 3 program, developed by IEA to analyse large-scale data, was used. First, the questionnaires of the teachers from the two countries were merged in the \"merge\" module of the IDBAnalyzer 3 program, and thereafter, the data was analysed in the \"analysis\" module. Data were analysed using the teacher weighted average, percentage calculations and regression analysis in the IDBAnalyzer 3 program. Standard error and standard deviation values are presented in the tables.\nStepwise multiple regression analysis was used in data analysis. However, before the analyses, the correlation coefficients between variables and VIF (variance inflation factors) for each variable were calculated to determine if there was a multicollinearity between the variables. Viewing the correlation between the variables (see Table 7 ), there is a moderate relationship between teacher self-efficacy (SELFEF) and other variables in both countries. Overall, there is a low or moderate relationship between the variables. When Table 8 is examined, it is apparent that the VIF values of the variables range between 1.07 and 1.16. Multicollinearity exists if VIFj \u2265 10 (Keith, 2006) . There is no multicollinearity between the variables in this study that may preclude a regression analysis. Table 9 presents the results of exploratory factor analysis of the TALIS 2008 indices used in this study. When the table is examined, index findings in both countries are seen to present a valid structure. OECD 2010, Technical Report pp. 176, 179, 183, 204 As indicated in the TALIS report (OECD, 2009b, p. 74) , while the scales are reliable (See Table 10 ) in terms of configural and metric invariance, the scalar invariance is not achieved in general, and it is therefore warned that some indices cannot be used for direct comparison. However, it is stated that the scale's invariance coefficient for the index scores used in the present study (SELFEF, CCLIMATE, TSRELAT, TCCOLLAB) are fit for international comparison and that it is possible to make a comparison (OECD, 2010). "}, {"section_title": "Validity and Reliability", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The TALIS study revealed that the teachers from South Korea had low perception of self-efficacy, although their students showed high success in international exams. This finding is not congruent with the findings in the literature (Ashton & Webb, 1986; Ross, 1992; Caprara et al., 2006) suggesting that there is a directly proportional relationship between teacher self-efficacy and student success. South Korean teachers had the lowest self-efficacy (X = -.77, se = .02) among the teachers participating in TALIS 2008 from 23 countries.\nIn the present study, predictors of teachers' self-efficacy were defined. TALIS 2008 data was re-analyzed and job satisfaction of the teachers, the value of the teaching profession within society (from the teacher's point of view), and how well some TALIS 2008 indices (CCLIMATE, TSRELAT, TCCOLLAB) can predict the teacher perception of self-efficacy in Turkey and South Korea were investigated (See Figure 1) For job satisfaction, while 15.78% of the teachers in Turkey indicated that they were not satisfied with their job, the rate of teachers who shared the same view was 10.86% in South Korea (See Table 11 ). In both countries, more than 80% of the teachers still reported that they were satisfied with their jobs. Kuzgun, Sevim and Hamamci (1999) suggested that job satisfaction may be influenced by different factors (income level, awards and recognition, job security, advancement opportunity, etc.). However, scarcity or plenitude of workplace conditions does not directly lead to job satisfaction in that satisfaction depends on the importance attached by the individual to these factors. Although there are significant differences between the conditions of teachers in South Korea and Turkey, participants in the TALIS 2008 survey expressed similar views about job satisfaction. In terms of salary, which is one of the factors that may explain job satisfaction, there are significant differences between the teachers in the two countries. Among the OECD countries, South Korea gives the highest raises for teacher salaries (Lee & Yoo, 2000) . A teacher at the first level of secondary education earns an average of $52,699 annually by the time they are midway through their career. This figure is well above the OECD average ($41,701) (CIEB, 2015) . Teachers who start working with an annual salary of $30,401 can reach $84,529 by the end of their career, which is much higher than the highest OECD average ($51,317) . In South Korea, teacher salaries always tend to be higher than that of other professions in the country (Lee & Yoo, 2000) . On the other hand, in Turkey, although starting teacher salaries in Turkey ($23,494) (OECD, 2013c) is above the gross domestic per capita level ($17,034 for 2011), salary raises and improvements are very low compared to South Korea (maximum $27,201 per annum) (OECD, 2013c). While teachers can earn twice the income per capita in South Korea as their career progresses, teachers in Turkey can only earn a little over their starting salary even if they demonstrate great success.\nIn terms of employees' rights of teachers working at private and public schools, teachers in South Korea have more advantages than their counterparts in Turkey. There can be significant differences in salaries of teachers working at private and public schools in Turkey. However, Lee & Yoo (2000) report that teachers working at private and public school in South Korea's education system earn the same salary (based on experience and seniority) and differences are paid by the state if private schools do not pay the same salary (p. 3). This practice is crucial in preserving the status and value of the teaching profession. In return, preserving the status of the profession leads to the teaching profession still being one of the most preferred programs among the students taking university exams (CIEB, 2015) . Thus, the most successful students strive to become teachers in the country that allows for advancement of qualified teachers. By contrast, in Turkey, although there have been attempts to improve the teaching profession since 1950s, this aim has still not been achieved, due to the profession is not preferred by successful students because of its low socio-economic status (Deniz & Sahin, 2006) . In South Korea, 5% of the most successful students taking the university exam prefer the teaching profession (Kwon & Ju, 2012) . Kwon & Ju (2012) attribute it to the respect held for the profession within the society according to the traditional understanding based on the teachings of Confucius, job security and high salary offered by the profession.\nTeaching is among the most preferred professions in South Korea and well respected by the society (Kim, 2009; Sorensen, 1994) . Shin & Koh (2005) report that education is highly valued in the Far Eastern societies because of the impact of Confucius' teachings. In South Korea, there are regulative studies to improve the teaching profession in the society. It is seen that law also protects the prestige of the teaching profession in South Korea. The \"Teaching Profession Status Enhancement Act\" dated 2008 introduced regulations regarding how the status of the teaching profession in the society must be preserved. The same act stipulated to create a \"council for improving the status of the teaching profession\" in each metropolitan area to preserve and improve the status of teaching profession (MOE, 2008) .\nAccording to the TALIS 2008 data, the majority of the teachers in Turkey think that their profession is recognized as a respectable profession by the society (See Table 12 ). 71.60% of the teachers participating in the research from Turkey (n: 2239) think that their profession is perceived as a respectable profession by the society. However, contrary to the views in the literature (Kim, 2009; Shin & Koh, 2005) , only 41.67% of the teachers (n: 1211) in South Korea think that their profession is respected by the society. Descriptive statistics are given in Table 13 . When the table is examined, the teachers' self-efficacy is seen to be very low in South Korea. This finding is not congruent with the findings in the literature correlating the student success with the teacher self-efficacy (Ashton & Webb, 1986; Ross, 1992; Mojavezi & Tamiz, 2012; Caprara et al., 2006) . The classroom disciplinary climate (CCLIMATE) index scores are lower among the South Korean teachers. In other words, there is a more negative classroom discipline in South Korea. Also in terms of teacher-student relations (TSRELAT), the teachers in South Korea demonstrate a more negative attitude. In terms of professional collaboration (TCCOLLAB), teachers in South Korea are far more advanced than their counterparts in Turkey. It is worth mentioning here the different practices of experience sharing. Team teaching is a method that has been preferred by teachers in many countries in recent years (Tajino & Walker, 1998; Welch, 2000) . Although there may be some uncertainties in division of tasks among the teachers instructing as a team, it is preferred by the field teachers in Japan and South Korea (Anderson & Speck, 1998; Welch, 2000) because of its positive impact on student success. Although the literature discusses practices such as co-teaching and team teaching and their differences (Welch, 2000) , the principal goal is to have the teachers from the same field teach together and share their experiences. To the question, \"How often do you teach with your colleagues as a team?\" 2039 out of 3077 teachers (66.3%) in Turkey responded \"never\". By contrast, 72.4% of the teachers from South Korea reported that they taught with their colleagues as a team at least once a year. This result is an important finding that indicates the difference between the professional solidarity and collaboration between the teachers in the two countries.\nIn the TALIS 2008 research, the teachers were asked about observing their colleagues' classes and providing feedback. 1917 teachers among 3093 (62%) in Turkey responded to this question as \"never\". On the other hand, the percentage of teachers who responded as \"never\" from South Korea was only 5.5% (n: 159). 78.4% of the teachers from South Korea reported that they observed other colleagues and provided feedback at least once a year. The percentage in Turkey was 26.5%. This significant difference between the two countries in observing colleagues' classes and providing feedback is an important finding that indicates the different perspectives of the teachers concerning their profession. In the literature, observing colleagues and providing feedback is regarded as an approach that improves education (Blackwell, 1996; Cosh, 1999) . In South Korea, teachers tend to benefit from each other's experiences by observing colleague's classes and holding collective discussions. However, in Turkey, teachers view their classrooms as a part of their privacy. TALIS results also suggest that the more feedback teachers receive, the more their self-confidence increases in the teaching process (TALIS, 2009) . When evaluated in this respect, it is important for teachers to develop a habit of observing each other's classes and providing feedback. The results of the stepwise multiple regression, indicating how well different variables explain teacher self-efficacy, is provided in Table 14 . According to this, the relationship between the teachers' self-efficacy (SELFEF) and the independent variables is R=.45 for the teachers in Turkey and R=.53 for the teachers in South Korea.\nIn both countries, the variable that best explains the teacher perception of selfefficacy is teacher-student relations in the school environment (TSRELAT) (Turkey \u03b2 =. 26, South Korea \u03b2 = 24). While the second variable that best explains the teacher self-efficacy is the classroom disciplinary climate (CCLIMATE) in Turkey (\u03b2=.17, p<.01), it is professional collaboration (TCCOLLAB) in South Korea (\u03b2 = 20, p <. 01). The third variable is professional collaboration in Turkey (\u03b2=.12, p<.01) , while it is classroom disciplinary climate (\u03b2=.16, p<.01) and teachers' job satisfaction (\u03b2=.16, p<.01) in South Korea. Job satisfaction is the fourth variable that explains the teacher perception of self-efficacy in Turkey (\u03b2=.11, p<.01). Lastly, while the respect for the teaching profession within the society appears to be a weak variable for explaining the self-efficacies of Turkish teachers (\u03b2=.06), it appears to be a more effective variable for South Korean teachers (\u03b2=.14). All the variables explain 22% (F (5, 3027) = 198.92; p<.01) of the variance in Turkey and 28% (F (5, 2866) = 214,916; p<.01) of the variance in Korea in relation to teacher self-efficacy. This is a good degree of explanation for a large-scale research finding to make a generalization about the teachers across the country."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Recommendations", "text": "This study investigated the teaching profession in Turkey and South Korea in relation to teacher self-efficacy, an important variable that may impact student success. Secondary analysis of TALIS 2008 data was conducted in order to find out variables that best explain self-efficacy. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to reveal the state of the teaching profession in both countries. No difference was found between the teachers of the two countries in terms of job satisfaction. A significant difference was found in favour of the South Korean teachers in terms of sharing professional experience and observing colleagues.\nIn terms of teacher self-efficacy, the teacher-student relation in the school environment is the most important factor in explaining the teachers' perception of self-efficacy in both countries. While the classroom disciplinary climate may explain the teacher self-efficacy better in Turkey, for South Korean teachers, collaboration with colleagues appears to be more indispensable. This result suggests that the disciplinary climate in the teacher's classroom in Turkey is more effective and collaboration with colleagues in South Korea is more effective in creating a perception of self-efficacy. The degree of the variables discussed in the study to explain the teacher perception of self-efficacy in both countries is quite respectable. Conducted with re-analysis of TALIS 2008, the present study reveals important findings regarding the condition of teachers in Turkey and South Korea. There is also a need for similar studies focusing on the practices of different countries."}]
