Our results relax several arbitrary assumptions made in The Bell Curve.

In addition, our analysis casts doubt on some of The Bell Curve' s claims concerning reverse discrimination in education.\nWe appreciate useful comments from"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The Bell Curve is perhaps the most reviewed book in the social sciences. Even more of an honor (among scientists), its analyses are also among the most replicated (Currie and Thomas, 1997; Cawley, Heckman, et al., 1997; Dickens, Kane and Schultz, 1996; Hout, et al., 1996; Korenman and Winship, 1996) . Until now, these replications have relied on the dataset analyzed by the authors of The Bell Curve, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).\nThis study replicates both the original analysis in The Bell Curve and that of several of the previous replications using a new dataset, the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS) and its three follow-ups through 1994. This survey covers youth from approximately ages 14 to 20 (eighth grade to sophomore year of college). It permits testing many of the predictions of The Bell Curve concerning how test scores and family background affect educational outcomes such as dropping out of high school and attending college, as well as other outcomes such as teen pregnancy and arrests.\nThe analysis here proceeds in two phases. First, we follow Herrnstein and Murray's (H&M) methods in The Bell Curve rather closely. We replicate H&M's finding that test scores often being more important than their narrow index of socioeconomic status in predicting youths' outcomes, although the socioeconomic status index is relatively more important in our dataset.\nWe then relax many of the arbitrary assumptions H&M make, as have other researchers who have replicated their results analyzing the NLSY. As these other replications have found, test scores remain important predictors of outcomes even with rich controls for family background. At the same time, and also as other replications have found, H&M's assignment of primary role to test scores is not robust to including richer measures of family background. In contrast, we find that the skills measured by standard cognitive tests are often only a fourth to a tenth as important as our measures of family background in predicting outcomes.\nWe also replicate H&M's analysis of black-white gaps in education, fertility out of wedlock, and arrests. H&M find that gaps in test scores explain (in a statistical sense) more than 100% of the gap in education. They interpret the resulting higher education of blacks than whites with similar test scores as evidence of reverse discrimination. We find that differences in family background are roughly as important as differences in test scores, and that the evidence is much less clear concerning the importance of reverse discrimination, differences in \"culture,\" differences in skills and attitudes unmeasured by the tests, or test bias."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "Following H&M, this paper first analyzes a sample of white respondents to compare the relative importance of test scores and family background for predicting youths' outcomes. It then analyzes the relative importance of these two sets of factors in \"explaining\" (in a statistical sense) the racial gap in many of the outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Test scores \"versus\" family background", "text": "Following Herrnstein and Murray, we use an integrated framework for analyzing the determinants of a wide array of outcomes: high school dropout, entering college, unmarried teen pregnancy, and arrests. (The youth of the NELS respondents precludes an analysis of labor market outcomes such as wages.) The basic method The Bell Curve's empirical section was a \"horse race\" between an index of test scores known as the AFQT and a measure of family background in predicting important life events. H&M assert that test scores explain most of the explainable variance of outcomes.\nIn their discussion of public policy, they provide evidence that large and long-term improvement in test scores are difficult to achieve. (Fischer, et al., 1996 , summarize the evidence somewhat differently.) Thus, Herrnstein and Murray conclude that public policy interventions are unlikely to be successful at increasing the living standards of the disadvantaged.\nAs noted in the introduction to this Symposium, these horse races have two important problems when used to evaluate policy. First, test scores are not solely a measure of almostimmutable general cognitive ability, and the correlation between test scores and outcomes such as college attendance may not be solely due to how well scores measure cognitive ability.\nFor example, test scores are partly a function of family background. Endogenous test scores are particularly likely to be a problem in the NLSY, where many of the highest-scoring respondents did not complete the cognitive test until they were in college, while many of the lowest-scoring respondents had already dropped out of high school (Fischer, et al., 1996) .\nHence, education partially caused test scores in the NLSY, as well as being caused by them. The result is that correlations of test scores with outcomes such as completing high school can be misleading. Respondents to the NELS all took the first cognitive achievement test in eighth grade, diminishing this problem.\nAlthough the NELS solves the problem of the test being given after differing amounts of schooling, the tests given in the NELS are designed to be school achievement tests in reading and mathematics. Cognitive tests such as those in the NLSY and NELS measure a combination of at least five factors: the trait of general cognitive ability; the quality of schooling and other influences on educational achievement; skill at taking tests; test bias; and other dimensions of the person's personality or upbringing such as comfort with taking tests and willingness to work hard at the meaningless task of taking a multiple choice test for researchers. A debate continues on the relative mix of these three factors for each test. (Fischer, et al. [1996] and H&M review this debate, coming to rather different conclusions.) The tests in the NELS, although not too different from the reading and mathematics sections of the AFQT in the NLSY, were specifically designed to measure what students have learned in school. As such, these cognitive tests should be more influenced by school quality than a test specifically designed to measure general cognitive ability.\nWhen test scores are used to predict college attendance, they are particularly likely to over-state the importance of cognitive ability. Many colleges use tests very similar to those in the NELS to evaluate applicants (for example, the SAT). If people of similar cognitive ability vary in their comfort taking tests, then those who are most comfortable will typically have higher scores on both the NELS tests and college admissions tests. Thus, the correlation between the NELS test scores and college attendance may partially capture comfort with or motivation on tests, thereby over-stating the importance of cognitive ability.\nThe second problem with H&M's analysis occurs when they imply that if test scores are the most important predictors of outcomes, then policy interventions are not a good idea. In fact,\nfor policy purposes what matters is the cost-effectiveness of an intervention, not the relative contribution a variable makes in predicting outcomes. Thus, if test scores predict ten percent of the variance of an outcome and school quality predicts only 1 percent, that result does not imply that we should abandon attempts to improve schools. Instead, potential improvements in school should be evaluated by comparing their costs and benefits.\nWith these cautions in mind, it remains interesting to identify the relative importance of test scores and family background in determining youths' outcomes. In posing a horse race between test scores and family background, H&M asked the wrong question. We are somewhat uncomfortable continuing to analyze this wrong question. At the same time, H&M published a widely-read set of answers that others have found to be misleading. Moreover, given that public policies may be made based on their analysis, it is important to examine whether H&M or their critics are correct in analyzing the relative importance of test scores and family background. As an additional justification for this study, H&M's results are easy to remember, even if not robust.\nIt is important that if people are only going to remember a little bit about what determines success (cognitive ability vs. family background) that they remember the correct summary of the evidence (Dickens, et al., 1997) . Our final justification is that by examining a different dataset that was collected a decade after the NLSY, we provide a check on the robustness of both sets of analyses.\nThe method of The Bell Curve is straightforward. Outcome variables were regressed (often using logistic regression) against a measure of test scores and an index of family background. (Sometimes other control variables such as age were included.) The index of family background was constructed as a weighted average of family income, the larger of the parents' education, and the larger of the parents' occupational status. The relative importance of test scores vs. the index of family background was measured by simulating how a one standard deviation increase in each affected the predicted probability of each outcome, holding the other predictor constant at its mean.\nAs a number of authors have pointed out, this \"horse-race\" procedure has two important limitations (Hout, et al., 1996; Dickens et al, 1996; Heckman, 1995; Korenman and Sanders, 1996) . First, it restricts the coefficients of each component of the index of family background to have an identical effect. Thus, a one standard deviation increase in parental education is constrained to have the same effect on the outcome as a one standard deviation increase in family income. The assumption of equal effect has no theoretical basis. Furthermore, when the assumption is tested empirically, it is almost always rejected.\nThe second problem with this index is that it omits a number of family characteristics that generations of social science research have identified as important predictors of lifetime outcomes, including whether both parents are present, birth order, and region. Casting the net a bit wider, the technique omits measures of neighborhood and school characteristics that may also be important predictors of youth's success. In this case, the portion of the explained variance that is shared by both test scores and family background is actually due to family background. (In our data set, family background explains 27 percent of the variance of test scores among the white students.) In this setting, the appropriate measure of the role of the abilities measured by test scores is the incremental R 2 of test scores, after family background has already been entered into the regression.\n1 The pseudo-R 2 is defined as (1 -L 1 /L 0 ), where L 1 is the likelihood function with all the included variables, and L 0 is the likelihood function with only the constant. For the linear model, this formula yields the same results as the traditional R 2 . In the logistic model, it rescales the likelihood function from zero (fits as well as the constant-only model) to 1 (perfect prediction; that is, log-likelihood=0) We follow H&M in relying on the pseudo-R 2 but we acknowledge that it is not precisely correct to use increments to pseudo-R 2 to measure \"importance\" of a set of Because social scientists traditionally compare individual coefficients, Fischer, et al. (1996) and Dickens, et al. (1997) create indices that sum up the effects of a bundle of family characteristics. Given the complicated causal paths between parental genetic endowments, family background, and test scores, it is safest to pay attention to results that are robust to both the upper and lower bounds provided by the changes in (psuedo-)R2. Nevertheless, social scientists are used to head-to-head comparisons in a regression framework. Thus, we computed how a one standard deviation \"change\" in family background affected each outcome and compared it to the effect of a one standard deviation change in test scores.\nWe used the method of Dickens, et al. (1997) . We first estimated the logistic equation predicting outcomes as a function of family background and test scores. For each person, we multiplied the logit coefficient vector by that individual's family background to create a family background index. (That is, the family background index is a weighted average of people's family background, with the logit coefficients providing the weights.) The standard deviation of these scores was then used to represent a \"one standard deviation increase in family background.\" The standard logit formula for the effect of a one unit change in an explanatory variable then gave us the change in probability of an outcome for someone one standard deviation above average in family background compared to someone with mean family background. (Specifically, dP/dX = m*(1-m)*s.d.(family background index), where m = the mean of the outcome variable. The dP/dX calculated with this formula is not be directly comparable to the odds ratio presented by variables. As discussed below, our results are consistent enough that alternative measures of \"importance\" would not change them substantively.\nthe logit regressions because it evaluates a discrete change, while the logit examines continuous changes.)\nInteractions: It is traditional in the literature on cognitive ability and family background to treat these two complicated phenomena as distinct. In fact, many outcomes may depend on an interaction of the two. For example, graduating high school may be almost a sure thing for a youth having high test scores or from prosperous families --only the combination of lacking both puts the youth at risk. Conversely, entering graduate school may be especially likely when students have both high cognitive ability and prosperous families, while either one alone has little effect. Thus, we will test for interactions between family background and performance on cognitive tests.\nThe within-school estimator: A contribution of this paper is the ability to control for many features of the respondent's junior high school, neighborhood, and high school. This feature is possible because the dataset has multiple respondents (typically 25) for each junior high school.\nThe method is to construct a within-school estimator that evaluates how youth with test scores higher or lower than their school average (or family backgrounds more or less privileged than their school average) achieve compared to the school average. Because we are estimating logistic equations, we use the conditional logit procedure to derive consistent within-school estimators (McFadden, 1974) . The estimate is similar to a fixed effect estimator using panel data. (Because our outcomes are discrete, the ordinary least squares fixed effect estimator is not consistent [Hsiao, 1986] .)\nControlling for average school quality with the within-school estimator eliminates the bias due to omitted school characteristics that are common for all students within the junior high school. This estimator also controls for characteristics of the family, high school, and neighborhood that respondents within a junior high school share.\nOur within-school estimator controls for junior high school, although during most of our sample period the respondents were in high school Controlling for junior high schools is useful because junior high schools are usually smaller than high schools, implying that this measure captures more aspects of the respondent's neighborhood. In addition, the choice of junior high school may be less likely to be influenced by career plans or other outcomes we study. For example, over two percent of our sample changed schools to attend a magnet high school; many magnet schools have a career orientation.\nWorking in the other direction, somewhat more junior high school students attend private schools than do high school students (16.7% vs. 11.6%); the gap was smaller for non-religious private schools most likely to be endogenous (4.1% vs. 3.7%).\n2 Controls for junior high school also omit important differences between the high schools that students from the same junior high may attend. Moreover, the within-school estimator does not control for all aspects of a students experience. For example, many schools put students in different tracks that lead to very different experiences. It is possible, although not clear, that family background and race influence the track students are placed on, even controlling for test scores (Gamoran, 1989; Lucas and Gamoran, 1991) .\nA further consequence of the NELS data having roughly 25 students per school is that the errors in logistic regressions are correlated among students. Thus, computed standard errors are biased downward. As discussed below, the conditional logit and logit results are typically quite similar. Moreover, our primary results have coefficient estimates that are many times their standard errors. Together, these results suggest this bias does not affect the interpretation of our results."}, {"section_title": "What Explains Racial Differences in Outcomes?", "text": "For most measures of social outcomes, blacks fare worse than whites. For example, blacks are more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to go to college, and more likely to bear a child out of wedlock. A crucial question is understanding the source of these differences.\nThis question can be phrased as a statistical decomposition: how much of the difference in outcomes can be predicted by different characteristics of blacks and whites, how much of the difference can be predicted by different returns to the characteristics of blacks and whites, and how much remains unexplained even if blacks and whites had identical characteristics and returns (that is, how much is due to differences in the intercept [Oaxaca and Ransom, 1994] . As discussed below, this decomposition is a statistical exercise, not necessarily causal.\nIn principle, the estimated black-white gap in an outcome is the difference in mean residuals for respondents of each race. As is usual with residuals, they represent our ignorance.\nIn spite of this feature, social scientists and social commentators frequently interpret residuals.\nFor example, many scholars have attributed the black-white wage gap to discrimination. Going to the other extreme, Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) attribute the wage gap to lower unmeasured human capital for blacks.\nIn some settings, racial gaps in outcomes favor the minority. The problem of interpreting the residual remains. For example, Mason (1996) Haveman and Wolfe (1994: 170-173) and Maxwell (1994) also find that differences in family characteristics completely explain (in a statistical sense) differences between black and white rates of dropping out of high school. 4 High unobserved human capital conditional on test scores is conceptually similar to and empirically identical to having a biased test. H&M cite several reviews of the evidence and conclude that no such bias exists (p. 281). When they later find evidence consistent with test bias, they interpret it as reverse discrimination. In contrast, Fischer, et al. (1996) , and Dickens, et al., (1997) scores. This is the method followed in most studies of racial differences. Our more flexible decomposition permits us to test for differences in returns (c 1 and c 2 not equal to zero).\nThis method uses a first-order Taylor series to decompose the racial differences in This formulation uses white coefficients and mean characteristics as the baseline. As a robustness check, we also perform the complementary decomposition using black coefficients and black mean characteristics as the baseline (Neumark, 1988) .\nFor the purposes of these decompositions we estimate the outcome equations using ordinary least squares (OLS). The estimated coefficients from the OLS were very similar to the changes in probabilities we estimated with an identical probit equation. We relied on OLS estimation instead of probit or logit because the OLS decomposition is easier to understand.\nThese decompositions ignore the causal links between test scores, race, and family background. The raw gap in test scores between blacks and whites is .75 standard deviations.\nControlling for the indicators of family background in this data set lowers this gap to .41 standard deviations. More complete measures of family background might further narrow the unexplained gap. The regression analysis we perform does not acknowledge the causal priority of family background, but puts test scores and family background on a level playing field.\nSimilarly, there is substantial evidence that blacks live in worse neighborhoods in large part due to discrimination in housing markets (e.g., Kingsley and Turner, 1993; Farley and Frey, 1992) . Our method attributes some of the effects of racially-motivated housing discrimination as the effect of disadvantaged neighborhood --again, a more complete causal model would increase the role of race.\nThe within-school estimator: It is possible that the decompositions of educational outcomes are largely due to differences in the quality of students' schools or neighborhoods.\nBlacks are disproportionately concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend less desirable schools. Many analysts predict that disadvantaged neighborhoods will disadvantage students. Thus, controlling for school characteristics, especially with use of a within-junior-highschool estimator, should reduce the black disadvantage in education and other outcomes.\nAt the same time, it may be that on average blacks attend less demanding high schools. In the NELS data, for example, if we examine blacks and whites with identical grade point averages, the blacks have on average test scores 0.68 standard deviation lower. It is possible that a student who would fail at a rigorous high school would successfully complete a high school degree in a less rigorous school. If lower rigor increases completion at (on average) less rigorous mostly minority schools, then blacks will have lower dropout rates than similar whites. In addition, to the extent that selective colleges use class rank, such colleges will give an advantage to students from less demanding schools --that is, on average, to blacks. Thus, the combination of high school segregation by race and use of class rank in admissions can increase Black college attendance at selective colleges."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS) is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics and carried out by the Bureau of the Census. 5 NELS is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. The base-year (1988) survey was a multifaceted study questionnaire with four cognitive tests, and questionnaires for students, teachers, parents, and the school.\nSampling was first conducted at the school level and then at the student level within schools. The data were drawn from a nationally representative sample of 1,000 schools (800 public schools and 200 private schools, including parochial institutions). Within this school sample, 25,000 eighth grade students were selected at random. The three follow-ups revisited the same sample of students in 1990, 1992, and 1994 ; that is, when most of the respondents were in the tenth grade, in the twelfth grade, and roughly two years after high school graduation.\nFollowing H&M, we first study a sample of non-Hispanic whites. The second section compares non-Hispanic whites with Blacks.\nThe cognitive / achievement tests: 6 In addition to the student questionnaire, students completed a series of cognitive tests covering reading comprehension, mathematics, science, and history/citizenship/geography. \"There is a reasonable consensus that [general cognitive ability] can be measured by summing across tests of several specific aptitudes, usually verbal and quantitative\" (Chatman and O'Reilly, 1994) . Thus, we make use of combined scores on the reading and mathematics tests. We analyze the equally-weighted average of the standardized reading and mathematics scores. For the small number of test takers (fewer than 1 percent) who had only a reading or a mathematics score but not both, the composite is based on the single available score.\nThe NELS design team created the composite score to be a \"simple, overall... measure of cognitive ability to use as a control variable for cross-sectional analysis of data\" (NELS, 1994) .\nUnfortunately, the composite score is an imperfect measure of \"cognitive ability.\" The test items 6 These tests are described in more detail in Rock and Pollach, 1995. are similar to those on a typical school achievement test; that is, items are designed to measure what most 14 year olds have been exposed to in classes. Although classroom learning is related to cognitive ability, it is affected by many other attributes of the family, teachers, school and neighborhood. Some of those additional factors are controlled for in the regressions below, but others remain omitted. Thus, the regressions below attribute to test scores the advantages both of high cognitive ability and of the other advantages of the youth's background that promote high levels of learning school material by age 14. (In spite of these cautions, H&M argue that related tests such as the SAT are good proxies for general cognitive ability. In addition, other researchers have used related achievement tests such as the GMAT as proxies for general cognitive ability [e.g., Chatman and O'Reilly, 1994] .)\nThe tests have high reliabilities. The reliability of each subscore (measured as the 1 minus the ratio of the average measurement error variance to the total variance) was greater than .80, and often near .90 (Rock and Pollach, 1995: 67) . We use the sum of the reading and math subscores, further increasing reliability. Unlike most tests, the NELS battery was also constructed to have similar reliabilities for different sex, racial and ethnic groups (Rock and Pollach, 1995: 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic Status Index and Rich Family Background:", "text": "We use two measures of family background, a narrow one replicating of Herrnstein and Murray's socioeconomic status (SES) index, and a broader measure.\nFirst we replicated H&M's SES index that combined parental occupational status, parental education, and family income into a single index. To do this, they converted each measure into z-scores with mean zero and standard deviation equal to one. They then took the maximum of the father's and the mother's centile of occupational status, using Duncan's measure of status.\nThey coded \"not in labor force\" as the lowest status. For education, they took the father's and the mother's z-score on education. For the third component, they took the z-score of the log of family income, coding a zero income as -4. In each case, they replaced missing values with the mean value of zero. Finally, the H&M SES Index is the standardized sum of the four z-scores for maternal and paternal education, parental occupational status, and family income.\nTo construct a richer measure of family background, we relaxed a number of the arbitrary assumptions that underlie the H&M index. First, we did not constrain the coefficients on the several components to be equal; instead, we entered parental education, parental occupational status, and family income separately. We also had no prior that the effects would be linear, and that only the higher of the two parents' occupational status and education mattered. Thus, we entered the squared z-score of family income, and both parents' occupational status and education. For predicting dropouts and starting college, we included a measure of whether either parent dropped out or started college, respectively. Because students with missing values are likely to be missing parents, we included dummies for important missing values.\nFollowing other replications of The Bell Curve, we included a number of variables that are potential indicators of advantaged family background: region, rural vs. urban vs. suburban, foreign language spoken in home, whether the mother or father foreign born, number of siblings, whether two parents are present in the home, and whether the home has a library card, magazines, and many books.\nTo supplement this fairly standard list, we drew from a wide range of measures that prior research suggested indicated advantages or disadvantages for youth. Thus, we included measures from all four of the NELS questionnaires for characteristics of the parents, teachers, students, and school.\nFrom the parental questionnaire, we took indicators for whether the family was one of five religions, and any of five levels of religious observance. We controlled for whether the youth was in a single-parent home in eighth grade, his or her parents were divorced or separated while the youth was in high school, and whether a single parent became married. We constructed a variable indicating whether at least one parent was working full time (or, in two-parent households, if both were working part-time). We created this measure of \"full-time equivalent worker\" twice, once when the youth was in eighth grade and then again four years later. We controlled for whether at least one parent had been a teen when the youth was born. (We were unable to control for whether they were married at the time of the youth's birth.) As a catch-all to capture unmeasured aspects of the family and its support for education, we controlled for whether an older sibling had dropped out of high school by the time the respondent was in eighth grade. (This measure is a simple approximation to the within-family estimator. A within-family estimator controls implicitly for many characteristics of the family [Korenman and Winship, 1996] .)\nWe were interested in measuring parent's involvement in the youth's life and education.\nNumerous commentators have suggested that discipline in the household, particularly concerning limits on TV, will increase student's academic achievement. Thus, we constructed simple indices of whether the family had rules concerning TV time, whether the family had other rules, and whether parents helped with homework more than once a week. As an indirect measure, we included a dummy variable for whether the child had participated in clubs such as Boy or Girl Scouts during elementary school. We also created a dummy equal to one if the parent belonged to a parent-teacher association or related organization, or volunteered at school.\nTo measure the characteristics of the students' classmates, we included dummy variables for whether the high school had less than 25 percent, or between 25 and 49 percent single parent households. We also included a dummy variable for whether the proportion minority was less than 40 percent.\nFrom the teacher questionnaire we created an index of how dangerous the teacher reports the high school as being, and an index of whether the teacher reports drugs are a problem in schools. Finally, we included the student's report of whether teaching was good at the school.\nBecause this list is rather long, we reran the analyses with a narrower list of family background variables that are closer to standard descriptions of \"advantage\" or \"disadvantage.\"\nThese results are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Interactions:", "text": "We test for the presence of interactions by interacting our summary test score measure with the summary socioeconomic status index developed by H&M. This simple specification is parsimonious--future research can examine additional interactions.\nOutcomes: We study a number of outcomes for each student. We analyze whether the respondent claims to ever have been arrested, as well as reports of ever having gone to juvenile hall. In addition to self-reports, H&M also analyze whether the respondent was ever interviewed in prison. Both miss substantial amounts of crime, whether due to under-reporting for the NELS, or lack of conviction or not being in jail during the interview week for the NLSY. There is no obvious reason to believe these differences will bias the results.\nSummary statistics: Means and standard deviations are presented in Table 1 . Six percent of the sample permanently drop out of high school, 78 percent have begun college, and 12 percent of the young women report having become pregnant out of wedlock. In contrast to the reduced form estimates we and H&M present, the structural model estimated by Jeff Grogger using the NLSY finds that test scores have no direct effect on arrest rates. He finds that high wages reduce crime, and that the capabilities measured by test scores affect crime solely through their small estimated effect on wages. He estimates that a one standard deviation increase in test scores raises wages by about 1 percent, which would lowers predicted crime per year by about .6 to .9 percent. These results would be larger if we factored in the effect of test scores on education, given that education also raises wages."}, {"section_title": "Results of the Horse Race", "text": "test scores is still large (though much smaller than with test scores entered along); a high-scoring student is three fourths likely to report being arrested as a mid-scoring student. Results are similar with the within-school (conditional logit) and head-to-head (dP/dX) estimates.\nIn results not shown, these effects were almost identical when the outcome was selfreports of whether the young man had ever been in juvenile hall. Because this self-report is plausibly more accurate, it suggests our results are not dominated by self-report biases. Results\nwere also similar for self-reported membership in a gang: test scores had a statistically significant effect, but much lower contribution to R 2 , than that of rich family background. The results are more balanced when we consider that family background is largely causally prior to test scores. Typically, H&M's SES index entered alone has a pseudo-R 2 of the same magnitude as the increment to pseudo-R 2 of test scores entered after the SES index.\nH&M's thesis that test scores are more important than family background is more dramatically reversed when the single SES index is replaced with a richer measure of family background. For all but the college-related outcomes, rich family background has a larger incremental contribution to R 2 when entered after test scores than test scores do alone. This is the extreme lower bound on the role of family background, and shows the results hold even if all of the correlation between test scores and family background is due to common parental genetic influences.\nIf we assume that family background is causally prior to test scores, the results are even more dramatic. Test scores provide between 0.5 and 5% increment to the pseudo-R 2 ; usually statistically significant, but never large. These results provide clear evidence that family background, broadly conceived, is more important (in Herrnstein and Murray's sense) in predicting outcomes than are test scores. These results replicate a number of analyses using the NLSY; these other analyses also find H&M's results are not robust to including broader measures of family background, and to relaxing the arbitrary assumptions underlying their socioeconomic status index (Fischer, et al., 1996; Dickens, et al., 1998; Korenman and Winship, 1996) . At the same time, the estimated coefficient on test scores when entered simultaneously with family background often remains large, reminding us of the difficulty in evaluating the importance of test scores vs. family background when the two are correlated.\nA perhaps surprising result is the relative unimportance of controlling for the students' junior high school. In general, the conditional logit estimates that create within-school estimates differ little from those using logits. The logit and conditional logit point estimates and explanatory power of the included variables usually do not differ substantially.\nThese results are not because schools do not differ substantially on most of the outcomes.\nTo the contrary, the standard deviation of high schools' dropout rates is 13%, twice the mean, while for college attendance the standard deviation is 24%, two fifths the mean.

Nevertheless, these figures are approximately correct.)"}, {"section_title": "Robustness checks", "text": "We performed a number of analyses to check the robustness of these results."}, {"section_title": "Measurement error on test scores:", "text": "Classical measurement error will bias down the coefficient and explanatory power of test scores. Fortunately, as noted above, the math and reading subscores have fairly high reliabilities (.80 and .89 respectively), implying that their sum has a reliability over .90.\nAugmenting the explanatory power of test scores by the standard formula for classical measurement error (that is, normally distributed and uncorrelated with the other independent variables) does not reverse the basic findings that rich family background remained a far more In fact, additional analyses of the NLSY find that a simple linear combination of test scores does not usually capture all of the useful information in the tests for predicting outcomes (Cawley, et al., 1997) . These results suggest that further analysis of test scores may increase their explanatory power. In fact, in results not shown, the explanatory power of the math and reading test scores was increased when the two scores were entered separately. When the reading and math tests were entered separately, the math test typically was more important in predicting outcomes. Because no theory suggests the relationship is linear, we also entered squared terms, which further increased the explanatory power of the regressions. In separate analyses, we analyzed the sum of the four tests, including science and history along with math and reading.\nNone of these changes reversed the basic findings that rich family background remained a far more important predictor of outcomes than test scores."}, {"section_title": "Degrees of freedom:", "text": "The reliance on relative pseudo-R 2 s and increment to R 2 s ignores the fact that the regressions include far more explanatory variables measuring rich family background than measuring test scores. Mere chance implies a higher R 2 will follow from adding more explanatory variables, even if they have no role to play in explaining outcomes. Fortunately, the very large sample relative to the number of explanatory variables suggests that this problem is not serious.\nIt is possible that the broad-ranging list of variables we included to capture family background measures factors that are not properly captured by the concept of a more or less advantaged \"family background.\" We reran results using a shorter list of variables that was closer to the concept of \"advantage\" --specifically, we dropped the indicators of region, rural vs. urban, religion, gender, and birth order. (These measures were chosen on a priori grounds, not while examining the estimated effect sizes to pick small effects.)\nWhile region is important for predicting idleness and religion is very important for predicting whether a youth drops out of high school, these changes do not have a large effect on the estimates of the pseudo-R 2 of the bundle of rich family background. For example, the pseudo-R 2 of the narrower family background list plus test scores is 29.5%, which is not too far below the pseudo-R 2 of the complete list, 33.5%. The coefficient on test scores also rose by less than one standard error. For both specifications, the explained variance of the family background vector dwarfs the incremental effect of test scores. For most of the other outcome measures, the change in pseudo-R 2 was under 1 percent and the omitted variables were barely or not at all statistically significant. The fact that dropping 15 of the 51 indicators of family background had so little effect reassures us that the \"horse race\" is not substantially misleading due to over-inclusion of variables.\nAdditional outcomes: We examined several additional outcome variables in addition to those discussed in the text, including temporary dropouts, receiving a GED vs. high school diploma, and attending a two-vs. four-year college. The results were consistent with those discussed in the text."}, {"section_title": "Interactions: No theory implies that family background and tests scores operate", "text": "independently.

In contrast, the same increase in test scores for a student with an SES index two standard deviations above average would enjoy only an 76 percent increase in the odds of attending college. This result may merely be capturing non-linearities in the relationship, because in the corresponding probit regression the interaction was not significant.

These decompositions simulate how much of the mean differences we observe between blacks and whites can be accounted for statistically by different observable characteristics of the two groups, and how much is due to different returns to those characteristics. Specifically, we estimate models with a full set of interactions between race and all of the family background and test score variables (a procedure with results identical to estimating separate regressions for each group).\nWe then take the coefficients estimated in the sample of black students and multiply them by the mean characteristics (family background, school characteristics, and test scores) of white students. This calculation measures the mean outcome we would predict if blacks had the same returns to characteristics as they do now, but had white family background and test scores. We then repeat this calculation with average white family background and school characteristics, and average black test scores. Finally, we repeat this calculation with average black family background and school characteristics, and average white test scores. percentage point lower dropout rate--that is, the simulated black dropout rate would be only one half of the actual white rate (2.6% in the simulation, vs. 5.2% for whites).\nBlacks who were not permanent dropouts were more likely to receive a GED than were whites (6.4% for blacks vs. 4.4 % for whites). Differences in both test scores and family background account for part of the gap. In the simulation, a black with mean white test scores and background would be more likely to receive a diploma, and less likely to receive a GED, than a similar white. Arrests: Almost 16 percent of the white men in this sample report having been arrested, compared to almost 22 percent of the black men. Racial differences in self-reported arrest rates are presumably due in part to different treatment of blacks and whites by the criminal justice system, and may also be influenced by different patterns of self-reporting. We are unable to measure these two potentially important factors. (Racial differences in self-reported arrest rates are discussed in Grogger, 1997.) When we simulate black men with white family backgrounds and black test scores, slightly more than half this 6 percentage point gap goes away (the gap shrinks to 3 percentage points). In the converse case, when we simulate black men with black family backgrounds and white test scores, half this 6 percentage point gap goes away (the gap again shrinks to 3 percentage points).\nFinally, when we simulate black men with mean white family backgrounds and test scores, the estimated arrest rate for blacks becomes the same as that of whites. In predicting self-reported time in juvenile hall, the gap in backgrounds is somewhat more important than the gap in test scores in explaining the gap in arrest rates, but the results are roughly similar."}, {"section_title": "Racial differences in coefficients:", "text": "In examining the coefficients for the various regressions, Blacks and whites usually had nearly identical returns to test scores. In contrast, family background typically mattered somewhat more for whites than for blacks. (The exception was in predicting out-of-wedlock fertility. Here, family background mattered more for blacks than for whites.) Nevertheless, the differences did not tend to be large --that is, the simulated racial gap for a typical youth from a quite disadvantaged family was typically similar to the gap for a youth with typical white characteristics.\nRobustness tests: Because the coefficients differ for the Black and white samples, our results could differ depending on the values where we perform the decomposition. To test for this sensitivity, we reran the decompositions for a disadvantaged white and disadvantaged Black, instead of for the mean white and Black. To do this, we constructed the profile of a \"disadvantaged\" white and disadvantaged black, moving most variables down from the mean by roughly one standard deviation. 8 We then reran the decompositions. Results were little different from those presented in the table.\nWe also performed the reverse decompositions: simulating white outcomes if they had black family backgrounds and /or test scores (Neumark, 1988) . The results were generally consistent with those presented above, with family backgrounds and test scores each independently explaining most of the gaps in education and self-reported arrest rates, and the two together explaining a substantial portion of the fertility gap.\nTo check whether our linear functional form affected the results, we performed logistic and probit regressions with dummies for race. Results were similar: Simulations using all specifications had similar amounts of \"over-explanation\" of the estimated racial gap in educational outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Overview of the decompositions:", "text": "In summary, these decompositions are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in test scores and differences in family background explain (in a statistical sense) roughly equal shares of the \"explainable\" black-white gaps in outcomes.\nConfusing any simple summary, the \"explainable\" share of the gap does not remain bounded by zero and 100%, but ranges from less than -200% to over +200%.\nThe decompositions of the racial gaps in education support more theories than they reject.\nThe result that family background matters substantially is consistent with the hypothesis that disadvantaged background is responsible for all of Blacks' higher dropout rate, and almost all of the lower Black college attendance. This result is consistent with the U.S. not providing equality of opportunity. At the same time, it also provides no evidence for the effects of racial discrimination against youth beyond those that lead to disadvantages in family background.\nSimilarly, test scores \"explain\" statistically the black-white gaps in educational attainment.\nThis result is consistent with the hypothesis that whatever leads to lower school and cognitive achievement by eighth grade also explains lower college attendance. It is, thus, consistent with notions of meritocracy, while downplaying discrimination.\nThe two results are both possible because background factors and test scores collectively \"over-explain\" the gaps in educational attainment. The result that blacks with mean white background and families are predicted to be more likely to finish start college provides no evidence for theories that blacks lack drive or ambition. For example, Mason interprets similar results in the NLSY as evidence of higher effort among blacks (1996) . Unmeasured skills are conceptually similar to test bias against blacks --a black youth with the same test scores as a white will, on average, have higher total ability. At the same time, this result is consistent with theories of reverse discrimination (H&M, ch. 19).\nTwo facts make it likely that reverse discrimination is not the main force at work. First, virtually all students get into one of their preferred colleges, even if they do not get into their first choice among highly selective college. Thus, reverse discrimination is much more likely to come into play at elite colleges than at college attendance in general (Kane, 1995) . Moreover, in this dataset the \"over-explanation\" of the education gap is roughly the same size for both high school dropouts and college attendance. Presumably, affirmative action does not lead to reverse discrimination in high schools. (However, it is possible the over-explanation for high school graduation is due to blacks on average attending less demanding high schools.)\nSimilar to the education results, differences in tests scores and family background both explain (in the statistical sense) part of the gap in childbearing out of wedlock. Unlike the education results, tests scores and family background together explain only about half the racial difference in childbearing out of wedlock. These results are consistent with different cultural rewards and sanctions for fertility out of wedlock in black families and culture.\nFor self-reported arrests and time in juvenile hall, the results are consistent: both family background and test scores mattering, and together explain the gap."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results provide no support for the hypothesis that the cognitive abilities measured by test scores are more important than family background in predicting youth's outcomes. H&M's The child's mother was a teenage parent and was foreign born. The family lived in the rural, central United States, concluded that test scores predict most outcomes far better than family background. A number of replications examine the same dataset and, by relaxing H&M's arbitrary assumptions, come to the opposite conclusion. Our results strongly support those of the other replications --family background, not test scores, are have the greatest influence on the outcomes we study.\nMulticollinearity, lack of precision concerning how much family background causes test scores, and other empirical problems preclude a precise analysis of the relative importance of the two sets of factors. Nevertheless, heuristically, family background is typically 4 to 10 times more important than the abilities measured by standard achievement tests in predicting youth's outcomes.\nThe relative unimportance of the within-school estimators suggests that family background and test scores do not primarily matter by affecting the school and neighborhood in which a youth lives. In contrast, significant past research finds important neighborhood effects on youth's outcomes (Crane, 1991) . (On the challenge of identifying context effects see Charles Manski (1993) and Robert Hauser (1970) .) It is possible that our results are due to more careful measurement of family background, and that estimated neighborhood effects actually proxy for family characteristics. Nevertheless, further research is called for to reconcile these different findings. One partial explanation for the differences may be the relatively limited between-school variance in mean achievement; it could be that schools have larger effects on the speed of learning, where the between-school variance is higher (Bryk and. Raudenbush, 1988.) Turning to racial differences, more than half the racial differences in education and in selfreported arrests can be explained (statistically) by differences in family background. More than half the racial differences can also be explained (statistically) by differences in test scores.\nIn this study we do not name the racial gaps we identify; such gaps are a measure of our ignorance. Correlational results, particularly concerning difficult-to-measure constructs such as ability and discrimination, are rarely easy to interpret. In fact, the results presented here (as are those in The Bell Curve) are consistent with discrimination (or reverse discrimination), biased tests, or unmeasured skills, culture, and energy among Black youth.\nAn implication of the common \"over-explanation\" result is that many analysts follow a procedure likely to lead to false acceptance of their theory. Because decompositions such as and the child attended a school which the teacher claims is dangerous and has a problem with drugs on campus.\nthose pursued in this paper can \"explain\" over 100% of a phenomenon, factors that explain 75%\nshould not be considered \"clearly the most important factor. Consistent with some past research, but in contrast to the interpretation of H&M, factors that \"explain\" 100% of the racial gap in an outcome can explain far less than 100% of the explainable gap (given that test scores and family background together explain over 100% of the racial education gap). A more complete understanding is required to make such statements, and this understanding remains lacking.\nThe naming of the residual black-white wage gap in a wage equation as \"discrimination\" is known to be problematic. Omitted variables that are correlated with race and that affect productivity or working conditions may cause the wage gap. Thus, a researcher who finds an additional variable that diminishes the pay gap to zero may claim evidence that discrimination does not exist. Unfortunately, the equation still may omit many important variables that are correlated with race and that affect productivity. If such additional variables were measured, measured discrimination might reappear. Notes: Odds Ratios for Test Scores and for SES measure the change in the odds of an outcome when the test scores or H&M SES index change one standard deviation. An odds ratio of 0.9 for Test scores, for example, indicates the outcome is 90% as likely for high-scoring students--for example, 20% of the baseline respondents, but 18% for students with high test scores Incremental R 2 of test scores is the pseudo-R 2 of test scores and family background or SES index minus the pseudo-R 2 of family background or SES index alone. Incremental R 2 of family background or SES index are the R 2 of test scores and either family background or SES index minus the R 2 of test scores alone. H&M SES Index is a single measure averaging parents' occupational status, parents' education, and family income. Rich family background includes a number of family and school characteristics, listed in Table 1 . dP/dX estimates the effect on the probability of the outcome of a one standard deviation increase in test scores or in the bundle of family characteristics.
