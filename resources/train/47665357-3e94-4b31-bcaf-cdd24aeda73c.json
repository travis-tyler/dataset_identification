[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and around 10-15% of people with MCI develop AD each year.

Here, we focused on anatomical brain networks computed from diffusion MRI and proposed a new feature extraction and classification framework based on higher order singular value decomposition and sparse logistic regression.

It is also considered to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia, as every year, ~10% to 15% of people with MCI progress to probable AD [2] However, not all people with MCI deteriorate cognitively and some even get better. More accurate accurate classification of MCI subtype is crucial for disease detection and treatment evaluation.\nMild cognitive impairment is a \"clinical\" diagnosis representing a doctor's best professional judgment about the reason for a person's symptoms. There are currently no tests or procedures to demonstrate conclusively that a person has MCI. Impairment on cognitive tests is usually defined as performance at least 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the age-, sex-and education-adjusted mean on a standardized test. In an attempt to define an even earlier point in time for disease detection, the recent extensions of the North American ADNI project (termed, \"ADNI-GO\" and ADNI-2) introduced the distinction of early versus late MCI. Late MCI (LMCI) refers to the original definition (performance of 1.5 SD below the normative mean), whereas in early MCI (EMCI), impairment is defined as performance in the range 1.0-1.5 SD below the normative mean on a standardized tests [3] .\nRecently studies of brain connectivity -including anatomical connectivity assessed with diffusion MRI -have attracted increasing attention. Reconstruction and modeling of brain networks provides an alternative way to investigate brain diseases on a holistic scale. More and more studies show that brain network properties are altered in certain disorders, such as bipolar illness [4, 5] , body dysmorphic disorder [6] , and even HIV/AIDS [7] . Even, brain networks and their features depend to some extent on the choice of fiber tracking algorithm used to infer the trajectories of pathways in the brain [8] [9] [10] ; also, dozens of tractography algorithms are now available [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] yielding visually very different brain networks. In this study, we adopted tensorbased fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm [12] to compute the brain network. Tensor-based FACT can yield false positive fibers which may add noise to computed network properties, but FACT is still one of the most widely used tractography algorithms, and it is simple and flexible. Here we propose a novel framework for network classification, with the goal of improving diagnostic classification based on networks. We also set out to show how this new framework could be applied to noisy networks (such as those derived from FACT) and used for differentiating EMCI from LMCI. Figure 1 illustrates the basic idea of our proposed framework for brain network classification using higher order singular value decomposition (HO-SVD) and sparse logistic regression (Sparse LG). Its two component techniques are explained below. The approach involves computing brain networks as connectivity matrices, but then stacking them up, across subjects, as a 3D tensor and performing feature reduction and sparse methods for classification."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "HO-SVD", "text": "In machine learning and data mining, SVD is a powerful tool for dimension reduction. The SVD of a matrix \u2208 \u211d \u00d7 is given by = \u03a3 , where \u2208 \u211d \u00d7 and \u2208 \u211d \u00d7 are orthogonal matrices and \u03a3 \u2208 \u211d \u00d7 is a rectangular diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of \u03a3 , known as singular values, are non-negative and assumed to be in descending order.\nThe higher order SVD (HO-SVD) is one common generalization of SVD from matrices to tensors [18] . In HO-SVD, a tensor \u2208 \u211d 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7\u2026\u00d7 is decomposed as\nin which (1) ( ) \u2208 \u211d \u00d7 , = 1, \u2026 , are orthogonal matrices where the th column of ( ) is the th -mode singular vector.\n(2) \u2208 \u211d 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7\u2026\u00d7 is the core tensor which is of the same size as , and has the following properties:\n\u2022 For any 1 \u2264 \u2264 , let and be the subtensors obtained by fixing the th index to and , 1 \u2264 , \u2264 , then \u2329 , \u232a = 0 for \u2260 ;\nThe Frobenius-norms \u2225 = \u2225 ,1 \u2264 \u2264 are the -mode singular values.\nThe th mode singular matrix ( ) can be obtained as the left singular matrix of the th mode unfolding matrix of tensor . After obtaining all singular matrices (1) \u2026 ( ) , the core tensor is given by\nInspired by the dimension reduction via SVD in the 2D case, we propose to reduce the feature dimensions, using higher order SVD. Similar to the matrix case, the ordering assumption for tensor singular values suggests that most of the information contained in a tensor may be expressed by the first few \"components\". Let the first mode of data tensor correspond to the sample size (i.e., 1 = ) and the remaining modes correspond to feature dimensions. Then, by keeping the largest 1 , \u2026 , singular values for each mode, a reduced tensor with size \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 can be obtained by \u0303=\u0303\u00d7 1\u0303 ( 1) ,\n. The proposed dimension reduction of the tensor is also analogous to principal components analysis [19] for a matrix input. Instead of the original tensor, we propose to use the reduced tensor \u0303 as the new input data for classification."}, {"section_title": "Sparse Logistic Regression", "text": "Let \u2208 \u211d be a sample vector and \u2208 {\u22121, +1} be a binary outcome.

The empirical logistic loss is measured by the negative log-likelihood and the average logistic loss is given by\nThe unknown coefficients and can be computed by minimizing the logistic loss, and this involves a smooth convex optimization problem. However, when dimension m is far larger than the sample size n, solving the logistic regression problem is ill-posed, and the learned model may suffer from the over-fitting problem.\nSparse logistic regression embeds the feature selection into classification using the Lasso penalty [20] which results in a sparse solution for . The sparse logistic regression problem is formulated as: min\nwhere the 1 norm of , i.e., \u2225 \u2225 1 , is the Lasso penalty and > 0 is the regularization parameter that controls the sparsity of the solution."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENT DESIGN", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject demographics and image acquisition", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from ADNI2, the second stage of the Northern American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).\nIn total, 112 subjects were analyzed; of these, there were 73 people with EMCI (mean age: 71.34\u00b111.57, 47 males) and 39 with LMCI (mean age: 72.32\u00b15.83, 24 males). Each subject underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on 3-Tesla GE Medical Systems scanners. T1-weighted SPGR (spoiled gradient echo) sequences (256x256 matrix; voxel size = 1.2x1.0x1.0 mm 3 ; TI=400 ms; TR = 6.98 ms; TE = 2.85 ms; flip angle = 11\u00b0), were collected as well as diffusion-weighted images (DWI; 256x256 matrix; voxel size: 2.7x2.7x2.7 mm 3 ; scan time = 9 min; more imaging details may be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2010/05/ADNI2_GE_3T_22.0_T2.pdf). 46 separate images were acquired for each DWI scan: 5 T2-weighted images with no diffusion sensitization (b0 images) and 41 diffusion-weighted images (b=1000 s/mm\u00b2 ). The DWI protocol for ADNI was chosen after a detailed evaluation of different protocols that could be performed in a reasonable amount of time; we reported results of these comparisons previously [21, 22] . All T1-weighted MR and DWI images were checked visually for quality assurance to exclude scans with excessive motion and/or artifacts; all scans were included."}, {"section_title": "Network Computation", "text": "Each subject's brain network was computed using the method described in [23] . In brief, each subject's DWI was preprocessed (such as corrected for eddy current distortion and motion as well as removal of non-brain tissue) using FSL toolbox (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/). Then whole brain tractography was computed using tensor-based fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm [12] implemented in diffusion toolkit (http://trackvis.org/dtk/). 113 cortical and subcortical ROIs were defined using the Harvard Oxford Cortical and Subcortical probabilistic atlas [24] . For each pair of ROIs, the number of detected fibers connecting them was determined from the FACT tractography. A fiber was considered to connect two ROIs if it intersected both of them. This process was repeated for all ROI pairs, to compute a whole brain fiber connectivity matrix. This matrix is symmetric, by definition, and has a zero diagonal (no self-connections; please see [23] for details). To avoid possible computation bias in the later feature extraction and evaluation sections, we normalized each matrix by the maximum value in the matrix, as matrices derived from different subjects have different scales and ranges. This normalized network will serve as the feature for the classification."}, {"section_title": "Feature extraction and classification", "text": "Based on a total of 112 subjects' 113x113 normalized networks computed in the above section, we compared three feature extraction methods:\n(1) Raw features: for each subject, the feature vector was constructed by stacking all the entries of the upper triangular matrix, since the brain matrix is symmetric. So each subject has 6328 (=113x112/2) features. Thus, we obtained the 112 (subjects) x 6328 (features) matrix as the input to Sparse LG.\n(2) SVD: We first built the raw feature matrix and then center this matrix by subtracting the means for each column. We use the top 10 principal components as the input for Sparse LG.\n(3) HO-SVD: We reduce the dimension of data tensor to 112x10x10 by keeping the largest 10 singular values for each mode. Then, we construct the feature vector for each subject by stacking the entries of the reduced data matrix. This constructed feature vector then serves as the input for Sparse LG.\nAfter feature extraction, we normalize each feature column of the input data matrix by subtracting the mean value from it and dividing it by the standard deviation. Since the outcome distribution is highly imbalanced, we used under-sampling to mitigate the bias caused. For each training/testing procedure, 85% LMCIs and EMCIs were randomly drawn as the training set, while the remaining subjects were used for testing. We then ran Sparse LG on the training set and evaluate classification performance on the test set, with parameters selected by 5-fold crossvalidation. We repeat the training/test procedure 20 times, and report the mean and standard deviations in classification performances including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) and the balanced accuracy which is the mean of sensitivity and specificity. The Sparse LG model is implemented using the Sparse Learning with Efficient Projections package. [25] In our experiments, LMCI was designated as the positive class and EMCI was the negative class."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": "There was no significant difference (P=0.53) in average age between the subjects with EMCI and LMCI. The gender ratio (the number of males over the total number of subjects) was also comparable (0.64 for EMCI and 0.62 for LMCI). Figure 2 shows the mean brain network for EMCI and LMCI. Although EMCI and LMCI have very similar visual patterns in the mean network, the mean network difference plot indicates there are indeed differences in some matrix cell values. When we performed paired T-test on each cell of the network between EMCI and LMCI and the false discovery rate method (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons, our results indicated there were no element-wise differences between the group mean LMCI network and the group mean EMCI network.\nThen we conducted feature extraction and classification experiments as described in Section 3.3. Table 1 summarizes the classification performance, and Table 2 lists the Student's T test P-values. Our results indicated both SVD and HO-SVD performed significantly better than raw features; moreover, our proposed HO-SVD has significant advantages in Accuracy, Specificity and Balanced Accuracy, compared to the standard SVD approach. It is well-known that FACT-derived brain networks have a fair amount of noise, due to the substantial proportion of false positive fibers generated. Our experimental results suggest that HO-SVD is quite effective in handling feature reduction for these noisy networks. This conclusion was further supported by conducting the same experiments on EMCI and LMCI's brain networks derived from another three variants of FACT -the 2 nd -order Runge-Kutta method [11] , and the interpolated streamline [14] and tensorline [13] methods.

Future studies will extend this framework to multi-task classification for all stages of Alzheimer's disease, as well as including data from other modalities (anatomical MRI, PIB-PET) that may assist with classification.
