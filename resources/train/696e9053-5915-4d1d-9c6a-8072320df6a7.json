[{"section_title": "", "text": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of bioactive molecules formed by the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. 1,2 AGEs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, 2 atherosclerosis, 1,3 and renal disease. 4 AGEs induce covalent cross-links with proteins such as collagen, enhance the synthesis of extracellular matrix components, increase oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, and upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules. [1][2][3][4] AGEs accumulate within the intimal extracellular matrix of arteries and atherosclerotic lesions 1,3 and increase glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. 4 AGEs have been the focus of growing interest because of substantial improvement in measurement technology and because experiments conducted in animal models have shown that reduced dietary intake of AGEs or pharmacological blockage of AGEs reduces the complications of atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. 1,2 In humans, treatment with drugs that reduce systemic AGE concentrations, known as AGE breakers, and dietary restriction of AGEcontaining foods have been shown to improve cardiovascular function. [5][6][7] AGEs have primarily been studied in groups of patients with diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, or both, and the relationship between AGEs and adverse clinical outcomes in older communitydwelling adults has not been well characterized. It was hypothesized that older adults with high levels of plasma carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), one of the dominant AGEs in the circulation and in tissues, have greater risk of mortality, especially cardiovascular disease mortality.

Education was recorded as years of school. Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ) and aspirin are two medications that can inhibit the formation of AGEs. Fewer than 3% of the participants reported taking any form of vitamins. A trained geriatrician examined all participants, and diseases were ascertained according to standard, preestablished criteria and algorithms based upon those used in the Women's Health and Aging Study for diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, stroke, and cancer. 10 Fasting plasma glucose was defined as normal, impaired, or diabetic based on a fasting plasma glucose of 99 mg/dL or less, 100 to 125 mg/dL, and greater than 125 mg/dL, respectively. 11 The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based on the diagnostic algorithm, 10 and of those who reported no diabetes mellitus, on a fasting plasma glucose of greater than 125 mg/dL. 12 The diagnostic algorithm for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based on the use of insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, hemoglobin A 1c , and a questionnaire administered to the primary care physician of the study participant. 10 Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated from the mean of three measures taken using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer during the physical examination.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to show that plasma CML is an independent predictor of all-cause and CVD mortality in older community-dwelling adults. Plasma CML is one of the dominant AGEs in the circulation and in tissues, 16 and CML is the only AGE that is a known ligand for receptors for AGE (RAGEs). 20 Binding of RAGEs on cell membranes by CML adducts leads to greater generation of free radicals, activation of the nuclear factor \u03baB pathway, and upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein. 1 The strong association between high plasma CML and CVD mortality in this population-based study is consistent with the role that the AGE-RAGE pathway is considered to play in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CVD. 1 CML accumulates in large blood vessels with age, 21 and high serum CML concentrations were found to be associated with greater arterial stiffness, a strong risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, in adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 22 A limitation of this study is that there may be residual confounding in the multivariate models due to measurement error and incomplete characterization of variables that were included in the models, given that only one set of measurements was used to determine baseline status. Some of the participants who provided the blood pressure readings used in this study were taking antihypertensive medication. In addition, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and the adjustment for fasting plasma glucose may be insufficient to truly characterize the risk for CVD attributable to diabetes mellitus. In the present study, lower LDL-C was associated with higher all-cause and CVD mortality, which is consistent with previous reports in cohorts of older adults. 23 Lower HDL-C was associated with higher all-cause and CVD mortality, which is consistent with a previous report."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "The dietary consumption of foods that are processed at high temperatures, such as by deep frying, roasting, and grilling, has been shown to lead to high levels of circulating CML. 7 The Western diet is especially rich in AGEs. 25 A limitation of the present study is that data on the dietary intake of AGEs was not available, because specialized dietary questionnaires are needed that address the cooking method used in the preparation of specific foods, although a previous study in older adults showed that serum CML concentrations are correlated with dietary intake of AGEs (correlation coefficient = 0.46, P<.001). 26 Controlled dietary intervention studies in humans show that restriction of dietary AGE intake can substantially reduce serum CML concentrations. 7 The findings from these dietary intervention studies are relevant to the present study, because circulating CML concentrations represent a modifiable risk factor. Circulating CML concentrations can be reduced using dietary interventions 7,27 and pharmacological intervention with AGE breakers or AGE inhibitors. 5,6,28 Restriction of dietary AGE intake reduces the expression of C-reactive protein and adhesion molecules and improves endothelial function. 7,27 In animals, dietary restriction of AGEs increases longevity to a magnitude comparable with that of caloric restriction. 29 Most studies of AGEs and their circulating receptors have been limited to patients with specific diseases, mainly diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and end-stage renal disease. The strength of this study is that it was a large population-based sample of community-dwelling older men and women. These results are consistent with previous studies that showed higher mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis 30 and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus 3 who had high circulating AGEs. The biological mechanisms by which high AGEs could increase the risk of dying cannot be specifically determined from this epidemiological study, although there is potential for high AGEs to cause widespread damage to multiple systems, because AGEs are known to alter the structural quality of blood vessels, bone, skeletal muscle, and other tissues through cross-linking with collagen 2 and to accelerate inflammation, atherosclerosis, and renal damage through the AGE-RAGE pathway. 1 In this study, plasma CML was independently predictive of CVD mortality and all-cause mortality. The magnitude of the HRs for mortality was greater for CVD mortality than allcause mortality, suggesting that high plasma CML may be more specifically involved in CVD mortality. In addition, plasma CML was not significantly predictive of non-CVD mortality. Although it is believed that the hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus increases the generation of endogenous AGEs, 1 the relationship between plasma CML and all-cause and CVD mortality was found in patients without diabetes mellitus. The association between plasma CML and all-cause and CVD mortality was nonlinear, with a threshold at the highest tertile. These findings suggest that there may be a critical threshold for plasma CML above which the risk of mortality increases greatly. The search for this threshold is a priority for future research, because it is essential for clinical translation of these findings. In the present study, plasma CML was the only AGE measured, and there are many other AGEs such as pentosidine, carboxyethyl-lysine, and hydroimidazolone AGEs that could be measured and might provide additional insight into the relationship between AGEs and cardiovascular mortality. The present study raises the possibility of using plasma CML as a prognostic biomarker for all-cause and CVD mortality in the general population. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings in other population-based studies and to determine whether plasma CML is an independent predictor of specific adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.
