IADL worsen as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progresses to Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia [1, 2] . IADL impairment leads to loss of productivity by the affected individual, as well as increased caregiver mental, physical, and financial burden. Impairment in basic ADL has been associated with increased global cerebral amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden in post-mortem studies of patients with moderate to severe AD dementia [3, 4] . Recent studies assessing less impaired individuals have shown that IADL impairment has been associated with greater in vivo global cortical amyloid burden in MCI visualized by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) [5] . Additionally, lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta 1-42 (A\u03b2 ) and higher total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 (p-tau 181p ) at baseline have been associated with greater IADL impairment over time in clinically normal elderly (CN) and MCI subjects [6] .\nImaging studies have also shown an association between IADL impairment and typical AD neurodegenerative patterns: Global brain atrophy seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with greater IADL impairment over time in MCI [7] , while an aggregate of temporal, lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate hypometabolism seen on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has been associated with greater IADL impairment over time in MCI and mild AD dementia [8] . Other studies have attempted to more closely localize IADL impairment in the brain. Cross-sectional MRI studies showed an association between IADL impairment and temporoparietal and medial frontal atrophy in mild AD dementia [9, 10] , while cross-sectional functional imaging studies showed an association with inferior temporal, inferior parietal, and superior occipital hypometabolism in mild to moderate AD dementia [11] , and medial frontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral superior parietal, and occipital hypoperfusion in mild AD dementia [12] .\nThe manifestation of disease progression that is usually most important to patients and caregivers is impairment in daily functioning, which can be captured by assessing IADL. There are multiple clinical features (cognition, behavior, demographics) and underlying pathophysiological changes (amyloid deposition and downstream neurodegeneration) that can contribute to future IADL decline. However, few studies have attempted to assess many of these features together. By evaluating these multiple complex features and their interactions, we will be able to determine which features significantly contribute to early functional impairment and to what extent, while adjusting for the other relevant features.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between IADL and regional cortical thinning, CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau 181p cross-sectionally and longitudinally in CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. We hypothesized that lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , higher t-tau, and higher p-tau 181p , as well as temporal and parietal atrophy will all be associated independently with impairment in IADL at baseline and over time across the AD spectrum, while controlling for subject characteristics, including demographics, cognitive function, and behavior that are usually related to IADL impairment."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the analyses in this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu\\ADNI, PI Michael W.

Associations between diagnostic groups and subject demographics and characteristics were evaluated using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables.\nCross-sectional analysis-A general linear regression model with backward elimination (p<0.01 retention requirement) was used to evaluate the cross-sectional association of the dependent variable, baseline FAQ, with the following baseline predictors: MRI regions (cortical thickness) and their interaction with diagnosis, CSF biomarkers and their interaction with diagnosis, sex, diagnosis, interaction of sex and diagnosis, age (linear and quadratic effects), APOE4 carrier status, duration of AD dementia symptoms, the American National Adult Reading Test intelligence quotient (AMNART IQ), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) total learning, Digit Symbol, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory brief questionnaire form (NPI-Q) apathy and depression items. In addition to reporting partial regression coefficient estimates (\u03b2) with confidence intervals (CI), significance test results (p values) were complemented with effect size estimates such as covariate adjusted means and estimates of percent variance accounted for in the dependent variable uniquely by individual predictors, as well as by the model as a whole (R 2 ). The inclusion of the interaction of MRI and CSF variables with diagnosis allowed us to test for any differential relation of any given MRI or CSF variable with FAQ across diagnostic groups. Model residuals were checked for conformance to assumptions and model fit.\nLongitudinal analysis-A mixed random and fixed coefficient regression model was used with backward elimination (p<0.05 retention requirement) for the dependent variable, FAQ, on a large initial pool of fixed predictors and variances/covariances of random terms. The fixed predictors were diagnostic group and their interactions with time, the MRI regions and CSF biomarkers and their interactions with time, the CSF biomarkers and their interactions with diagnosis, and the baseline dependent variable (FAQ) and its interaction with time, which allowed for different trajectories depending on level of FAQ at entry as might be expected for example if there are floor or ceiling effects. The same additional covariates used in the cross-sectional analysis were also included. The random terms in all these models included correlated intercept and linear slopes of time. \u03b2 values with CI were reported. The squared correlations of predicted values from fixed and random predictor sets vs. actual values were used to indicate the percent of variance of the dependent variable linearly accounted for by the predictors.

Similarly, the relation between A\u03b2 1-42 and FAQ was reversed in the model with other predictors held constant (the unadjusted correlation of A\u03b2 1-42 with FAQ was negative: r=\u22120.28, p<0.0001). However, in this case there was no suggestion of multi-collinearity of A\u03b2 1-42 with other predictors.

Whereas, baseline lower supramarginal (lateral parietal) and inferior temporal cortical thickness, lower A\u03b2 1-42 , and greater t-tau are associated with worsening IADL impairment over time across the AD spectrum, including CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia subjects. Of note, the FAQ, which was used to assess IADL, was not used for the initial diagnoses of subjects, thus eliminating this potential confound. Moreover, these findings were independent of age, sex, cognitive reserve, duration of AD dementia symptoms, APOE4 status, apathy, depression, memory and processing speed performance, many of which were associated with IADL impairment. Furthermore, these results suggest that cross-sectionally an association between AD biomarkers and IADL impairment is seen primarily at the stage of mild dementia, while longitudinally it is possible to observe independent associations between markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration and IADL decline across the early AD spectrum, even in CN elderly at risk for AD.\nOver the past decade multiple clinical trials of potentially disease-modifying drugs in mildmoderate AD dementia have failed to show a clinical benefit. Consequently, the field has been moving toward treatment earlier in the disease course, and the Food and Drug Administration recently issued guidelines for clinical trial design in early AD [20] . These guidelines noted that IADL tests are currently inadequately sensitive for capturing disease progression in early AD, especially in the transition from preclinical AD to MCI. Our results suggest that the FAQ is able to longitudinally capture IADL worsening in the early AD spectrum: even though about \u00bd of our sample consisted of late MCI and about \u00bc of mild AD dementia subjects, about a \u00bc of our sample consisted of CN elderly subjects, over a \u2153 of whom had significantly low A\u03b2 (as previously defined [18] ), which is suggestive of preclinical AD. Therefore, the current analyses suggest a potential utility for certain sensitive IADL measures in tracking disease progression even at the earliest stages of AD. Furthermore, we showed that amyloid pathology, regional neurodegeneration, and certain clinical features drive this IADL worsening.\nTwo previous studies used the ADNI database to investigate the relationship between IADL impairment over time and baseline global brain atrophy separately from baseline CSF AD biomarkers [6, 7] . The study assessing global brain atrophy, used the ventricle-to-brain ratio, and found an association between greater baseline atrophy and IADL impairment over time in MCI, especially in APOE4 carriers [7] . The study assessing CSF AD biomarkers found an association between baseline lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and greater baseline t-tau and p-tau 181p and IADL impairment over time in CN and MCI, partially mediated by global cognitive performance [6] . Both of these studies used models adjusted for age and looked at MRI and CSF measures separately, while our study looked at MRI and CSF measures in the same model, targeted specific MRI regions rather than global atrophy, and adjusted for several other relevant covariates. We found associations between IADL impairment over time and baseline inferior temporal and lateral parietal (supramarginal) atrophy and baseline lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and greater t-tau across all subject groups, including AD dementia. These results extend those of the previous studies referenced above and suggest that evidence of neurodegeneration, such as regional atrophy and greater CSF t-tau, as well as amyloid burden, independently and simultaneously contribute to longitudinal functional impairment across the early AD spectrum.\nAnother longitudinal study using FDG PET assessing IADL impairment, showed that a composite score of regional hypometabolism predicted longitudinal functional decline in MCI and mild AD dementia [8] . Two of the three regions in the composite score were temporal and lateral parietal, which are the regions of atrophy we found an association with; the third region was the posterior cingulate [8] . The FDG PET study used similar covariates to the ones we used in our analyses. Our results reinforce the cortical regional localization of progressive functional impairment in the AD spectrum, which matches the cortical neurodegeneration typically seen in AD.\nOur cross-sectional results are partly in agreement, while our longitudinal results are more so in agreement with previous neuroimaging studies and post-mortem and in vivo studies of cortical amyloid deposition. Previous, smaller, cross-sectional, MRI studies showed an association between IADL impairment and temporal atrophy in mild AD dementia [9, 10] similar to our results indicating an association with reduced inferior temporal cortical thickness signifying atrophy, driven by the mild AD dementia group; one of the other studies also showed an association with parietal and medial frontal atrophy [9] . Another cross-sectional study employing FDG PET showed an association between IADL impairment and inferior temporal hypometabolism in mild to moderate AD dementia similar to our regional results; it also showed an association with inferior parietal and superior occipital hypometabolism [11] . Yet another cross-sectional functional imaging study using single photon emission computed tomography showed an association between IADL impairment and lateral superior parietal, occipital, medial frontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal hypoperfusion in mild AD dementia [12] . In our study, the multivariate model indicated an independent association between greater rather than reduced lateral occipital cortical thickness and IADL impairment. However, the univariate unadjusted relationship was reversed, which could have been tied to significant multi-collinearity between the inferior temporal and lateral occipital regions, suggesting that in fact reduced rather than greater lateral occipital cortical thickness is more likely associated with IADL impairment.\nNeither our cross-sectional nor longitudinal analyses showed an association with frontal atrophy. It is possible that in our early AD sample IADL associations with regional frontal changes would be seen with an earlier marker of neurodegeneration, such as FDG PET, rather than MRI cortical thickness, which was used in the current analyses.\nCross-sectional post-mortem studies have demonstrated that greater amyloid burden is associated with greater basic ADL impairment in moderate to severe AD dementia [3, 4] , and a cross-sectional in vivo study has shown that greater amyloid burden, as seen on PiB PET, is associated with greater IADL impairment in MCI [5] . Lower CSF A\u03b2 has been associated with greater global cortical amyloid burden seen at post-mortem and in vivo [21, 22] . Therefore, we anticipated that in our cross-sectional analysis lower CSF A\u03b2 will be associated with greater IADL impairment, which was the result in the univariate unadjusted analysis. However, the relationship was reversed in the multivariate modelgreater CSF A\u03b2 1-42 was associated with greater IADL impairment (higher FAQ score), driven by the mild AD dementia group. Here there was no suggestion of multi-collinearity of A\u03b2 with other predictors to possibly explain the reversed relationship. In the AD dementia group, there was a small cluster of high FAQ / high A\u03b2 1-42 subjects, who were primarily responsible for the correlation/regression line becoming positive. It is possible that these subjects were less likely to harbor AD pathology as the cause of their dementia, leading to the unexpected results. Moreover, subjects with low A\u03b2 1-42 values, low FAQ scores, and cognitive impairment in memory and another domain that could have potentially met criteria for MCI in the study, might have been classified as having mild AD dementia due to the overlapping cognitive impairment criteria between the two diagnostic groups. The addition of low FAQ / low A\u03b2 1-42 subjects to the AD dementia group could have further contributed to this unexpected positive relation of FAQ to A\u03b2 1-42 .\nThe current study had several limitations. The ADNI population is not representative of the general population because the subjects are carefully selected to have limited general health issues, psychiatric conditions, and cerebrovascular disease; moreover, the subjects were highly intelligent premorbidly and had a high proportion of APOE4 carriers [13, 14] . However, we adjusted for these elements in all analyses. Additionally, this population resembles that of most AD spectrum clinical trials, making it easier to compare our results to clinical trial outcomes. The IADL scale used in these analyses, the FAQ, has been shown to be a sensitive measure for differentiating between CN, MCI, and mild AD dementia, but nearly all CN subjects have a baseline score of 0, representing a major floor effect [14, 17] . As such, the cross-sectional results were driven by the mild dementia group. However, the longitudinal results were significant across all diagnostic groups indicating that the FAQ is sensitive to the development of functional decline over time even in CN subjects. Although our intention was to adjust for cognitive impairment in terms of its known contribution to IADL impairment in the AD spectrum, the resulting association between biomarkers and IADL impairment independent of cognition could have been due to a non-neurodegenerative process. Significant cerebrovascular disease or traumatic brain injury were exclusionary in this study, but milder presentations, which could still contribute to IADL impairment, were not exclusionary and could have contributed to the associations we found. Finally, relatively few regions (seven) of cortical thickness were used in our regression models, and exploratory whole-brain voxel-based analyses were not performed. The latter would have had the potential to allow the data to drive the localization of IADL impairment. However, we picked the regions for these analyses based on prior imaging studies, and this approach allowed us to employ more sophisticated multivariate regression models.\nIn conclusion, baseline parietal and temporal atrophy and lower CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and greater ttau predict worsening IADL impairment over time across the early AD spectrum, while temporal atrophy is associated with IADL impairment in mild AD dementia crosssectionally. These results, especially the longitudinal results, demonstrate the association between complex daily functioning decline in early AD and typical AD pathophysiological changes, including influence exerted by markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration independent of each other, as well as emphasize the importance of assessing for IADL impairment at the stage of MCI and even at the transition from CN to MCI."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
