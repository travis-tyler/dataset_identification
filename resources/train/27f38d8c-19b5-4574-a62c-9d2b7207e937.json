[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Although several novel approaches for hippocampal subregion delineation have been developed, they need to be applied prospectively and may be limited by long scan times, the use of high field ([3T) imaging systems, and limited reliability metrics. Moreover, the majority of MR imaging data collected to date has employed a T1-weighted acquisition, creating a critical need for an approach that provides reliable hippocampal subregion segmentation using such a contrast. We present a highly reliable approach for the identification of six subregions comprising the hippocampal formation from MR images including the subiculum, dentate gyrus/cornu Ammonis 4 (DG/CA4), entorhinal cortex, fimbria, and anterior and posterior segments of cornu Ammonis 1-3 (CA1-3). MR images were obtained in the coronal plane using a standard 3D spoiled gradient sequence acquired on a GE 3T scanner through the whole head in approximately 10 min. The average ICC for inter-rater reliability across right and left volumetric regions-of-interest was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.98, median 0.86) and the average ICC for intra-rater reliability was 0.92 (range 0.66-0.99, median 0.97). The mean Dice index for inter-rater reliability across right and left hemisphere subregions was 0.75 (range 0.70-0.81, median 0.75) and the mean Dice index for intrarater reliability was 0.85 (range 0.82-0.90, median 0.85). An investigation of hippocampal asymmetry revealed significantly greater right compared to left hemisphere volumes in the anterior segment of CA1-3 and in the subiculum."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "There is considerable evidence that the hippocampal formation plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of neurologic conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (Mielke et al. 2012; Whitwell et al. 2012) and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Szeszko et al. 2002 (Szeszko et al. , 2003 Zierhut et al. 2013a, b; Tamminga et al. 2010) . The majority of work investigating the hippocampal formation in these and other disorders using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has employed a T1-weighted contrast and used gross anatomic measures comprising all cornu Ammonis (CA)architecture of the hippocampal formation to address questions regarding neurobiology has led to numerous approaches for the identification of subregions using MR imaging. For example, prior work in aging (La Joie et al. 2010; Burger 2010 ), Alzheimer's Disease (Mueller et al. 2007 , schizophrenia (Zierhut et al. 2013a, b; Harrison and Eastwood 2001) , insomnia , multiple sclerosis (Gold et al. 2010; Sicotte et al. 2008) , post-traumatic stress disorder , temporal lobe epilepsy ), and normative populations (Malykhin et al. 2010b ) has provided evidence for differential involvement of specific subregions in the neurobiology of these disorders and their associated functions.\nSeveral prior approaches for hippocampal subregion delineation have limited their method to the identification of subregions (e.g. CA1, dentate gyrus) within the body of the hippocampus where their arrangement is most clearly identified and homogeneous Wang et al. 2010) . Similarly, other investigators have divided the hippocampus into the head, body, and tail (Malykhin et al. 2010a; Narr et al. 2004; Witthaus et al. 2010 ) to facilitate measurements. Researchers have also attempted to ''unfold'' the hippocampus, or translate the threedimensional positioning of its subregions into two-dimensional space (Donix et al. 2010; Ekstrom et al. 2009 ). Moreover, an additional method involves the use of surface shape analysis by projecting post-mortem atlases onto 3-dimensional renderings of the whole hippocampus (Boccardi et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2010; Frisoni et al. 2008; Xie et al. 2009 ). Although this approach can be useful, it is limited to subregions located on the external surface of the hippocampal formation. For example, the shape of CA4 and the dentate gyrus (DG) cannot be fully resolved due to their more medial location. Moreover, we are unaware of any approach for hippocampal subregion segmentation using a T1-weighted contrast which can be applied retrospectively to large datasets (e.g., ADNI; Apostolova et al. 2010; Carmichael et al. 2012) .\nDue to its complex three dimensional shape, the orientation of the hippocampal formation varies significantly along the rostrocaudal axis. Recent reviews suggest that the hippocampus can be divided along its long axis (Fanselow and Dong 2010) consistent with evidence from proton MR spectroscopy (King et al. 2008 ) and functional MR (Demaster and Ghetti 2013) imaging studies. Posterior and anterior hippocampal regions have a unique pattern of connectivity and have been linked to different functions (Poppenk et al. 2013; Nadel et al. 2013 ) that may be of relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Szeszko et al. 2002) . In our prior work (e.g., Szeszko et al. 2003 Szeszko et al. , 2006 Wellington et al. 2013) we divided the hippocampus into anterior and posterior segments based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrating a dissociation in functions for the posterior and anterior parts of the hippocampus with regard to familiarity of stimuli (Strange et al. 1999; Strange and Dolan 2001) . Animal studies suggest that the ventral (corresponding to the anterior hippocampus in humans) or rostral hippocampus has strong connections with prefrontal regions (Barbas and Blatt 1995; Carr and Sesack 1996) and may be involved in context coding Rajah et al. 2010) . In contrast, other data indicate that the dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the posterior hippocampus in humans) plays a role in spatial behavior , thus supporting the idea that this region of the hippocampus is part of a functional network connected to sensory cortical areas including the parietal cortex (Save and Poucet 2000; Guazzelli et al. 2001) . Although a distinction in the hippocampal rostrocaudal axis has been made in MR imaging studies at the gross anatomic level, to our knowledge it has not been fully incorporated into the delineation of a specific hippocampal subregion.\nIn the majority of prior post-mortem studies hippocampal subregions have typically been distinguished from each other using vascularization patterns and cellular features (Duvernoy 1988) . Moreover, a recent study demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields using a high resolution MR imaging dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology (Adler et al. 2014) . These cytoarchitectural identifiers are extremely difficult to detect using in vivo imaging, although various arguments have been made for the visibility of certain cellular layers and substructures at very high ([3T) field strengths (Kerchner et al. 2010; Thomas et al. 2008; Wieshmann et al. 1999; Theysohn et al. 2009 ). A limitation with such approaches, however, is that these magnets are not typically available outside of clinical academic research facilities. At lower (\\7T) field strengths, investigators have relied predominantly on anatomical landmarks and post-mortem atlases rather than cytoarchitectural features to identify hippocampal subregions on MR images (e.g., Gold et al. 2010; La Joie et al. 2010; Malykhin et al. 2010a; Sicotte et al. 2008) . To date several approaches have been developed for the investigation of hippocampal subregions, and groups are actively collaborating to sort through specific issues plaguing mensuration protocols (see http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com).\nApproaches have used manual techniques (Mueller et al. 2007; Malykhin et al. 2010b; La Joie et al. 2010) , automated techniques (Van Leemput et al. 2009; Bonnici et al. 2012; Pipitone et al. 2014) , or a combination of these two approaches (Yushkevich et al. 2010) . Although automated and semi-automated processes for hippocampal subregion delineation have been demonstrated to be highly valuable given their potential to accommodate high throughput, manual mensuration remains the gold standard to which these other methods are compared. Several approaches for the identification of hippocampal subregions may be constrained by the investigation of subregions within only a limited part of the hippocampus, long scan times that are not typically clinically feasible, and the use of very high field ([3T) MR imaging systems that are unavailable outside of research centers (Table 1) . Moreover, a critical issue across many studies concerns the consistent lack of inter-rater reliability assessments and/or the investigation of intra-rater reliability within only a limited part of the hippocampal formation that may not be applicable to other areas.\nThe primary goal of this study was to develop a methodology for hippocampal subregion segmentation that can be generalized to other magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired at a 3T using a T1-weighted contrast. Although other superior in vivo approaches have been developed for hippocampal subregion and subfield delineation, they are not based on a T1-weighted contrast and need to be acquired prospectively. We also sought to develop strategies for dealing with issues germane to other approaches, such as those described by Konrad and colleagues (2009) . We based our delineation criteria largely on post-mortem atlases (Duvernoy 1988; Harding et al. 1998; Yushkevich et al. 2009 ) and prior published work (Malykhin et al. 2010b; Mueller et al. 2007; Van Leemput et al. 2009; Yushkevich et al. 2010) . We also relied on anatomical rather than cytoarchitectural features to facilitate the implementation of these criteria on MR images where such features would be more evident. We tested the feasibility of our approach by computing intra-rater reliability, interrater reliability, and examining Dice indices for right and left hippocampal regions-of-interest. We subsequently present a range of volumetric data in ten healthy volunteers and investigate hippocampal asymmetry within our regions-of-interest."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Initial training involved extensive discussion of the relevant anatomy and repeated mensuration of hippocampal subregions between two operators to develop the delineation criteria.

It is acknowledged that the terminology used to define the hippocampus and its constituent parts is critical to the field and there is extensive controversy regarding which regions should be considered part of the hippocampus. For the purpose of this study we considered the hippocampus proper to comprise CA1-3 and DG/CA4. These subregions, along with the remaining additional structures (i.e., the entorhinal cortex, subiculum, and fimbria), comprised the hippocampal formation. We have used similar nomenclature in prior published work (e.g., Szeszko et al. 2003; Wellington et al. 2013; Bogerts et al. 1990; Bogerts et al. 1993 ).

These criteria relied on anatomical landmarks and intensity level changes within the images."}, {"section_title": "Posterior CA1-3", "text": "Starting in the most posterior slice of the hippocampus proper, all of the hippocampal gray matter that appeared was allocated to subregion CA1-3 for two slices (i.e., approximately 2 mm). After this point, subregion CA1-3 was distinguished from subregion DG/CA4 based on differences in the images' intensity (see upper left row of Fig. 1a) , which indicated the location of cellular layers that lie between CA1-3 and DG/CA4 (i.e., the stratum radiatum of the cornu Ammonis, the stratum moleculare of the cornu Ammonis, and the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus; see the middle right row of Fig. 1b as an example). Simultaneous with the appearance of the thalamus' pulvinar nucleus in the coronal view (see middle left row of Fig. 1a) , the medial boundary of CA1-3 became the most medial point at which the subregion of DG/CA4 folded in upon the rest of the hippocampus proper. Throughout the posterior hippocampal formation, the lateral boundary of CA1-3 was the lateral border of the hippocampus proper's gray matter (see Fig. 1a, b) . The inferior boundary of CA1-3 in the posterior hippocampal formation was the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus, whereas the superior boundary of this subregion was first the white matter medial to the lateral ventricle, then the fornix, and then the fimbria (see Fig. 1a, b) .\nWhen it appeared, the gray matter of the uncus marked the beginning of the anterior hippocampal formation and was included in the subregion of CA1-3 (see bottom right row of Fig. 1b ). In the anterior hippocampal formation, the medial boundary of CA1-3 was primarily the CSF of the temporal horn (see Fig. 1c ). As in the posterior hippocampal formation, the subregion of CA1-3 was distinguished infero-medially from the subiculum in the anterior hippocampal formation by the placement of subregion DG/ CA4 (see Fig. 1a-c) . When DG/CA4 terminated anteriorly, the subiculum became the inferior boundary of CA1-3 until the two most anterior slices of the hippocampus proper, in which CA1-3 was identified as all the gray matter in the hippocampus proper, and its inferior boundary once more became the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus (see bottom right row of Fig. 1c) . The lateral boundary of this subregion in the anterior segment of the hippocampal formation remained the most lateral gray matter of the hippocampus proper (see Fig. 1c ). CA1-3's superior boundary in the anterior hippocampal formation remained the fimbria until that subregion's rostral termination (see bottom right row of Fig. 1b and top left row of Fig. 1c ). After that point, it became the CSF of the temporal horn and eventually the gray matter of the amygdala (see the bottom right row of Fig. 1c ).

The subiculum's medial boundary throughout the majority of the hippocampal formation was defined by the shape of the parahippocampal gyrus. Specifically, a line was drawn between the most medial point of white matter and the most medial point of gray matter on the parahippocampal gyrus to create the medial border of the subiculum (see middle left row of Fig. 1b) . The subiculum's lateral boundary was the inferior medial boundary of CA1-3 (see Fig. 1a-c) . Its inferior boundary was the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus (see Fig. 1a-c) . Finally, the superior boundary of the subiculum throughout the posterior hippocampal formation was the superior termination of the parahippocampal gyrus's gray matter (see Fig. 1a, b) . When the uncal apex appeared, the subiculum was superiorly distinguished from the Anterior CA1-3 subregion by locating the hippocampal fissure in more rostral slices. It was observed how the hippocampal fissure progressed posteriorly, until the coronal slice displaying the uncal apex was reached and conclusions could be drawn about where the superior boundary of the subiculum was located (see bottom right row of Fig. 1b) . The superior boundary of the subiculum in the anterior hippocampal formation then continued to be the hippocampal fissure (see, for example, the middle left row of Fig. 1c) . The hippocampal fissure's anterior progression was also used to predict the location of the subiculum's superior boundary in the most rostral slices of the hippocampal formation, where the CSF of the hippocampal fissure becomes less detectable from changes in the image's intensity (see bottom left row of Fig. 1c ). In the anterior hippocampal formation, the lateral boundary of the subiculum became the most lateral hippocampal gray matter. This was distinguished from the lateral boundary of CA1-3 by differences in the image's intensity.

We fully acknowledge the possibility that components of the fasciolar gyrus were included in the delineation of this subregion. The lateral boundary of the DG/CA4 subregion in the posterior hippocampus proper began as the fornix and became CA1-3 moving anteriorly (see Fig. 1a ). In the posterior hippocampus proper, the inferior boundary of DG/CA4 is CA1-3 and the superior boundary of this subregion began as the white matter medial to the lateral ventricle and became the fimbria progressing through the hippocampus anteriorly (see Fig. 1a , b).

Considerable care was taken to ensure that the entorhinal cortex could be distinguished medially from the dura in more anterior slices. The lateral boundary of the entorhinal cortex was the white matter of the parahippocampal gyrus.\nThe inferior boundary of this subregion was determined by the most inferior point of the parahippocampal gyrus medial to the collateral sulcus (see top left row of Fig. 1c) .

Manual segmentation of a single (i.e., one hemisphere) hippocampus took approximately 2.5 h. One operator (KR) manually traced these regions-of-interest again approximately 1 week later to determine intra-rater reliability. Reliability was assessed using the Dice index (Dice 1945) , which is defined as 2(A \\ B)/(A ? B). That is, the size of intersection (agreement or overlap) between two labels (i.e., A \\ B) is divided by their average size (i.e., [A ? B]/2). The Dice index ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect agreement) and was computed for hippocampal subregions using both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. In addition, volumes for the subregions delineated on these five cases were estimated by ITK-SNAP and then used to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A twoway mixed effects model based on the ICC value for a single operator was utilized. Thus, each subject is assessed by both operators, but the operators are the only ones of interest. Importantly, ICCs were computed based on the premise that a single operator would conduct the tracings and not that the average of the two operators would be used for the measurements.

Although several innovative methods have been developed for manual mensuration of hippocampal subregions (e.g., those based on a T2-weighted contrast) which provide the ability to visualize subfields, they may not be applicable to a T1-weighted contrast and need to be acquired prospectively. We therefore believe this study fills an important gap in the literature given that the majority of MR imaging data collected to date has utilized a T1-weighted contrast. In addition, although 3-dimensional approaches are available to Fig. 3 Mean inter-rater and intra-rater Dice coefficients for hippocampal subregions in the reliability trial. The color scheme for the hippocampal subregions is identical to that depicted in Fig. 1a -c segment the entire hippocampal formation and to identify hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA2/3, CA1, subiculum) using a T1-weighted contrast (Bearden et al. 2008) , they are approximate and do not provide information regarding its medial surface. A significant strength of our study is the emphasis on reliability metrics to establish feasibility and generalizability. Specifically, our approach is supported by the use of excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, including Dice indices. Moreover, in contrast to several prior segmentation schemes our approach and associated reliability metrics were applied to the entire rostrocaudal axis of the hippocampus. Prior work for hippocampal segmentation using other contrasts may be limited by reliability metrics. For example, in the study by Mueller et al. (2007) intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were computed using two operators to measure ten cases, but delineation criteria were applied only to five adjacent slices in the hippocampal body. Bonnici et al. (2012) similarly restricted the reliability measurements of their manual delineation criteria regarding the subregions of CA1, CA3, DG, and the subiculum. As a result, their relatively high Dice indices (i.e., ranging from 0.7 to 0.86 for intra-rater reliability and from 0.57 to 0.80 for inter-rater reliability) may not reflect the reliability of their delineation criteria across the majority of the hippocampal structure, including the hippocampus/amygdala transition area. Furthermore, intra-class correlations were not computed as an additional gauge of reliability. In contrast to Mueller et al. (2007) and Bonnici et al. (2012) , both Malykhin et al. (2010b) and La Joie et al. (2010) conducted reliability measures on their manual tracings of subregions throughout the entire structure of the hippocampus. In the study by Malykhin et al. (2010b) these authors established delineation criteria for the subiculum, CA1-3, and the dentate gyrus. In the study by La Joie et al. (2010) , volunteers underwent a T1-weighted structural scan (acquired in 9.7 min) and, in addition, a high resolution proton density weighted sequence was acquired perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus (in 7.6 min). Thus, the authors' goal was to develop a new magnetic resonance imaging sequence designed with the specific goal of measuring the hippocampus. La Joie et al. (2010) delineated CA1, the subiculum, and ''other,'' which included CA2-4 and the dentate gyrus. Intra-rater reliability assessed using intra-class correlations in both Malykhin et al. (2010b) and La Joie et al. (2010) was high, ranging from 0.95 to 0.98 and from 0.89 to 0.96, respectively. However, in both studies inter-rater reliability measures were not computed, thus making it difficult to determine whether the established delineation criteria would effectively generalize to other operators.\nApproaches for automatic or semi-automatic hippocampal segmentation are extremely valuable for studies requiring high throughput, although the reliability of these approaches has not been demonstrated to be consistently high. Concerning automatic segmentation, Van Leemput and colleagues (2009) used a 32-channel head coil to produce ultra high resolution MR images based on Markov random field priors. The mean intra-rater Dice index for seven hippocampal subregions was 0.79, although reliability was assessed within only two consecutive coronal slices of the hippocampus midbody where the orientation of subregions is typically the most clear and consistent. No inter-rater reliability statistics were computed. Dice overlap measures between their manual and automated approaches (see their Fig. 3, lower right) ranged from approximately 0.2-0.75. Moreover, a potential disadvantage of this approach is the long acquisition time (i.e., [37 min) given that images were averaged five times to achieve a high signal to noise ratio. This may preclude the use of this sequence in some clinical populations. Also, it is unknown whether these methods can be successfully generalized to MR images with lower resolution and signal-tonoise ratio (e.g., Teicher et al. 2012) . Similarly, in another study Bonnici et al. (2012) used multi-voxel pattern analysis to automatically classify subregions, but did not present reliability statistics between this approach and their manual mensuration delineation criteria.\nIn one study Yushkevich et al. (2010) developed a ''nearly automatic'' program for hippocampal subregion delineation criteria within the hippocampal body using a technique established by from focal 0.4 9 0.5 9 2.0 mm 3 resolution T2-weighted MR images acquired in under 5 min. Their approach requires that an operator partition images into the hippocampal head, body, and tail. The intra-class correlation coefficient expressing agreement between automatic segmentation and manual segmentation for one operator was relatively large for subfields CA1 (0.89), the dentate gyrus (0.94), and the hippocampal head (0.91). Intra-class correlations between the automatic and manual approaches were substantially lower (range 0.19-0.5) for CA2, CA3, the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the hippocampal tail, and the parahippocampal gyrus. This indicates that the values produced by the automated approach for these regions may be less reliable. Similarly, Winterburn and colleagues (2013) proposed a coupling of high-resolution along with contrast T1-and T2-weighted imaging to identify CA1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/ stratum moleculare, and the subiculum in approximately 36 min. High resolution FSPGR-BRAVO images were acquired in a scan time of approximately 20 min, and T2-weighted images using a FSE CUBE in approximately 16 min. Moreover, for both image contrasts three separate acquisitions were performed yielding three separate image volumes. The T1 and T2 acquisitions were acquired in two separate sessions for each volunteer ''to minimize discomfort for the subject.'' Although this methodology has significant merits and strengths, it may be difficult to practically scan psychiatric patients and pediatric populations using this approach. To assess reliability, a single hippocampus from each subject was re-segmented by the same operator with values ranging from 0.64 to 0.83. No inter-rater reliability was performed, and the stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum, and stratum moleculare were measured as a unitary structure. The delineation of the dentate gyrus and CA4 subregions may have particular relevance for psychiatric and neurologic disorders that have implicated hippocampal abnormalities in their pathogenesis. Specifically, the dentate gyrus is highly pertinent to psychiatric disorders involving adult neurogenesis as this process typically occurs in the subgranular zone of this subregion. For example, it has been hypothesized that schizophrenia is related to an immature dentate gyrus possibly caused by reduced neurogenesis (DeCarolis and Eisch 2010). In addition, a recent study by Fabricius et al. (2010) found smaller dentate gyri in male rats that had been isolated after weaning. The social isolation of rats has previously been suggested as an animal model of schizophrenia, as it results in neurochemical changes similar to those found in individuals with the disorder. Accompanying behavior alterations have involved locomotor hyperactivity, discrepancies in prepulse inhibition in the acoustic startle paradigm, and multiple cognitive deficits (Fabricius et al. 2010) . To investigate the hippocampal subregions of the dentate gyrus and CA4, this study has implemented a slice-by-slice delineation approach in contrast to a method involving surface analysis. A potential limitation of this latter technique is that it does not permit investigators to examine subregions encased within the overall hippocampal structure and thus cannot determine whether volumetric abnormalities can be attributed to internal (i.e., DG and CA4) or external (i.e., CA1) hippocampal subregions.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to report significant volume asymmetry within hippocampal subregions. Our findings thus converge with the considerable existing evidence for significant right greater than left total hippocampal volume asymmetry from MR imaging data (Wellington et al. 2013; Pedraza et al. 2004 ). In one study Woolard and Heckers (2012) reported asymmetry limited to the anterior hippocampus. They also concluded that the magnitude of right greater than left anterior hippocampal volume asymmetry was associated with basic cognitive performance in a cohort of 110 healthy subjects. Our data thus extend prior work by implicating right greater than left volume asymmetry in the anterior CA1-3 and subiculum, although these findings should be considered tentative until replicated in larger samples. Their functional significance should also be investigated.\nIn this study, as in our prior work (Szeszko et al. 2003; Wellington et al. 2013; Bogerts et al. 1990 Bogerts et al. , 1993 , we defined the hippocampus proper to comprise the subregions of CA1-3 and DG/CA4. In contrast, the hippocampal formation includes the hippocampus proper as well as the entorhinal cortex, subiculum and fimbria. As a result, it was possible for us to compute volumetric estimates of the hippocampus proper from our data by summing the generated volumes from the reliable subregions of anterior CA1-3, posterior CA1-3, and DG/CA4. We are aware that previous stereological estimates regarding the hippocampus proper have included areas of the subiculum (La Joie et al. 2010; Malykhin et al. 2010a; Winterburn et al. 2013) . Whereas the cellular structure of the subiculum is thought to resemble that of the cornu Ammonis subregions, the cytoarchitecture of the pre-subiculum and post-subiculum are more comparable to that of the entorhinal cortex (Amaral and Lavenex 2007) . As our delineation of the subiculum merges these distinct components of the subicular complex, the similarities to the entorhinal cortex noted above encouraged us to eliminate the possibility that the pre-subiculum and para-subiculum subregions would be included in a volumetric estimate of the hippocampus proper by excluding our ''subiculum'' region-of-interest from our calculations.\nThe analysis of volumes for the hippocampus proper yielded some intriguing results. Specifically, we found trend-level (p = 0.07) effects for the hippocampus proper to be significantly larger in the right compared to the left hemisphere. This is consistent with previous findings that have determined the right hippocampus to be slightly larger than the left (Harrison 2004) . However, as reported in Table 4 , the subregions that comprise the hippocampus proper display differing volumetric patterns across hemispheres. Namely, the right anterior CA1-3 region was significantly larger than its left hemisphere counterpart (p = 0.001) whereas the right DG/CA4 subregion demonstrated a trend for being significantly smaller compared to its counterpart in the left hemisphere (p = 0.08). These findings imply that the effect observed in the hippocampus proper is due primarily to the difference between hemispheres in the anterior CA1-3 subregion. Furthermore, it appears that the DG/CA4 region-of-interest could possibly demonstrate a different volumetric pattern across hemispheres than the anterior CA1-3 subregion. These results may be particularly noteworthy given that specific functions have been attributed to the right hippocampus (i.e., spatial memory) and left hippocampus (i.e., verbal memory; Harrison 2004) , as well as the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus (Strange et al. 1999; Strange and Dolan 2001) .\nThere were several limitations to the current study that should be acknowledged. Despite excellent reliability, our approach still necessitates the manual delineation of hippocampal subregions and thus requires considerable operator effort to complete the tracings. On the other hand, manual approaches for hippocampal mensuration remain the gold standard by which other approaches can be compared. It should also be acknowledged that our use of an atlas-based approach for hippocampal subregion delineation may have disadvantages. Specifically, because the operator could not determine vascularization patterns or cellular structures from MR images, the subregions defined in this study provide only estimates regarding where these specialized regions are located. For example, the distinction between CA1 and the subiculum is traditionally marked by the end of the stratum radiatum, a layer of CA1 that is comprised of dendrites from its pyramidal neurons (Duvernoy 1988 ).\nAn additional limitation is that this approach and contrast ultimately required that we merge unique hippocampal subregions. For example, the hippocampal areas of CA1, CA2, and CA3 were merged into a single subregion (CA1-3). As CA3 occurs more superiolaterally in the body of the hippocampus, it is possible that this approach may result in the partial exclusion of this subfield. Similarly, the identified ''subiculum'' subregion included cellularly distinct components of the subicular complex, and the dentate gyrus and CA4 were combined into a single subregion (DG/CA4) that did not consistently exclude the fasciolar gyrus. Based on our extensive initial pilot work, we concluded that the reliable separation of these individual subfields was not possible in our MR images. We also acknowledge that results based on the anterior/posterior distinction of CA1-3 may have changed if different guidelines were used. In addition, although there is no widely accepted standard for assessment of test-retest reliability, our choice of 1 week was short and may have contributed to the high intra-rater ICCs. Ultimately, however, we believe that it is more critical for mensuration studies to investigate inter-rater reliability, which is the standard most often used in volumetric neuroimaging studies (in contrast to intra-rater reliability) so that results can be replicated by other individuals. We also acknowledge that others have included separate volumetric estimates regarding the head and tail of the hippocampus, but that these analyses have not yet been conducted on our dataset and thus, may be considered a limitation of the proposed methodology. Lastly, our sample size is small and the preliminary nature of the asymmetry findings must be acknowledged and replicated using larger sample sizes.\nIn summary, we describe a novel approach for manual hippocampal subregion volumetry using T1-weighted MR images acquired at 3T. Our approach has demonstrated excellent inter-and intra-rater reliability compared to several prior automated and semi-automated approaches."}]
