[{"section_title": "1", "text": "One hundred years ago, U.S. agriculture played a much different role in the economy than it does today. In 1916, the farm population peaked at 32.5 million, 31.9 percent of the total U.S. population (Alston et al. 2010a). Since then, while the U.S. population continued to grow, the farm population declined to 4.6 million in 2013, just 1.5 percent of the total. 1 A dramatic transformation of agriculture, with farms becoming much larger and more specialized, was achieved through the progressive introduction and adoption of a host of technological innovations and other farming improvements that enabled much more to be produced with less land and a lot less labor. Productivity grew rapidly. Echoing Schultz (1956) and Griliches (1963), Jorgenson and Gollop (1992, p. 748) concluded \"There is little doubt that productivity growth is the principal factor responsible for postwar  economic growth in agriculture, accounting for more than 80 percent of the sector's growth.\" 2 Similar transformations have taken place around the world, especially in the higherincome countries; and, partly driven by the changes in the United States, food has become much cheaper in real terms in spite of having a much larger and richer global population to feed. In the second half of the 20 th century, in particular, global food supply grew faster than demand and real food prices fell significantly, alleviating hunger and poverty for hundreds of millions around the world (e.g., Alston and Pardey 2014). 3 Can that pattern, or anything like 1 The U.S. government ceased providing estimates of farm population (i.e., rural civilians living on farms regardless of occupation) in 1991. This 2013 estimate was formed by multiplying the average number of people per farm living on farms during 1987-1991 by the number of farms in 2013 obtained from USDA-NASS (2015). The farm population share was formed by dividing the result by the corresponding U.S. population obtained from U.S. Bureau of Census (2015)."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "constructed Fisher ideal approximations to Divisia indexes of quantities of inputs and outputs for each of the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the United States as a whole. The highly disaggregated base data permitted the construction of indexes with adjustments for heterogeneity of inputs (e.g., age and horsepower of tractors in the capital stock or age and education of farm operators in the labor input) and outputs at the state and national levels. These quality-adjusted state-specific indexes can be used to estimate and analyze national and state-specific trends in multifactor productivity (MFP) and in several partial factor productivity (PFP) measures (specifically, land, labor, capital and materials) for the period 1949-2007. 7 Initial work with an earlier version of these data (e.g., see Alston et al. 2010a) provided evidence of a slowdown in productivity growth since 1990, but this work also raised some questions that require consideration of the prior history for which we do not have such detailed data available on inputs, outputs, and productivity. Hence, to place the post-World War II (WWII) evidence in a longer-run setting, we backcast the InSTePP measures of national agricultural productivity to 1910, using commensurate land, labor and MFP measures compiled by the USDA (see Appendix A for details). We apply a battery of measures to the resulting MFP data, as well as various PFP measures, to test for changes in productivity growth over the longer term. These analyses, as well as analyses using the moredetailed data after 1948, consistently reveal a phenomenon of accelerating growth peaking in the 1960s or 1970s, followed by a progressive slowdown, visibly apparent after 1990. In this Appendix A. See  for a more complete description of the InSTePP Production Accounts which are available at www.instepp.umn.edu/datasets. 6 framework, the recent slowdown can be seen to some extent as a return to a more-normal long-run average growth rate, following a period of abnormally high rates in the period of the 1950s through the 1980s. U.S. FARM PRODUCTIVITY, 1910-2007 Our analysis begins with the most comprehensive but also most aggregative measure: using our new data on national agricultural MFP over the longer period, 1910-2007. We describe the patterns in the data and then apply various procedures to test for a slowdown."}, {"section_title": "Multifactor Productivity Measures", "text": "Over the course of the century, the index of the aggregate quantity of output (Q) from U.S. agriculture grew from 100 in 1910 to 461 in 2007, at an average fitted exponential growth rate of 1.69 percent per year. Meanwhile, the index of the aggregate quantity of inputs (X) used in U.S. agriculture grew at an average fitted exponential growth rate of just 0.03 percent per year, reflecting some increases in capital and materials inputs that offset the reductions in use of land (after the late 1970s) and especially labor. Consequently, the measure of MFP (MFP = Q/X) grew at an average fitted exponential growth rate of 1.66 percent per year ( Figure 1). The implication is that U.S. agriculture produced 4.6 times as much agricultural output in 2007 as in 1910 without appreciably increasing the quantity of aggregate input. Over the same period, the PFP of land grew more slowly, averaging 1.35 percent per year while the PFP of labor grew relatively rapidly, averaging 2.90 percent per year, as the labor intensity of farming was falling substantially. U.S. agricultural land was 4.8 times more productive in 2007 than it was in 1910, and labor was 18.4 times more productive, reflecting the great exodus of farm labor out of agriculture-even after appropriate adjustment for the partially 7 offsetting improvements to land (mainly irrigation) and the enhanced educational status and work experience (increased age) of farm operators. [Figure 1: Output, Input, MFP, Labor PFP, Land PFP andLand per Farm, 1910-2007] The long-run path of these various productivity measures was not always smooth. Substantial year-to-year variation in MFP, and the associated year-to-year variation in aggregate output (and to a much lesser extent measured aggregate input use) make it difficult to discern the onset, magnitude and duration of a productivity slowdown (e.g., see Appendix Figure A-1). 8 To test for secular changes in productivity growth entails comparing longer sub-periods in which some of the year-to-year variation is smoothed out-for instance, the data are summarized by decade in Table 1. As these data indicate, our measures of MFP and PFP growth have varied substantially from decade to decade, with relatively high rates of growth during the period 1950-1980, when the rate of growth of aggregate output was also relatively high (1.87 percent per year for the period 1950-1980, and 2.03 percent per year for MFP for the same period). But findings regarding productivity growth over sub-periods may depend on the choice of where to divide the data (measures may be sensitive to starting and ending points), as well as choices about how to measure growth rates and whether to measure them in absolute or percentage changes, in yields per acre or in partial-or multi-factor productivity indexes. In addition, they may depend on the econometric and statistical techniques used, as discussed next before we turn to a formal assessment of structural changes in the rates of productivity growth."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "[ Table 1. Annual Growth Rates in U.S. Output, MFP andPFP, 1910-2007] Perron (1989), Zivot and Andrews (1992), and Hansen (1992 and2001) devised and applied methods for testing for a unit root (i.e., non-stationarity) when a structural break may be present in the underlying series. These studies indicate that commonly used unit root tests, such as a Dickey-Fuller test, may be inappropriate in the presence of structural breaks. A Dickey-Fuller test provides strong indications that our index of MFP is non-stationary. 9 However, an alternative possibility is that our MFP series is in fact stationary around a deterministic trend that has a structural break somewhere in the series, and we have to distinguish between these alternatives. Zivot and Andrews (1992) developed a statistical approach to distinguish between a unit root process and a trend stationary process with a structural break of unknown timing, which we refer to as the ZA-test. This test allows for a break in either the level or the trend of the underlying series, or both. In our application of the ZA-test, the null hypothesis is that the MFP series in natural logarithms has a unit root, while the alternative hypothesis is that the series is stationary around a deterministic trend, with a structural break of unknown timing in its level and trend. Under the alternative hypothesis, standard tests for a unit root might be inappropriate. The ZA-test procedure involves segmenting the entire sample into different periods at each observation and performing a series of one-sided t-tests of the null hypothesis of a unit root. The observation (year) with the minimum calculated (negative) t-statistic provides the strongest evidence against the null hypothesis, and represents the most likely candidate for a 9 breakpoint in the series. 10 Figure 2 plots the estimated breakpoint t-statistics for the MFP series in natural logs for the period 1910-2007 with a five percent trim. The largest (negative) t-statistic occurs for the breakpoint year of 1979. However the calculated t-statistic for this test, -3.38, is less than the 5 percent critical value of -5.08, so we do not reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in the series. 11 [Figure 2: Zivot-Andrews Breakpoint t-statistics on MFP Series, 1913 According to the ZA-test, a one-time structural break in the series does not appear to exist. However, this does not rule out the possibility of a gradual decline in recent decades in the level or growth rate of a fundamentally non-stationary time series. The findings from the Dickey-Fuller and ZA tests suggest that we should work with a stationary variant of the productivity series, the first differences of the logs (i.e., the annual rate of growth) of MFP (as plotted in Figure A-1), to assess whether the growth in U.S. agricultural productivity has slowed. To do so, we adopted and expanded on a procedure Nordhaus (2004) used to test for periods of a slowdown in U.S. productivity growth. This \"rolling regressions\" procedure is parsimonious and allows for the identification of periods of slowdown using a stationary productivity growth series. We first applied a modified version of Nordhaus' rolling regressions approach, whereby we assessed differences in the average rates of U.S. agricultural MFP growth for periods before and after a breakpoint date. To do this we regressed annual observations of the rate of growth of MFP for the period 1911-2007 on a constant term and an indicator variable 10 that was assigned a value of zero for each year prior to a breakpoint and one thereafter. Breakpoints were set at each year from 1920 to 2006, and a rolling series of dummy variables was constructed accordingly. The estimated coefficients on the dummy variables for the different breakpoints are plotted in Figure 3, Panel a. 12 These coefficients measure the difference in the average annual rate of productivity growth between the years before and after the corresponding breakpoint. 13 [ Figure 3: Estimated Coefficients on Dummy Variables for Breakpoints andTime Intervals of MFP Growth Rates, 1910-2007] For the first 50 years or so of the series beginning in 1910, the breakpoint coefficients plotted in Panel a of Figure 3 are positive numbers, indicating that productivity grew more rapidly after each breakpoint compared with the period before it. The generally downward slope of the sequence of coefficients implies that, over time, the increase in the growth rate of MFP after the breakpoint was generally diminishing, albeit with some temporary reversals. In contrast, for the series of breakpoints following the late 1970s, the dummy variable coefficients are generally negative, indicating that, for each breakpoint, productivity was slower after the breakpoint than before it-clear evidence of a slowdown in MFP in the morerecent years. The breakpoint for 2007 is an exception and reflects an outlier effect; setting aside this atypical terminal observation results in an outlier effect in the opposite direction as can be seen in the dotted line in Figure 3, Panel a. 14 We also tried the specific rolling regressions procedure used by Nordhaus (2004). In this instance the indicator variable was assigned a value of one for each year in a five-or fifteen-year interval, and zero for all other years in the sample. 15 The terminal year for each interval was stepped back through the data, beginning in 2007, and the estimated dummy coefficients for the rolling series are plotted in Panels b and c of Figure 3. Here the coefficients indicate the difference between the average annual rate of MFP growth for the interval ending in the year shown, and for all other years in the sample. Consider a five-year rolling interval and the estimated results for the interval ending in 1925. To obtain the 1925 coefficient estimates we set the indicator variable equal to one for all the years in the five-year interval ending in 1925 (i.e., 1921-1925) and zero for all the other years in the sample. The estimated coefficient on the indicator variable indicates the magnitude by which average productivity growth for the specified five-year interval differs from the average productivity growth for the other years in the sample (i.e., 1911-1920 and 1926-2007). 16 The results from five-and fifteen-year interval analysis serve to reinforce the breakpoint analysis, indicating a slowdown in productivity growth in the latter decades of the 14 Breakpoint estimates can be sensitive to the choice of endpoint, especially at the tail end of the sample when the small number of observations on one side of the breakpoint makes the coefficient estimates vulnerable to outlier effects. U.S. MFP jumped by 2.53 percent from 2006 to 2007-an abnormal rate, well above the longrun average rate of growth of 1.52 percent per year over the period 1910-2007, and no doubt reflecting a response to the commodity price spikes in that year. 15 We also applied the same procedure for a ten-year interval with no appreciable difference in the qualitative nature of the results. 16 For example, the average productivity growth rate for the interval 1921-1925 was 0.30 percent per year, and the average for the other years in the sample 1911-1920 and 1926-2007 was 1.59 percent per year. The estimated coefficient on the indicator variable for 1925 is -1.29, indicating that in the period 1921-1925 MFP grew by 1.29 percent per year more slowly on average than during the periods 1911-1920 and 1926-2007 (i.e., 0.30 -1.59 = -1.29). sample, but they also suggest a period of comparatively slow productivity growth in the early decades of the 20 th century. Given a null hypothesis of constant growth, it is informative to plot the logarithm of MFP against time: constant productivity growth implies a linear path, i.e., dlnMFP/dt is constant. In Figure 4, Panel a, the path of lnMFP is clearly (visibly) non-linear. To parsimoniously characterize the patterns in these data we estimated polynomial trend models in which the linear model, representing constant exponential growth, is a nested special case. A cubic polynomial trend model (the gray line) fits the data (the black line) very closely, and the quadratic and cubic terms are individually statistically significant; the hypothesis of the linear model with a constant growth rate is strongly rejected (see Table 2, Column 3  , 1910-1930) and more recently (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). [ Figure 4: A Cubic Trend Model of Productivity Indexes in Natural Logarithms, 1910-2007 [ Table 2. Cubic Trend Models of MFP andPFP in Natural Logarithms, 1910-2007] The results in Figure 4, Panel a (see also Appendix Figure B-1) and Table 2, Column 3, support the view proposed by Alston et al. (2010a) that U.S. farm productivity growth has slowed in recent decades, in the context of the post-war period (i.e., since 1950). But more than that, they also suggest that this slowdown was relative to a period of unusually high productivity growth in the middle of the full sample period, 1910-2007. In the context of that longer time series, the period 1947-1985 studied by Jorgenson and Gollop (1992), was a period of comparatively rapid and fairly steady productivity growth-compared with both the prior period 1910-1946 and the subsequent period 1986-2007. In addition, it can be seen that the middle 1980s were characterized by relatively volatile productivity patterns-probably the consequences of unusual weather conditions in some years (e.g., drought in 1982-83; see Boken, Cracknell and Heathcote 2005) and farm policy in some others (the \"payment-in-kind\" program introduced in 1983 and other significant changes wrought by the 1985 Farm Bill; see Olmstead and Sumner 2006). This volatility makes findings regarding a slowdown potentially sensitive to the choice of breakpoint within the 1980s, though productivity growth seems clearly to have been slower after 1990 than before 1980. Since 1990, MFP grew by 1.18 percent per year, which is less than the average rate of growth of 1.52 percent per year for 1910-2007, and substantially less than the rate for several preceding decades. Conscious of potential end-point effects, we also calculated the annual average rate of growth for various periods, beginning in different years,  Figure B-2). The same cubic model estimated using data just for the shorter period, 1949-2007, for which we have much more detailed information on inputs, outputs, and productivity, also indicates a slowdown but with different timing-an inflection in 1971 using our (InSTePP) MFP data versus 1982 using the USDA TFP data (  . In each case, as for MFP, a cubic polynomial trend model (the dashed line) fits the data (the solid line) very closely, and the quadratic and cubic terms are individually statistically significant; the hypothesis of the linear model with a constant growth rate is again strongly rejected (see Table 2). However, the patterns are quite different between land and labor productivity. In the case of labor, the pattern shows a clear acceleration and slowdown with an inflection centered on 1960, whereas for land, a clear acceleration in the early decades is not mirrored by a corresponding slowdown in the later decades. The estimated inflection point of 1974 has a relatively wide 95 percent confidence interval and, visually, we see only weak if any indications of a slowdown at any time after 1950. As for MFP, we also applied the breakpoint and interval regression methods to these two productivity metrics for data spanning the period 1910-2007. 17 In Figure 5, Panels a and b report the results of the breakpoint analysis for land and labor productivity, respectively, and panel c reports the 15-year interval analysis for both land and labor productivity. The breakpoint coefficients plotted in Panel a reveal that in most periods, land productivity grew faster, on average, after than before each breakpoint (i.e., most estimated coefficients are positive). This is consistent with the plot in Figure 4, panel b, in which land productivity accelerated before 1950 after which it grew at a fairly constant trend rate. As the breakpoint moves toward the end of the sample, the gap in pre-and post-breakpoint growth rates becomes more variable and begins to widen, most notably after 2000. This pattern reflects the abnormal production year in 2007, when U.S. aggregate output jumped (by 3.47 percent that year) in response to spiking commodity prices. Productivity increases in that single year increasingly dominate the average growth rate in post-breakpoint periods as the number of observations following the breakpoint shrinks. The breakpoint analysis for the sample period 1910-2006 is plotted as a dotted line in Figure 5, Panel a, where setting aside the observation for 2007 mutes the tendency for the trend rate of growth in land productivity to rebound in more recent years. [ Figure 5: Estimated Coefficients on Dummy Variables for Breakpoints and Time Intervals of PFP Growth Rates, 1910-2007 In keeping with the plots of labor productivity in Figure 4, Panel b, the pattern of breakpoint regression coefficients in Figure 5, Panel b indicates that the pace of labor productivity growth slowed during the first half of the 20 th century in tandem with a slowing of the rate of decline in labor use in agriculture (Alston et al. 2010a, chapter 3). 18 Throughout the time period, the estimated coefficients tend to decrease as the breakpoint is moved to later years. Labor productivity grew more slowly in periods after the breakpoint for breakpoints later than 1965, except for 2007, again a reflection of an anomalous end-point (year 2007) effect. If we set aside the observation for 2007, the trend rate of growth in labor productivity is slower for all years after 1965 ( Figure 5, Panel b). The interval results in Figure 5, Panel c, reinforce the insights gleaned from the breakpoint analysis in Panels a and b, as well as the results from the cubic trend models as plotted in Figure 4. Fifteen-year interval productivity growth rates for land were below the long-run average until the beginning of WWII. After remaining well above average for about 10 years, beginning in 1952, interval growth rates hovered around the long-run average through to the end of the sample. The pattern for labor is similar in the early years but quite different after 1950. Labor productivity grew more slowly than average for each of the fifteen-year windows terminating in years after 1992, just as it did for the fifteen-year intervals terminating in years prior to 1942. The slower-than-average growth rates in the beginning and ending years of this 97-year sample bracket a period from 1942 to 1992 when the fifteen-year interval growth rates in labor productivity consistently exceeded the rest-ofsample growth rates. In Panel c, the gap between the interval and the rest-of-sample labor productivity growth rates is around -2 percent to -3 percent per year through to the mid-1930s, after which it generally increases up to 1950 and generally diminishes over time after 1960, to become increasingly negative after 1992."}, {"section_title": "Partial Factor Productivity Measures: Crop Yields", "text": "A comparable analysis of U.S. national average crop yields-yet another partial factor productivity measure-for barley, corn, oats, rice soybeans, and wheat back to the mid-19 th century indicates that the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were generally decades of abnormally high rates of yield growth. More complete details are provided in Appendix B, but to summarize, the period of abnormally high MFP growth began a little later and was shorter lived, spanning the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to 1935, the rate of growth in crop yields was, with some minor exceptions (for rice and soybeans), generally below the rate since then. 19 And, again like the MFP evidence, rates of yield growth for all six crops since 1990 are more in line with the average rate of growth in yields over the entire period 1867-2009, well below the rapid rates of the 1960s and 1970s. Notably, the more recent rates of growth in crop yields are generally similar to the corresponding rates of growth in MFP. For example, the comparatively slower rates of growth of crop yields since 1990 ranged between 0.62 and 1.75 percent per year, with five of the six crops experiencing yield gains of less than 1.40 percent per year; and with a simple average among all crops of 1.00 percent per year for 1990-2009 and 1.17 for 1990-2007. 20 The corresponding rate of growth in MFP was 1.18 percent per year for 1990-2007. In this instance, at least for the period 1990-2007, a simple average of the crop-specific PFP measure provides a reasonable approximation to the broad path of the corresponding MFP measure that is a more encompassing measure of productivity. Cubic trend models fitted to all of these national productivity measures-be they MFP, labor or land PFPs, or crop yields generally indicate a significant slowdown in productivity growth with an inflection in the early-to mid-1960s (see Appendix B). In Table   3 we report the point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the inflection point (the year of maximum annual productivity growth) for each of those measures and, to evaluate the possibility that the early years might have been influential, using a range of subsamples for MFP. [ The evidence presented above on the changing trajectory of productivity growth in U.S. agriculture is reliant on primal measures of productivity. Drawing on the duality between real commodity prices and primal productivity measures described by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), Alston and Pardey (2014) pointed out that the progressive slowing of the rate of decline in real commodity prices over the past four decades or so (transiting to an upward drift in these relative prices in more recent years, even prior to the commodity price spike of 2007-2008) is consistent with a secular slowdown in the growth rate of MFP. To the extent that U.S. farmers' terms of trade are determined in global markets, they will reflect global, not just U.S. agricultural productivity growth, which might not have slowed as much or with the same timing. Even so, in terms of both their extent and timing, the relative price movements are broadly consistent with a slowdown in productivity growth as documented here using the primal measures for U.S. agriculture alone."}, {"section_title": "STATE-SPECIFIC PRODUCTIVITY PATTERNS, 1949-2007", "text": "The analysis using national aggregate data back to 1910 provides compelling evidence of a slowdown in the growth of agricultural MFP in recent decades, following a period of unusually rapid growth in MFP during the third quarter of the 20 th century. Here we use more detailed state-specific evidence on input, output, and MFP indexes for the period  to gain a sense of the structure of productivity change among U.S. states, and to test more formally for a slowdown since 1990."}, {"section_title": "Diverse Patterns of Change in Inputs, Outputs, and Productivity", "text": "The national aggregate data are quite informative but they do mask remarkable diversity among the states in their production and productivity patterns over the period 1949-2007. All states had positive MFP growth. Some states had both inputs and outputs growing (e.g., California and Idaho), and some had both falling (e.g., Massachusetts and New Jersey); however, the majority of states had the quantity of output growing against a declining quantity of aggregate inputs. Clear evidence of a recent productivity slowdown can be seen in distributions of annual state-specific MFP growth rates over ten-year periods since 1949 (Appendix Figure D-2). Aggregate input growth was generally higher in 1990-2007 compared with 1949-1990 (and notably so for most western states), whereas output growth 20 generally slowed after 1990. These reinforcing input and output trends contributed to the pervasive slowdown in MFP growth. Given the very substantial differences in paths taken by agricultural input, output and productivity among the 48 contiguous states, albeit with a predominant pattern of slower productivity growth since 1990, we might reasonably expect to find diversity among the states in the timing, duration, and extent of shifts in their productivity patterns. In Table 2, Column 7 we report the results for a cubic trend model estimated by ordinary least squares, pooling the state-specific data, which is equivalent to estimating individual state models subject to the restriction that the parameters are the same for every state. 22 The estimates suggest a slowdown with an inflection in 1969 and a narrow 95 percent confidence interval. In Figure 6, the box and whiskers plots of distributions of the predicted state-specific MFPs (in logarithms) reveal a general pattern that is consistent with the plot in Figure 4 of the national average MFP (in logarithms) over the same period. Overlaid on that 21 Some notable exceptions are among the mid-western states (such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota) where the paths suggest constant (or even slightly accelerating) growth. These are states where corn and soybean production predominate; two crops that have sustained comparatively rapid rates of growth in national average yields in recent years compared with prior decades (Appendix Table B-2). 22 The estimated parameters are identical to those that would be obtained by estimating the 48 individual statespecific models, without imposing that restriction, and then taking the simple average of each coefficient (since they are linear models with the same explanatory variables). The predicted MFP from this model is accordingly the average of the predicted state-specific MFP indexes from the unrestricted models and at the same time a prediction of the simple average of the state-specific MFP indexes. plot, the fitted model from Table 2, column 7, closely tracks the mean of the observed 48 state-specific MFP growth rates, which exhibits a sharper slowdown than the model applied to the national index of MFP. [ Figure 6: Observed and Predicted Average State-Specific and National MFP, Natural Logarithms] The slowdown in U.S. agricultural MFP is also apparent in measures of PFPs using our more detailed state-level data. In Table 4, over the period 1949-2007, in U.S. agriculture the productivity of labor, land, capital, and materials grew at average annual rates of 3.37 percent, 1.88 percent, 1.62 percent, and -0.09 percent, respectively; the materials result reflects the very substantial substitution of materials inputs for other inputs, especially labor. Over the period 1990-2007, the corresponding partial productivity growth rates for labor, land, capital, and materials were 1.90, 2.17, 0.46, and 0.55 percent per year respectively. A substantial slowdown is evident in the growth rates of productivity of both labor and capital. Materials productivity grew more rapidly over 1990-2007, reflecting a slower rate of increase in the use of materials input in this period compared with the several decades immediately following WWII. Appendix Table D-1 provides state-specific details on the same measures that echo these findings in the national data. [ that the estimated coefficient on the time trend provides an estimate of the average annual proportional growth in the MFP index. We computed these alternative measures for various time periods, and then conducted statistical tests of the differences in the state-specific growth rates before and after the split points. The results are reported in Table 5. In every case with either measure the tests indicate a substantial and statistically significant (in all cases but one at well less than 1 percent) slowing of MFP growth for any period that includes the years 1990-2007 compared with any prior period. The slowdown is most pronounced for 1990-2007 compared with 1949-1990. [ agricultural production over the past 100 years; changes in what is being produced, where and how; changes in the nature of farms and farming; and changes in the infrastructure, markets, policies and other aspects of the institutional environment within which farmers operate. Central to many of those changes have been a host of innovations and other investments made by farmers, in some cases enabled by public and private investments in science and technology. It is not easy to attribute elements of the observed productivity patterns to particular causes, partly because many influences are in play but also because the lags between investment in innovation and observed outcomes are generally very long-50 years or more in some cases-and variable. A period of relatively rapid productivity growth in the 1970s and 1980s could be a reflection of investments made in the 1930s and 1940s; and a slowdown in the 1990s could be showing that the additional gains to be drawn from those earlier investments were beginning to peter out. The particular shape of the productivity path, however, is suggestive that something significant was substantially different about the period between 1950 and 1990, especially the middle of that period. In broad terms, the surge and subsequent slowdown in U.S. agricultural productivity mirrors the surge and slowdown in U.S. nonfarm productivity, but with different timing. As discussed by Gordon (2000, p. 2) a surge in U.S. nonfarm productivity growth after 1913 \"\u2026ushered in the glorious half century between World War I and the early 1970s during which U.S productivity growth was faster than before or after.\" These phenomena are no doubt connected, involving the fact that the farm sector was a much larger part of the total economy in the early years than now, and the explanations could involve parallels. While we do not offer a formal assessment, we present two potential views of the agricultural productivity surge. Over the course of the 20 th century, following the closing of the frontier, American agricultural development and farm productivity growth were increasingly driven by organized agricultural R&D. On that view, the evolving path of productivity patterns to a great extent will therefore have been driven by the prior path of investments in science and in the development and adoption of innovations. But the lags between agricultural research investments and their main contributions to farm productivity growth are variable, though typically very long-averaging in the range of 35-50 years in econometric studies that measure the links, such as Evenson (1993 and and Alston et al. (2011). A slowdown in agricultural productivity growth could reflect a decades prior slowdown in agricultural research investments or a change in the effectiveness of those investments for any of a variety of possible reasons (e.g., decreasing returns, coevolving pests and diseases, changes in climate, or a (re-)allocation of R&D resources to non-productivity purposes). In 1889, shortly after the Hatch Act was passed, federal and state appropriations totaled $0.98 million; but by 2009, the total public agricultural R&D enterprise had grown to $4.89 billion, an annual rate of growth of 7.8 percent (4.0 percent in inflation-adjusted terms). The U.S. private sector has spent a similar amount in recent years growing from $68 million in 1950 (compared with $56 million in public research that year) to $6.8 billion in 2009 (Pardey et al. 2015). However, the rate of growth of total public and private spending on agricultural R&D has slowed in recent decades, with a shrinking share devoted to research oriented toward enhancing farm productivity, which might have contributed to the observed slowdown in productivity growth. An alternative (not necessarily entirely incompatible) view comes from looking at the path of the innovations and associated changes in the size and structure of U.S. farms that drove the farm productivity patterns. This view, like Gordon's (2000) assessment of the \"big wave\" surge in U.S. MFP, accounts for the corresponding \"big wave\" surge in the rate of agricultural output growth in terms of the timing of \"great clusters\" of inventions. In the case of agriculture, these clusters include \"mechanical,\" biological,\" \"chemical,\" and \"information\" technologies. Although the resulting productivity patterns are comparatively smooth, the long-term path can be envisioned as entailing a small number of large, discrete, but interrelated, \"meta-technological\" events. 23 The envelope of this rolling series of discrete meta-technological events gave rise to a comparatively smooth pattern of productivity growth as the technologies were progressively adopted and, eventually, became widely used. 24 But the consequent rate of productivity growth was not constant. The various interrelated changes coalesced into a surge of productivity growth during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. After the extent of uptake of these transformative \"meta-technologies\" peaked, the associated rate of productivity growth began to stall, or at least slow to a rate that could be sustained by more normal incremental innovation. Much of the measured productivity gains, especially in the earlier period, can be roads, railroads, and other public infrastructure (Fogel 1964;Atack 2013). Public infrastructure investments that contributed considerably to agricultural productivity include century. The first revolution saw the change from manpower to animal power, and centered about the Civil War. The second revolution saw the change from animal power to mechanical power and the adaptation of chemistry to agricultural production. It centered around the post-World War II period. The transition from animal power to mechanical power is virtually complete (Rasmussen, 1962, p. 578).\" those related to rural electrification, telephone service, and irrigation projects (e.g., see Beall 1940;Fisher 1987). Biological innovations, in particular improved crop varieties that were responsive to chemical fertilizers, took center stage a little later-although they were clearly part of the story all along. In particular, as a result of focused research over several decades (see Alston et al. 2010a, pp. 264-5) hybrid corn was introduced to farms in Iowa in the early 1930s, though it took until the 1960s for vastly improved hybrids to achieve 100 percent adoption throughout the United States (Dixon 1980). Varietal improvement has continued. These innovations, with others, laid the foundation for genetically modified hybrid corn varieties to be developed and adopted, beginning in 1996 (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). Similar, though generally not quite as dramatic, genetic innovations were common to many agricultural crop and livestock species (especially poultry, see Peterson 1967), and contributed to the rapid rise of yields and aggregate productivity during the second half of the 20 th century (Olmstead and Rhode 2008). Changes in intellectual property rights applied to life forms helped encourage the private investments that drove much of the genetic gains (Wright and Pardey 2006). In parallel with these genetic changes was the development of modern agricultural chemicals, including various fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, and hormones, much of which took shape after World War II (Smith 1979;Alston and Pardey 2006). These were also largely private innovations and interlinked with private and public investment in complementary varietal innovations (e.g., herbicide-tolerant crop varieties) (Pardey and Beddow 2013). More recently, much agricultural innovation has emphasized information technologies, including various applications of computer technologies, geographic information and related precision production systems, satellites, remote sensing, and the like. One plausible hypothesis, then, is that the transformation of agriculture in the 20 th century involved a series of interlinked, one-time events, not to be repeated. We posit that the big wave of technological progress through the middle of the century-reflecting the progressive adoption of various mechanical innovations, improved varieties, synthetic fertilizers and other chemicals, each in a decades long process-contributed to a sustained burst of faster-than-normal productivity growth throughout the third quarter of that century. A particular feature of this process was to move people off farms (either entirely or involving a substantial increase in part-time farming) and replace them with machines and chemicals, a one-time transformation of agriculture, which was largely completed by 1980. As shown in Figure 7, the adoption processes for several major classes of agricultural innovations were undertaken over periods of several decades, with many of those processes coming to full fruition during the middle third of the 20 th century. Many of these were labor-saving innovations that facilitated the consolidation of farms into many fewer and larger units. The pattern of land per farm is remarkably similar in shape to the pattern of MFP (see Figure 1 and Alston et al. 2010a, Figure 2-5, p. 17). The acceleration and slowdown in the growth in average farm size, in particular, is closely correlated with the slowdown in farm productivity. [ Figure 7: Adoption Paths for Selected Major U. S. Farming Innovations, 1920 CONCLUSION At issue in many minds is whether anything like the rapid farm productivity growth of the middle twentieth century could be recaptured in the coming decades. Over the most recent 20 or so years of our data, the annual average rate of MFP growth was half the rate of the 28 previous two to three decades and well below the average rate throughout the twentieth century. More subtly, and of equal importance, the statistics assembled here suggest the relatively rapid productivity growth experienced during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s could be construed as an aberration, while the post-1990 rates of productivity growth have fallen well below the longer-run trend rate of growth. One interpretation of this evidence emphasizes agricultural science and related public policy. The lags between investing in R&D and reaping the productivity growth dividends from those investments are long, spanning many decades (Alston et al. 2010a and2011). Another interpretation looks to the transformation of agriculture to shed most of its labor and replace horses, mules, and people with machines and other inputs purchased off the farm-including energy, agricultural chemicals, and proprietary genetically engineered plant varieties that assist in the management of pests and weeds-resulting in many fewer farms, much less labor and much more land per farm. This process of transformation is largely 29 complete, at least in the sense that average land per farm is no longer growing much, such that the scope for further gains from this source is more limited-although some further consolidation continues to take place and new technologies such as robotics and informatics will continue to substitute for some labor. On the first interpretation it ought to be possible to restore farm productivity growth by significantly increasing the growth of expenditure on farm productivity-enhancing research, but keeping in mind the ever-increasing demand for maintenance research simply to prevent productivity from falling; on the second, it is less clear whether the rapid growth rates of the 1960s and 1970s could be restored, even with a significant and sustained acceleration of such spending.  1910 1915 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 Labor PFP Index (1910=100) Index (1910=100) or Acres "}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "Zivot-Andrews Breakpoint t-statistics on natural log of MFP Series, 1917-2002 Notes: Zivot-Andrews breakpoint t-statistics were obtained using STATA 12 assuming a break in the level and trend with a five percent trim and two lags of the dependent variable.

The land input is subdivided into service flows from three basic types of land, namely: pasture and rangeland, non-irrigated cropland, and irrigated cropland.

Rents for capital items were taken to be specific 49 fractions of the purchase price, fractions that varied among capital types. Purchase prices were assumed to reflect the expected present value of real capital services over the lifetime of the specific type of capital. Eleven types of materials inputs are included in this data set. Apart from fertilizers, measured as quantities of elemental nitrogen, phosphorous, and potash, the purchased input quantities were implicit quantities derived by dividing state-specific expenditure totals by the corresponding national average price. The miscellaneous category was preaggregated and included a list of disparate inputs, such as fencing, irrigation fees, hand tools, veterinary services, and insurance costs, among others. In this category, state-specific prices were available only for electricity; all other input prices were national prices or price indices based on national prices paid by farmers. The agricultural input data come from a host of sources, most importantly from various issues of the U.S. Census of Agriculture. Most of the input data are constructed using Census estimates that are supplemented with annual data from numerous other sources, including the USDA-ERS, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), and the Census of Population. For example, Census estimates of operator labor on farms were disaggregated by age and education cohort using data from the ERS Agricultural Resource Management Survey. Also, Census data on the counts of tractors and combines used in production were disaggregated into different horsepower and width classifications using proprietary data from the AEM. In the disaggregated form, the output data cover 74 output categories, including 16 field crops, 22 fruits and nuts, 22 vegetables, implicit quantities of greenhouse and nursery products, 9 livestock commodities, and 4 miscellaneous items that include implicit quantities of machines rented out by farmers, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage. The commodityspecific prices used as weights to form aggregate output are state-specific prices received by farmers for all commodities, except machines for hire and greenhouse and nursery products, which use national average prices. Bias from the procedure used to aggregate inputs and outputs can be kept to a minimum by choosing an appropriate index, carefully selecting value weights for all inputs and outputs, and disaggregating inputs and outputs as finely as possible. The InSTePP indexes of quantities and prices of output and input were formed using a Fisher discrete approximation to a Divisia index for the years 1949 through 2007. An index of multifactor productivity for each state and the nation was then constructed as the ratio of the index of aggregate output to the index of aggregate input using state-specific price and quantity data to form the national aggregate.

A visual inspection suggests a structural change in the U.S. crop yields during the mid-1930s, but it is less obvious how rates of growth in crop yields have fared in recent decades. According to these USDA, NASS yield estimates, on average over the entire period, soybean and rice yields grew by around 1.6 percent per year and corn yields grew by 1.34 percent per year, while yields of wheat, barley and oats all grew at rates below 1.0 percent per year (Appendix Table B -2,). Setting aside soybeans (where we only have 11 observations prior to 1935) and rice, prior to 1935 the yield growth rate was low or negligible. Thereafter (i.e., for 1936-2009), yields for all six crops grew by more than 1.0 percent per year, with corn being the standout: corn yields grew by 2.60 percent per year on average for 1935-2009. Rice yields grew at the same rate before and after 1935 (1.60 percent per year). [Appendix Figure B -4: Yields for Six Field Crops, 1867 [Appendix Table B -2: Crop Yields, andAbsolute andProportional Changes in Yields, 1867-2009] A substantial (but not statistically significant) slowdown in the growth of crop yields after 1990 is apparent for each crop, which suggests that the rate of growth of U.S. crop yields slowed substantially during the period 1990-2009 (1.17 percent per year, averaging across all six crops) compared with 1935-1990 (1.81 percent per year). However, this conclusion is sensitive to the choice of terminal points for the periods being compared, and especially so given the year-toyear (often weather-induced) volatility in crop yields. To address this potential problem, Appendix Figure B-5 reports the results of a rolling regression interval analysis for the (logarithms of the) average national yields of these six major field crops in the United States. The figure shows how proportional rates of growth in the crop yields for these six crops have changed over time. These plots indicate the difference in the average annual growth rate over a 15-year interval, relative to the average growth rate for the other years, in each time series. Setting aside the rather truncated soybean time series, this evidence indicates that the (15-year) rate of growth in yields for barely, corn, oats, rice and wheat has slowed in the recent several decades relative to the immediately preceding decades. [Appendix Figure B-5: Estimated Coefficients on Dummy Variables for 15-Year Intervals of U.S. Crop Yield Growth, 1881 These results indicate that the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s were generally decades of abnormally high rates of yield growth during a longer period spanning the late 19 th century and the entire 20 th century. The period of abnormally high MFP growth began a little later and was shorter lived, spanning the 1970s and 1980s. Up to 1935, the rate of growth in crop yields was, with some minor exceptions (for rice and soybeans), generally below the rate since then. 26 And, again like the MFP evidence, rates of growth for all six crop yields since 1990 are more in line with the average rate of growth in yields over the entire period 1867-2009, well below the rapid rates of the 1960s and 1970s. Cubic trend regression models also indicate a slowdown in the proportional growth rate (Appendix Figure B-6). [Appendix Figure B -6: Cubic Trend Regression Models of U.S. Crop Yield, 1881 Notably, the more recent rates of growth in crop yields are generally similar to the corresponding rates of growth in MFP. For example, the comparatively slower rates of growth of crop yields since 1990 ranged between 0.62 and 1.75 percent per year, with five of the six crops experiencing yield gains of less than 1.40 percent per year; and with a simple average among all crops of 1.00 percent per year for 1990-2009 and 1. 17 for 1990-2007. 27 The corresponding rate of growth in MFP was 1.18 percent per year for 1990-2007. In this instance, an average of the crop-specific PFP measure provides a reasonable approximation to the broad path of the corresponding MFP measure that is of greater interest. An alternative perspective on crop yield growth is the absolute (as distinct from the proportional) increment in crop yields per year. Since 1935, corn has both the highest proportional rate of yield growth (2.60 percent per year, middle section of Appendix Table B-2) and the highest absolute rate of yield growth (106.7 pounds per acre per year, lower section of Appendix Panel a: 5-year and 10-year moving average growth rates Panel b: 15-year and 25-year moving average growth rates Appendix Figure B-1"}, {"section_title": "Moving average of annual MFP growth by different intervals with quadratic trend lines", "text": "Notes: In panel a, darker points indicate 5-year moving average growth rates with the period terminating in the year the points are plotted.

The main ideas can be illustrated with some simple mathematics.  Taking logarithmic differentials of equations (1) and 2gives measures of growth rates of MFP and TFP. Taking the difference between the logarithmic differentials gives an equation for the difference between growth in TFP and growth in MFP as follows: (3) Thus the discrepancy depends on the relative importance of the excluded quantities of outputs and inputs (qe and xe), and on the differences in the growth rates between the included and excluded quantities of outputs and inputs. Importantly, if the excluded quantities of outputs and inputs are growing at the same rates as their included counterparts, the MFP measure grows at the same rate as the TFP measure. If the growth rates are different, however, the MFP growth rate will be different, with the difference increasing with the relative importance of the excluded outputs and inputs unless by chance the distortions in the outputs and inputs offset one another. For instance, in the United States, the purchased inputs category has been a relatively rapidly growing category of inputs. All other categories have been shrinking, especially operator labor. The greenhouse and nursery products category has been by far the fastest growing category of outputs (see Alston et al. 2010a for 29 This appendix draws on material presented in Alston, Babcock and Pardey (2010). "}, {"section_title": "details", "text": "). If we were to exclude purchased inputs, we would understate growth in inputs, and therefore overstate growth in productivity. Conversely, if we were to exclude greenhouse and nursery products we would understate output growth and understate productivity growth. If we were to exclude both purchased inputs and nursery and greenhouse products, the net effect may be to increase or decrease the measured productivity growth depending on the relative importance of the two biases."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX D: STATE-SPECIFIC MFP GROWTH", "text": "Appendix Table D-1 includes state-specific details on rates of growth in inputs, outputs, and MFP for the 48 contiguous states and for the United States as a whole over the 58 years, 1949-2007, and for each decade within that period. 30 Appendix Figure D-1 plots the average annual growth rate of agricultural output against the corresponding annual average growth rate of agricultural input, state by state, and for the 48-state aggregate. Points on the 45-degree line that pass through the origin have output growing at the same rate as input and thus have zero MFP growth. All states had positive MFP growth, with all points above and to the left of the 45degree line through the origin. Some states had both inputs and outputs growing (e.g., California and Idaho), some had both falling (e.g., Massachusetts and New Jersey), but the majority had output growing against a declining input quantity. In a few (mostly northeastern) states, MFP growth reflected a contraction in input use that outweighed declining aggregate output. The 45degree line in Appendix Figure D-1 that passes through the observation for the national aggregate cuts the vertical axis at 1.78 percent per annum, the national aggregate annual average productivity growth rate. A point above that line indicates a relatively fast output growth rate for the given input growth rate (or a relatively fast reduction in inputs for a given rate of output growth). We can think of the points above the line as reflecting faster-than-average MFP growth. [Appendix Table D -1: State-Specific Input, Output, andProductivity Growth, 1949-2007] [Appendix Figure D -1: Input versus Output Growth Rates, by State, 1949-2007 Clear evidence of a recent productivity slowdown can be seen in Appendix Figure D-2, which shows distributions of annual state-specific MFP growth rates over ten-year periods since 1949. Each of the distributions refers to a particular period, and the data are the state-specific averages of the annual MFP growth rates for the period, a total of 48 growth-rate statistics. By inspection, it can be seen that the general shape and position of the distribution of state-specific MFP growth rates seems reasonably constant across periods until the last two, 1990-2000 and 2000-2007, when both distributions shift substantially to the left, indicating a widespread slowdown in state-specific productivity growth. Aggregate input growth was generally higher in 1990-2007 compared with 1949-1990 (and notably so for most western states), whereas output 69 growth generally slowed after 1990. These reinforcing input and output trends contributed to the pervasive slowdown in MFP growth. [Appendix Figure D- Figures D-1 and D-2 display the very substantial differences in paths taken by agricultural input, output and productivity among the 48 contiguous states, albeit with a predominant pattern of slower productivity growth since 1990.
