[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: MAPT encodes for tau, the predominant component of neurofibrillary tangles that are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic association of MAPT variants with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk has been inconsistent, although insufficient power and incomplete assessment of MAPT haplotypes may account for this.\nWe examined the association of MAPT haplotypes with LOAD risk in more than 20,000 subjects (n-cases = 9,814, n-controls = 11,550) from Mayo Clinic (n-cases = 2,052, n-controls = 3,406) and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC, n-cases = 7,762, n-controls = 8,144). We also assessed associations with brain MAPT gene expression levels measured in the cerebellum (n = 197) and temporal cortex (n = 202) of LOAD subjects. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which tag MAPT haplotypes with frequencies greater than 1% were evaluated.\nResults: H2-haplotype tagging rs8070723-G allele associated with reduced risk of LOAD (odds ratio, OR = 0.90, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.85-0.95, p = 5.2E-05) with consistent results in the Mayo (OR = 0.81, p = 7.0E-04) and ADGC (OR = 0.89, p = 1.26E-04) cohorts. rs3785883-A allele was also nominally significantly associated with LOAD risk (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13, p = 0.034). Haplotype analysis revealed significant global association with LOAD risk in the combined cohort (p = 0.033), with significant association of the H2 haplotype with reduced risk of LOAD as expected (p = 1.53E-04) and suggestive association with additional haplotypes. MAPT SNPs and haplotypes also associated with brain MAPT levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of AD subjects with the strongest associations observed for the H2 haplotype and reduced brain MAPT levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.16 to \u22120.20, p = 1.0E-03 to 3.0E-03).\nThese results confirm the previously reported MAPT H2 associations with LOAD risk in two large series, that this haplotype has the strongest effect on brain MAPT expression amongst those tested and identify additional haplotypes with suggestive associations, which require replication in independent series. These biologically congruent results provide compelling evidence to screen the MAPT region for regulatory variants which confer LOAD risk by influencing its brain gene expression."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia, is defined by two neuropathological hallmarks: senile plaques primarily composed of extracellular amyloidbeta (A\u03b2) deposits and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein.\nMAPT (micro-tubule associated protein) encodes tau and resides within a~900 kilobase (kb) inversion polymorphism (reviewed [1] ) that generates a~1.3 megabase (Mb) region of linkage disequilibrium (LD) defined by two extended haplotypes, referred to as H1 and H2. Variants have evolved that occur on only the H1 haplotype resulting in multiple sub-haplotypes.\nBoth common and rare genetic variation in MAPT have been strongly implicated in primary tauopathies. Rare missense and exon 10 splicing mutations, which lead to increased levels of tau isoforms with four microtubule binding domains (aka 4-repeat or 4R tau) lead to familial frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) [2, 3] , whereas the common MAPT H1 haplotype strongly associates with increased risk of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSP risk identified MAPT as the strongest locus, with risk alleles at rs8070723 which tags the H1 haplotype and also for rs242557, which partially tags the H1c subhaplotype [8] .\nDespite having tauopathy as a defining lesion, reports of association between AD and genetic variants at the MAPT locus are inconsistent. While MAPT H1 [9] haplotype or H1c subhaplotype [10] [11] [12] [13] showed association with AD risk in some studies, others failed to detect association with H1 [10, 13, 14] , H1c [15] or other MAPT variants [16] . The sample size for most of these studies range from a few hundred to a few thousand; and the largest published study of~17,000 subjects only evaluated the H1/H2 haplotypes but none of the H1-subhaplotypes [9] .\nIn addition to investigations of MAPT variants with risk for tauopathies, some studies also assessed their role in gene expression. MAPT exons 2, 3, 4a, 6 8 and 10 are known to be alternatively spliced [1] , there are FTDP-17 splicing mutations which increase 4R tau [2, 3] and 4R tau is increased in affected brain regions in PSP and CBD [17, 18] . Allele-specific gene expression studies in human brains and neuronal cell lines identified higher levels of exon 10 containing transcripts but not total MAPT associated with the H1-haplotype [19] and higher levels of exon 2-and 3-containing transcripts associated with the H2 haplotype [20] . MAPT H1c-subhaplotype was associated with higher total and 4R MAPT levels in human brains [11] . A study of exon levels in multiple brain regions from humans identified higher expression levels of exon 3 associated with the H2 haplotype, but no association of MAPT levels with the H1c-subhaplotype [21] . We have previously reported association of MAPT H1-tagging and rs242557 SNPs with increased brain MAPT levels in~400 brains from a combined cohort of subjects with AD and other brain pathologies [22] . Collectively, these findings suggest that the disease risk conferred by some MAPT variants could be due to higher total or 4R tau levels and/or that the protective effect of MAPT H2-haplotype might be secondary to an increase in N-terminal exon-containing MAPT transcripts. While these studies are informative, to date, there has not been a systematic and well-powered analysis of MAPT subhaplotypes for association with MAPT brain expression levels.\nHerein, we present a comprehensive assessment of MAPT variants that tag all MAPT subhaplotypes of frequency >1% in the largest to date MAPT association study of 9,814 LOAD cases vs. 11,550 controls. Further, we evaluate association of these MAPT variants in two brain regions: the cerebellum, which is predominantly unaffected in AD and the typically affected temporal cortex from~200 autopsied LOAD subjects. Our wellpowered and complementary investigation of disease risk and gene expression provides compelling evidence for a role of transcriptional regulatory variants of MAPT in conferring LOAD risk."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and samples Mayo clinic cohort", "text": "We evaluated LOAD risk association with MAPT variants in 2,052 LOAD cases vs. 3,406 controls from Mayo Clinic.

Given that the inclusion of exon 4a in tau transcripts in the central nervous system was not reported previously, we generated a quantitative PCR assay against this exon, and were able to successfully measure it in the human brain (data not shown). All three probes passed our QC threshold of detectability in >75% of subjects, with ILMN_1710903 and ILMN_2310814 detected in 100% of all AD brains tested in both the cerebellum (CER) and temporal cortex (TCX) and with ILMN_2298727 detectable in 98.0% of AD CER and 83.7% of AD TCX tissue. We previously estimated intraclass coefficients [28] for all gene expression probes, which represent the percentage of variance in expression between samples over total variance and which reflect the genetic component that contributes to variability in gene expression. We determined that both ILMN_2298727 and ILMN_1710903 had high ICC estimates of 87%, whereas ILMN_2310814 had a low ICC estimate of 18%. The variances of gene expression estimated from all subjects in our eGWAS of cerebellar tissue (n = 374) [22] revealed consistent findings for these three MAPT probes, with both ILMN_2298727 (0.24) and ILMN_1710903 (0.12) having variance estimates that are~an order of magnitude greater than that of ILMN_2310814 (0.03). We thus conclude that ILMN_2310814 is unlikely to be an informative probe.\nWe previously annotated all our probes for variants in their sequence [22] , given the concern that such variants may result in differential binding of probes with artifactual variance in the expression levels, and therefore could result in false positive associations with genetic variants in LD with probe sequence variants [36, 37] . Our annotation detected two variants within the probe sequence of ILMN_1710903 (rs67759530, rs66561280) that were also polymorphic in our autopsied AD series. ILMN_2310814 did not have any variants within its probe sequence. ILMN_2298727 annotation identified rs73314997 within its sequence, although this variant was essentially monomorphic in our eGWAS subjects [22] . Thus, of the three MAPT probes assessed in our gene expression analyses, ILMN_2310814 is unlikely to be informative and ILMN_1710903 may be prone to artifactual results. We therefore focused on ILMN_2298727 in our MAPT expression analyses (Tables 3 and 4 ), although we show results from all 3 MAPT probes for completeness.\nEvaluation of the six MAPT SNPs revealed significant associations between ILMN_2298727 and rs1467967, rs242557, rs8070723 and rs7521. The MAPT H2 haplotype tagging rs8070723 was associated with lower MAPT levels in both CER (\u03b2 = \u22120.16, p = 0.002) and TCX (\u03b2 = \u22120.20, p = 4.9E-04) of LOAD subjects (Table 3) , as we previously reported in this cohort [22] . The other significant variants were associated with higher MAPT levels in both brain regions. Interestingly, the same variants showed associations in the same direction with the ILMN_1710903 probe, although with higher levels of significance.\nFifteen MAPT haplotypes with frequencies >1% were identified in the autopsied LOAD subjects with complete genotypes for the 6 variants (n = 178). There was globally significant haplotype association with the TCX gene expression levels measured with ILMN_2298727 (p = 0.004) ( Table 4) , that may be a reflection of the significant MAPT H2 association. MAPT H2 haplotype, as expected, was associated with lower CER (\u03b2 = \u22120.16, p = 0.003) and TCX (\u03b2 = \u22120.20, p = 0.001) MAPT levels. MAPT H1b was marginally associated with higher TCX levels (\u03b2 = 0.13, p = 0.058), I with higher CER MAPT levels (\u03b2 = 0.20, p = 0.07), and L with lower TCX MAPT levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.33, p = 0.009). Significant associations with similar directions of effect were also observed with ILMN_1710903 and MAPT H2, H1b and I haplotypes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this largest to date evaluation of haplotypic variation at the MAPT locus in 9,814 LOAD cases and 11,550 controls, we find robust and replicable association of the MAPT H2 haplotype with reduced risk of LOAD or, equivalently, increased risk of LOAD with the MAPT H1 haplotype-in two independent cohorts from Mayo Clinic and ADGC, with similar effect size estimates. Most prior reports of haplotypic association identified LOAD risk conferred by MAPT H1c subhaplotype [10] [11] [12] , which we were unable to replicate. One group identified an association between the MAPT H1 haplotype and an increased risk for amnestic mild cognitive impairment [38] , which can be a prodrome to clinical AD. The only other study to evaluate MAPT in a large cohort (3,940 cases and 13,373 controls) also identified an association between the H2 haplotype and decreased LOAD risk [9] . In that study by Gerrish et al. [9] the H2-haplotype tagging SNP had an OR estimate of 0.89 (p = 5.20E-04), which is remarkably similar to the estimate of the H2-tagging SNP (OR = 0.90, p = 5.3E-05) and H2 haplotype (OR = 0.90, p = 1.53E-04) in our study. It should be noted that both the present study and Gerrish et al. included samples from the ADNI and TGen series. We confirmed that the MAPT H2 association retains its significance in the ADGC cohort even after removal of these two datasets (OR = 0.87, p = 6.1E-04). Thus, there is evidence of MAPT H2 association with reduced risk of LOAD in two large and independent studies. Though robust, this LOAD risk association does not achieve genome wide significance in either study or a p value < 1.0E-7 in the recent meta-analysis of 74,046 individuals by the IGAP consortium [39] . It will be important to evaluate the IGAP dataset for availability of MAPT haplotype tagging variants and to pursue an indepth analysis of haplotypic association at this locus.\nAlthough the MAPT H2 haplotypic association with LOAD was clearly the strongest of the MAPT haplotypes and one that we previously reported [22] , we identified additional SNPs and haplotypes with nominal significance in our study. These weaker associations would not withstand multiple testing and could represent false positives and require replication in additional series. It should be noted that some of these variants, such as rs3785883, H1b, H1d and J showed consistent direction of effect in the Mayo Clinic and ADGC cohorts. MAPT rs3785883 minor allele was previously shown to associate with higher levels of CSF tau, phospho-tau and earlier age at onset [16] . Although this prior smaller study did not identify association with LOAD risk, the biological effect of this variant which associates with increased LOAD risk in our study appears to be consistent between these two studies.\nWe and others previously reported association between MAPT haplotypes and brain MAPT levels [11, [19] [20] [21] [22] . In this study, we evaluated MAPT subhaplotypes for association with brain MAPT levels in two brain regions from LOAD subjects. The most robust gene expression association occurs with the H2 haplotype, as we had reported [22] (\u03b2 CER = \u22120.16, p CER = 0.003; \u03b2 TCX = \u22120.20, p TCX = 0.001), that also has the strongest association with LOAD risk in our study. We find that this haplotype with a protective effect on LOAD associates with lower brain MAPT levels. Given multiple MAPT alternatively spliced exons leading to multiple transcripts, each with potentially different effects on function [1, 20] , uncovering the precise regulatory change associated with genotypic variation in this region is critical. In our study, we mainly focus on results from one probe, ILMN_2298727, that is both informative and does not have a variant in its sequence based on annotation and genotyping. This probe is expected to anneal to exon 4a, however the expression levels obtained from it can be a surrogate for total MAPT levels or levels of any of the alternatively spliced exon-containing transcripts that reside with exon 4a. Indeed, gene expression associations with this probe are consistent with those from ILMN_1710903, which should recognize all transcripts, although ILMN_1710903 is confounded by a confirmed variant within its sequence. Our findings are also congruous with prior reports of associations of H1 haplotype or H1c sub-haplotype with higher 4R [19] and or total MAPT [11] levels, as measured by alternative gene expression measurement methods. We did not identify significant associations between the H1c subhaplotype and brain MAPT levels, though we did observe suggestive associations between both CER and TCX MAPT levels and rs242557, a variant that partially tags H1c. MAPT rs1467967 associated with significant MAPT elevations in both brain regions and a suggestive association with LOAD risk, which is biologically consistent. These and additional weaker gene expression associations with variants such as H1b, I, L and rs7521 requires further replications.\nIn summary, our study provides evidence of robust LOAD risk and brain MAPT level associations with MAPT H2 haplotype and nominates additional variants and subhaplotypes for further investigations in LOAD. The overall genetic contribution of MAPT variants to LOAD risk appears to be modest, in contrast to primary tauopathies, where the H1 haplotype, for example, has an estimated OR of 5.5 from the PSP GWAS [8] . This may be due to different sets of functional variants residing in the same haplotypic backbone and leading to different biological outcomes resulting either in a primary tauopathy vs. tau pathology in LOAD; a more complex genetic architecture in LOAD with contribution from multiple functional variants in different pathways; or a combination of both. Discovering the precise sets of MAPT functional variants; and assessing their biologic consequence, especially on transcriptional regulation, may be critical to deciphering the commonalities and distinctions in the etiology of LOAD vs. primary tauopathies. Our study highlights the importance of in-depth association of MAPT haplotypic variation in well-powered cohorts and nominates H2 and additional variants as LOAD risk factors with effects on gene expression. Larger scale MAPT haplotype LOAD risk association studies, variant discovery efforts targeting specific haplotypes and transcriptional studies that jointly evaluate haplotypes and specific transcripts are warranted."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, these findings confirm associations between MAPT H2 haplotype and both reduced risk of LOAD and lower MAPT transcript brain levels. In addition, we describe additional MAPT variants and subhaplotypes that associate with LOAD risk and/or brain MAPT levels, which require confirmation in additional series. These results highlight the importance of joint utilization of gene expression and disease risk phenotypes. Additionally, these biologically consistent findings should encourage screening efforts in the MAPT region for discovery of regulatory variants that confer LOAD risk via influencing brain levels of MAPT transcripts."}, {"section_title": "Additional file", "text": "Additional file 1: This file includes Table S1 .
