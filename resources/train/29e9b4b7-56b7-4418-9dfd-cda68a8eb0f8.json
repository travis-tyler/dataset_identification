[{"section_title": "Farm Typology", "text": "The farm typology, or classification, developed by ERS primarily focuses on the \"family farm,\" or any farm where the majority of the business is owned by an operator and individuals related to the operator. USDA defines a farm as any place that produced and sold-or normally would have produced and sold-at least $1,000 of agricultural products during a given year. USDA uses acres of crops and head of livestock to determine if a place with sales of less than $1,000 could normally produce and sell that amount. Farm size is measured by gross cash farm income (GCFI), a measure of the farm's revenue that includes sales of crops and livestock, Government payments, and other farm-related income, including fees from production contracts."}, {"section_title": "Differences among farm types are illustrated in this report using 2017 data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual survey conducted by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics", "text": "Service and ERS.

Fifteen percent of nonfamily farms had gross cash farm income (GCFI) of $1,000,000 or more, and they accounted for 89 percent of nonfamily farms' production. Examples of nonfamily farms include partnerships of unrelated partners, closely held nonfamily corporations, farms with a hired operator unrelated to the owners, and (relatively few) publicly held corporations. Changes in questionnaire design between the 2016 and 2017 Agricultural Resource Management Surveys contributed to a change in the share of farming operations classified as \"retirement farms.\" More principal operators reported their primary occupation as farming in 2017. This led to an increase in the number of low-sales farmsthose with gross cash farm income less than $150,000-and a decrease in retirement farms.

"}, {"section_title": "Types of Contracts", "text": "The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) identifies two types of contracts: \u2022 Marketing contracts. Ownership of the commodity remains with the farmer during production. The contract, reached prior to harvest, sets a price (or a pricing formula), product quantities/ qualities, and a delivery schedule. Contractor involvement in production is minimal. \u2022 Production contracts. The contractor usually owns the commodity during production, and the farmer is paid a fee for services rendered. The contract specifies farmer and contractor responsibilities for inputs and practices. The contractor often provides specific inputs and services, production guidelines, and technical advice. \u2022 The value of contract production was nearly evenly split between marketing and production contracts in 2017. \u2022 Production contracts were commonly used on livestock farms, representing the majority of production on poultry/egg and hog farms, and almost onethird of production on cattle farms. \u2022 Marketing contracts were commonly used on crop farms. Roughly 90 percent of production on tobacco and sugar beet farms was under marketing contract. Fruit and vegetable farms had between one-third and one-half of their production under marketing contract. \u2022 Only 9 to 17 percent of corn, soybean, and wheat production was produced under marketing contract in 2017. farm production is sold without contracts."}, {"section_title": "Percent of value of production", "text": "\u2022 Family farms accounted for 83 percent of all contract production in 2017. \u2022 \u2022 Nevertheless, many small farms operate in the low-risk green zone, as do between 37 and 45 percent of midsize, large, and very large farms. \u2022 In 2017, net farm income for the sector declined almost 40 percent from its peak in 2013, though it was only slightly below its 10-year average.

Ninety-eight percent of U.S. farms are family farms, and they account for 87 percent of farm production. Nevertheless, many small farms in each type operate in the low-risk green zone, with an OPM greater than 25 percent, as do more than 36 percent of midsize, large, and very large farms. Midsize, large, and very large farms saw the largest decline in the share with an OPM in the green zone between 2013 and 2017, consistent with lower net farm income for the sector. \u2022 Farm households in general are neither low income nor low wealth. About 41 percent of farm households had income below the median for all U.S. households in 2017, and 4 percent had wealth less than the U.S. median. Smallfarm households rely heavily on off-farm sources for their income, so general economic policies-such as tax or economic development policy-can be as important to them as traditional farm policy. \u2022 Images used in this publication are a derivative of images from GettyImages.
