[{"section_title": "", "text": "Many types of tourism rely directly on ecosystem services and biodiversity (ecotourism, agritourism, wellness tourism, adventure tourism, etc.). The literature on tourism de ines agritourism as the process of attracting people to the farm (Evans and Ilbery 1992) while the literature on sociology de ines it as one type of entrepreneurial venture developed to enhance farm revenue or value (Che, Veeck, andVeeck 2005, Barbieri andMshenga 2008). Thus, the tourism perspective regards agritourism as a unique entrepreneurial venture while the sociological perspective views it as a component of the entire farm structure. 1 Agritourism uses recreational and supply services provided by ecosystems, and the UC Small Farm Program (2012) de ined it as \"a commercial enterprise at a working farm, ranch, or agricultural plant for the enjoyment or education of visitors that generates supplemental income for the owner.\" In short, the lack of a consistent de inition of agritourism and its characteristics has been a barrier to research enumerating its bene its Rendle 2000, Phillip, Hunter, andBlackstock 2010). For this study, we had to adopt a de inition of agritourism that was consistent with the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (U.S. Department of note that most of the research so far conducted on agritourism has relied on farmers' reports of their goals and motivations-whether those goals are being advanced has rarely been examined quantitatively. The research presented here contributes to illing that gap. Therefore, our objective is to assess the impact of farmers' participation in agritourism on returns to assets (ROA), farms' total household income (THI), and net farm income per dollar of owned assets (NFIPOA). We study two types of farms, small (sales less than $250,000) and large (sales greater than $250,000). This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we use farm-level data in combination with other county-level data to study participation in agritourism. The analysis is unique in the large representative sample comprised of farms of different economic sizes and located in various regions of the United States (see Figure 1). Second, we further investigate the impact of participation in agritourism on the economic well-being of farm households (including total household income and return on assets) for small and large farms separately. Third, we use recent data (2007, 2008, and 2009). Finally, the study employs a propensity score matching (PSM) method to correct for self-selection bias in estimating the impact of agritourism on ROA, THI, and NFIPOA."}, {"section_title": "Motivation to Participate in and Advantages of Agritourism", "text": "Previous studies of agritourism in the United States have focused mainly on the operators' goals and motivation for starting agritourism enterprises (e.g., Nickerson, Black, andMcCool 2001, McGehee andKim 2004). Nickerson, Black, and McCool (2001) pointed out that agritourism is a popular way for farmers to diversify their operations and incomes. Using data from farms in Montana, the authors analyzed motives for diversi ication and abstracted eleven main reasons for undertaking agritourism: luctuations in agricultural income, employment for family members, additional income, loss of government "}, {"section_title": "S.

The authors also reported that farm owners were most concerned about luctuations in agricultural income; diversi ication was used as a tool to stabilize their incomes. Farmers who rented their land were most concerned about tax incentives available for agritourism operations. Several studies have stressed the importance of noneconomic motives for agritourism. 5 For example, Barbieri and Mahoney (2009) identi ied continuance of farming and ranching from one generation to another and enhancement of quality of life as important diversi ication goals among farmers in Texas. Other studies have determined that farmers' choosing to incorporate agritourism facilities and programs into their operations relates to a broad range of goals, including educating people about farming, meeting personal entrepreneurial goals, 6 and business succession (Tew and Barbieri 2012, McGehee and Kim 2004, Rob and Burton 2004, Getz and Carlsen 2000, Bowler et al. 1996. Agritourism can play an important role in the business of small farms. For example, McGehee and Kim (2004) surveyed small-scale family farmers in Virginia and found that the number of acres owned, their economic dependence on farming, and the perceived popularity of agritourism were important motivating factors for their involvement in the industry. Bernardo, Valentin, and Leatherman (2004) and Carter (1998) both suggested that farmspeci ic characteristics, including the operators' farming experience, access to capital, and size of operation, were important factors in determining a farmer's participation in agritourism. Finally, Evans and Ilbery (1992) pointed out that small-scale farmers involved in agritourism activities re lected a \"survival strategy,\" a point of much discussion in the literature on small farms. Furthermore, farmers who pursue survival strategies often are earning marginal returns economically and so tend to be more concerned about maintaining the viability of their businesses. While the prior studies offer insights into agritourism, they suffer from being largely anecdotal and may have limited applicability because they examine small areas or regions. Moreover, none of the studies in the literature have examined the effect of participation in agritourism on farm incomes and returns to assets. Finally, as discussed by Mace (2005) and Nickerson, Black, and McCool (2001), no clear consensus has been reached on the factors that are important in determining a farmer's involvement in the agritourism business. Barbieri and Mshenga (2008) studied the impact of owner characteristics on the gross income of agritourism farms. Data were collected in 2005 from 853 members of the North American Farmers' Direct Marketing Association (NAFDMA), which included operators of working farms that generated additional income through agritourism, nonfarmers, and about 449 operators of agritourism farms. An interval regression model was employed with annual gross income as the dependent variable. The results showed that length of time the operator was in business, number of employees, number of farm acres, and being male or white were positively correlated with gross income. Age, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with gross income. The study used annual gross income from agritourism as a measure of performance but did not include income from other enterprises of the farm so did not evaluate total gross farm income. Bernardo, Valentin, and Leatherman (2004) analyzed the status of the agritourism industry in Kansas and found that it made multifunctional contributions to long-term food security, viability of rural areas, cultural heritage, land conservation, maintenance of agricultural landscapes, and agribiological diversity. The authors also found that the United States was far behind Europe and Asia in terms of development of an agritourism industry. For instance, approximately 30 percent of all farm businesses in the United Kingdom at the time were engaged in nontraditional agricultural activities such as outdoor recreation, educational experiences, direct agricultural sales, accommodations, and entertainment. We now turn our attention to the issue of agritourism and farm performance. The relevance of economic goals behind farm diversi ication through agritourism, relating either to income enhancement or maximization of farm resources, has been consistently found in European and U.S. studies (Turner et al. 2006, McGehee and Kim 2004, Nickerson, Black, and McCool 2001. A recent study of agritourism among New Jersey farmers (Schilling, Sullivan, and Komar 2012) showed that some New Jersey farmers were driven to agritourism for inancial reasons while others were not. Despite a growing body of research, the literature remains inconclusive regarding the potential benefits of agritourism to farm households. Some have argued that agritourism income is inconsequential (Busby and Rendle 2000, Fisher 2006, McGehee 2007, Nickerson, Black, and McCool 2001, Ollenburg and Buckley 2007, Sharpley and Vass 2006. In a recent study, Tew and Barbieri (2012) could not conclusively identify economic bene its from agritourism and found instead that agritourism participation was motivated primarily by other goals, such as marketing. 7 The studies presented have investigated noneconomic motives for participating in agritourism, mostly through qualitative analyses. Additionally, the literature reviewed indicates that agritourism is an essential tool by which to enhance farm incomes and farm household incomes in general. However, studies to date have fallen short of identifying factors that determine whether farmers will choose to participate in agritourism and whether agritourism has an impact on farmers' net income per dollar of owned assets, household income (a measure of short-run inancial success), and returns on assets (a measure of long-run inancial success). We explore these questions."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for 2006, 2007, and 2008. The ARMS is conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service. The survey collects data to measure farmers' inancial condition (farm income, expenses, assets, and debts), operating characteristics of farm businesses, costs associated with producing agricultural commodities, and the inancial wellbeing of farm operators' households. As a result, it also provides information about relationships between agricultural production, resources, and the environment. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the contiguous United States. Each survey is completed by a single senior farm operator who is responsible for most of the day-to-day management decisions for the operation. In this study, we use pooled data from 2006 through 2008. We exclude operator households that were organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms that were run by hired managers from the sample. Data regarding income sources and wealth components (farm and nonfarm) were collected in detail. In this case, wealth is de ined as the difference between total assets and total debts. 8 The survey collects data on (i) farm and nonfarm debt, classifying it as real-estate or non-real-estate, and (ii) farm household assets valued at market prices at the end of each year. We estimate nominal and real capital gains on farm assets and debt (see Mishra and El-Osta 2009). Since we are using pooled data for 2006 through 2008, we adjust the variables for total household income and net worth (wealth) for in lation using the consumer price index (www.bls.gov/cpi) measured in 2006 U.S. dollars. The ARMS uses a multi-phase sampling design and allows each sampled farm to represent a number of similar farms in the population by way of a survey expansion factor that is de ined, in turn, as the inverse of the probability of the surveyed farm being selected. Therefore, following Goodwin and Mishra (2004), we adopt a bootstrapping approach that consistently accounts for the strati ication inherent in the survey design. 9 The ARMS database contains a population weighting factor for the number of farms in the surveyed population (i.e., all U.S. farms) represented by each individual observation. We use this factor in a probability-weighted bootstrapping procedure. Speci ically, the data is sampled (N observations are selected from the sample data) with replacement, and the models are estimated using the pseudo-sample. This process is repeated several times, and estimates of the parameters and their variances are given by the sample means and variances of the replicated estimates. We use 2,000 replications. In the irst-stage probit model, the dependent binary variable, participation in agritourism, takes a value of one if the farm received income from agritourism and zero otherwise. In the second stage, the dependent variables are THI and ROA to allow us to assess the impact of agritourism. We group the independent variables into four categories: operator characteristics, farm characteristics, county-level variables, and regional variables. The operator characteristics are primary occupation (equals one if farming and zero otherwise), age, educational attainment, and gender. The farm characteristics are total operated acres (in log), receipt of government payments (equals one if payments were received and zero otherwise), small farm size (equals one if gross farm income is $250,000 or less and zero otherwise), livestock as the primary enterprise (equals one if more than 50 percent of the farm's income comes from a livestock enterprise and zero otherwise), and high-value crops (fruits, nuts, nursery products, and vegetables) as the primary enterprise (equals one if more than 50 percent of the farm's income comes from high-value crops and zero otherwise). We also include variables at the county level that may have an impact on a farmer's decision about participating in agritourism: county median household income, an amenity index, 10 the number of farms that involve agritourism in the county in 2007, the population of the county, and an index of mean soil productivity. 11 The regional dummy variables indicate the location of each farm: Atlantic, Southern, Plains, Western, or Midwest region. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the variables used in the empirical model and summary statistics for all conventional farms (those not participating in agritourism) and agritourism farms. The three-year ARMS data set netted approximately 19,300 farm households and just 3 percent (600) of those participated in agritourism. The data in Table 1 reveal that operators of farms that included agritourism were somewhat older (see Figure 2 for the frequency distribution) and more highly educated (see Figure 3 for the frequency distribution) than operators of conventional farms. About 9 percent of the agritourism farms were operated by women. Additionally, agritourism farms had higher amenity index values and about 60 percent of the farms had received some form of government payment compared to 53 percent of conventional farms. The Plains and Western regions had the largest percentage of agritourism participation. On the other hand, conventional farms (farms that did not participate in agritourism) exceeded agritourism farms in terms of production of high-value crops, median income, and productive land."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Let us assume that two individuals, the farm operator and a spouse, work and live in the household. We also assume that the household derives utility from consumption and leisure, U i (Y i , L i ). This framework is similar to ones proposed by Dawson (1984), Benjamin, Corsi, and Guyomard (1996), and Blanc, Cahuzac, and Elyakime (2008). The farm household maximizes utility subject to time and income constraints. A distinguishing feature of the proposed farm household is that it derives income from farming activities and off-farm work. A farm household's utility maximization can be represented as where L i represents leisure time and Y i represents total income of household i. The allocation of time devoted to income-producing and leisure activities can be represented as where T i is the farm household's total time, TF i is time spent on farm activities, and TNF i is time spent on nonfarm activities. 10 Climate, topography, and water area (conserving or nonconserving) are strongly correlated with rural county population changes over the past 25 years. The natural amenities index captures much of this relationship and is described in a report from the Economic Research service (see www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aer781 for details). 11 Productivity refers to the suitability of the soil as a plant growth medium and the favorability of the climate. While productivity is complex, some useful proxies include crop yield or yield potential and one or more speci ic soil attributes such as the soils' water-holding capacity. The soil productivity index (Pierce et al. 1983) was created to combine multiple soil attributes into a single number (1-100) with 100 designating the most productive soil.  The farm household's total income is derived from farm income (FI i ) and nonfarm income (NFI i ), and farm income includes the household's net income from agritourism. Speci ically, (2) where P i , C i , and Q i are vectors of output prices, costs, and farm outputs associated with farm production for farm household i. Production is associated with various farm and farmer attributes (such as farm size, human capital, managerial ability, operator age, and educational attainment). It is obvious that participation in agritourism impacts the return to farming (net farm income). Net farm income is an important measure of the performance of the farm as a business. Taken by itself, however, it leaves some important questions unanswered. For example, it fails to effectively capture how ef iciently farmers use their assets. Therefore, we use NFIPOA, the net farm income divided by the total value of the farmer's owned assets, as a measure of farming ef iciency. Note that NFIPOA is not de ined by a unit. A higher NFIPOA denotes greater ef iciency and implies that each dollar in value of the owned assets produces more than a dollar in net farm income, a desirable outcome for farmers. However, we are interested not only in the net return to farming but also in total household income, an indicator of economic well-being in the short run (Mishra et al. 2002). Equation 1 shows that both the return to farming (net farm income) and leisure time have an impact on the well-being of farm households (Mishra et al. 2002). The impact of participation in agritourism on NFIPOA, ROA, and THI can be represented as where is an indicator of the bene it ( inancial performance) of agritourism to farm household i and A i is a dummy variable indicating participation in agritourism. Participation in agritourism is in luenced by a set of factors, Z, and unobservable factors captured by 1 . M ij represents a vector of managerial abilities that in luence NFIPOA, ROA, and THI, which we use as indicators of inancial performance. These income and pro it measures are commonly used in the literature (Mishra et al. 2002, Mishra andEl-Osta 2009). 12 THI is used because it measures the maximum amount that can be consumed by a household in a given period while holding real wealth steady (Eisner 1989). 13 This approach implies that current economic well-being rather than future well-being is of interest to inancial economists, researchers, and policymakers. The household's members may scarcely be aware of many of the income components that contribute to future economic well-being (such as contributions to pension plans). Recall that THI includes income from farming and from nonfarm activities. Farm operators, being self-employed, also are interested in measuring the economic performance of their farming businesses. The appropriate measure of the economic performance of farms has been a topic of much interest among economists and accountants. Several studies have investigated net farm income as a performance measure (Melichar 1979, Haden andJohnson 1989). However, net farm income does not address opportunity costs as a measure of inancial performance or success. ROA provides a way to assess the overall ef iciency with which farm assets are used to produce net income. It is probably the single best overall measure of operating performance because it allows for a comparison of farm incomes in spite of different sizes of farms (Gloy, Hyde, andLaDue 2002, Mishra andEl-Osta 2009). We de ine ROA as (5) ROA = (net farm income + farm interest expense) -(estimated value of unpaid operator labor management) ."}, {"section_title": "total farm assets", "text": "We replace the dependent variable in equation 3 with ROA as a measure of inancial performance."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Approach", "text": "Estimation of a treatment effect under a nonexperimental setting is increasingly popular in social science research. A conventional method by which to estimate the treatment effect is to use treatment status as a regressor in a standard regression model. An alternative method that is gaining recognition in social science research is matching observations in the treatment group with observations in the control group based on some observable characteristics. A number of matching estimators have been proposed based on the algorithm to match observations for the two groups. Rubin (1983) proposed a propensity score in which one can estimate the predicted probability of being in the treatment using a logit or probit model. Models of treatment effects using a propensity score also are gaining popularity in agricultural and farm household economics. Recently, Uematsu and Mishra (2012) used this method to study impacts of participation in organic farming. An important feature of the propensity score model is that it summarizes information contained in the multi-dimensional vector into a single index variable (Becker and Ichino 2002). For the matching analysis, we employ the following probit model."}, {"section_title": "(6)", "text": "I i is the income of farm i, is the farm income of farmers who are not involved in agritourism, is the farm income of farmers who are involved in agritourism, and A i is a binary variable that takes a value of one for farmers participating in agritourism and zero otherwise. The propensity score is a conditional probability of treatment under pretreatment variables (Rubin 1983, Becker andIchino 2002). We can estimate a propensity score using a probit or logit model. In this case, A (the dummy variable for participation) becomes the dependent variable and x is a set of independent variables. To ind the control observation, we need the matching estimation. We use the nearest-neighbor matching estimator proposed by Abadie et al. (2004) using the \"nnmatch\" command in Stata. The nearest-neighbor matching estimator also employs a matching scale that summarizes information from multiple variables into a single index using the vector norm || x || v = (x\u00b4Vx) 1/2 where V is the positive de inite variance matrix used to weight variables through normalization by standard deviation. The distance between two observations is de ined by || z -x || v where z and x are vectors of observable characteristics for the two observations. The \"nearest neighbors\" are identi ied after applying the weighting index to all observations. For an application of the nearestneighbor matching estimator using Stata, see Abadie et al. (2004). We need to stratify the conditional independence, unconfoundness, and balancing condition assumptions to evaluate the propensity score and matching method. For a discussion of these assumptions, see Rubin (1983), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Imbens (2004). Finally, using the propensity score, we can estimate the \"average treatment effect on the treated\" (ATT) as one of the measures of the treatment effects. The empirical estimator of ATT is de ined as 8where N 1 is total observations in the treatment, i denotes the individual observation, I i is the observed outcome, and I 0i is the unobserved outcome: 9where M is the matched observation, M i is observations in the control group that match observation i, and I 0i if A i = 1 is a weighted average of the outcome variables for all of the matched observations in the control group (Uematsu and Mishra 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Probit Analysis", "text": "We present the results of our estimations in the probit model in Table 2 (all farms), Table 3 (small farms), and Table 4 (large farms). The dependent variable is a dummy variable that indicates whether a farm household participated in agritourism. The probit model also enables us to estimate the propensity score based on the observables. We satis ied the balancing property using the algorithm detailed in Becker and Ichino (2002). The likelihood ratio statistics of 859.32 for all farms, 505.08 for small farms, and 359.47 for large farms suggest that the estimated model is statistically signi icant at the 1 percent level. In terms of all farms covered by the survey, farm operators who indicated that farming was their primary occupation were more likely to participate in agritourism than those with nonfarm occupations. Since most of the activity of agritourism is related to farms and pastures, this result makes sense. Operators who were older, more educated, and female were more likely to be participating in agritourism. Farms, regardless of size based on gross cash income, that were located in the Atlantic and Southern regions of the United States were most likely to include agritourism while farms located in the Midwest were least likely to be participating in agritourism. Midwest farms were most likely to grow cash grains and to receive government subsidies in case of income shortfalls. Lastly, farms specializing in livestock and high-value crops were more likely to be participating in agritourism. These indings are consistent with Mace (2005), Brown and Reeder (2007), and Frost and Wacher (2010). Government payments (subsidies) play an important role in production agriculture and the survival of farms. The results reported in Table 2 for all farms indicate that farmers who received government subsidies were less likely than other farmers to be participating in agritourism. This was also true for small farms (see Table 3). It is plausible that government payments provide a disincentive to diversify risk via participation in agritourism, especially for small-scale farmers who are more likely to receive conservation payments and more off-farm income (Mishra et al. 2002). Goodwin and Schroeder (1994) noted that government programs are intended to decrease exposure to risk and that farmers who participate in such programs are less likely to be involved with production contracts, commodity futures, and the options market. In addition, Robison and Barry (1987) pointed out that government programs typically provide risk-reduction opportunities, thereby reducing the need for additional sources of income as a buffer against income shocks. Several county (location) characteristics have an impact on farmers' decisions about agritourism. For example, higher median household income in a county and the number of agritourism farms operating in the county have a positive and signi icant correlation. It is reasonable to think that people in a county with a relatively high median income are more willing to pay for agritourism, perhaps from a recreational point of view. These indings are consistent with Bernardo, Valentin, and Leatherman (2004) and McGehee and Kim (2004). It seems that farmers get involved in agritourism by learning from other farmers in the county. Speci ically, Table 2 (all farms) indicates that the correlation between the number of agritourism farms in the county and participation in agritourism is positive and statistically signi icant. This inding points to farmers adopting successful strategies used by other farms in the county. Farmers in more heavily populated counties are less likely to participate in agritourism than farmers in more rural counties. A possible explanation is that owners of farms located in or near highly populated counties may be more likely to sell their farms to developers for housing and/or commercial projects (shopping complexes, parks, and recreation facilities), a much more lucrative proposition than agritourism. We next evaluate whether any of these factors affect participation in agritourism differently when we focus on small (less than $250,000 in gross sales) and large farms (more than $250,000 in sales). In the case of small farms, most of the factors that affect participation in agritourism are similar to those in the all-farms case (Table 2) except for operator age, high-value crops, and mean spoil productivity. Both the operator age and high-value crop Note: *** denotes statistically signi icant at the 1 percent level. Small farm: farm with gross cash income less than $250,000. Large farm: farm with gross cash income of more than $250,000. Agritourism: Does It Affect the Farmer's Bottom Line? 485 Joo,Khanal,and Mishra variables were found to be insigni icant in the case of small farms. However, the results presented in Table 3 indicate that, for small farms, a higher mean soil productivity index has a negative signi icant effect on participation in agritourism. This inding makes sense because productive farm land would most likely be devoted to production of farm outputs, a more pro itable use of such land. In the case of large farms, the results reported in Table 4 show that operators who listed farming as their occupation were less likely to participate in agritourism. In addition, the coef icients for female operators and government payments were no longer signi icant. Finally, none of the regional location variables was signi icant in the case of large farms."}, {"section_title": "Average Treatment Effect for the Treated", "text": "Using the propensity score, we conduct the nearest-distant matching analysis to facilitate matching of observations in the treated group with observations in the control group. We estimate ATT using m = 1, . . . , 5 and report the results in Table 5 for each matched number. The ATT analysis is conducted for three types of sub-samples-all farms, small farms, and large farms-on ROA, THI, and NFIPOA. Notes: *** denotes statistically signi icant at the 1 percent level. Small farm: farm with gross cash income less than $250,000. Large farm: farm with gross cash income of more than $250,000. In the all-farms group (Table 5), the ATTs on ROA, THI, and NFIPOA were not signi icant. This suggests that participation in agritourism has no signi icant effect on ROA, THI, and NFIPOA. Similarly, the ATTs on ROA and NFIPOA were not signi icant for large farms. The average treatment effect on THI for large farms was negative and signi icant at m = 4 and m = 5, indicating that large farms may incur losses from participation in agritourism enterprises. The range of ATT on THI for m = 4 and m = 5 is -90,863 to -90,565 and signi icant at a 10 percent level. Thus, large farms participating in agritourism tended to incur a loss of between $90,000 and $91,000 in total household income. Consequently, large farms may not bene it from adopting agritourism and perhaps would be better suited to growing cash grain crops and exploiting economies of scale and scope. The additional degree of income risk faced by large-scale farm operations could be best managed using other tools, such as government program payments and/or crop insurance. In the case of small farms, the ATT is signi icant on ROA, THI, and NFIPOA, which indicates that, as the scale of a farm decreases, the likelihood of inclusion of agritourism increases. These results indicate that small-scale farmers are deriving greater inancial rewards from agritourism than are operators of large farms. Perhaps operators of large farms generally do not charge agritourism fees and include agritourism primarily for public relations. They also may receive Notes: Small farm: farm with gross cash income less than $250,000. Large farm: farm with gross cash income of more than $250,000.

Our results suggest that small farms that participate in agritourism earn higher ROA, THI, and NFIPOA than farms that do not. The range of the ATT on ROA for m = 3 and m = 4 is 0.0038 to 0.0044. Therefore, an additional 0.38 percent to 0.44 percent in ROA is associated with farms that participate in agritourism. This is a signi icant return for small-scale farmers when one considers that ROA for such farmers generally ranges from -5.0 percent to -0.4 percent (Hoppe and Banker 2010). Table 5 shows that the ATT on THI for m = 4 and m = 5 ranges from $16,524 to $19,043; that is, an additional $16,524 to $19,043 of total household income for a small farm is associated with participation in agritourism. Our indings agree with those of Somoza (2011), which reported that small-scale farmers engaged in agritourism in the southeastern United States in 2007 generated an average of $24,276 in income from agritourism enterprises, up more than 230 percent from 2002. Finally, the results reported in Table 5 show that small-scale farmers participating in agritourism earn a greater NFIPOA. The ATT on NFIPOA for all m ranges from 0.014 to 0.025. Thus, an additional 1.4 percent to 2.5 percent in NFIPOA is associated with participation in agritourism. The results suggest that, for every dollar of owned assets, small-scale farmers were able to generate more than a dollar in net farm income. Perhaps operators of small farms who participate in agritourism are ef iciently and effectively using their assets to generate additional farm income. Our results demonstrate that small-scale farmers can bene it from participating in agritourism because it allows them to diversify their income sources despite having limited resources."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The decline in the ability of farmers in general and small-scale farmers in particular to generate suf icient income has caused many farmers to seek new sources of income and diversi ication of their agricultural bases. Agritourism is an alternative farming enterprise and source of income that can improve a farm household's well-being and economic performance, particularly for operators of small farms. This study examined whether farmers bene it from participation in agritourism in terms of return to assets, total household income, and net farm income per dollar of owned assets. Instead of the conventional parametric approach, we employed a nonparametric approach and used the nearest-neighbor matching method to estimate the average treatment effect of agritourism on the inancial performance of farms. The matching estimator allowed us to assess the marginal effect of being an agritourism farmer on the inancial performance of farms without specifying functional forms or making assumptions about the conditional distributions of the dependent variables. We conducted three separate analyses: all farms, small farms (less than $250,000), and large farms (greater than $250,000). Our results for all farms and large farms revealed that agritourism's effect on return on assets, total household income, and net farm income per dollar of owned assets was not signi icant. For small farms, however, agritourism increases farmers' return on assets, total household income, and net farm income per dollar of owned assets. Those farms can obtain a 0.4 percent higher return to assets and $16,524 to $19,043 in additional income. We ind that agritourism is helpful in increasing the economic well-being of small-scale operators and thus improving their sustainability. There are several implications of this study. The vast majority of farms are located in primarily rural areas, and agritourism can play an important role in rural tourism, which signi icantly affects rural economies in many Western nations. Rural tourism has an important role in diversifying the income of farm households and thus strengthening and stabilizing the rural economic base, especially in areas in which agriculture as an occupation is declining. In addition, agritourism can enhance the value of local resources and preserve traditional sectors (complemented by local manufacturing and services) while simultaneously generating publicity for local products and demand for onsite casual and permanent labor. Our results help to identify the types of farms and farmers best suited to undertaking agritourism enterprises, information of use to both farmers and policymakers."}]
