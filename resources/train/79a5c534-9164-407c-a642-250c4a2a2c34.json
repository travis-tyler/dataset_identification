Smith", "text": "for hill-land beef producers such as those in West Virginia.\nIn addition to an optimal solution for a representative farm, a range of quasi-optimal or nearlyoptimal solutions are also generated. The latter are solutions that deviate from the efficient frontier by some specified percentage, and thereby can provide decision makers-beef cattle producers-with a set of choices more consistent with their unique preferences. Thus, if the level and/or types of activities contained in an optimal solution to a given problem deviate from a producer's preferences, the problem can be reformulated and solved to generate a set of quasi-optimal solutions that could conform to these preferences. Generating and reporting more than a single optimal solution enhances the potential usefulness of optimization models. Previous empirical studies utilizing these models have been criticized for their failure to generate and/or report such multiple solutions (Paris) ."}, {"section_title": "Model Specification", "text": "A linear programming (LP) model, incorporating the quasi-optimal solution technique, determines the optimal configuration of pastures and other production activities for the representative hill-land beef farm. The LP model is based on a formulation by Rubin, and can be represented by (1) Maximize c 'x (2) subject to Ax < b, and (3) X>o, where: CT is an n-dimensional row vector whose elements, cj, represent the unit return to unpaid resources (bi) for the jth activity; x is an n-dimensional column vector whose elements, xj, represent the level of the jth activity; A is a matrix whose elements, aij, represent the amount of the ith resource required per unit of the jth activity; and b is an n-dimensional column vector whose elements, bi, represent the amount of the ith resource available.\nThe feasible region is the convex polyhedral set (4) P = {X > O/AX S b}.\nTo find all alternative solutions, each point in the polyhedral set (5) pA = {X = O/I%X < b, CTX = 6*} must be identified. Likewise, to find all points for which the objective function is within some percentage of the optimal value, O*, all points in the polyhedral set\nIn order to generate a set of alternative solutions that are optimal or nearly optimal, the technique of \"modeling to generate alternatives\" (MGA) is used. Of the several MGA techniques available (Gidley and Bari) , the Hop, Skip and Jump (HSJ) approach as formulated by Brill et al. is used. This one-phase MGA technique generates a tractable number of alternatives. The HSJ method forces into the LP basic solution those activities that are nonbasic in prior solutions. Thus, each succeeding solution differs from previous solutions. As with all MGA techniques, the HSJ method accomplishes this by converting the original objective function into a constraint.\nThe objective function of the model is specified to maximize returns to fixed resources, which in this analysis are land owned, equity capital, and management. The activities are categorized into crop and livestock groups. The crop activities consist of pastures comprising various CSG and WSG species. The livestock activities are cattle liveweight gains. The constraints are limitations on producer resource endowments including land, labor and operating capital. The empirical model has 13 production activities, 22 resource constraints, 1 right-hand-side, and 1 objective function.\nThe model is solved initially using standard LP procedures. Subsequent quasi-optimal solutions are obtained by appropriate modifications of the LP matrix. For this analysis, a procedure developed by James Gidley of the Civil Engineering Department at West Virginia University was employed. This procedure consists of making simultaneous modifications in the objective function activities and the appropriate constraints each time a quasioptimal solution is generated. One of these constraints ensures that the resulting objective function value conforms to the a priori, quasi-optimal specification."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Procedure and Data Requirements", "text": "Four types of grazing systems, consisting of various sub-systems, are initially analyzed. While the systems involve different stocking rates, grass species and grazing sequences, the grazing season is constant for all systems, 92 days from mid-June to mid-September.\nThe parameters associated with these systems were established in grazing trials by plant and animal scientists, and are intended to reflect situations confronting a cross-section of West Virginia beef cattle farms.\nThe preliminary analysis evaluates enterprise budgets to compare the costs (of pasture establishment, when appropriate, and pasture maintenance) and returns (specified in terms of net present values) of alternative grazing systems over time. The base year for the analysis is 1984.\nTechnical coefficients of the enterprise budgets for the pastures in different grazing systems come from field experiments conducted by plant and animal scientists at the West Virginia University Experiment Station farm at Wardensville, West Virginia (Reid and Jung) . Sixteen enterprise budgets were developed-four for pasture establishment and 12 for pasture maintenance.\nThe key factors hypothesized to determine relative profitability of alternative grazing systems include animal liveweight gain, sward production, operating costs, fixed costs (excluding those for land owned, management, and operator's equity), cost of capital, and expected net income. All pastures are assumed to have a useful life of 30 years for net present value (NPV) computations. Data to compute the net cash flows for the first five years of this 30-year period are based on results from the field experiments mentioned earlier, coupled with costs and prices from records of the representative farm, and using secondary data (Agricultural Prices and Agricultural Statistics (USDA); Census of Agriculture (U. S. Department of Commerce); and West Virginia Agricultural Statistics (WV Department of Agriculture). The net cash flow values for the remainder of the investment are forecasted by exponential smoothing. Both the net cash flows and the cost of capital are specified in \"real\" terms.\nAll investments are analyzed using the weighted average, after-tax, cost of capital method described in Casler et al. Finally, a sensitivity analysis incorporating variations in the price and production levels of beef, and the cost of capital is conducted.\nA representative farm is used to illustrate results typical of a West Virginia hill-land farm. The selection was based on attributes such as size, topography and resource endowments. The representative farm is assumed to employ borrowed and equity capital in a 5 to 2 ratio during the production season, and to be in the 2070 tax bracket. While a debtiequity ratio of 2.5 may not be representative of all West Virginia farmers ,it is fairly representative of those who do borrow operating capital. Further details on model structure, model coefficients, and estimation procedure can be found in Romero."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The results presented in Table 1 indicate that, on average, establishment costs for WSG are approximately three times greater than for conventional (CSG) grazing systems. This differential is a result of both the higher cost of seed for WSG and the lack of establishment costs for native pastures. However, in general, annual returns to fixed resources (profits above costs of items such as seed, fuel, chemicals, and labor, but excluding costs of land, equity capital, and management), are substantially higher for WSG systems than for traditional systems. When establishment costs are included in the NPV computations, a native CSG sub-system-Bluegrass/White Clover in grazing system I-is the best investment alternative. This finding implies that certain traditional CSG pasture \n. systems may be the better alternative for some farms, provided that they are the existing native pasture, It is important to note that only 4 out of 12 subsystems, either WSG or CSG, generated positive returns over the life of the respective investment when establishment and maintenance costs are included. This outcome justifies the claim by many producers that, under current conditions a profitable summer steer production system is not a sustainable proposition. On the other hand, the positive net returns (and NPVS) for certain subsystems support the hypothesis that, in some cases, a modified grazing system, incorporating the more profitable grass species, may provide a solution to the problem of low or negative net returns from beef cattle enterprises in West Virginia-with attendant implications for beef cattle producers in other areas of the Northeast. At the same time, the results indicate that establishment costs are important when incorporating either a different CSG or a WSG into a grazing system. Finally, stocking rates influence relative profitability. As Table 1 shows, the NPV for Bluegrass/White Clover in grazing system III, with approximately one animal for four acres, is negative, while the NPV for Bluegrass/White Clover in grazing system I, with two animals per acre, is positive. Although the magnitude of the NPVS could change with the cost of capital, the time period, the management factor, and specific area,"}, {"section_title": "Hill-Land Beef Producers 59", "text": "the substantial relative difference in NPVS should not be ignored by decision-makers."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analyses", "text": "The preceding results are found to be sensitive, by varying degrees, to changes in beef prices, liveweight gains, and the cost of capital. Table 2 shows the variations in annual per acre returns to fixed factors (land, equity capital and management) if the average price of beef and animal liveweight gain changes by 15%. While a 15~0 increase in beef cattle prices (or Iiveweight gain) increases net annual returns for all WSG sub-systems, the increase is insufficient to generate positive net returns for some CSG sub-systems. Further, even with a 15% decrease in the value of these variables, all but one WSG sub-system still yielded a positive net return. However, only one of five CSG subsystems generated a positive return when beef cattle prices and liveweight gain decreased by 15%. These findings have implications for the strategies of beef cattle producers confronted with varying degrees of price and production risks, For example, WSG can be a profitable alternative (especially in hill lands, where they are better suited than CSG), even when price decreases occur. One important use of the sensitivity analyses is to determine break-even prices. Table 2 shows that for traditional pastures (system III) positive returns only occur when the price of beef increases above $70.00 per cwt. This reinforces the notion that traditional grazing systems should be modified, possibly including WSG, for beef production to regain profitability in West Virginia. Table 3 reveals the variations in NPV for different grazing systems when the weighted average, after-tax cost of capital is changed from 7. 3~0 (the most likely scenario when the analysis was conducted), to 5. 3% and 12%. In general, as expected, a decrease in the cost of capital increases the NPV, and vice-versa. Again, the results demonstrate the relatively higher profitability levels associated with grazing systems incorporating WSG. However, this is true only when the cost of capital is below 7 .3Y0. On the other hand, when capital costs are at 12%, only Bluegrass/White Clover (a CSG) in grazing system I yields a positive NPV. The consistently positive net returns-and NPVs-associated with Bluegrass/White Clover in grazing system I, even under unfavorable conditions with respect to beef prices, Iiveweight gains and interest rates, imply that this system may be the best alternative for those beef cattle producers with Bluegrass/White Clover pastures and without a large proportion of hill land. However, if the pasture is not established, its economic appeal diminishes significantly, as does any system that involves establishment costs. For farms with substantial proportions of hill land, WSG is usually the better alternative."}, {"section_title": "-------------------------------------($/acre) -----------------------------------------($/cwt) ----", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "------------------------------------------------------------------------", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "-----------------------------------", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "--------------------------------.

When a WSG such as Caucasian Bluestem is introduced into the grazing system of the representative farm, annual returns to fixed resources more than doubled, from $13,927 to $31,424. This increase is the result of more steers stocked and sold when a WSG is established on land that previously was unused because of its marginal (hill-land) nature. Thus, grazing systems incorporating WSG on hill lands may enhance net returns, while intensifying production and enabling a more efficient use of farm resources, This is especially true in areas with a predominantly hilly terrain that often precludes the extensive use of land and other capital inputs."}, {"section_title": "Quasi-Optimal Solutions", "text": "Quasi-optimal solutions-solutions that represent feasible alternatives to the optimal strategy, and are within a specified percentage of the optimal solution-are also generated. These solutions provide decision-makers with more alternatives.\nThe percentage by which the objective function ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n'iVahres are rounded-off to the nearest whole number. \"Caucasian Bhrestem was the only WSG that appeared in the optimal solution. \"Retums to fixed resources.\nis relaxed to yield quasi-optimal solutions can arbitrarily be selected. For this analysis, quasi-optimal solutions within 5 and 15% of the optimal objective function value were generated (Table  5) . ln this case, the quasi-optimal solutions incorporate changes in the number of steers, the acreage devoted to other production activities such as producing and selling hay, or establishing a specific WSG. While the activities and resources utilized among the two solution sets differ, the major difference is in the WSG activities.\nBig Bluestem and Caucasian Bluestem are \"forced out\" of quasi-optimal solutions #1 and #4; Caucasian Bluestem and Switchgrass out of solutions #2 and #5; and Big Bluestem and Switchgrass out of solutions #3 and #6. The selection of activities to include in each solution is accomplished by specifying an objective function that maximizes the difference from previous alternatives. This enables decision-makers to easily discern differences in alternatives and select the alternative that best approximates their preference. A priori knowledge of the association between specific activities and net returns arising from this set of activities also enables producers to more easily match their resource availabilities, expertise and preferences with the output to be produced. While this facilitates the planning process, obviously any deviation from the optimal solution reduces profits. For example, solution #4 in Table  5 does not include any hay production. This may be appropriate for a producer who either lacks the hay producing equipment or does not wish to produce hay. The \"cost\" of this approach, however, is a net return 15?40less than the maximum obtainable. Further, the ability to substitute WSG for one another is important because seed availability varies among regions.\nThe level of objective function value relaxation can be varied considerably. The resulting solutions have great potential utility to individual farmers, both to provide better insights into the problem and to increase the likelihood of generating a solution more consistent with the unique preferences of each farmer. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The main objective of this analysis was to evaluate the investment potential of using warm-season grasses for beef-cattle feeding in hill-land areas, such as those in West Virginia. This was accomplished by comparing the costs and returns of warmseason grasses with those for cool-season grasses. Four types of grazing systems involving different stocking rates, and including various species of cool-and warm-season grasses and native pastures, were analyzed, The results were evaluated for their sensitivity to changes in beef prices, liveweight gains, and the cost of capital. Both optimal and a set of quasi-optimal solutions for a representative hill-land farm in West Virginia are generated using a linear programming model, incorporating the quasioptimal solution technique. Data for 1984 were obtained from field experiments, farm records, and secondary sources.\nIn general, pasture systems incorporating warmseason grasses yielded higher annual returns to fixed resources than those consisting of conventional, cool-season grasses. However, the much higher establishment costs associated with warm-season grasses somewhat diminished their appeal as longterm investments. On the other hand, not all coolseason grass systems generated positive net returns over their respective investment lives either. Modifying some existing grazing systems, and possibly establishing warm-season grasses in hill-land areas, could be a profitable strategy for beef producers under certain conditions.\nThe results were sensitive to changes in beef prices, liveweight gains, and the cost of capital. For most grazing systems, increases in the cost of capital reduced the investment appeal much more than decreases in either beef cattle prices or liveweight gains. Further, estimated break-even prices were generally lower for warm-season grasses than for cool-season grazing systems. When the pasture is an existing native grass, one cool-season grass, Bluemass/White Clover. was L)rofitable even under . adverse price, production and interest rate conditions. When a warm-season grass such as Caucasian Bluestem was introduced into the grazing system of the representative farm, annual returns to fixed resources more than doubled over the existing farm plan. Thus, grazing systems incorporating warmseason grasses, particularly in hill~lands, 'may enhance net returns to beef producers, while making more efficient use of farm resources.\nThe generation of quasi-optimal solutions demonstrates the potential for a wider applicability of the results than with traditional o~tim-ization analyses. Further, the alternative soltt{ions may capture some issues left out of the original model development; issues which mav be as relevant to the .&lution of a problem as those included initially.\nIncorporating warm-season grasses into the farm tians of hill-land beef txoducers in West irginia-and those in oth& areas with similar resource and management attributes-may not be a panacea for the relatively low, and often negative, returns characterizing many of these operations. However, the potential for increasing producers' net returns is present, even if used merely to complement current grazing systems that consist primarily of cool-season grasses. This is especially important at a time when the competitive position of beef producers has diminished."}]
