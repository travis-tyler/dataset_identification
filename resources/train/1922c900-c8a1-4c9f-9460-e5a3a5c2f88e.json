Most of these individuals were 8thgraders in 1988 and graduated from high school in 1992.3 All tables in this report follow their histories through December 31, 2000. In addition to the postsecondary variables that were built from data recorded from postsecondary transcripts, this report uses data collected from previous waves of NELS:88, including high school transcript data. Thus, it is possible to examine the relationship between postsecondary histories and outcomes and earlier high school experiences, attainment, and coursetaking. The evidence of student records as set forth in postsecondary transcript information offers cogent documentation of precisely what college students study, when and where they study it, and how well they perform in each course. It is important to note that transcript records do not do anything more than that. They do not tell us how much students have learned, whether the learning is retained, or what classroom experiences, teaching methods, or delivery systems produced the best results. For any one student, they provide only an outline of educational history, but an outline that suggests productive paths to analysis. This collection of tables is designed to illustrate some of the range and analytical promise of the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files. The NCES restricted data file from which these tables are constructed includes 482 student-level variables, of which 293 are drawn wholly from the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files; 40 are drawn wholly from the NELS:88 High School Transcript Files, edited with reference to postsecondary transcript information; 76 are drawn from interviews/surveys of students across all waves of NELS (1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000) and of their parents in 1988 and 1992; 10f the approximately 12,100 students in the NELS:88/2000 panel, about 9,600 (75.2 percent, weighted) reported having attended at least one postsecondary institution. Based on received in-scope transcripts and, when transcripts were not received, other corroborating information (from National Student Loan Data Systems files, Advanced Placement and College Entrance Examination Board tests:and other student responses), about 9,400 (71.2 percent, weighted) were judged as \"likely participants.\" Based only on received in-scope transcripts, about 8,900 (66.8 percent, weighted) were \"known participants.\" See discussion of the determination of likely participation in section I (Postsecondary Attainment) and its elaboration in appendix B, section 5.1. 2\"Postsecondary institutions\" include not only 4-year colleges and universities, 2-year colleges, and other degree-granting institutions but also noncollegiate institutions awarding less-than-2-year certificates. 30f the high school graduates in the NELS cohort, 3.3 percent had received a diploma or GED by December of 1991, and 1 percent of those who entered postsecondary education had done so by the same date. The tables in this report use the bracketing dates of 1992-2000 to mark the modal year of high school graduation and date of postsecondary entry (1992). By confining the universe to those survey participants who were in the 12th grade in 1992, early high school graduates, dropouts, students who had been retained in grade, and those who were not in school in 1992 are excluded. The populations under study are thus skewed toward higher levels of academic preparation and performance. 1 1 3 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 29 are derived from combinations of information on postsecondary transcripts, interviews/survey responses, and high school transcripts; are drawn from an augmented test-score file that drew, in part, on postsecondary transcript information; and 30 consist of weights, participation flags, and high school characteristics. In addition, the restricted file provides hierarchical, nested Course, Transcript, Institution, and Crosswalk Files that allow analysts to create new student-level variables or to modify the existing variables, or both. For a brief account of the construction of these files, see appendix B (Technical Notes), section 6. This E.D. Tabs presentation focuses on academic performance and attainment, postsecondary attendance patterns, and postsecondary curriculum. It also draws on high school background variables and demography. The Technical Nature of E.D. Tabs E.D. Tabs are simple descriptions: cross-tabulations and means. The included tables provide standard errors of measurement (required by the complex nature of the survey design), so that analysts can perform standard t-tests and arrive at conclusions about statistical significance. Some reported standard errors appear large relative to the size of the estimate, indicating that the estimates are unreliable. The larger standard errors tend to be a function of smaller cell sample sizesparticularly for the American Indian/Alaska Native group and for some aggregate variables consisting of widely varying groups (e.g., the 4-year, 2-year, and sub-baccalaureate category in the \"Type of institution(s) attended\" variable). 4The core of the test-score file was drawn from (1) the second follow-up (1992) high school transcript file and (2) a special examination of general learned abilities that was administered to participants in the 12th grade. This file was supplemented by test scores recorded on postsecondary transcripts. See discussion of Senior Test Quintile in appendix B, section 10."}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "Section I: Postsecondary Attainment Students who participated in NELS:88/2000 were interviewed between January and June of 2000. Transcripts from institutions they reported attending were requested in August 2000, and were received between September 2000 and March 2001. The four tables in this section present the transcript-based educational attainment of postsecondary participants in the NELS:88/2000 cohort as of December 31, 2000, which was set as the concluding date of the study. If analysts compare the student's account of highest degree earned by December 2000 to the transcript evidence, they will find disagreements in both directions. That is, there are (1) some cases in which the transcript evidence shows a degree that is higher than that reported by the student and, conversely, (2) other cases in which the student reported a higher degree than the transcript evidence documents. The first type of discrepancy is usually the result of the difference between the date the student was interviewed and the date the transcript was received. For example, a student in the final year of law school was interviewed in March 2000 and indicated the bachelor's degree as the highest degree received. The student received the J.D. in June 2000, and the law school transcript was received in Septemberwith the J.D., which is then the transcript-based highest degree. The second type of discrepancy includes students whose transcript records are incomplete;5 some of these students may, in fact, have earned the degrees they reported. Table 1 presents attainment for \"all likely postsecondary participants\" in the NELS cohort. The universe of \"likely participants\" consists of more than those for whom transcripts were received. It also includes those for whom transcripts were requested and not received, but for whom other evidence in the NELS:88/2000 files strongly supports the student's report of participation. The other evidence consulted for this classification included (1) the student's presence in the National Student Loan Data System files, (2) Advanced Placement and College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Achievement Test scores taken from high school and college transcripts, and (3) student responses to a series of questions about postsecondary experiences asked in the third follow-up survey (1994) and the fourth follow-up survey (2000). For example, a student who reported in 1994 that her parents borrowed money to pay tuition and that she held a college work-study position, and who reported in 2000 that she had changed majors and attended more than one school at the same time, was judged to be a likely postsecondary participant even though no transcripts were received (see the more detailed description of \"Likely Participants\" in appendix B, section 5.1). Forty-five percent of all likely postsecondary participants earned a bachelor's degree by age 26 or 27. Table 2 narrows this universe to all known participants who earned more than 10 credits in their postsecondary careers, thus removing incidental students, 40 percent of whom did not enroll in credentialgranting postsecondary programs.6 Fifty-one percent of this group earned a bachelor's degree by age 26 or 27. 5Transcript records are incomplete when an institution said it had no record of the student or that it could not find the transcript and there was no other evidencefor example, another transcript with transfer creditsfrom which to construct the otherwisemissing record. 60f the incidental student population (weighted N=319,000), 11 percent took only one course in their postsecondary careers, 3 percent were continuing-education-only students, 15 percent took nothing but remedial courses, 22 percent took more than one course but attempted 10 or fewer credits, and 5 percent were wholly vocational students at only one school."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Table 3 adds earned credits from 4-year colleges to the criteria, thus restricting the universe to those who had the opportunity to earn a bachelor's degree by virtue of attending at least one institution that awarded bachelor's degrees. Sixty-seven percent of those who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits and any credits from bachelor's degree-granting institutions also earned a bachelor's degree by age 26 or 27.7 Each ratcheting-up of the threshold changes the denominator for the calculations and sets the conditions closer to those under which degrees are likely to be earned. It also changes the percentile distribution of the independent variables, socioeconomic status (SES) quintile,8and race/ethnicity (e.g., the narrower the universe, the more the SES distribution is skewed toward the upper end). Some findings that are evident in tables 1-3 include the following: Focusing on the column indicating no degree (\"None\"), no matter which universe one chooses, men are less likely to earn any credential than are women.9 With reference to the proportion of students who earned no degree, the overall attainment gap between the highest and lowest SES quintiles resulted in a significant difference in all three renditions of the attainment table. At the same time, no differences were detected in the three midrange quintiles among students who earned more than 10 credits and among those who earned more than 10 credits and any credits from 4-year colleges. Except when the sample is limited to those who earned any credits from 4-year colleges, those in the lowest SES quintile were more likely to earn a certificate as their highest postsecondary degree than those in the upper three SES quintiles. Table 4 is a different portrait of attainment than the conventional accounting presented in tables 1, 2, and 3. It consolidates all degrees at the bachelor's level and higher, and disaggregates the universe of students who earned no credential by the number of credits they earned by the concluding date of the study. The rationale behind this presentation is to offer the reader both the summary benchmarks of degree completion and an additional understanding that credits earned are a form of attainment, and that many students were still enrolled at the end of the longitudinal study period. For example, of the nearly 10 percent of those who entered postsecondary education and earned 60 or more credits but no degree, 37 percent were still in school in the year 2000a threshold indication of their potential for completing a credential. Eleven percent of postsecondary participants earned 10 or fewer credits by age 26 or 27. 70f those students with a known birth year and who participated in both the base year (1988) and fourth follow-up (2000) surveys, 31.9 percent were born in 1973 and 61.4 percent were born in 1974 (using the F4BYPNWT). Of those students with a known birth year and who participated in the second follow-up (1992), the third follow-up (1994), and the fourth follow-up (2000), 31.8 percent were born in 1973 and 61.1 percent were born in 1974 (using the F4F2PNWT). For this reason, the cohort age in 2000 is referred to throughout this document as \"26 or 27.\" 8Socioeconomic status quintile was computed only once for the entire NELS:88/2000 population. 9This and all subsequent comparisons and statements of trends have been tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level, with adjustments made for multiple comparisons.

Taken with the 12-year accumulation of data available for NELS:88 participants, transcript information can begin to shape discussions on successful high school to college transitions, college coursetaking following high school success or failure, and nontraditional routes through the postsecondary education system, among many other topics. Data collection for the NELS:88/2000 PETS, conducted from September of 2000 through March of 2001, included transcript requests to over 3,000 postsecondary institutions that respondents to the NELS:88 fourth follow-up study reported attending during either the third or fourth follow-up studies to NELS:88. The transcript study collected and processed postsecondary education transcripts using a transcript control system developed specifically for this purpose. Specially trained research personnel then coded and tabulated these academic documents, sampling statisticians developed nonresponse-adjusted analysis weights for the transcript data files, and other staff developed and documented a data file for the transcript study. 3."}, {"section_title": "NOTE:", "text": "The criterion of more than 10 credits excludes incidental students.

Percentage distribution of the highest postsecondary attainment of 1992 12th-graders who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits and any credits from 4-year colleges, by race/ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status: 1992-2000  The first issue is student mobility, or the extent to which students attend more than one institution in the course of their undergraduate careers. Tables 6 and 7 answer two specific questions concerning student mobility: What proportion of undergraduates attend more than one institution? What proportion of undergraduates attend institutions in more than one state? The answers to these questions are presented for three populations of 1992 12th-graders: (1) all postsecondary attendees, (2) those who earned more than 10 credits (thus excluding incidental students), and (3) those who earned bachelor's degrees. The key findings are as follows: Among all postsecondary students, 32.3 percent attended two institutions and another 18.9 percent attended more than two (table 6). Among those who attended two institutions, 71.8 percent attended the two institutions in the same state and 28.2 percent attended institutions in two states (table 7). Twenty percent of all undergraduates who earned more than 10 credits attended institutions in more than one state as undergraduates. Also, 24 percent of bachelor's degree recipients attended institutions in more than one state as undergraduates (table 7). To provide some historical perspective on multi-institutional attendance, it is helpful to examine the results for 12th-graders who subsequently earned more than 10 postsecondary credits in three separate longitudinal studies that included postsecondary transcripts. These results are shown in table 5. The rate of multi-institutional attendance among traditional age postsecondary students has increased from cohort to cohort. A simple accounting of the number of schools attended does not address the nature, extent, or sequence of attendance. For those features of the mobility story, the analyst can draw on other variables in the restricted NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files. 9 Table 5. Among 1972Among , 1982Among , and 1992 12th-graders who earned more than 10 postsecondary credits, percentage who attended more than one postsecondary institution as undergraduates 1For those students who were in both the base year survey (1988) and the fourth follow-up survey (2000) and who received a high school diploma of any kind, the modal year of graduation was 1992 (89.2 percent, using the F4BYPNWT). For those from this group for whom the date of first entry to postsecondary education could be determined, 1992 was also the modal first year (79.5 percent) for those who entered postsecondary education. The second issue, illustrated in table 8, concerns the question: What kind of institution was the \"true\" institution of first attendance for different population groups? To determine the true institution of first attendance, colleges and community colleges attended prior to high school graduation were excluded, as were those attended in the summer term between high school graduation and fall enrollment (unless the institution for both summer and fall terms was the same). Also excluded were false startsthat is, cases where students enrolled at an institution but withdrew in the first term of attendance only to enter and earn credits in another institution at a later point in time. In this model, it is the second institution that becomes the true first institution. The key findings are as follows: Hispanics/Latinos are more likely to begin their postsecondary careers in community colleges than students in other racial/ethnic groups (though no difference was detected between Hispanics/Latinos and American Indians/Alaska Natives).10 Men are more likely to begin in community colleges than women. There is a positive relationship between both the SES quintiles and highest mathematics studied in high school and the student's likelihood of first entering a doctoral degree-granting institution. in nroughout this report, race categories exclude Hispanic origin unless specified.\nThe universe consists of all students who earned bachelor's degrees and whose transcript records were complete.

Standard errors appear in parentheses. The NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files include variables derived from both postsecondary and high school curricular information. The vast majority of the postsecondary variables describe the number of credits earned in specific disciplinary configurations; for example, upper level laboratory science courses, media studies, non-Western cultures and societies, and ethics. With the exception of variables accounting for Advanced Placement work in specific subjects, the metric for the high school curriculum variables is the Carnegie Unit (after some editorial adjustments on the high school transcript file). The Advanced Placement variables were derived from both postsecondary transcript entries and test scores noted on high school transcripts, and each is expressed as number of courses. The topics addressed in this section's tables cut across high school and postsecondary academic history. Table 11 displays the relationships between the highest level of mathematics the student completed in high school and (1) the highest postsecondary degree earned, (2) credits in calculus and advanced mathematics courses (including advanced statistics) earned in college, and (3) the extent of remedial work in mathematics at the postsecondary level. There is a positive relationship between the level of mathematics completed in high school and (1) the highest postsecondary degree and (2) the number of credits earned in calculus and advanced mathematics in college. For example, students whose highest level of mathematics in high school was at the trigonometry, precalculus, or calculus levels had bachelor's degree completion rates above 60 percent; for students who completed a calculus course in high school, the bachelor's degree completion rate was 83 percent. Considering the gaps in the acquisition of college credits in calculus and advanced mathematics, researchers may wish to examine more closely the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) paths of those students whose highest level of high school mathematics was precalculus to determine the proportion of students that continued mathematics study along noncalculus-based lines (finite/discrete mathematics, statistics, or both). Table 12 distinguishes between core computer science coursework and the broader category of computerrelated coursework (including computer applications) in the experience of bachelor's degree recipients in the NELS cohort, by major.\" Apart from mathematics/computer science majors, engineering majors earned a higher mean number of computer science credits than all other majors, and business majors earned a higher mean number of computer-related credits than all other majors except engineering. Table 13 uses the same universe and format as table 12, but shifts the subject to the study of languages other than English and the combination of language and international studies completed among undergraduates.'2Table 13 is intended to help identify the prevalence of language study beyond humanities majors, and to provide a curriculum-based look at the extent to which bachelor's degree recipients from different majors might be prepared to participate in a global economy. As such, the table I IIn previous taxonomies of postsecondary courses (e.g., Adelman 1999), computer applications courses were positioned in the chapter for Computer Science. Given the increase in volume of coursetaking in these areas, as well as the diversification of fields in which computer applications curricula were offered, the 2001 external faculty review group that focused on engineering, engineering technologies, and computer science recommended that (1) computer applications courses in specific disciplines (e.g., agriculture, engineering technologies, graphic arts) be listed under those disciplines, and (2) generalized applications courses and training courses in office software packages be given a separate chapter in the taxonomy. These recommendations were followed in course coding. For a brief description of the taxonomy used for coding postsecondary courses in NELS:88/2000 and the process of its development, see appendix B, section 3.2.2. 12With the exception of a small percentage of 8th-graders in the base year (1988) of the study who were excluded from the sample because of limited English proficiency, the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files also allow analysts to track students from non-English-dominant households through high school curriculum (using English as a Second Language [ESL] and other coursework to determine who was truly bilingual) to college curriculum (including \"heritage language\" study).\nThe universe consists of all 1992 12th-graders who became postsecondary participants and for whom first-year credits could be determined.  the first postsecondary year consists of the 11-month period following the first-term date at the student's true institution of first attendance. \"True institution of first institution\" excludes postsecondary institutions attended while the student was still in high school, institutions attended in the summer between high school graduation and fall semester entry (unless the institution was the same for both periods), and \"false starts\" (i.e., when the student withdraws without earning any additive credits from the ostensible first postsecondary institution in the first term of attendance but enrolls in another institution and earns credits at that institution at a later date).\nThe universe consists of all 1992 12th-graders for whom a true first date of postsecondary attendance could be determined and who attempted any credits within the calendar year following that date.

Such markers are useful for event-history renderings of student progress (e.g., see DesJardins, McCall, Ahlburg, and Moye 2002). the nature and extent of remediation in postsecondary contexts. Since most institutions do not award additive credits for remedial work, the remediation variables are presented in terms of numbers of courses taken (in reading, mathematics, and total) and by a ratio of the number of remedial courses to the number of all courses in which the student enrolled.

The first benchmark is a rendition of attainment first by credentials earned and then, for those who earned no credentials, by number of credits earned. Those who earned at least a bachelor's degree took fewer remedial courses than those who did not. The second benchmark in table 17 refers back to the academic intensity and quality of the student's high school curriculum, a metric set forth as \"Academic Intensity Quintile\" (see appendix B, section 10, for a description of the academic intensity of the high school curriculum). Those in the highest quintile of secondary school coursework were less likely to take remedial courses in college.

For the fourth follow-up study respondents who were also respondents to the third follow-up interview in 1994, the question assessed their postsecondary experiences since the previous NELS:88 interview in 1994. For the approximately 90 fourth follow-up respondents who were nonrespondents in 1994, the question asked about their postsecondary experiences \"since leaving high school.\" Forty-five percent of the NELS:88/2000 respondents (5,500 sample members, overall) reported some level of postsecondary experience on this item; thus, this subgroup of the fourth follow-up study sample members became the preliminary target population for the transcript study.' Fourth follow-up study respondents with postsecondary education experience since the third follow-up interview were then asked about the institution or institutions they had attended, the locations of these institutions, and information about degrees earned, fields of study, and dates of enrollment and degrees. In addition to this information, the telephone and field interviewers also attempted to identify, with the sample member's assistance, unit identification numbers for each of the postsecondary institutions using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),2 the NCES core postsecondary institution data collection program.

Thus, fourth follow-up study respondents were able to report a maximum number of 13 postsecondary institutions that they had attended at any time since high school. Table B-1 provides, for both the third and fourth follow-up studies, the number of student respondents with postsecondary experience and the number of institutions each of the sample members attended during that period. A total of approximately 9,600 fourth follow-up study respondents (79 percent of the overall respondent population) reported postsecondary experience since high school. Approximately 21 percent of the NELS:88 respondent population did not participate in postsecondary education. The transcript data collection for the NELS:88 transcript study, however, further limited the target population of students and the postsecondary institutions they attended. To streamline transcript request procedures, only the postsecondary institutions identified in the IPEDS institutional characteristics file were included in the final institution target population. Thus, postsecondary information from foreign institutions, nondegree-granting programs (e.g., military training programs), and noncredit-granting institutions (e.g., institutions that offer only short-term training or continuing education programs) were not included in the NELS:88/2000 PETS as they were not included in IPEDS. Thus, the final count of postsecondary institutions selected for the target group of institutions was 3,200, and only students attending those schools are included in the transcript study.3 Table B-2 describes this final target group of postsecondary institutions included in the transcript study. The table partitions the final target group by the level of the institutions' educational offerings (e.g., lessthan 2-year, 2-year, and 4-and-more-year degree programs), control (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit), and special school type (e.g., historically Black colleges and universities and American Indian tribal colleges). 3A small supplement to the transcript study was also carried out with approximately 400 students in 300 postsecondary institutions that were not reported by the student respondents during the NELS:88 fourth follow-up study interview.

The taxonomy of this document, in turn, was based on that derived from the first of the postsecondary transcript-based longitudinal studies, the NLS:72, and published in A College Course Map (Adelman 1990). Each iteration of the taxonomy is reviewed by panels of faculty from the disciplines along with panels of registrars and institutional research officers. The panels are presented with the existing taxonomy, and computer printouts of course titles and allied data (type of institution, local course numbering, student major, number of credits) from the transcript files reflecting initial coding decisions. Decision rules for placing courses in different categories are then either maintained, elaborated, or modified. For the NELS:88/2000-based version of the taxonomy, faculty reviewers were asked to examine the 1999 taxonomy in their fields (and allied fields) prior to the review sessions and to consider the viability of the existing codes, potential modifications, and issues the panel should address. Their responses shaped the background for the review sessions. The NELS:88/2000 review panels made corrections, recommended new categories (e.g., for courses under history on The Holocaust, Vietnam, and World War II) and disaggregations of existing categories (e.g., what was formerly a single code for Linguistics is now four codes indicating subfields), and marked specific cases for catalog searches. As a result of the discussions of the review panel covering engineering and computer science, a completely new chapter in the taxonomy for computer applications courses was created. The taxonomy is empirically driven by the coursework indicated on the transcripts. For a course category to be retained from one iteration to the next in the taxonomy requires a minimum number of cases of coursetaking that differs slightly depending on the size of the database. The process of empirical modification of the taxonomy from its 1999 to 2003 version involved dropping 38 codes due to low coursetaking volume, and adding 157. In addition, a new section of 20 codes covering credit-byexamination (Advanced Placement, College-Level Examination Program [CLEP], and departmental examinations) was created and included.

The design for the fourth follow-up study was built upon the sampling foundation employed during the earlier study waves. Data users are referred to the NELS:88 user manuals for more information on the survey sampling design. The general purpose of weighting survey data is to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the effects of nonresponse. Weights are often calculated in two main steps. In the first step, unadjusted weights are calculated as the inverse of the probabilities of selection, taking into account all stages of the sample selection process. In the second step, these initial weights are adjusted to compensate for nonresponse; such nonresponse adjustments are typically carried out separately within multiple weighting cells. Consistent with earlier rounds of NELS:88, the fourth follow-up study weights and the postsecondary education transcript study weights were modified, where possible, to compensate for nonresponse and to provide point estimates of population totals that were consistent across rounds. (Readers who wish to review additional descriptions of the process for developing raw or unadjusted weights and then adjusting them for nonresponse should review sections 3.8.4.2-3.8.4.5 of the User's Manual: NELS: 88 Base-Year to Fourth Follow-up: Student Component Data File (Curtin et al. 2002) for a detailed discussion of the NELS:88 weight calculations and nonresponse and poststratification adjustments.)"}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education Transcript Study Weights", "text": "Building on the weighting structure for the fourth follow-up study's questionnaire design weight (F4QWT), 10 additional weights were developed for the postsecondary education transcript study data. These weights describe three distinct transcript respondent populations. P1 weights, a general postsecondary education participation weight, can be used to describe the NELS:88 population that participated in some type of postsecondary education after high school, including GED, basic skills, and single-course programs. Participation was based on either the availability of a collected transcript or on information available from secondary sources (e.g., from information on transfer credits contained in another school's transcript or from information contained in the U.S. Department of Education's National Student Loan Data System4). The populations described by P2 and P3 weights are more restrictive. For example, the P3 weights are based on the NELS:88 population with returned transcripts at levels higher than GED and basic skills, and for subjects for whom the transcript record was complete or likely complete.

The calculation of exact standard errors for survey estimates can be difficult. Several procedures are available for calculating precise estimates of sampling errors for complex samples. Procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR), which can be found in advanced statistical programs like SUDAAN or WESVAR, produce similar results. The NELS:88/2000 analyses included in this report used the Taylor Series procedure to calculate standard errors as generated by AM statistical software (http://www.am.air.org)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Tests", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Differences Between Means", "text": "Comparisons that have been drawn in the text of this report have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values (cv). The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can by computed by using the following formula: where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups) and se, and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure5 adjusts significance tests for multiple contrasts. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1))/2 possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, if a classification variable such as race has 6 categories, K=6 and there are (6*5)12.15 possible comparisons between the categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alphalevel for a single t-test (in this case, 0.05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons (15) to derive a new alpha corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. For all of the tables in this report, the Bonferroni adjustment is applied on a classification variable by classification variable basis, adjusting The Sample of \"Likely Participants\" in Postsecondary Education Of the approximately 12,100 students in the NELS:88/2000 panel, about 9,600 reported attending at least one postsecondary institution. Based on received in-scope transcripts and (when not received) other corroborating information, about 9,400 were judged as \"likely participants.\" However, a small number of these reported attending foreign institutions for which no transcript was requested and have been given a weight of zero on weights based on the response type, PSEWT1 (weights with \"P 1\").

Over 60,000 pieces of paper from about 2,800 institutions, ranging from state universities presenting transcript information in traditional formats to experimental colleges for which transcripts consisted of essay evaluations of student projects to trade schools where transcripts were handwritten, were processed. All of this information was converted into standardized records, with decision rules reviewed by an external panel of registrars and institutional research officers. Approximately 370,000 courses were coded in a taxonomy of 1,178 categories (based on the taxonomy in Adelman 1999b) with the advice of six external faculty review teams covering fields ranging from the humanities to engineering to office occupations."}, {"section_title": "ci3", "text": "The next step in the process involved reassembling all the paper and records by student, followed by the construction of Beta analysis files, testing, and re-examination of the transcript documents to resolve ambiguities and contradictions.

The postsecondary transcripts also contained information previously recorded in the NELS files as missing (e.g., test scores, Advanced Placement credits, high school location, and high school graduation date and status). In some cases, the postsecondary transcripts contradicted the extant electronic record of students' secondary school histories. This information spilled over into the editing of the NELS high school files. After the penultimate files were constructed, they were passed to an external contractor, who checked every piece of data for consistency and formatting, as well as the logic for every variable. This rigorous quality control process extended for nearly 5 months."}, {"section_title": "7.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for Further Exploration", "text": "The tables in this E.D. Tabs suggest many other topics for further exploration by independent researchers. These include the following (with reference to the tables above): Tables 1-3 exhibit the highest degree earned by 1992 12th-graders who entered postsecondary education., but do not deal with the broader issue of access and participation. A presentation of the extent of postsecondary access and participation by all 1992 NELS participants (some who were in 12th grade, some who had graduated early from high school, some who were out of grade sequence, and some who had dropped out of school) would provide a broader portrait. Tables 1-3 also do not engage the question of how much time it took students to earn undergraduate degrees. Once that question is raised, the factors associated with time-to-degree could be explored, including number of institutions attended, credits-byexamination, use of summer terms, academic performance, remediation, and others. Transcripts provide evidence of program completion, but because they were received at different times and because institutions observe different schedules in updating student records, the transcript record may understate student attainment in some cases. For this reason, two variables were created for the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files that flag students who, on the basis of academic and credit momentum, would likely have been degree recipients by December of 2001a year after the concluding date of the study.6 These variables, called BALIKELY and ASSOELIG, are not used in the E.D. Tabs tables, but researchers can consider them when building their own analysis files and confronting the topic of highest degree earned. Table 4 and its account of students who earned no degrees in terms of the range of credits they did earn by the concluding date of the study invites explication of two subgroups: the incidental students who earned 10 or fewer credits and long-term noncompleters who earned 60 or more credits but no degree. 6The threshold criteria for BALIKELY were enrollment in a 4-year college in 2000 with (1 a) more than 90 earned additive credits, (2) a GPA more than 2.75, and (3) a true major indicated on the transcript of the student's current institution. The threshold criteria for ASSOELIG were enrollment in a community college with (1) more than 65 credits; (2) earned additive credits in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences; (3) a passing grade in English composition; (4) a passing grade in a college-level mathematics course; and (5) an overall GPA more than 2.5."}, {"section_title": "63", "text": "6 9 BESTCOPYAVAILABLE Tables 6 and 7 open up the issue of geographic mobility of postsecondary populations. Did students migrate to another state for postsecondary education and stay there? Did they move somewhere else? Did they return to the state of their high school? Or did they stay in state for their postsecondary education? The NELS:88/2000 files offer the possibility of mapping such movements at four points in time. Tables 9 and 10 implicitly explore the question of the extent of transfer from community colleges to 4year institutions and the success of transfer students. Are transfer students who earn associate's degrees from community colleges prior to transfer more likely to complete bachelor's degrees than those who do not? To what extent do those students who alternate attendance between 2-year and 4-year colleges eventually transfer and earn degrees? Table 11 is concerned with the relationship between high school and college coursetaking in mathematics. The same form of exposition can be applied to the sciences and, coupled with survey data on the intensity of students' interest in science, intended college major, and actual college major. Tables 12 and 13 bring bachelor's degree major into focus. This topic calls for an account of major by race/ethnicity and gender, with comparisons to previous grade-cohort longitudinal studies. These tables use four curriculum clusters (computer science, computer related, foreign languages, and international studies), but there are dozens of other clusters available for analysis in the NELS:88/2000 (e.g., upperlevel laboratory science, ethics, fine and performing arts, history, and graphic arts and design). Table 13 does not indicate the degree of competence in one or more languages other than English that may have been attained by students in a number of ways (including home language background). For that, researchers are referred to another composite variable in the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files, LOTECOMP, which builds on a number of proxy measures of competencefor example, the number of credits earned in advanced courses in a given language and/or passing language competence examinations (the restricted file includes codes for Advanced Placement, CLEP, and institutional language exams). Table 16 provides information on the mean undergraduate GPA by selectivity of the first institution of attendance, but does not do so by selectivity of the institution awarding the degree or the distribution of letter grades by institutional selectivity, topics that are much discussed in the general media and trade press. Analysts might wish to probe beneath the surface of table 17 to determine what kind of remedial work was at issue and whether the student also took remedial courses in high school. Following previous U.S. Department of Education analyses (e.g., see Adelman 1999a), and in addition to the three high school performance measures presented in tables 18-20, researchers may wish to consider other precollege student characteristics variables in the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files, such as socioeconomic status quintile (SESQUINT), whether the student became a parent by the modal senior year of high school (CHLD92), and consistency and level of the student's educational goals (EDUANTIC), among others. In addition to the three indicators of first-year performance that are the subjects of tables 18-20, researchers may also wish to consider such matriculation and postmatriculation variables as the extent of delay of entry into postsecondary education (DELAYTRI), the nature of the true first institution of attendance in terms of Carnegie type (REFITYPE) and selectivity (REFSELCT), and continuity of enrollment (CONTENT), among others. 70 64 8.

Variables Used in Tables:   Academic Intensity Quintile Derived from the NELS:88 High School Transcript Files (1992). The procedure starts with the highest observed level of curriculum across each of its major components (highest level of math, total mathematics credits, total Advanced Placement courses, total English credits, total foreign language credits, total science credits, total core laboratory science credits, total social science credits, total computer science credits), setting the floor for that configuration at the first of what becomes a 32-descending-step variable that is then rendered in quintiles to smooth out otherwise occasional lumpy distributions. ACCURHSQ. Further elaboration of academic intensity in high school curriculum is as follows: For the NELS:88/2000, 32 levels of academic intensity of a student's high school curriculum were determined, following the procedure and paralleling similar levels defined for the High School and Beyond/Sophomore Cohort (see Adelman 1999a). The determination of academic intensity is confined to those students with complete high school records for grades 10, 11, and 12, and, when local high school transcript practice did not distinguish grade levels, those students with summary records. The methodology calls for starting with the highest observed level of curriculum across each of its major components (mathematics credits, level of mathematics, total number of Advanced Placement courses, English credits, foreign language credits, science credits, core laboratory science credits, social science credits, and computer science credits). The highest observed levels were highest mathematics at the calculus, precalculus, or trigonometry level; more than one Advanced Placement course; any Carnegie units in computer science; 3.75 or more Carnegie units each in mathematics and English; more than 2 Carnegie units each in science, foreign languages, and social sciences; and no remedial courses (mathematics, reading, or English) This configuration was set as Level 1 of the 32 levels of academic intensity. Level 2 drops the computer science criterion and lowers the Advanced Placement threshold to one course. Distributions of units earned, by component, were set forth and placed in parallel columns so that clear breaks (e.g., between 2.5 and 2.0 units of science credits) could be observed and matched. A descending set of intensity levels was then marked. This version was tested for the lumpy distribution it produces, and then modified to reduce distortions. For example, at a level in the distribution where all students show the highest level of mathematics at algebra 2, no Advanced Placement units, 3 or more units of English, 2 or more units of core laboratory science, 2 or more units of foreign language, 2 or more units of social science, and no computer science, one level might bulge to nearly 10 percent of the sample while the next level in the descending sequence might yield only 2 percent of the sample. By adding a requirement for more than 1/2 unit of computer science to the first level, the lump was deflated and students moved down to subsequent levels so that the distribution was less distorted. After 20 iterations of this process, 32 clear levels of curriculum units earned were established. These were then arrayed in quintiles to smooth out even more of the statistical noise that inevitably arises. The quintile versions of the academic intensity levels are used in this document. The elaboration of each of the 32-level version of academic intensity can be found on CD-ROM (\"NELS:1988-2000PETS 4th Follow-Up,\" NCES 2003 in a supplementary folder containing the SAS programs that produced high school-related variables."}, {"section_title": "[Number of] Undergraduate Institutions", "text": "Derived from the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files.
