Precipitation and snowmelt are transferred either to the root zone or directly to the stream network from hydrologically connected impervious (\u210e ) areas. Snowpack accumulation and melting follow a simple temperature index method (Willmott et al., 1985) . Evapotranspiration is drawn from the root-zone (Hamon, 1964) . Saturation excess, generated when rooting zone soil water exceeds field capacity, is directed to two exponential runoff generating pools representing surface (quickflow) and shallow groundwater (baseflow) flow-paths.\nTwo modifications were made to FrAMES model structure to accommodate NACL functionality. First, the \u210e parameter, which controls impervious connectivity to stream networks, was decreased during winter precipitation compared to liquid rain events to account for greater routing of road salt to the subsurface during winter storms (e.g. snow plowed from roads is piled up on sides which infiltrate soils). Second, we added a groundwater storage pool to represent long-term storage in the subsurface. Previous versions of FrAMES conceptualized a shallow groundwater compartment with an exponential transit time distribution (TTD) to generate the hydrodynamic response of catchments. We represent longer time-scales of transport through the subsurface as mass exchange between the shallow groundwater compartment and an immobile zone (discussed below).\nChloride concentrations are calculated within each compartment of NACL and based on incoming water and their associated concentrations. Fluxes between compartments are defined by flow between compartments assuming instantaneous mixing throughout the compartment: \nwhere [m 3 ] is the water volume in compartment . The evaporation from the soil root zone does not remove any chloride creating an evapoocentration effect. Water and chloride compartments and transfers are illustrated graphically in Figure S2 .\nFrAMES \nThe concentration within the mobile zone ( ) is updated at time using a modified mobile zone storage term ( * ) and outflow from the mobile zone through the baseflow flux ( ).\nwhere \u0307 represents the m individual chloride fluxes to the mobile groundwater zone. The modified mobile zone storage term ( * ) is the sum of the mobile zone volume ( ) and immobile storage accessible over the duration of the time-step:\nFinally, NACL updates the immobile zone concentration at time t ( ):\nWe use a single immobile zone of fixed size ( ) with a single mass exchange coefficient ( ) at each gridcell; however, the method could be extended to multiple immobile zones to generate longer-tail transit time distributions. The immobile domain is fixed in size, which assumes deeper groundwater volumes remain constant. As the groundwater pool drains during summer low-flows, mass exchange from the immobile zone dominates salt concentration in groundwater resulting in maintenance of high seasonal salt concentrations, even in response to short term storm events. Our simulations capture mean watershed behavior, and do not account for spatially heterogeneity in underlying hydrogeological structure or geochemical processes that may create spatial variability in chloride retention in the subsurface."}, {"section_title": "S3 -Parameterizing FrAMES-NACL", "text": "The simulated topological network (STN) representing the river network of the study domain used the HydroSHEDS digital elevation model (Lehner et al., 2008) aggregated to a geographic resolution of 45 arc seconds (approximately 1.5 km resolution) through network scaling (Fekete et al., 2001) . We used daily gridded air temperature from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (Rienecker et al., -6.4\u00b0C/km [NOAA et al., 1976] . For precipitation forcing data, we re-interpolated (geographic inverse distance weighting with = 2) MERRA surface precipitation and NOAA Global Historical Climate Network ground station data with equal weighting. We used land-cover data derived from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (Vogelmann et al., 1998) , imperviousness from national land cover data (Xian et al., 2011) , and population density data derived from U.S. census data (Thorn et al., 2017) NACL represents four sources of chloride ( Figure S2b ) with specific parameters defining loading provided on \u22123 ]) measured through the National Atmospheric Deposition National Trends Network (http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/NTN/ ) at stations within (NH02 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest), and surrounding our study domain (MA08, MA13, ME02, ME08, ME96, and VT01). We associated all wet precipitation with throughout the study domain and assume no loading from dry deposition.\nChloride input via road salt application is calculated from per area application rate per unit snowfall and the fraction of impervious surfaces that are treated with deicer ( ). Snowfall rate in snow water equivalents (\n, defined by the precipitation rate on days with daily mean air temperature less than \u22120.29\u00b0 (R. J. Stewart et al., 2013) controls road salt applied. Treated impervious areas receive chloride at a rate specified by the deicer loading parameter (\n[kg Cl mm\n, which assumes chloride salt deicer application rate is constant per depth of frozen precipitation. The mass flux of deicer (\u0307) applied to a grid-cell is then given by\nwhere (Novotny et al., 2009; Struzeski, 1971 ), but account for chloride introduced by water softeners (Godwin et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2008; Trowbridge et al., 2010) . We do not distinguish direct transport of chloride to river systems through sewered infrastructure, and we consider chloride added during waste treatment to be negligible (Kelly et al., 2008) . By neglecting sewer flow, domestic chloride travels longer through municipal centers than is realistic; however, because domestic loading is considered constant, overestimating transport time doesn't affect our simulations.\nAgricultural salt loading is represented as a constant areal loading rate\nfor fractions of grid cells with agricultural land cover ( ): \u0307= \u00d7 \u00d7 (9) Agricultural loading ( ) estimates were taken from two Midwestern US studies and likely overestimate loading from the pastures that constitute most croplands in the study region (Novotny et al., 2009; Stites & Kraft, 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "S4 -Markov-chain Monte Carlo calibration and experiment", "text": "To address our first hypothesis, we use FrAMES-NACL to calibrate deicer application rate ( ), and compare to empirical estimates of deicer application rates obtained from three studies (Godwin et al., 2003; Sander et al., 2007; Trowbridge et al., 2010 ) that inventoried road salt usage. We estimated deicer application rates [ Cl \u22121 \u22122 ] from inventories by dividing total salt usage reported by the inventory studies by total received snow (typically annual),scaled to an estimate of treated impervious area. If total frozen precipitation was not reported in a study, we used data from nearby NOAA Global Historic Climate Network stations. Where application rates were reported in lane length, we calculated lane area assuming a lane width of 3.66m. In parameterizing road salt application in FrAMES-NACL, we assume 60% of impervious areas are used for pedestrian and vehicle travel (Cappiella & Brown, 2001; Shuster et al., 2005; Southworth, 2003) and receive deicer application (e.g. = 0.6) ( Figure S3 ), and that the remainder of impervious area (e.g. roofs) receives no deicer.\nWe calibrated road salt chloride loading rates to be consistent with the distributions of chloride observed in streams using FrAMES-NACL. A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis [Goodman and Weare 2010, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013] informed estimates in the context of uncertain hydrologic storage and flow. The MCMC analysis characterized posterior parameter distributions for 6 free hydrology and chloride-related parameters summarized on Table S1 . We used the acceptance ratio ( ) ( in Sadegh and Vrugt (2013 eq. 10)) on probabilities of non-exceedance (PONE) of target variables ( ) as an informal Bayesian likelihood to test model behavior. Observations were defined as PONE from daily data for both discharge ( ) and specific conductance ( 0 ) at 9 discrete probabilities (0.1, 0.2, \u2026 0.9) similar to methods used by Yu and Yang (2000), Westerberg et al. [2011, 2014] , and Vrugt and Sadegh (2013).\nThe MCMC was started with normally distributed ensembles about each parameter's initial estimate assuming most parameters initial variability was 10% of the estimate. For road salt loading, the initial value and variability of came from the average of the inventory estimates. The prior distribution for was log-uniform on bounds that encompassed 1.5 times the range in inventory estimates. "}, {"section_title": "S5 -Calculation of informal likelihood", "text": "We use the acceptance ratio ( ), the fraction of model predictions that fall within a band of acceptability defined by observation data ( or 0 ) [Vrugt and Sadegh, 2013] .\nThe acceptance ratio [0,1] represents the proportion of simulated values within error bounds (based on observational and estimated model structural error) of observational data. We selected stations with at least 170 days of data throughout the entire year from catchments of order 5 or less, retaining higher order stations for validation ( 0 :n=5, :n=9). The larger pool of stations measuring specific conductivity weights 0 almost twice as heavily as discharge. A priori heteroscedastic estimates of observational error ( or 0 ) were 10% of observation value for discharge ( ) and 6% of observation value for specific conductance ( 0 ), the latter based on manufacturer reported instrument error of instantaneous measurements at 95% confidence:\nA multiplicative factor equal to 4 accounted for additional model structural error. We double the value of from analysis of Vrugt and Sadegh [2013] because we are incorporating information from numerous subcatchments of the Merrimack and Piscataqua Rivers; however, parameterizations are not spatially explicit and apply to both watersheds as spatially homogenous expected values.\nStation data from lower (1-5) orders defined model performance whereas we reserved higher order station data for validation. For each station, time-series of the lower and upper error bounds are: \nThe model's ability to recreate non-exceedance probability distributions of the two variables of interest (discharge and specific conductance) is the primary metric for quantifying performance. Here, for each station with a minimum of 200 daily observations of a test variable, we rank lower (e.g. comparison with model generated equivalents ( \ufffd and \ufffd 0 ). \ufffd and \ufffd 0 represent model generated equivalents of observed variables and 0 ranked and interpolated to non-exceedance probabilities for the subset of days with observational data for each station . An acceptance ratio , which is a system level model assessement equivalent to the distance measure used in Sadegh and Vrugt (2013), summarizes model behavior for a particular scenario:\nwhere and 0 are the number of sites with sufficient data to test runoff and specific conductance, respectively, and the acceptance function counts the number of instances where a model generated variable at a given non-exceedance probability is bounded by the estimates of that value from observations:\nwhere represents either or 0 . Stated simply, is the number of sites and non-exceedance probabilities where model generated predictions for two variables are consistent with observations, expressed as a proportion total sites, probability bins and variables.\nis defined as a range between 0 and 1, with 1 defining a perfect simulation.\nWe calculate the informal likelihood using the PONE of target variables in favor of time-series because our metric of chloride impairment is closely related to the PONE of specific conductivity and the input data has irreducible error that contaminates parameter identification using simulated time-series. We compare concentrations to a fixed threshold ( \u00a73.3) throughout the productive season, and not at points in any species' life cycle, obfuscating a requirement for predictions at specific times. Error in individual storm magnitudes represented by input data contributes significantly to total model error in hydrologic and transport simulations (Andino et al., 2016; Kavetski et al., 2006a Kavetski et al., , 2006b McMillan et al., 2012; Renard et al., 2010 Renard et al., , 2011 Vrugt et al., 2008) . MERRA precipitation intensities exhibit considerable error at shorter than monthly frequencies (Rienecker et al., 2011) , and poor resolution of storms in small observational catchments follows from MERRA's coarse (0.5\u00b0x0.67\u00b0) resolution. Utilizing exceedance probabilities for our objectives eliminates the latent parameters typically employed when representing input data errors explicitly (Kavetski et al., 2006a (Kavetski et al., , 2006b Renard et al., 2010; Vrugt et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "S6 -Definition of Impairment Threshold", "text": "Prolonged exposure of freshwater with salinities or chloride concentrations less than 400 [\n\u22121 ] reduces richness of community structure in fish (Morgan et al., 2012) , fen gramminoids (Richburg et al., 2001) , and stream macroinvertebrates (Blasius & Merritt, 2002) .
