Their help comes in the form of computer models that can predict surge levels more accurately. Wang, Shen, and other members of VIMS' Estuarine and Coastal Model-ing Group were joined in the effort by researchers with the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University (FIU). \"Our goal,\" says Wang, \"was to compare the performance of new and existing storm-surge models to determine which ones have the greatest potential for further development.\" The group tested the National Hurricane Center's current surge model (called SLOSH for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) and several newer models to gauge their strengths and weaknesses. The tests measured the resolution, computing efficiency, and accuracy of each model using hurricanes Andrew, Betsy, Camille, Hugo, and Isabel. The SLOSH model was originally developed by the National Weather Service more than 20 years ago. Emergency managers use SLOSH to determine which areas must be evacuated for storm surge. SLOSH, together with improved track forecasting, communications, and evacuation routes, has significantly reduced the number of hurricane-related fatalities in the U.S. However, the model's limitations lead to large uncertainty in its flood predictions.

VIMS researchers continue to release hatchery-reared blue crabs into the York River in a collaborative effort to determine whether such efforts could be used to enhance Chesapeake Bay's historically low blue crab stocks. The population of female blue crabs in Chesapeake Bay has declined more than 80% during the last ten years. The VIMS research team, led by Drs. Rom Lipcius and Rochelle Seitz and Mr. Jacques van Montfrans, released 11,540 juvenile crabs into shallow York River coves in June. Maryland scientists released a similar number of juvenile crabs into the Rhode River, which empties into Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis. Together, the 23,000 crabs represent the largest single experimental release of juvenile blue crabs ever attempted to test the feasibility of stock enhancement for the species. The release program is a collaborative effort between VIMS, the University of Maryland's Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB) in Baltimore, and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in Edgewater, Maryland. It complements efforts to reduce the harvest of adult crabs through the establishment of blue crab sanctuaries. The ongoing trials are designed to determine the optimal time and place for releasing juvenile crabs. Because the ultimate success of the trials depends on factors such as crab size, food availability, predation, cannibalism, water temperature, and salinity, the researchers spent the summer months studying crab survival in relation to these parameters. They also studied whether hatchery crabs would survive as well as those collected from the wild. The VIMS team released another 4,017 hatchery-reared crabs into York River coves in October and November. The fall release was designed to test whether high rates of predation and cannibalism observed during the summer might decrease in autumn as adult crabs and finfish such as Atlantic croaker leave the coves to migrate downstream. Analysis of the recent experimental data indicates that fall releases are indeed more successful. \"During the summer, tethered crabs survived only about a day on average,\" says Seitz. \"Many of the crabs we released in November are surviving for as long as 10 days.\" In addition, hatchery crabs are surviving at rates equal to those of wild crabs of the same size. Early results also suggest that crabs of the size used in the release studies (15-20 mm across the carapace) can and do survive in significant numbers when set loose in unvegetated sand and mud flats. \"That's somewhat unexpected given the traditional view of seagrass beds as the main crab nursery grounds,\" says Seitz. Data from ongoing studies suggest that grass beds are important for the youngest crabs, but that the slightly older and larger juvenile crabs used in the release studies may prefer the open flats because of their large populations of burrowing clams-animals the young crabs like to eat. \"Our recent field experiments also suggest that releasing slightly larger juvenile crabs of 20-25 mm carapace width produces higher survivorship,\" says Lipcius. The hatchery crabs were reared at COMB by Drs. Yoni Zohar and Odi Smora, who have spent the last several years overcoming previous obstacles to raising blue crabs in captivity, including cannibalism.

But instead of a potential menace to the waterway, the red patches were part of a study designed to further enhance biosecurity of non-native oyster trials. \"Each of the red patches resulted from the release of about 30 gallons of rhodamine dye into the water,\" says project leader Dr. Roger Mann. Mann, Dr. Kenneth Moore, and other VIMS researchers tracked the dye patches to help predict where tidal currents would carry larval oysters in the unlikely event that any of the nonnative oysters now deployed in seafood industry trials successfully reproduce. The The dye study is one requirement of a July decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to extend the Virginia Seafood Council's on-going trial of the non-native oyster Crassostrea ariakensis. NOAA, EPA, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service also contributed to the decision. The Virginia Seafood Council (VSC) trials began in September 2003 when commercial growers deployed 100,000 sterile oysters at each of 8 sites in the Virginia waters of Chesapeake Bay. The Virginia Marine Resources Commission granted a state permit for the trial through May 2005. The Army Corps of Engineers granted a federal permit through June 2004. Both dates were based on a planned starting date of August 2003. But a two-month delay in the initial deployment of the oysters led the growers to request an extension of the federal permit until April 2005 so that their animals can grow to market size. The main concern with the VSC request was that the extension would allow the non-native oysters to remain in the water during their summer spawning season. The deployed oysters are the offspring of adult oysters that were genetically manipulated to produce progeny with three sets of chromosomes, rather than the pair of chromosomes carried by normal \"diploid\" oysters. These \"triploid\" offspring are effectively sterile. However, this process is not foolproof, and the original VSC permit allowed a maximum of 1 diploid oyster per 1,000 non-native oysters deployed. The federal agreement to extend the VSC permit contained two key provisions to minimize the risk that any of the deployed diploid oysters might successfully spawn and produce larvae that could establish a feral population. First, the extension permit required that the growers further thin out their oysters, either by distributing them amongst a larger number of containment bags, or selling those of market size. The growers also had to move the structures that contain the bags farther apart. Oysters are \"broadcast spawners\" that release eggs and sperm freely into the water.

The tags, which consist of a tiny wire inserted into leg muscle, allow researchers to track the crabs despite repeated molting of the external skeleton. Researchers can easily identify a tagged and recaptured crab by passing it across a metal detector. Each of the crabs was also tagged with a dye visible through the transparent exoskeleton of the swimming legs. After transporting the crabs to VIMS in iced coolers, the researchers released the animals into a shallow, muddy cove in the Catlett Islands (a pristine salt marsh habitat owned and managed by the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve at VIMS), and another cove in Indian Field Creek, a pristine habitat under the protection of the Naval Weapons Station. \"Linking our scientific enhancement efforts with the federal protection and relatively pristine nature of many military installations may produce a favorable set of conditions for growth and survival of juvenile blue crabs,\" notes Lipcius. The current research builds on experiments during 2003 in which Lipcius, Seitz, and van Montfrans moved young crabs from York River and Tangier Island grass beds into the same Catlett Island coves. High survival rates among these transplanted crabs showed that the coves contain far fewer crabs than they are capable of supporting. \"Last year's experiments suggest that the ecosystem is below its carrying capacity, and that the blue crab is limited by recruitment, not resources,\" says Lipcius. In other words, low crab numbers aren't due to a lack of food, but to a shortage of young crabs. \"That's why enhancement using hatchery-reared crabs seems like a viable method for restoring the Chesapeake's blue crab population,\" says Seitz.

During a morning field session participants learned to identify species of fresh and salt-water plants that help delineate tidal zones, and observed the effects of tidal range on wetland jurisdictional areas. A seining session allowed participants to get their feet wet while learning about the natural history of Chesapeake Bay's shallowwater inhabitants. The Crest 5 VIMS Associate Professor Dr. Linda Schaffner testified before the House Committee on Government Reform in August that restoring the health of Chesapeake Bay will require effective interactions between monitoring programs and computer modeling. The committee hearing, \"A Model of Success? Monitoring, Measuring and Managing the Health of the Chesapeake Bay,\" was called in response to an August 5th Washington Post article on inconsistencies between what modeling and monitoring data say about the true status of efforts to clean up the Bay. The field hearing took place at Fort Monroe in Hampton. The Post article contended that the computer model used by the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) to estimate pollution reduction in the Bay significantly overstates the Program's environmental achievements. The CBP is a regional partnership established in 1983 to restore the nation's largest estuary. The Government Reform Committee, which is chaired by Congressman Tom Davis (R-VA-11th), convened the field hearing to help determine whether or not the Bay Program and its partners are using the best methods to measure and report progress in protecting and improving the health of the Bay. According to the Post, several scientists affiliated with the CBP say that water monitoring measures pollution reduction more reliably than Schaffner, who also serves as president of the Estuarine Research Federation, credited the CBP with fostering a spirit of cooperation among the scientists who study the nation's largest estuary. \"[The] program has done a good job of soliciting science input on the issues, asking scientists to review programs, recommendations and strategies, and practicing scienceinformed management,\" says Schaffner. \"The holistic view that many of us working in the Bay's science community have of the Bay and its ecosystem can be attributed to the structure and synthesis the CBP has promoted.\" She also called for an increase in funding for estuarine research and for nutrient reduction in support of efforts to restore the Bay's water quality. Schaffner Schaffner contends that modeling versus monitoring is not an either-or question. \"Attempts to weigh the relative merits of modeling or monitoring are misguided-they are two sides of the same coin,\" said Schaffner. \"We need both and they should be used in concert to understand and verify where we are in our efforts to restore the Bay.\" Schaffner also stressed the need for effective communication between the modeling and monitoring communities, particularly in light of the geographic and administrative complexities inherent in a regional collaboration such as the CBP. \"Good communication and exchange of information between monitoring and modeling efforts is essential,\" noted Schaffner. \"Although this needed level of communication may be relatively easily established and maintained when a program is small, it can be considerably more difficult to attain when a program is large or when different agencies are responsible for modeling versus monitoring programs.\" The CBP includes representatives from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; the District of Columbia; the Chesapeake Bay Commission (a tristate legislative body); the Environmental Protection Agency; and participating citizen advisory groups. VIMS researchers Walter Priest and William Reay were part of a group that recently received a prestigious national award for their efforts to help restore the Elizabeth River, a highly industrialized tributary of the James River and Chesapeake Bay that includes three \"Superfund\" sites. VIMS, the Navy and its contractors, EPA, the Elizabeth River Project, Atlantic Wood Industries, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality received the 2004 Coastal America Spirit Award to recognize their restoration work at the Atlantic Wood and Norfolk Naval Shipyard sites and the New Gosport landfill. The Coastal America Spirit Award is presented to unique, multi-agency partnerships that demonstrate teamwork in restoring and protecting U.S. coastal resources. Coastal America is a partnership among federal, state, and local governments and private alliances to address environmental problems affecting the nation's coast, waterways, and wetlands. Dr. Carl Hershner, head of VIMS' Center for Coastal Resources Management (CCRM), notes that \"Priest and Reay have long and remarkable track records of providing extensive and usually unheralded technical assistance to many groups in the region.\" Priest is affiliated with CCRM's Wetlands Unit.

The Atlantic Wood site, which was used from 1926 to 1992 to treat wood with creosote, sits on the industrialized waterfront of Portsmouth beside the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Because the restoration project involved \"crossboundary contamination\" between the two facilities, cleanup required unique legal agreements and partnerships among the award recipients.

The fiveweek residential program has provided high-achieving Virginia high school students with marine research experiences for 14 years. The program is structured as an apprenticeship in which each student works with a faculty sponsor on an authentic VIMS research project. From L, Molly Turner (West Potomac HS, Alexandria), Residential Assistant Jennifer Scott (Potomac HS, Dumphries, VA), Jenny Geldermann (Chantilly HS, Chantilly), Ian Keene-Babcock (Glenvar HS, Salem), and David Gibbs (H-B Woodlawn Alternative Program, Arlington). Ms. Turner worked with VIMS graduate student Jill Peloquin to identify and quantify phytoplankton from the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Ms. Geldermann worked with Dr. Rom Lipcius to examine the role of the blue crab as a keystone predator in salt marshes of Chesapeake Bay. Mr. Keene-Babcock helped Dr. Rochelle Seitz to determine relative survival rates of juvenile blue crabs in habitats with varying predator and prey levels. Mr. Gibbs helped graduate student Todd Gedamke determine the rate of growth of barndoor skates via analysis of dissected vertebrae. A key to the newer models' potential is their much higher resolution. UnTRIM, for example, can perform its calculations within a framework of grid cells that are as small as 30 meters square. By comparison, the smallest cells in the SLOSH model (which was originally designed for relatively smooth coastlines) are on the order of 1 square kilometer. The newer models also use grid systems that are much more flexible, allowing a closer fit to the convoluted shoreline of an estuary like Chesapeake Bay. \"UnTRIM's unstructured grid gives us the ability to fit the model grid to the shoreline and to resolve the tributaries,\" says Shen. \"It can accommodate complicated geometry,\" adds Wang. UnTRIM's greater resolution and flexibility allows it to create a virtual Bay made up of 239,541 cells of varying shape. In simulations using data from Hurricane Isabel, the UnTRIM model's surge predictions closely matched realtime water-level measurements from various sites in the Bay, including Gloucester Point in the York River and Sewells Point in the James River. \"The Isabel simulation captured both the evolution of the surge and its peak distribution,\" notes Shen. \"It clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the unstructured-grid model for simulating storm surge.\" Storm-surge models are also benefiting from advances in coastal mapping. Shen and Wang's collaborators at FIU are leaders in the application of a new airborne mapping technology called LIDAR, for Light Detection And Ranging. Whereas existing coastal maps show topography in intervals of 5 to 10 feet, LIDAR data are routinely accurate to 6 inches. Incorporating highly detailed LIDAR data within a storm-surge model promises forecasts of unprecedented accuracy. That's particularly important in flat-lying coastal plains, where even small discrepancies between mapped and actual elevations can result in surge-prediction errors that trigger massive over-evacuations, at an estimated cost of $1 million per mile. Data from a new generation of ocean-observing systems, like the one being developed at VIMS (see Spring 2004 issue of the CREST), also promise to improve model accuracy. Modelers can use these data both to improve real-time forecasts and to validate and refine their models. \"We simply can't do high-quality modeling without ocean-observing systems,\" says Wang. \"The accuracy of coastal-flooding predictions is directly related to the accuracy of the model, and that depends greatly on good observational data.\" But the modelers' greatest challenge, notes Shen, is to bridge the gap between the large-scale wind forces that drive the hurricane at sea, and the small-scale features that control the surge level in any particular spot. \"Hurricanes come from the ocean, but the critical area for surge modeling is the coast and estuary,\" says Wang. To perform best, \"[the model] needs to simultaneously cover the large area where the storm roams and the details of the local region where people live.\" A related challenge is to better incorporate the atmospheric parameters that drive the hurricane and its surge. This is partly an issue of conflicting data standards that reflects the traditional separation between oceanographers and atmospheric scientists. \"We need an 'industry standard' for data so we can communicate more freely,\" says Wang. Atmospheric data parameters include a hurricane's winds, central pressure, size, forward speed, and track direction. Funding for the just-completed model inter-comparison study came from the Federal Emergency Management Agency through a grant to FIU. Wang and Shen are now continuing their efforts with funding from the Navy and NOAA, through a grant from SCOOP (the Southeastern University Research Association, Coastal Observation and Operational Prediction Program). \"The inter-comparison study gave us a new direction for our own modeling research,\" says Shen. \"We're excited about the possibilities.\" For more information on the model inter-comparison project, visit http:// www.ihrc.fiu.edu/lcr/research/ windstorm_simulation/index.htm "}, {"section_title": "Network Upgrades Continue", "text": "The drive to replace VIMS' outdated network of copper lines with fiber-optic cables moved one step closer to completion in September when contractors converted the lines on the north end of campus. \"All the north end buildings are now connected by fiber optic cable for their data network connections,\" says ITNS Director Newt Munson. \"This will greatly reduce ITNS staff time and equipment replacement costs following the next lightning storm.\" The new fiber optic network provides at least 100-megabit data connection rates among Brown, Hall, Wilson, and Sowers houses; the DCOP building; and the new CBNEER facilities.

With an initial bankroll of $100, each player tries to maintain financial success while accumulating the fewest invasive species. The game is divided into rounds in which each player rolls a die in an attempt to bring a ship and its associated revenue into their port. Some of these ships carry invasive species in their ballast tanks. If an invader is present, the player checks a reference card to determine if the port provides it with suitable habitat. If so, the player records the species along with the number of rounds it will require to become established. If two invasive species become established in a port, it loses business and the player begins to lose money. After each round players can hire inspectors to keep out invasive species. They can also pay to raise their port's economic level to attract more vessels. \"The winners are the players that end up with the fewest invasive species, the best economic performance, and the most money,\" says Carriger. At the end of the game, the group compares each port's success and reviews the strategy behind each player's actions. The MACOSEE conference gave Carriger and Newman an opportunity to test the invasive species game with classroom science teachers from several mid-Atlantic states. Carriger worried the game might be too involved for pre-high-school students, but the middle-school teachers he worked with thought it would be perfect for their curriculum. Several of the teachers developed lesson plans around the game so that they can use it in their classroom during the school year. \"The teachers absolutely loved it,\" says Newman. \"There wasn't a single person who wasn't pleased.

Five such plans are currently in the works. They are designed to help managers simultaneously provide maximum sustainable yields for blue crabs, oysters, striped bass, shad and related species, and menhaden. \"The FEP will make all future fishery management plans in Chesapeake Bay ecosystem-based,\" says Lipcius. Ecosystem-based plans reflect a growing recognition among scientists that a complex web of interacting factors affects the dynamics of every fisheries species. That means, for instance, that the blue crab management plan will take into account that adult crabs eat young oysters, and that juvenile crabs won't survive unless they have sea grass beds in which to escape predation by striped bass. \"In the past we managed fisheries species one by one, apart from what was going on in the rest of the ecosystem,\" says Lipcius. \"But we've now come to recognize that everything is hooked to everything else, and that all species are affected by a range of ecological and socioeconomic issues.

The second provision required the completion of the dye study, to better understand where tidal currents are likely to carry any larvae that might result from successful reproduction between two diploid non-native oysters. If tidal currents scatter the larvae so that they settle over a broad area, they will be too far apart to reproduce as adults. VIMS Assistant Professor Jian Shen is feeding the field data from the dye releases into a high-resolution computer model of lower Chesapeake Bay. Model output helped the researchers track and sample each dye patches in the week following its release (after which it became too dilute to measure). In turn, their field data helps the model predict the movement of the patch, and can be used to calibrate the model so that it can more accurately predict larval dispersal at other sites and under different conditions. Researchers have used rhodamine dye in hundreds of studies since the 1960s to trace water movement through lakes, rivers, and estuaries. They use it because it dissolves readily in water, is harmless in low concentrations, and is strongly fluorescent and thus easy to detect. Mann and Moore traced the dye patch using a boatmounted \"Dataflow\" sensor that can measure dye concentrations continuously while the vessel travels at speeds up to 20 knots. \"Our overall objective is to demonstrate and quantify dispersal of a larval surrogate-fluorescent dye-at four of the trial sites to provide quantitative input to the risk analysis,\" says Mann. \"Release of fluorescent dye provides a tractable method to simulate passive dispersal of larval forms on a sitespecific basis in real time. Site-specific data are required to provide critical values for risk assessment in the ongoing permit process.\" Funding for the study comes from EPA and NOAA through the Chesapeake Bay Program, and from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.

Andrews passed away October 28 at the age of 88. Andrews, affectionately known as \"Andy\" by his many friends and colleagues, is widely respected for his fundamental research on the ecology of oyster pathogens in Chesapeake Bay. Equally important were his oyster spatfall studies and the disease-management strategies he developed for industry. Andy In 1946 Andy and fellow student Willard Van Engel attended a fisheries meeting in St. Louis where they met the Director of the Virginia Fisheries Laboratory (the precursor of VIMS), who offered them jobs that they both accepted. Andy soon began studying oyster spatfall patterns in Bay tributaries. After years of monitoring, he recognized that small Bay tributaries have significant annual setting patterns despite relatively low oyster populations, due to high larval retention.

When the reef-restoration strategy was initiated in Virginia in 1996, the first reconstructed reefs were placed in these small tributaries because of the larval-retention patterns Andy had documented. Andy produced fundamental papers on Dermo disease during the 1950s and his 1988 review on the pathogen is still widely read and cited. When Haplosporidium nelsoni (MSX disease) appeared in Chesapeake Bay in 1959, Andy immediately began studying this organism and produced many seminal papers on its ecology. In 1960 he initiated a monitoring program for H. nelsoni at VIMS using imported oysters. This program continues today and provides a 42-year database on H. nelsoni prevalence and intensity that has proved invaluable for examining climate effects on pathogen abundance. Andy was also a long-time educator. During his career at VIMS he taught Ichthyology, Field Biology, Taxonomy and Systematics, Marine Ecology, and Biological Oceanography. He was a long-time member of the National Shellfisheries Association and served as President and Editor of the Journal. He was elected Honorary Life Member in 1983. In 1998 he received the David Wallace Award in recognition of his career-long efforts to use science for the betterment of shellfish management and a sustainable industry. Governor Gilmore reappointed him to the post in 2001. His leadership and business acumen was also evident at the Virginia Seafood Council, where he served as president and as vice president for Legislative Affairs. He became well-known to members of the Virginia Congressional delegation and the Virginia General Assembly as a tireless spokesman for the seafood industry, admired for his knowledge of issues and his skills in resolving difficult problems affecting business, consumers, and the environment.

What makes eddies especially interesting to biological oceanographers is their nutrient content. The surface waters of the North Atlantic's Sargasso Sea typically lack the dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus needed to support abundant phytoplankton growth. Yet growth rates for these tiny marine plants can spike during almost any month. \"We think that cold-core eddies may explain some of these peaks,\" says Steinberg. The researchers suspect that eddies draw nutrientrich waters from depth up to the Sargasso's nutrient-poor surface. The sudden influx of nutrients into sunlit surface waters could fuel phytoplankton blooms that in turn send ripples all the way up the food chain and outward to affect the ocean's fundamental geochemical cycles. But because eddies are transient, mobile features, they have proven difficult to study using fixed moorings or occasional ship visits. The EDDIES project is designed to overcome these sampling limitations by carefully tracking and studying a few selected eddies. During this summer's cruises, the Oceanus crew explored five different eddies before focusing on a single, welldefined cold-core eddy just south of Bermuda. WHOI scientists had been tracking the eddies in satellite images long before the first cruise departed. Eddies can persist for months and travel thousands of miles. The researchers conducted two cruises separated by three weeks to assess changes over time in these dynamic ocean features. Steinberg's team is exploring how the eddies' physical and biological features might affect the small animals that feed on phytoplankton. \"Our overall goal is to better understand the role that eddies play in structuring zooplankton communities in space and time,\" she says. One key question for the team is whether eddies concentrate zooplankton physically, by swirling them inward like debris in a tornado, or if the animals actively migrate upward into the eddy to feast on phytoplankton. Preliminary data show that zooplankton biomass is indeed higher within the eddy than in the surrounding seawater, notably along the eddy periphery. Another question is how changes in zooplankton abundance and behavior within an eddy might affect the transport of carbon to the deep sea. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton take up carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide that has dissolved in seawater. If this carbon subsequently sinks to the deep sea, it will contribute nothing to global warming and can remain there for thousands of years. \"Food webs in the Sargasso Sea and other open-ocean gyres are typically dominated by small phyto-plankton and bacteria,\" says Goldthwait. These small cells are hard for larger zooplankton to find and eat, and they sink slowly if at all. Thus the carbon they contain is normally recycled back into the surface ocean and atmosphere before it ever reaches the depths. But nourishment of open-ocean food webs by a passing eddy might help pump this carbon to the abyss. If the added nutrients promote the growth of larger phytoplankton species and these are eaten by zooplankton that produce heavy fecal pellets, the carbon incorporated in their tissues can sink to the depths relatively quickly. In fact, on the summer's first cruise, the abundance of fecal pellets found in traps that collect sinking material was much higher inside than outside the eddy. Goldthwait, Henderson, and Cope studied zooplankton communities using a high-tech instrument called a MOCNESS plankton net (for Multiple Opening and Closing Net Environmental Sampling System). Unlike traditional plankton nets, which are continually open and thus mix organisms from all depths sampled, the MOCNESS has a set of nets that can be programmed to individually open and close at a particular depth, allowing study of zooplankton from discrete water levels. They deployed the net 21 times within the Bermuda eddies. The researchers are now comparing zooplankton captured from inside the cold-core eddy with those collected in surrounding waters. This will help determine whether the animals moved into the eddy to feed or were swept in by its rotation. The researchers are using a suite of laboratory tools to determine the zooplankton's diet and health. Analysis of stomach contents shows the kinds and amount of phytoplankton consumed. Analysis of fatty tissues sheds light on diet, as well as overall health. They are also examining the ratio of RNA to DNA within the animals' cells. Elevated RNA levels indicate rapid growth and metabolism, which in turn suggests access to abundant food. \"Eddies perturb the chemical and biological environment on a global scale and dramatically impact biogeochemical cycling in the ocean,\" says Steinberg. \"Ultimately, our experiment could provide critical information about how the ocean has responded to environmental changes in the past, and how it might do so in the future.\" Both Steinberg's project and McGillicuddy's EDDIES project were funded by the National Science Foundation. They will run through 2006."}]
