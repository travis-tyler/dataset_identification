In particular, requiring best management practices-a combination of cover crops, nutrient management, and erosion controls-on land adjacent to water that also has a treatment need according to USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) criteria met TMDL goals for a quarter of the cost of implementing the full suite of management practices on all cropland. Still, the most efficient design-based approach was 4-5 times more expensive than the optimal performance-based approach and treated more than twice as much land. Another incentive system for Bay-area farmers to reduce their pollutant levels is the establishment of water quality trading. Trading is already used by some States to enable wastewater treatment plants and other point sources to meet TMDL limits without costly upgrades. Trading also offers an economic incentive to farmers to implement water quality-improving practices they might not otherwise adopt. Trading program rules developed by Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia all require that fields achieve a certain level of nutrient management before being able to generate credits, thus ensuring that abatement contributed by agriculture is \"additional.\" However, requiring more of farmers in order to trade can discourage them from participating. With a daily inventory of roughly 2.0 billion pounds of poultry, dairy, swine, and feedlot beef, animal agriculture is a significant source of nutrient loadings to the Bay, contributing an estimated 17 percent of the nitrogen entering the Bay and 26 percent of the phosphorus. Animal operations produce roughly 99,400 tons of recoverable manure nitrogen and 44,200 tons of recoverable manure phosphorus annually, which is often more than can be safely used by crops grown on the land managed by the livestock operation. Removing excess manure nutrients from farms in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and moving it to where it can be used efficiently costs an estimated $15 million to $27 million per year. Manure hauling costs decrease with the willingness of crop producers to use manure. An increase in the share of cropland using manure from 30 to 90 percent reduces hauling costs in the watershed about 15 percent. Education and technical/financial assistance for manure management could increase the willingness of crop producers to substitute manure for commercial fertilizers. Using manure as an energy source could absorb some of the excess manure nutrients and reduce regional hauling costs if the economics are favorable and concerns over air quality are adequately addressed. However, demand for manure as an energy source could increase costs for crop producers who utilize manure as a nutrient source, either through higher manure prices or through the need to purchase inorganic fertilizers. Our findings suggest that the value of manure as a source of crop nutrients would exceed the reduction in hauling costs. But this negative impact on agriculture would have to be weighed against the benefits provided by local energy production."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Chesapeake Bay is North America's largest and most biologically diverse estuary. Its watershed covers 64,000 square miles across 6 States (Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia and is home to more than 17 million people. For over 200 years, the Chesapeake Bay has provided a rich bounty of crabs, shellfish, and fish, as well as high-quality recreational opportunities. However, as the region's population grew and land was converted from forests to farms and urban development, the quality of the Bay's waters declined along with many of its living resources. Since the 1970s, the Clean Water Act has facilitated significant reductions in polluting emissions from sewage treatment plants, factories, and other point sources of pollution in the Bay watershed, but point sources are only part of the problem in meeting established water quality goals. In particular, continued heavy nutrient and sediment runoff from nonpoint sources has contributed to low oxygen levels, algal blooms, decreased water clarity, loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, and declines in fish and shellfish populations (U.S. EPA, 2011). In 2010, only 18 percent of tidal waters met or exceeded guidelines for water clarity; only 38 percent of the Bay and its tidal tributaries met Clean Water Act standards for dissolved oxygen; and more than half of stream health scores at monitoring sites were poor (Chesapeake Bay Program, 2011). The history of efforts to restore the ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay is emblematic of a general failure to solve the agricultural nonpoint-source (NPS) problem. The Bay has been a focal point of Federal and State initiatives to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution from agriculture and other sources for almost 30 years (see box, \"History of Chesapeake Bay Restoration Efforts\"). Beginning in 1983, successive agreements between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the Governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, and New York; and the Mayor of the District of Columbia established the Chesapeake Bay Program, set nutrient and sediment reduction goals, and developed strategies that rely heavily on voluntary approaches for reducing nutrient and sediment emissions. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-along with EPA and the watershed States-has made large public investments to improve the management of agricultural resources and to reduce agriculture's negative impact on environmental quality. Monitoring data and model estimates based on land use changes observed between 1985 and 2009 indicate some reductions in nutrient and sediment loads (National Research Council, 2011). Despite this progress, the biological health of the Bay remains poor (CBP, 2011). In 2009, President Barack Obama issued the Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration Executive Order, which calls for the Federal Government to lead a renewed effort to restore and protect the Bay and its watershed. In 2010, the U.S. EPA established a Total Maximum Daily Load for the Bay (see box, \"The Total Maximum Daily Load\"). It sets emission limits for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment across the Bay jurisdictions that are believed necessary to meet applicable water quality standards in the Bay and its tidal rivers and embayments."}, {"section_title": "History of Chesapeake Bay Restoration Efforts", "text": "In 1976, Congress directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to undertake a comprehensive study of the Bay's condition and what measures would be necessary to restore it to its former health. That effort culminated in the 1983 report, Chesapeake Bay: A Framework for Action, which described the state of the Bay's ecosystem, its change over time, and scientific evaluations of the Bay's functions in relation to its condition (U.S. EPA, 1983). The report established a regional management framework for addressing some of the Bay's most significant problems. Among the recommendations made in the report was for Bay watershed States to take action to reduce pollution-primarily excess nutrients and sediment-from agricultural and urban sources. The first Bay agreement in 1983-between Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. EPA-simply acknowledged there was a problem and called for the development of plans to address excess nutrient and sediment pollution (CBP, 1983). In 1987, a new agreement set a goal of reducing controllable nitrogen and phosphorus loads delivered to the Bay by 40 percent by 2000 (CBP, 1987). A 1991 evaluation led to an increased focus on Bay tributaries and added the program goal of expanding the total area of submerged aquatic vegetation (CBP, 1992). An evaluation in 1997 found some progress toward reducing nitrogen and phosphorus, but concluded that restoration efforts needed to accelerate in order to both maintain what had been achieved and to meet the 2000 goals (CBP, 1999). In 2000, a new agreement-joined by Delaware, New York, and eventually West Virginia-reaffirmed the 40-percent reduction goal and targeted 2010 for progress sufficient to remove the Bay and tributary waters from the U.S. EPA list of impaired waters (CBP, 2000). By 2006, the Bay jurisdictions had developed Tributary Strategies that outlined river basinspecific implementation activities for reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads from point and nonpoint sources. Implementation strategies for nonpoint sources relied almost exclusively on voluntary approaches. A 2007 evaluation concluded that insufficient progress was being made toward load reductions (CBP, 2007), prompting President Obama's Executive Order (13508) in 2009, which calls for the Federal Government to lead a renewed effort to restore and protect the Bay and its watershed. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL was finalized in 2010."}, {"section_title": "The Bay Total Maximum Daily Load", "text": "A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards. TMDLs are intended to be the common basis for control of point and nonpoint sources of pollution for surface waters that are designated as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The TMDL provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA) are designed as a second line of defense for protecting the quality of surface-water resources. Section 402 of the CWA established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to restrict the discharge of pollutants from municipal and industrial dischargers. Each point source must obtain a discharge permit before it can discharge wastes into surface water. The permit requires dischargers to comply with technology-based controls (uniform, U.S. EPA-established standards of treatment that apply to certain industries and municipal sewage treatment facilities) or water qualitybased controls that invoke State numeric or narrative (qualitative) water quality standards. Section 305(b) of the CWA requires States to report to Congress every 2 years which waters are meeting water quality standards and which are not meeting the standards. When technology-based controls are inadequate for waters to meet State water quality standards, Section 303(d) of the CWA requires States to submit to the U.S. EPA a list of impaired waters and the cause of the impairment. Once listed as impaired, a TMDL may be required, along with a plan to mitigate the impairment and meet the applicable water quality standard. Developing a TMDL involves calculating the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards, and allocating pollutant loads to the various sources. The TMDL for the watershed is the sum of individual wasteload allocations for point sources, load allocations for nonpoint sources and natural sources (i.e., runoff from undisturbed forests and other natural areas), and a margin of safety. Waste load allocations for point sources are met through the NPDES permit, which is regulatory in nature. Load allocations for nonpoint sources can be met through regulatory or voluntary approaches developed by the States. Since the Clean Water Act specifically bars the use of Federal regulations to reduce nonpoint-source pollution, regulations would have to originate at the State level. Prior to the TMDL, the Bay States relied heavily on traditional USDA conservation programs, which use financial incentives to encourage farmers to voluntarily adopt management measures consistent with the goals laid out by the various Chesapeake Bay agreements. These conservation programs include the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), developed by the Bay Watershed States outlining their strategies for meeting the TMDL, show a continued reliance on Federal and State financial assistance for practices such as cover crops on cropland. However, exclusive reliance on such policies has not been effective in improving water quality (Shortle et al., 2012). Despite years of conservation expenditures, nearly 90 percent of cropland in the Bay watershed is in need of additional nutrient or sediment management measures (USDA, NRCS, 2011). High expected costs and farmer resistance have hindered the use of practices necessary to reduce agricultural runoff (Bosch et al., 1992;Osmond et al., 2012). All of the Bay States have developed or are developing water quality trading programs. Trading programs provide regulatory flexibility for point sources, allowing them to purchase abatement from other sources, including nonpoint sources, that exceed a compliance baseline. Ideally, trading reduces the cost of meeting TMDL goals and increases abatement by nonpoint sources. Each State has its own set of rules for establishing eligibility (baselines) and calculating credits or offsets. Program design plays a critical role in the attractiveness of trading to potential program participants and their ability to meet their TMDL goals. In this report, we focus on two issues. Not enough cropland is under the most effective (best) management practices for protecting water quality (USDA, NRCS, 2011;U.S. EPA, USDA, 2006;NRC, 2011;Lichtenberg et al., 2010), and the State WIPs seek to redress that. A model built with data compiled specifically for the Chesapeake Bay watershed enables us to evaluate the efficiency characteristics of different policy instruments for achieving TMDL goals for nutrient and sediment emissions. The policy instruments examined span those contained in the State WIPs as well as alternatives, and include regulation, taxes, financial incentives, and water quality trading. Animal operations in the Bay watershed generally produce more manure nutrients than can be assimilated by the crops grown on the operation, and addressing this imbalance is another goal of the State WIPs. Farm-level implementation of improved nutrient management practices on cropland cannot be effective on these operations until the problem of excess manure production is addressed. A model built with data on animal operations in the watershed helps to evaluate the cost of balancing manure production and manure-nutrient demand by redistributing manure around the watershed."}, {"section_title": "Whom To Target", "text": "Cost-effective control of nonpoint-source pollution acknowledges the heterogeneity of agriculture by promoting different environmental performance goals for different farms so as to minimize costs over the landscape (also known as allocative efficiency). A long line of research has found that certain cropland-defined in terms of resource characteristics, farming practices, and geographic location-tends to contribute a disproportionate share of pollutants degrading a water resource (Ribaudo, 1986;1989;Veith et al., 2004;Diebel et al., 2008). A policy promotes cost-effectiveness when it adequately accounts for the variation in each farm's water quality impacts and abatement costs (Babcock et al., 1997;Braden et al., 1989;Claassen and Horan, 2001;Fleming and Adams, 1997). For example, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, onsite losses of nutrients and sediment differ widely by watershed, defined here as a 4-digit HUC 1 (table 1) (USDA, NRCS, 2011). Pre-TMDL per-acre losses of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment are highest in the Susquehanna watershed (HUC 205), followed by the Potomac watershed (HUC 207). However, assigning responsibility for nonpoint source pollution loads is difficult. Runoff does not emanate from a single point, but leaves each field in so many places, often unseen, that accurate monitoring would be prohibitively expensive (Braden and Segerson, 1993;Shortle and Abler, 1997). The amount and nature of runoff leaving a field depend not only on factors that can be measured, such as the technology employed and the use of variable inputs, but also on factors such as rainfall that vary daily and are difficult to predict (Braden and Segerson, 1993;Shortle and Abler, 1997). Uncertainty about who is responsible and the degree of responsibility creates problems for efficient nonpoint-source policy design. Requiring farmers who are not contributing to the problem to adopt best management practices reduces program cost-effectiveness. Similarly, not covering those farmers who can provide the greatest reductions at the lowest cost also reduces cost-effectiveness. The difficulty in identifying which producers are producing the most pollution is an often-cited reason why voluntary actions are the tools of choice in existing nonpoint-source programs (Shortle and Horan, 2001). "}, {"section_title": "What To Target", "text": "Since the goal of a nonpoint-source policy for the Chesapeake Bay watershed is to improve water quality in the Bay, the ideal policy would base incentives (positive or negative) on pollutant delivery to tidal waters (Oates, 1995). However, measuring nonpoint-source emissions is extremely difficult and costly, making actual emissions delivery impractical to use in a policy. Alternative instruments should be highly correlated with environmental conditions, enforceable, and targetable in time and space (Braden and Segerson, 1993). One option is using estimated loadings within the tidal waters of the Bay. The development of accepted field-and watershed-level modeling tools allows estimated emissions to be used as a policy base. For example, estimates of soil erosion from the Universal Soil Loss Equation are being used in USDA conservation compliance policy (Code of Federal Regulations, 1996). Emissions estimates from models such as the Nutrient Tracking Tool developed by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX) could be used as a basis for policies addressing nutrient pollution. Shortcomings of this approach include the need to run the model for each farm and multiple farming options, which increases transaction costs. Also, estimates of runoff are available only for the management choices contained in the model. And the degree of uncertainty surrounding model estimates would need to be accounted for in setting policy. Other policy design options are to directly influence the inputs or farming practices that are correlated with pollutant flows. These may include inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, or irrigation water, and practices such as conservation tillage and nutrient management. Farming practices are generally easier to observe. The drawback of input-or design-based options is that they do not account for factors between the field and the receiving waters (i.e. slope and vegetation) that influence water pollution in the Bay (the policy goal). Policies designed around factors that are more correlated with emissions are more efficient ."}, {"section_title": "What Type of Incentive", "text": "The policy stimulus is the incentive the producer responds to when making management choices. The least intrusive instruments are public persuasion combined with education and technical assistance (Horan and Shortle, 2001). Under such a policy, producers would not have to participate, although those who stand to benefit economically from a change in management may opt to do so. Such policies have been a mainstay of USDA conservation policies for decades. However, education and technical assistance have been shown to have limited effects on managing nonpoint pollution when not paired with other policy instruments . Regulations on inputs, management practices, or estimated emissions provide more direct stimulus. For a regulation on inputs or management practices (design-based policy) to be efficient, all polluting inputs used by farmers would have to be controlled . Such regulations tend to be inflexible, and to be efficient the regulator would need to know practice costs as well as their impacts on pollutant delivery. A regulation on estimated emissions (performance-based policy) provides more flexibility to farmers, but requires models that farmers can use to estimate how their management choices affect emissions. Farmer decisions can also be influenced through economic incentives like taxes on estimated emissions or polluting inputs, subsidies for management practices that improve water quality, and markets for trading pollution allowances. For measured or estimated delivered emissions, only a single tax (on emissions) or subsidy rate (on abatement) for each pollutant is needed to achieve an efficient allocation of abatement. For inputs, however, a system of taxes for polluting inputs and incentives for abating practices needs to be applied for the policy to be efficient, and the rates would vary for each farm to account for differences in delivery, making such an approach far more complex . In general, incentives are more flexible than standards, as farmers choose the best way to manage their operations given the incentives."}, {"section_title": "Comparing Policy Instruments", "text": "Different policy instruments address the \"Who, What, and How\" questions in different ways, with implications for economic performance. Performance-based policies targeting pollution emissions are generally more efficient , designed as they are to achieve a specific environmental performance measure rather than to simply encourage the adoption of certain management practices. The choice of how to meet the performance measure is left entirely to the farmer, who has better information than resource managers on how changes in practices affect costs. Performance-based policies include emission limits, pollution taxes, and payments for improved water quality. Properly designed, such policies automatically allocate pollution control to those farms and fields that can provide the most reductions at least cost (the \"Who\" and \"What\"). They also promote the greatest flexibility in achieving policy goals, which leads to the most efficient policies . Because nonpoint-source emissions cannot be observed or are too costly to measure, performancebased policies have rarely been applied to nonpoint-source pollution. Instead, nonpoint-source policies tend to be design-based, pegged to a producer's variable input use and production practices. Policies based on expected emissions, estimated with models, provide some of the flexibility offered by performance-based policies. Point/nonpoint trading markets fall in this category, as models are used to estimate the performance of practices installed for the purpose of creating credits. The cost of developing models may be high, but once developed, the cost of applying them should be low. Design-based regulations can be cost-effective, but this requires precise targeting of specific practices to each field. Efficiency requires that the regulator have information on the abatement costs of each farm, which is privately held and may be difficult to obtain. Efficiency is reduced the greater the heterogeneity of land, the more uniformly instruments are applied across regions, the fewer polluting inputs that are controlled, and the greater the uncertainty of the resource management agency about the performance of best management systems (BMSs). 2 Standards also limit flexibility, although they are relatively easy to implement. Regulations applied to agriculture generally take this form. Common examples include requirements for nutrient management plans, bans on applying manure to frozen fields, required use of vegetative filter strips, and limits on chemical applications in aquifer recharge zones. Design-based economic incentives such as cost-sharing promote the voluntary adoption of desirable practices. Historically, financial assistance (cost sharing) has been the primary policy instrument for inducing farmers to adopt management practices that reduce nonpoint-source pollution. A successful and efficient financial assistance approach would require practice-and region-specific payment rates that are high enough to entice farmers to participate and to adopt the most cost-effective practices. Payments may have to continue for as long as practices are maintained (current conservation programs offer only short-term contracts). Research has found that nonstructural management practices, such as nutrient management, are more likely to be discontinued after cost-share funding ends than structural practices (Jackson-Smith et al., 2010), and that farmers often find nutrient management difficult to implement (Genskow, 2012;Osmond et al., 2012). Paying farmers to adopt practices they would not ordinarily adopt on their own could be very expensive given the improvements still needed to attain water quality goals in the Bay, and raises questions about the fairness of paying farmers for pollution abatement while regulated point sources must bear the cost of abatement. Such an approach may also be at odds with the large budgetary imbalances currently affecting Federal and State finances. "}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Policy Instruments for Meeting TMDL Goals", "text": "Our assessment of policy instruments for achieving the TMDL goals on cropland in the Chesapeake Bay watershed includes performance-based regulations (emission limits), performance-based incentives (emission taxes), and design-based standards (regulations on practices or inputs). These policies include those currently included in State Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) as well as some that are not being considered. The strength of our analysis is in estimating the difference in costs between policy scenarios, rather than in our assessment of the absolute cost of any one scenario. These differences enable us to identify which policy design features are more costeffective. While our analysis does not mimic the State Watershed Implementation Plans, our estimates do provide a measuring stick for the costs of reducing agricultural nonpoint-source pollution by an amount broadly consistent with what is being asked of agriculture to meet Bay water quality goals. The estimates reflect a stylized assessment in which the watershed is treated as one political jurisdiction and provide policymakers with information about the extent to which alternative policy approaches might deviate from the least-cost solution."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The NRCS Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) for the Chesapeake Bay watershed provides the data for our crop-sector analysis (see box, \"CEAP Data\"). The data consist of 756 fieldlevel survey observations from 2003-2006 containing information on baseline crop acreages, input use, conservation practices, estimated edge-of-field nutrient and sediment losses, and estimated delivery of those materials to the tidal waters of the Bay. In addition, the data contain estimated nutrient and sediment delivery for three \"enhanced\" management practices-cover crops, nutrient management, and water erosion controls-that could be added to baseline practices. The 756 sample points are treated as representative farms that capture regional variation in resource endowments and base technology use. We use these representative farms to evaluate a suite of performance-and design-based policy options for meeting the TMDL (see box, \"Model Management Practice Choices\"). Baseline observations without any of these practices could receive all the practice combinations. Baseline observations already receiving the full suite of practices would not receive any additional practices. 3 An alternative approach for estimating the nutrient loadings would have been to apply the Chesapeake Bay watershed model used by EPA to track changes in loadings within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and to track the progress States are making in implementing their WIPs. We chose to use the NRCS modeling system to estimate changes in loadings because it provides field-level output (the EPA model is a county-level model) and thus is better suited to make full use of the richness of the field-level data provided by the CEAP survey. This approach was critical for providing information on the cost-effectiveness of field-level targeting for practices."}, {"section_title": "CEAP Data", "text": "The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) was initiated in 2002 by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Agricultural Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to evaluate the benefits from resource conservation on agricultural lands. A series of large watershed-scale studies was conducted as part of CEAP to focus on the water quality benefits from conservation systems. The focus of the CEAP Chesapeake Bay study is on the 4.4 million acres of cultivated cropland in the watershed. A survey of farmers obtained information on the extent of conservation practice use in the watershed over 2003-2006. The National Resources Inventory (NRI)-a statistical survey of conditions and trends in U.S. soil, water, and related resources on private lands conducted by NRCS since the 1970s-provided the statistical framework. The CEAP-NRI survey collected detailed production and conservation management data for crop fields in the NRI over crop years [2001][2002][2003][2004][2005][2006]. The statistical properties of the observations capture the distribution of practices on all agricultural lands within each four-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) in the Bay watershed. We restricted our analysis to major field crops, which constituted 97.9 percent of crop acres in the watershed. We excluded fields planted to vegetables, as we have less confidence that our cost data are representative of these specialized crops. This left us with 756 observations. The CEAP data also contain model estimates of erosion and nutrient emissions from fields under both the baseline and alternative management systems. Field-level effects of conservation practices were assessed using the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX) (Williams et al., 2008;Gassman et al., 2009). APEX is a field-scale physical process model that simulates day-to-day farming activities, wind and water erosion, loss or gain of soil organic carbon, and edge-of-field losses of soil, nutrients, and pesticides. APEX also estimates crop yields for a given set management choices. The impact of field-level emissions on loadings of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment within the watershed and to the tidal waters of the Bay was simulated with the Hydrologic Unit Model for the United States (HUMUS) (Arnold et al., 1999;Srinivasan et al., 1998). Within HUMUS, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool is used to route instream loads from one watershed to another (Gassman et al., 2007;Arnold and Fohrer, 2005). Weather is a predominant factor in determining the emissions of nutrients and sediment from cropland. To capture the effects of weather, each scenario was simulated using 47 years  of daily weather data. The estimates used in our analysis are the means of these simulations. "}, {"section_title": "Model Management Practice Choices", "text": "Cover crops. Cover crops are planted when the principal crops are not growing to provide soil surface cover and reduce erosion, and to withdraw excess nutrients remaining in the soil, preventing them from leaching or running off to surface water. In our model: \u2022 For sample points in the baseline without a cover crop in the rotation, rye was planted as the cover crop. \u2022 The cover crop is planted the day after harvesting the main crop or the day after the last major fall tillage practice. \u2022 The cover crop is not harvested for sale. Nutrient management. Nutrient management is defined in terms of the appropriate rate, timing, and method of application for all crops in the rotation. In our model: \u2022 All commercial fertilizer is applied 14 days prior to planting, except for acres susceptible to leaching loss. \u2022 For acres susceptible to leaching, nitrogen was applied in split applications. \u2022 Manure applications during winter months are moved to the spring. \u2022 All fertilizer and manure are incorporated or injected. \u2022 All nitrogen application rates for all crops except cotton and small grains are limited to 1.2 times the crop removal rate. For small grains, nitrogen applications are limited to 1.5 times the crop removal rate. For cotton, nitrogen applications are limited to 50 pounds per bale. \u2022 Phosphorus application rates are adjusted to be equal to 1.1 times the amount removed in the crop at harvest. Water erosion control. Water erosion controls reduce sediment loss by reducing field slopes, reducing the length of time a field is without plant cover, or trapping sediment in runoff. In our model: \u2022 Terraces are added to all sample point with slopes greater than 6 percent, and to those with slopes greater than 4 percent and a high potential for excessive runoff (hydrologic soil groups C or D). \u2022 Contouring or strip-cropping is added to all other fields with slopes greater than 2 percent that do not already have those practices. \u2022 Fields adjacent to water receive a riparian buffer. \u2022 Fields not adjacent to water receive a filter strip. \u2022 No changes are made to tillage. The model simulations provide estimates without any of the uncertainty characteristics of nonpointsource pollution that are associated with variability in weather and practice performance. Since we are using the model results to compare policy instruments for reducing agricultural nonpoint-source pollution, this shortcoming is not seen as a major issue and policy rankings should not be affected. Uncertainty would be important if we were trying to determine the level of management necessary to meet a water quality standard with a degree of certainty or to compare the cost-effectiveness of abatement from sources with very different uncertainty characteristics. We assume that policymakers are concerned only with long-term average outcomes. In our modeling, we assume that farms do not enter or exit the sector in response to the introduction of TMDL-related policies. We also do not consider taking cropland out of production (shifting to pasture or forest) as an option for reducing pollution losses, other than converting cropland to filter strips as part of water erosion controls. The CEAP data do not include this practice. We also assume that policies implemented in the Bay watershed do not influence market prices, so there would be no incentive for farms not affected by an abatement policy to alter their production (no \"leakage\"). The survey also found little change in the use of nutrient management practices. The 2011 data were not publicly available as of the publication date (or \"in time\" for our analysis). Had we based our analysis on the 2011 data, our estimates of total costs would probably be lower, but our conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of the different policy approaches should not have changed. "}, {"section_title": "Cost of Best Management Systems", "text": "We assume that farmer management choices are the result of profit maximizing behavior. The cost to a farmer of implementing a new conservation practice is the expected reduction in net farm returns. These include annualized capital costs (equipment and structures), changes in annual input costs (labor, fuel, chemicals, seed), and changes to gross revenue due to changes in crop yields (including land taken out of production). Capital and annual costs were obtained from several sources, including State Watershed Implementation Plans and contract data from USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Changes in crop yields for the different management scenarios were obtained directly from the CEAP modeling. Policy transaction costs (administration, monitoring, verification, and enforcement) are not included in the analysis. We also could not include manure hauling costs incurred by confined animal feeding operations with inadequate cropland for agronomic application of the manure nutrients. We first examine whether the management baseline represented by the CEAP survey data was economically \"optimal.\" If we assume that farmers have perfect information and seek to maximize expected profits, we expect that observed practices are those that maximize net returns. However, we found that a small portion of our sample could increase net returns by adopting some of the improved management systems, implying that farmers are not maximizing net returns, a result found by others using profit-maximizing models that assume perfect information (Diaz-Zorita et al., 2004;Pendell et al., 2006;Veith et al., 2004). In an analysis such as ours, this could lead to a policy intervention having a negative cost. Two factors may be at work here. First, the actual cost of adopting practices for each observation is unknown; only regional averages are available. Second, a variety of factors that operators treat as costs may not be captured by a simple accounting of implementation costs and revenues. These include increased uncertainty about expected returns (risk), loss aversion (decisions are influenced more by a potential loss than an equal-sized potential gain), and behavioral inertia (Gillenwater, 2012). Consider the split application of nutrients, which is a practice for improving nutrient use efficiency. If the field is too wet when the second application needs to be applied, then yields will suffer. A farmer may be reluctant to adopt this practice even though, on average, it offers an increase in net returns. The data did not allow us to explore the cost and risk characteristics of each observation. Instead, we estimated what the implicit cost of the enhanced management systems would have to be for the observed management practice to be the profit-maximizing choice. For each modeled scenario, we determined the largest increase in net returns from among all the observations. We then added this value as an implicit cost to adopting the conservation measures to each observation. For example, if we require each sample farm not currently using nutrient management to adopt the practice, and a single farm shows a profit by doing so, we would add that profit as an implicit \"cost of risk\" to each sample farm in the database. This ensures that the baseline scenario represents those practices that give farmers in the watershed maximum net returns in the absence of any policy, while preserving the rankings of observations in terms of management system implementation costs. Changes in management would therefore only be in response to the incentives offered by the policy, and not to any other economic factor.

An alternative is to focus on inputs and management practices (designbased approaches), which are more easily observed by both resource management agencies and farmers. Practices can be required through regulation or encouraged through financial incentives. An important difference in the evaluation of these scenarios is that they are not constrained to meet the TMDL goals. An essential design feature of these policies is identifying which fields are subject to regulation or incentives (the \"Who\" question). If pollution control programs could target priority fields (based on geography or field characteristics) and the farmers of those fields adopt the most efficient pollutantreducing practices, then the total costs of abatement would be minimized (performance-based practices do this automatically through their incentive structure). The key is to find targeting criteria that are the best predictors of both water quality and low unit abatement costs, but are also easy to implement (low administrative costs). We selected targeting criteria from among the variables included in the NRCS CEAP data set that we believe could be used in such a policy. Scenarios are evaluated based on the likely attainment of basinwide TMDL goals, total costs to agriculture, and unit abatement costs (a measure of efficiency). The costs of the design-based scenarios are estimated by selecting the observations/fields meeting the targeting conditions (described in the scenarios below), adding required management practices to the baseline practices, then adding up the total BMS implementation costs. Exceeding TMDL goals is not rewarded; as long as the goals are met, the lowest cost policy is the one preferred.

The scenarios were evaluated with an optimization model described in Appendix I."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The Bay-level policy scenario, which minimizes the cost of simultaneously meeting the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment reduction goals at the tidal waters of the Bay, was the optimal solution, contingent on resource managers having perfect information on costs and the delivery of pollutants from each field. The cost of meeting TMDL abatement goals was estimated to be about $54.8 million per year (table 5). This cost estimate includes our measure uncertainty about expected returns (risk), loss aversion, and behavioral inertia which are unobserved but reflect real costs to the farmer and thus influence their practice adoption decisions. Unit abatement costs were $2.13 per delivered pound for nitrogen, $67.27 per delivered pound for phosphorus, and $647.33 per delivered ton for sediment. The pollutant reduction goals were met by adopting conservation systems on only 505,000 acres (12 percent of cropland in the watershed) (table 6). Water erosion controls and nutrient management were applied to over 90 percent of the cropland receiving additional treatment. Cover crops were applied to less than half of cropland receiving treatment. Over 56 percent of the crop acres with improved management were located in the Susquehanna sub-basin (HUC 205), which is the largest source of pollutants to the Bay. Pollution can be reduced at a lower unit cost on average in this sub-basin than in the others. Only 1.7 percent of crop acres with improved management were located in the Lower Chesapeake (HUC 208).  One way that this optimal abatement could be achieved would be for the regulatory agency to assign a delivered discharge limit for each field. A discharge limit allows each farm to meet the standard at least cost, but allocative efficiency requires that each field have a unique limit that accounts for practice costs. Such an approach would be very costly to implement, even if the data were available. An alternative is to implement a tax on pollutants discharged to the tidal waters. The estimated taxes on delivered pollutants to simultaneously achieve the necessary reductions are $2.36 per pound N, $39.98 per pound P, and $200.08 per ton sediment. 4 We assume that any tax revenue would be rebated back to farmers through a system of awards for adopting conservation systems. To illustrate Cost, pollutant reduction, and unit cost of policy instruments by scenario  the incentive provided by an emissions tax, we look at farms that had none of the best management systems in place prior to the TMDL. The annual tax burden on these farms would be about $130 million. By adopting all three management systems, their tax burden would be reduced by $102 million. As long as the implementation cost of a management system is less than the proposed pollutant tax, the farmer would implement the system. The optimal solution concentrated pollutant reductions and associated costs in the Susquehanna watershed. This might seem unfair, particularly since the Susquehanna watershed does not border the Bay and residents would not directly benefit from the Bay's improvement. A more \"equitable\" requirement could be that each basin reduces delivered nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment by the same percentages. However, shifting delivered abatement to parts of the watershed characterized by higher unit costs increases the overall costs of meeting the TMDL by almost 47 percent (HUC-4 level in table 5). Unit abatement costs increase to $3.12 per pound for nitrogen, $97.18 per pound for phosphorus, and $901.01 per ton for sediment. About 22 percent more crop acreage is treated than under the Optimal scenario. The share of treated acres coming from the Susquehanna sub-basin decreases to 45 percent, while the share coming from the Lower Chesapeake increases from 1.7 percent to 19.5 percent (table 7). Requiring that the watershed pollutant abatement goals be met at the field level proved far more costly (table 5). Total control costs were more than 14 times greater than for the Optimal scenario. Additional conservation practices were adopted on nearly all cropland (table 6). As a result, watershed-level abatement goals were significantly exceeded (58-percent reduction for N and P, and 72-percent reduction for sediment). This is partly due to the \"all or nothing\" nature of the conservation systems in our analysis; the conservation systems could not be fine-tuned to deliver specific abatement levels. The distribution of cropland acres receiving additional treatment closely matches that of the distribution of cropland in the watershed, rather than aligning with the sources of pollutants delivered to the Bay.\nThe \"current practices\" baseline provides the most credits at lowest cost, as all fields are eligible to supply credits with the implementation of a practice. In this scenario, 31.65 million pounds of nitrogen are sold to POTWs at an equilibrium price of $3.13/lb. (table 9). Point sources realize a benefit of $251 million from being able to purchase nonpoint-source credits rather than installing enhanced treatment technology. All abatement goes to the market and none to Load Allocation. Since all farms can immediately enter the market, most of the credits are coming from fields with high nitrogen losses and without best management systems. Installing practices on such fields produces high amounts of nitrogen reduction for a low unit cost. Fields already under conservation measures cannot provide as much additional abatement and the abatement provided is more costly. When an N loss eligibility baseline is used to provide more abatement for Load Allocation, supply curves shift to the left, as expected, since some fields cannot sell credits until the baseline is met. Since abatement required to meet the baseline cannot be sold, fewer credits are supplied. The cost of credits supplied reflects the cost of meeting the baseline, plus the cost of any additional measures taken to reduce N losses. The more stringent the baseline, the fewer the available credits (and the further left the supply curve shifts). Under the most stringent baseline (15 lbs. N loss/acre), the equilibrium price in the market would be $16.49 per lb./N, and only 3.29 million credits would be traded (table 9). The benefit to point sources is only $67 million, a decrease of 73 percent from the \"current practices\" baseline. Some fields not meeting baseline requirements would still find it profitable to meet baseline requirements and sell credits in the market. As such, 3.54 million pounds of N abatement would go toward Load Allocation. The amount of abatement going to Load Allocation increases as the eligibility baseline is relaxed (table 9). At the least stringent baseline we examined (65 lbs. N/acre), more nonpoint-source abatement (46.6 million lbs. N) is produced at the equilibrium price than under the \"current practices\" baseline (31.65 million). The reason is that market prices are high enough to induce fields that do not quite meet baseline requirements, but can produce high levels of abatement at low cost, to adopt the necessary practices. Changing the baseline alters the amount of abatement. If a goal of the program is to maximize total nonpoint-source abatement, then a carefully chosen eligibility baseline could accomplish this. However, the equilibrium credit price in the point/nonpoint trading market is still higher than under the \"current practices\" baseline and the economic benefits to regulated point sources are reduced. If a baseline reduces the supply of credits in the market, the government could try to compensate by offering to subsidize practices necessary to meet the baseline. A State may feel that the benefits of trading, in terms of reducing point-source costs and mitigating nonpoint-source pollution, are worth the taxpayer expense of the subsidies. This is currently an accepted use of conservation program funds (American Farmland Trust, 2013). We examined this policy by calculating nonpoint-source nitrogen credit supply curves when the costs of meeting the baseline are not paid by the farmer. For simplicity, we assume a 100-percent cost-share. We also assume that abatement generated by the subsidized practices is not eligible for sale as credits, even if the baseline is exceeded (consistent with rules against so-called double dipping, or receiving multiple payments for the same action). All abatement from subsidized prac- tices goes to the nonpoint-source Load Allocation of the TMDL. Credits would be produced for practices adopted once the baseline is met. For all but the most stringent baseline (15 lbs. N/acre), the provision of a subsidy actually reduces the number of credits going to the market (table 9, fig. 3). The reason for this counterintuitive result is that abatement generated by a practice cost-shared by the government cannot be sold as credits in the market, even if the eligibility baseline is exceeded. As a result, some of the credits that were available to the market when the subsidy was not offered instead go to Load Allocation; the supply curve for that stringency level shifts to the left with the subsidy. Point sources do not benefit from the subsidy, but total nonpoint-source abatement is higher with the subsidy for all baselines. If the subsidy is less than 100 percent (as are cost-shares in most conservation programs), the incentive would be reduced and less nonpoint-source abatement would be generated These results are driven in part by the \"lumpiness\" of our management options and the limited number of management options considered. Adopting a practice may produce a large amount of abatement that cannot be \"fine-tuned\" to exactly match demand. With more management choices, a farmer would have greater control over how much abatement can be provided and the impact of the subsidy on credit supply would probably be reduced; more abatement would go to the market and less to Load Allocation. A baseline based on management practices rather than nitrogen loadings would not face this issue.  "}, {"section_title": "Design-Based Policies", "text": "Requiring that all crop acres be treated with the full suite of management practices (E3) is a simple approach to implement. It is also the most expensive (23 times more expensive than the Optimal scenario), as it makes no attempt to make use of information on vulnerability to pollutant loss or current levels of management (table 5). Not surprisingly, the pollution abatement goals are exceeded by wide margins: 75-percent reduction for N, 74 percent for P, and 85 percent for sediment. These results indicate that ample opportunities exist to reduce costs through targeting. Requiring that all crop acres be treated with at least one water quality BMS is a lower cost alternative to the E3 approach. It is seven times more expensive than the Optimal scenario but about 30 percent of the cost of the E3 scenario, as only those fields not under any BMS would be treated (table 5). A drawback of this approach is that the abatement goal for nitrogen is not met. Farmers choose practices that are most beneficial (less costly) to them and not necessarily consistent with watershed goals. A more efficient approach may be to target on factors believed to be closely related to pollution creation and delivery . Requiring selected management systems on cropland that NRCS has identified as vulnerable to pollutant losses more than meets the TMDL abatement goals (N reduced 28 percent, P reduced 30 percent, and sediment reduced 34 percent) (table 3-4). About 1.6 million acres of cropland receive additional conservation practices in this scenario (table 3-5). Total costs are reduced by almost 67 percent compared to the E3 scenario. However, costs are still almost eight times greater than for the Optimal (performance-based, Bay-level) scenario. The distribution of crop acres receiving additional treatment is reasonably close to that of the Optimal scenario, although the Lower Chesapeake sees a significantly higher percentage of cropland treated (11.4 percent) than in the Optimal scenario (1.7 percent) (table 7). Targeting only vulnerable acres requires some land that has adequate treatment in the baseline to produce additional abatement. Additional abatement can only be achieved at a high cost, reducing the overall efficiency of the policy. Costs are likely to be reduced by targeting on NRCS-defined treatment needs, which takes into account both vulnerability and baseline practices. Targeting only cropland with a high treatment need (not shown) did not meet TMDL abatement goals for any of the pollutants. Expanding coverage to include cropland with high or moderate treatment needs greatly exceeded the abatement goals: 64-percent reduction for N, 63 percent for P, and 63 percent for sediment (table 5). Over 3 million acres of cropland undergo improved management, about 86 percent more cropland than under the vulnerability scenario (table 6). This increase in treated acres is the reason why total costs are much higher than targeting based on vulnerability. Unit reduction costs, which are a measure of cost-effectiveness, are not definitively better than those under the Vulnerability scenario (better for N, worse for P and sediment). But the fact that overall pollutant reductions were more than doubled without a large increase in average unit abatement cost indicates there are some efficiency gains by targeting on treatment need. Requiring cropland identified as having moderate to high treatment needs to adopt at least one additional water quality BMS of the farmer's choice offers a lower cost alternative to prescribing specific practices for the targeted acres. Abatement goals are met and total control costs decline by 44 percent compared to the Treatment Need scenario. Unit abatement costs are higher for N but lower for P and sediment. However, targeting on Vulnerability still meets the overall abatement goal at a lower cost. The Vulnerability scenario better matches the distribution of abatement across HUCs of the Optimal scenario than does the Treatment Need scenario, meaning that conservation measures are more likely to be cost-effective at reducing pollution (table 7). Including additional information in the targeting criteria could further improve the efficiency of targeted policies. Targeting only cropland adjacent to a stream did not meet the unit abatement goals, even when all three management systems were required (not shown). Additional targeting criteria are needed to reach enough cropland to achieve the watershed abatement goals. A policy that requires nutrient management and soil and water controls on cropland that is adjacent to a stream AND has at least a moderate treatment need, or has a high treatment need anywhere in the watershed, was found to exceed the abatement goals at a cost that is much lower than targeting based only on treatment needs or even vulnerability. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment reductions are 30, 31, and 25 percent, respectively. About 1.36 million acres (32 percent of cropland in the watershed) are targeted, which is less than half the acres treated under the simple Treatment Need scenario. Unit abatement costs for N and P are significantly lower than under any of the design-based scenarios (table 5). The distribution of cropland receiving additional treatment is very close to that of the Optimal scenario, which contributes to higher cost-effectiveness (table 7). Trying to improve the efficiency of this targeting approach by letting farmers with cropland meeting the targeting criteria select a BMS does not meet the abatement goals for N and P (table 5). Targeting highly erodible land (HEL) or land receiving manure could also meet the TMDL goals at a lower cost than targeting only on treatment needs, but at higher costs than for targeting land adjacent to water. Allowing farmers to select a practice did not meet the abatement goal for nitrogen in either of these scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "TMDL goals could be met by installing management systems on a relatively small share (about 12 percent) of cropland in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, based on our data and assumptions that regulators have the information necessary to set the appropriate performance standards or emission taxes. This finding (Optimal scenario) demonstrates the unequal contribution of nonpoint-source pollutants across fields. Focusing on a small percentage of cropland could raise concerns about fairness and hinder agreement on a common policy across political jurisdictions. However, increasing the amount of cropland required to adopt key management systems reduces overall efficiency. Such a tradeoff between equity and efficiency may be necessary to achieve political support for policies that meet TMDL requirements. If the information required to implement such a performance-based policy is either not available or too costly to collect, practice-based regulations or incentives can be used. The results of the Optimal scenario demonstrate the cost implications of being able to target abatement to those areas that can provide the most cost-effective control. The most cost-effective design-based policy among our scenarios is to target cropland that has moderate treatment needs and is adjacent to water plus cropland with high treatment needs anywhere in the watershed. In general, using additional information (like proximity to water) in an enhanced targeting scheme achieved lower unit abatement costs than any of the other design-based scenarios that focused only on vulnerability or treatment needs. One reason is that the distribution of targeted cropland across HUCs is similar to the distribution of treated acres in the Optimal scenario (table 3-6). There may be additional targeting criteria that could lower the overall costs of policies based on highly erodible land (HEL) or use of manure. The least efficient policy (E3) was to require that all cropland use the full suite of conservation systems. The benefit of performance-based policies are also apparent in the per-acre costs of implementing required management systems. Since performance-based policies select those fields that can produce the most abatement at least cost, fewer management systems need to be adopted. The average peracre treatment cost for cropland receiving treatment in the Optimal scenario is $108. For the designbased scenarios, average per-acre treatment costs range from $160 to $304. Because cropland could not be targeted to the same land in the Optimal scenario through relatively simple targeting criteria, more treatment systems were needed per acre in order to meet the abatement goals. Requiring the use of improved management systems through regulation has a level of certainty in practice adoption that cannot be attained through purely voluntary approaches. If farmers are willing to adopt practices for a payment that just covered adoption costs (including reduced yields), the costs of regulation and financial incentives would be similar. However, if farmers are reluctant to change practices, incentive offers may have to be much higher than implementation costs to induce voluntary change. If so, the voluntary approach may end up costing much more than a regulation to achieve TMDL goals, assuming widespread compliance and low enforcement costs. When farmers were allowed to select the management systems to adopt, with or without compensation, they tended not to adopt systems that would achieve all three water quality goals. Cover crops and water erosion controls tended to be preferred over nutrient management. Farmer reluctance to voluntarily adopt nutrient management has been noted in other studies (Genskow, 2012;Osmond et al., 2012). TMDL goals were achieved when allowing farmers to choose which practice to implement only when all cropland with moderate and high treatment needs was targeted. This is due to the large amount of cropland covered, reflected in the relatively high total cost ($531 million) of this strategy. If required management practices increase operating costs to the point where a profit cannot be made, then a farm would likely go out of business and the land would be incorporated into a more efficient farm or shift to some other use. We did not evaluate the potential for the TMDL to affect land use, primarily because of the limited management system changes we included in our analysis, and our inability to accurately estimate farm-level financial impacts, including risk. In reality, farmers have many more management choices available to them than we modeled in this analysis, such as conservation tillage and new crop rotations, which would likely lower the overall economic impacts of the TMDL."}, {"section_title": "Water Quality Trading Baselines and the Costs of Meeting TMDL Goals", "text": "The previous section demonstrated the benefits of a performance-based approach that provides incentives for farmers of fields that can provide the most abatement at least cost to adopt appropriate management systems. "}, {"section_title": "How Trading Works", "text": "Water quality trading is a type of emissions trading. Trading can in theory allow firms with different pollution abatement costs to allocate pollution abatement among themselves in the most efficient way. In a cap-and-trade program, trading is organized around the creation of a good called an emission allowance, which allows the holder to discharge one unit of pollutant. Regulated dischargerspoint sources that discharge directly to water through a pipe or other conveyance-can legally discharge only as much as their holding of allowances. Emissions in excess of the allowances result in a fine or other penalties. The total number of emission allowances allocated to regulated dischargers in a watershed is set by the State regulatory agency, based on the proportional contribution of the regulated pollutant to the total emissions limit for a watershed (a Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL, is often the basis for a water quality trading program). Emission allowances are initially allocated to firms by the regulatory agency, usually in proportion to current emissions. Assuming that the number of allowances granted to a firm is less than its baseline emissions, all firms face a choice. Firms with discharge levels greater than their initial holdings of allowances will have to either purchase more allowances or reduce emissions. Firms with marginal costs of pollution control greater than the price of an allowance will purchase allowances in the market. Firms with marginal control costs less than the price of an allowance will reduce emissions and sell their excess allowances in the market. In equilibrium, the water quality goal is met (total emissions are no more than the number of emission allowances in the market), those firms that can reduce emissions at the lowest cost provide most of the pollution control, and marginal control costs for all emissions are equal (thereby meeting the efficiency goal). The promise of emissions trading, along with the real-world success of air emissions trading, has led U.S. EPA to encourage States to consider agriculture as a source of offsets in water quality trading programs, and a number of States are either implementing or considering water quality trading programs that allow point/nonpoint source trading. Allowing agriculture to supply credits in a market created by capping emissions from regulated point sources would (1) reduce the cost of meeting water quality goals by allocating abatement more efficiently among sources (the economic rationale for trading); and (2) provide a strong economic incentive for unregulated nonpoint sources to play a larger role in improving water quality (U.S. EPA, 2008). This is an important goal for water quality trading in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Regulators designing point/nonpoint trading markets must contend with uncertainty about sources and levels of emissions, the effectiveness of best management practices, the water quality impacts of emissions from different sources, and farmer willingness to participate in a market driven by regulation (on point sources) (Hoag and Hughes-Popp, 1997;King, 2005;King and Kuch, 2003;Woodward and Kaiser, 2002;Ribaudo and Gottlieb, 2011;Horan and Shortle, 2011;Shortle 2013). The failure of current trading programs to perform as hoped can largely be attributed to failures of market design and program rules to adequately address these issues, and to the high transaction costs due to the necessity of incorporating uncertainties into market design."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Trading Baselines", "text": "In a point/nonpoint trading program, pollutant reductions that would have occurred as a result of technology upgrades by regulated point sources are replaced by equivalent, long-term reductions from unregulated nonpoint sources that would not have occurred in the absence of the trading market. In order for water quality to be protected, the nonpoint-source reduction in pollutants must be identical in quality to the forgone point-source reduction and must not have occurred without the incentive provided by the market (the credit is \"additional\"). This is the role of the baseline. A baseline is a prediction of the amount of pollutant emissions from an activity resulting from the expected future behavior of actors absent any policy intervention (trading program), holding all other factors constant (Marshall and Weinberg, 2012;U.S. EPA, 2007). Fields not meeting the baseline criteria cannot produce credits for sale in a market until the baseline criteria are achieved. If a full credit is issued for an activity that would have occurred anyway, then it is non-additional and total pollutant loadings will be greater than if the credit had been additional (Marshall and Weinberg, 2012). In the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia have all established baselines that do not reflect current practices, but that require a certain level of stewardship be attained before credits can be sold. These are consistent with U.S. EPA guidance on baselines. U.S. EPA's trading policy states that where a TMDL is in place, the Load Allocation or other appropriate baseline should serve as the threshold for nonpoint sources to generate credits (U.S. EPA, 2007). In a sense, the baseline becomes a representation of the TMDL Load Allocation implemented at the field scale, akin to the Waste Load Allocation for point sources being incorporated into the individual NPDES permits. Establishing a stewardship-based baseline essentially requires a farm to contribute to the TMDL's Load Allocation before being able to sell credits. The ability to sell credits is expected to be a sufficient incentive for farmers to provide this extra abatement. Farmers already meeting the baseline, who could be considered good stewards for previously adopting conservation practices, would be able to enter the trading program without first contributing to Load Allocation. Farmers who are not using best management systems (from a resource conservation standpoint) would likely have to adopt some conservation measures to meet baseline requirements. The more stringent the baseline (i.e., the smaller the pollutant losses allowed), the greater the percentage of cropland needing improved management before being able to produce and sell credits. However, setting a baseline that is more stringent than current practices could come at a cost to point sources trying to reduce their own permit compliance costs. Such a baseline could significantly restrict credit supply by discouraging producers who can supply credits at a relatively low cost but are not meeting the baseline from voluntarily entering a market. A farmer would only be willing to create and sell credits if the expected credit price is high enough to generate the revenue necessary to cover the cost of meeting the baseline plus the cost of any measures taken to produce additional abatement. If the price is sufficient for the farmer to enter the market, the amount of abatement equal to baseline is credited toward Load Allocation, while the remainder goes to the market. In aggregate, the sector's credit supply curve shifts to the left, reflecting the higher cost of supplying credits. Higher credit costs will reduce the amount of credits purchased by point sources. The amount of the shift depends on the share of cropland not currently meeting baseline requirements and the amount of abatement farmers must achieve before being eligible to trade. In aggregate, the shift in the sector supply curve increases the market price of credits, reducing the number of nonpoint-source credits purchased by point sources. There are also consequences from the standpoint of reducing nonpoint-source pollution. If meeting an eligibility baseline discourages those farms that can provide the most abatement at the least cost from participating in a trading program, the overall efficiency of the policy for meeting TMDL goals could be reduced. As demonstrated earlier, traditional design-based policies that might be used to achieve a stewardship baseline consistent with the TMDL are much less efficient than performancebased policies, such as trading. Stephenson et al. 2010found that when the eligibility baseline is more stringent than current practices, agricultural credit costs for nitrogen can surpass marginal abatement costs for point sources because the baseline has claimed the lowest-cost pollutant reductions. Ghosh et al. (2011) found that Pennsylvania's baseline requirements significantly increased the cost of entering a trading program, making it unlikely that nonpoint sources that could reduce nutrient losses for the lowest unit costs would enter the market. Wisconsin has expressed concern that U.S. EPA's approach to defining baselines could obstruct agricultural sources' participation in trading programs and possibly impede water quality improvements (Kramer, 2003). The concern is that fewer nonpoint-source credits would be purchased by point sources, and that total abatement costs for regulated sources would be higher than they would be otherwise. None of these studies examined the effect of baseline choice on total nonpoint-source abatement. We examine this tradeoff between baseline stringency and willingness to trade with the CEAP data from the Chesapeake Bay watershed. We assume that agriculture is not required to meet baseline requirements unless entering into a trading program. We assume that point sources are allowed to seek credits from agricultural sources (consistent with the trading policies of Chesapeake Bay States). Agricultural sources are allowed to sell credits to point sources once a baseline requirement is met. Credits are generated only by the adoption of additional management, even if a field meets the baseline before entering the trading program (no non-additional credits in the market). We select a baseline rule that is based on nitrogen loading rates rather than specific practices, as it is easier to evaluate environmental stringency. This approach is consistent with the baseline rules proposed for Maryland's water quality trading program. We look at loading rate thresholds of 15, 25, 35, 45, and 65 pounds of nitrogen per acre of cropland, along with a baseline based on current practices. We also assume that trading is allowed across sub-basins within the Bay watershed, which is not currently allowed. In our analysis, we examine the relationship between baseline stringency, market equilibrium price, abatement going to the credit market, and abatement going to TMDL Load Allocation."}, {"section_title": "Demand for Credits in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed", "text": "We assume for this analysis that demand for credits from agriculture will come from publicly owned sewage treatment works (POTW). A demand curve for credits is estimated with data from 176 significant wastewater treatment plants in the watershed to represent demand from POTWs (personal communication with John Talberth, Water Resources Institute). Demand is predicated on avoiding costs of treatment upgrades that would be required to meet emission permits under the TMDL. Sources of cost data include Maryland Department of the Environment, Pennsylvania General Assembly Legislative Budget and Finance Joint Committee, and Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. Treatment costs include capital and operating costs for achieving nitrogen reductions consistent with a Waste Load Allocation for the TMDL. Reductions were calculated as a function of existing flows (3-year average) and both pre-and post-upgrade concentrations. For each plant, costs of reducing nitrogen were modeled on a per-pound basis. After all relevant data for each plant were compiled, a demand curve for credits was plotted ( fig. 2). We assume that a credit consists of 1 pound of nitrogen reduction delivered to the tidal waters of the Bay."}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Supply of Credits", "text": "With the data on practice cost, yield, edge-of-field nitrogen loss, and nitrogen delivery to the tidal waters of the bay, we estimate the least-cost option for each observation to supply credits for a trading market, subject to meeting the eligibility baseline. Each observation (considered a representative farm) could add new management systems (nutrient management, cover crops, or water erosion control) to its \"current\" set of practices, except for those observations/sites already implementing the full suite of management systems. We use the performance-based models described earlier to find the least-cost management choice for each observation. Costs reflect the total costs to the farmer of adopting the practice set (including practice implementation costs), the opportunity Nitrogen credit supply and demand curves under alternative loading-rate baselines costs of changes in nutrient applications and crop yields, and costs associated with increased risk (ignoring any cost-share payments from conservation programs). If the observation meets the eligibility baseline, all new abatement goes to the credit market. If the eligibility baseline is not met, abatement is allocated between meeting the baseline (going to the TMDL's Load Allocation) and supplying the credit market. Adopting a single management system often produces enough abatement to meet the baseline and to supply the credit market. The credit price at which it would be profitable for a field to supply credits in the market reflects the cost of achieving the baseline. Aggregating credit supply across all observations for a particular baseline results in a sector credit supply curve for that scenario (fig. 2). We calculate nonpoint-source nitrogen credit supply curves for a \"current practices\" baseline, and baselines of 65, 45, 35, 25, and 15 pounds of nitrogen loss per acre of cropland. Only about 26 percent of watershed cropland could meet the most stringent baseline before adopting additional practices (table 8). About 85 percent could meet the least stringent baseline."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The stewardship-based eligibility baselines for point/nonpoint trading could restrict the number of credits that would be supplied in a trading program. Existing baseline rules are intended to encourage achievement of the TMDL Load Allocation for agriculture. However, the rules may unnecessarily constrain markets, increasing credit prices and reducing potential efficiency gains. Stringent nitrogen loading baselines did not provide much \"extra\" abatement for Load Allocation, while they significantly reduce the volume of credits traded. Relaxing the baseline increased abatement for both the market (benefiting point sources) and for Load Allocation. Offering a subsidy to cover the cost of meeting the baseline significantly increased total abatement. In our analysis, much of this increase went to Load Allocation. With more choices of conservation practices than we considered and different rules for how credits are awarded, a subsidy could provide more credits for the market. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully evaluating these factors when designing a trading program. This analysis does not consider market design features such as trading ratios and geographic limits on markets that would further restrict trading and increase credit prices. Given that impediments to trading are many (Ribaudo and Gottlieb, 2011;King and Kuch, 2003;Woodward and Kaiser, 2002;Shortle, 2013) and the stated need to reduce the costs facing regulated point sources for meeting the TMDL, baseline choice has a major influence on whether point sources can reduce these costs. The worst nonpoint polluters tend to have the largest range of abatement possibilities, so the most effective abatement program of any kind (trading or otherwise) incentivizes these farms to participate. Setting stringent eligibility baselines tends to reduce participation in trading by this group, because of the high cost of meeting baseline requirements. Without a regulatory means of forcing nonpoint-source producers to adopt management practices consistent with the Load Allocation of the TMDL, the consequences of choosing an eligibility baseline are magnified."}, {"section_title": "Manure Management and the TMDL", "text": "Animal agriculture is a significant part of the agricultural economy in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Of the 83,800 farms in the watershed in 2007, animal farms with predominantly confined animals accounted for about 13,800 operations (16 percent), with a combined average daily inventory of roughly 2.0 billion pounds of poultry, dairy, swine, and feedlot beef. Animal agriculture is also a significant source of nutrient loadings to the Bay. Animal operations produce roughly 99,400 tons of recoverable manure nitrogen and 44,200 tons of recoverable manure phosphorus annually (USDA, NRCS, 2012), most of which is applied to available cropland on the source operation. However, confined animal feeding operations often produce more manure nutrients than can be used by crops grown on the land managed by the operation (Ribaudo et al., 2003;Gollehon et al., 2001). This has led to problematic storage of surplus manure and overapplication of manure nutrients, with resulting nutrient losses to the environment (Ribaudo et al., 2003;). An estimated 17 percent of the nitrogen entering the Bay and 26 percent of the phosphorus has been attributed to animal operations (NRC, 2011). Confined animal feeding operations are regulated to control for water-quality impacts under the Clean Water Act. The largest animal feeding operations (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs) require NPDES permits if discharge from the housing facilities enters surface waters through a pipe or ditch. In addition, all CAFOs are expected to have a nutrient management plan that balances the application of manure nutrients to cropland controlled by the operation with the agronomic needs of receiving crops. Most of the Bay States have requirements on the storage and application of manure nutrients that cover all sizes of operations, not just the largest. Maryland and Delaware also pay animal operations to haul manure out of their States. Despite existing Federal and State programs intended to encourage sound manure management, data from the 2007 Census of Agriculture indicate a significant imbalance between manure nutrients produced in the watershed and the nutrient uptake potential of the crops receiving manure. Even if confined animal operations in the CBW fully utilized the crop and pasture land under their control for manure application, only about 47 percent of the manure nitrogen produced could be assimilated onfarm. 5 Clearly, responsible nutrient management requires moving significant quantities of manure off animal operations for abatement practices to be effective. State Watershed Implementation Plans acknowledge this continued imbalance by setting reduction goals for nutrient emissions from manure applications. The TMDL creates the impetus to make the fullest use possible of these requirements. Our earlier analysis of improved management on crop acres covered all cropland, including that owned or leased by animal operations. However, the CEAP data did not allow us to single out this cropland. Because animal operations have a continuing, self-supplied source of crop nutrients (animal waste) that cannot be easily \"turned off,\" the management problems they face are different than those of crop producers who purchase all their nutrients. The cost of moving excess manure nutrients to additional cropland where it can be applied efficiently, or to other uses, adds to the overall cost of improving nutrient management on animal operations (Ribaudo et al., 2003). To examine these costs, we apply a different data set and model. Much of the watershed's excess manure is concentrated in major poultry-producing areas of southern Maryland and Delaware, as well as northwest Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Concentrated dairy production across south-central Pennsylvania adds to the manure excess ( fig. 4). Balancing nutrient supply and demand within the watershed will require moving manure from areas of surplus to areas where it can be used without posing a risk to water quality. Cropland receiving commercial fertilizer can use manure nutrients to meet all or some of the crops' nutrient needs, but moving manure from animal operations requires cropland managers willing to use it following good nutrient management practices. Alternative uses for manure, such as energy and commercial fertilizer production, could also absorb some of the regional excess. Manure (nutrients) may also be transported out of the watershed entirely. All of these options require hauling manure from farms with excess, which can be costly (Ribaudo et al., 2003). The costs associated with managing surplus manure nutrients depend not only on individual farm conditions but also on the interaction among animal operations, and their proximity to available land for manure spreading. Our analysis uses the Chesapeake Bay Regional Manure Transport Model, which accounts for the competition for available cropland land among animal producers in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (see , for a complete description of the model). We assume that all animal feeding operations (AFOs) are moving toward meeting the nutrient management goals laid out in the State Watershed Implementation Plans. The model and its results reflect a regional planning perspective emphasizing the cost determinants and feasibility of different manure management strategies at the watershed scale.   In areas of the Chesapeake Bay watershed where confined animal production is concentrated, implementation of manure management policies poses tremendous challenges. If the manure produced exceeds potential local use, producers may choose to (1) transport the manure ever greater distances until enough land can be found for application or (2) pursue technologies that either utilize manure as a production input or transform the manure to a value-added product that is more readily transportable and usable. Changes in feed management, such as adding phytase to enhance phosphorus utilization for non-ruminants (poultry, hogs), can help reduce nutrients excreted in manure to some extent. 6 Manure amendments, such as alum in poultry litter, have also been used to lessen phosphorus runoff from field-applied manure. 7 Beyond this, the only recourse is to reduce the number of animals in the watershed. Florida, for example, reduced its dairy numbers via a Dairy Buyout Program to reduce nutrient runoff from dairy farms in the Lake Okeechobee watershed to protect the Everglades (Schmitz et al., 1995). The Chesapeake Bay Regional Manure Transport Model helps us account for landowner willingness to apply manure and non-cropland manure uses. Our model is designed to minimize the total regional costs of manure management, transport, and application for use on agricultural lands in the CBW, given the existing scale and structure of the animal industry and manure storage/hauling technologies currently in use. The regional specification captures the element of competition by modeling access to available farmland, simulating within-county and out-of-county manure flows based on manure nutrient content and assimilative capacity of receiving farmland, and computing the associated hauling and application costs. Explicit modeling of competition for land on which to spread manure differentiates the model from existing farm-level models. The model was developed to (1) provide a mechanism to track manure and related nutrient flows within the CBW, from confined animal farms to offsite application and use; (2) compute the regional costs of applying manure to land, given manure transfers dictated by nutrient flows and manure hauling weight; and (3) provide a framework for evaluating proposed land-application regulations and alternative nutrient management policies. The model was first used to evaluate the impacts of new Clean Water Act regulations on CAFOs (Ribaudo et al., 2003). For this analysis, several changes were made to accommodate more recent data from the 2007 Census of Agriculture and a revised methodology for estimating hauling distance (see Appendix, \"Updates to the Chesapeake Bay Regional Manure Transport Model\"). The county is the primary modeling unit. The county-level specification provides consistency with census of agriculture data and other data sources and permits differentiation of institutions and regulatory conditions across county and State political boundaries within the watershed. County and other data are used to capture heterogeneity in production, technology use, and land resource availability across the region, though our model may not represent the conditions on any particular farm."}, {"section_title": "37", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "An Economic Assessment of Policy Options To Reduce Agricultural Pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay, ERR-166", "text": "Economic Research Service/USDA Model output reported at the 6-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) is used to highlight variation in production conditions and policy response at a sub-basin scale."}, {"section_title": "Study Scenarios", "text": "The cost of achieving TMDL pollutant abatement goals for animal agriculture will depend on various factors that influence the production and disposition of excess manure-nutrients in the CBW. Using the Chesapeake Bay Regional Manure Transport Model, we first simulate onfarm AFO manure excess and off-farm manure use on non-AFO crop farms under conditions reflected in the 2007 Census of Agriculture. The Base Case approximates the \"current\" costs of manure handling based on reported off-farm manure use in 2007, given that accurate estimates of the share of applied manure meeting nutrient standards are unavailable. We then evaluate four policy scenarios: (1) compliance with a nutrient management plan across differing levels of willingness of non-AFO crop farms to accept manure; (2) compliance with a more restrictive requirement for nutrient management; (3) the presence of manure demand for non-cropland uses (energy generation), and (4) reductions in the scale of the confined animal sector (see table 10 for scenario labels)."}, {"section_title": "Base Case", "text": "The Base2007 simulation was constructed to approximate the disposition of manure and manure handling costs under current (2007) conditions, providing a context for examining changes in manure handling under alternative NMP compliance assumptions. The base case fixes onfarm manure use (AFOs) and off-farm manure use (non-AFO crop farms) to reported levels of acreage receiving manure in the 2007 Census. 8 Onfarm manure excess was calculated from estimated recoverable manure nutrients produced on AFOs and crop-nutrient uptake on AFO cropland and pastureland in 2007, assuming an N standard for land application of manure and adjustments in manure-ready acreage due to P-limited soils (Kellogg et al, forthcoming). In the base case, we assume that all manure hauled off the farm is applied at agronomic rates under an N application-touptake ratio of 1.4 (N efficiency of 0.71), reflecting historically acceptable manure N losses (USDA, NRCS, 2011). Onfarm manure accounts for all remaining manure-including excess that is not applied to land off the farm and not otherwise removed for non-cropland uses. Under the Base2007 simulation, onfarm manure applied on AFOs accounts for a significant share (69 percent) of total manure produced across Chesapeake Bay counties ( fig. 5). Onfarm manure includes 3.5 million dry tons (56 percent of total) sufficient to meet the agronomic requirements of crops produced on AFO farms, plus an additional 0.8 million tons (13 percent) that is assumed to be overapplied on AFO farms. Such overapplications are consistent with previous research (Ribaudo et al., 2003;Gollehon et al., 2001), and align closely with NRCS simulation assumptions for onfarm AFO manure use in 2007 (Kellogg, et al., forthcoming). Manure moved off the farm and applied to cropland accounts for 1.9 million tons, or 31 percent of total manure produced. Approximately 1.1 million tons of manure moved off-farm is applied within the source county, while 0.8 million tons are hauled to other counties within the watershed. A small share of manure is diverted to non-cropland uses-primarily for commercial fertilizer products and small- Economic Research Service/USDA scale composting of manure sold for non-cropland uses within and outside the basin. We estimate this amount at roughly 1 percent of total manure production in the Chesapeake Basin counties. 9 Manure hauling costs, which are expected to increase with full NMP implementation, are an important concern for the animal industry (Ribaudo et al., 2003). Under the Base2007 simulation, annual manure hauling costs are estimated at $171 million across basin counties, with on-farm hauling costs of $116 million accounting for a significant share. 10 Off-farm hauling costs of $55 million were divided between in-county ($34 million) and out-of-county ($22 million) hauls. Poultry litter accounts for a large share of long-haul manure transfers, with wetter slurry and lagoon waste more typical of dairy and hog operations tending to shorter within-county hauls. Manure was applied on approximately 1.6 million acres across the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 2007, including 1.1 million acres on AFOs and 0.5 million acres on non-AFOs (altogether 36 percent of the 4.4 million cropland acres in the CBW) (USDA, NRCS, 2011). An estimated 12 percent of total farmland received manure in the watershed, with acreage shares varying considerably across sub-regions. County-level estimates of manure-nutrient assimilative capacity suggest considerable opportunity to reallocate surplus manure within the watershed. 11"}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Management Plan Compliance Scenarios", "text": "In the following scenario analyses, we assume that all AFOs and non-AFOs in the watershed apply manure under an approved nutrient management plan (NMP) that defines acceptable application rates, timing, and application methods (consistent with nutrient management described earlier and with rules developed by the Bay watershed States). (While all manure applied to cultivated cropland is assumed to be incorporated or injected, the full suite of conservation treatments may not necessarily be in place to minimize nutrient losses from applied manure). As more AFOs comply with manure-nutrient standards under approved plans, manure applied onfarm is reduced and a greater share will have to be moved off the farm. Increased competition for land to spread manure will, in turn, increase the distance required to access suitable land. Higher manure hauling costs faced by animal producers is an important policy challenge in moving toward full NMP compliance."}, {"section_title": "Willingness To Accept Manure (WTAM)", "text": "The willingness of crop farms to accept manure will be a key determinant of future hauling costs. A reluctance to apply manure may reflect various concerns, including potential odor in nearby residential areas, manure storage requirements, variability in manure-nutrient content, potential dispersion of weed seeds and pathogens, and possible litigation from nearby nonfarm housing. Manure rotational requirements on soils with high phosphorus content may also limit applied manure in some areas. The willingness of landowners to use manure affects manure handling costs through changes in both the extent of suitable land and the hauling distance required to access available acreage. Under our NMP compliance scenarios, we assume that all AFO farms are willing to use their own manure onfarm to meet crop nutrient requirements. For non-AFOs, we apply four WTAM levels to manure-ready acreage across the CBW-30, 50, 70, and 90 percent. The range of WTAM levels reflects the uncertainty surrounding landowner attitudes to manure, and the sensitivity of hauling costs to alternative WTAM specifications. While WTAM assumptions are applied uniformly across the watershed, we recognize that rates may vary across sub-basins. For example, landowner willingness to use manure may be higher in animal-producing areas with an established tradition of manure use and more active local manure markets. Under the NMP-compliance scenarios, onfarm manure use accounts for about 56 percent of manure produced in the CBW counties-or that amount required to cover nitrogen requirements of crops produced on AFOs (assuming an N application-to-loss ratio of 1.4). The decline in onfarm manure use from Base2007 levels is mirrored in an expansion in off-farm manure transfers ( fig. 5). With increasing willingness of non-AFO crop producers to apply manure, a greater share of manure transfers are used within the source county, with lesser shares hauled to other counties both within and outside the basin. As the region moves toward full NMP compliance, off-farm manure hauling and application costs are projected to expand relative to BASE2007 conditions ( fig. 6). Increased costs reflect both expanded acreage receiving manure and increased hauling costs required to access additional acres. Off-farm hauling costs-estimated at $55 million basinwide under BASE2007-increases by a range of $15 to $27 million, depending on assumptions about crop producers' acceptance of manure. Increasing the willingness to accept manure from 30 percent to 90 percent reduces hauling costs (basinwide) by about 15 percent.

Net imports of manure are positive for portions of the south-central CBW (James and Lower Chesapeake sub-basins) and northern CBW (Upper and West Branch Susquehanna sub-basins). However, much of the onfarm manure excess produced in the CBW remains within the sub-basin of origin, with imports often concentrated in receiving counties adjacent to high-surplus counties."}, {"section_title": "Full Conservation Treatment", "text": "While NMP compliance scenarios reflect generally high levels of manure management, further reductions in manure-nutrient losses may be achieved through the adoption of additional conservation treatments appropriate for a given field. Increasing nitrogen use efficiency from 0.71 to 0.83 (N application-to-uptake ratio of 1.2 or less) may require reduced application rates, as well as such practices as cover crops, filter strips and riparian buffers that capture excess nutrients and reduce pollutant runoff. Somewhat less apparent are the implications of moving toward full conservation treatments on manure handling costs in the watershed. Cropland and pastureland area available for manure spreading, with Chesapeake Bay sub-basin (HUC6) delineations, 2007  Figure 9 shows manure hauling and application costs under two cases: NMP compliance, with and without full conservation treatments (HICON50 and WTAM50).

"}, {"section_title": "Manure Use for Biomass Energy", "text": "The use of manure as a biomass feedstock for electricity power has been promoted as an innovative means to address regional goals for management of excess manure and renewable energy generation (Ribaudo et al., 2003). While a number of concept proposals have been advanced in the Chesapeake Bay region, uncertainty in energy markets, air-quality concerns, ash disposal issues, and other local siting issues have generally limited their support. The impact of a large-scale biomass facility on local manure supplies has been a particular concern of the agricultural community (Pease et al., 2012). Here we evaluate the effect of manure use for energy generation on AFO off-farm hauling costs for land-applied manure, and potential implications for the crop sector. Against our benchmark WTAM50 scenario, we consider five levels of regional manure feedstock demand for power generation-50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, and 250,000 dry tons (out of 6.2 million dry tons of excess produced) -based on proposed energy projects. Manure feedstock is assumed to be drawn from poultry litter and other semi-dry manure sources (30 and 50 percent moisture content, respectively). As we are not evaluating a specific sited facility, reductions for biomass feedstock are applied uniformly across all excess dry and semi-dry manure sources from across the watershed to give total 13 Conservation practices such as filter strips and riparian buffers may further reduce available acreage for manure spreading. However, the effect on manure hauling costs is likely to be very small on a watershed scale.  Economic Research Service/USDA dry-weight tonnage. Base assumptions for manure used in pelletization and small-scale composting are held constant. Figure 10 shows the reduction in (1) off-farm hauling costs and (2) value of chemical fertilizer offsets under alternative levels of manure diversions for power generation. With reductions in manure excess to supply demand for biomass feedstock, the decline in off-farm hauling costs for land-applied manure range from $1.1 to $5.0 million basinwide. Reductions in hauling cost moderate with greater manure diversions, as the most costly hauls are retired first. To the extent that manure transport costs are borne by the animal operations, cost savings accrue largely to producers in the Potomac and Upper Chesapeake sub-basins where, not surprisingly, much of the interest in a facility siting has focused. With reduced manure excess, and resulting declines in acreage receiving manure, the value of forgone manure-based on the cost of equivalent levels of chemical N and P fertilizer-ranges from $1.7 to $8.4 million. The response function is nearly linear across manure diversions, as nutrient uptake rates averaged across affected acreage basinwide remain fairly constant ( fig. 10). A tightening of available manure supplies may result in additional costs for area crop producers who have come to rely on manure, to the extent that the full value of applied manure exceeds purchase costs. Under the BIOMS250 scenario, the 250,000 dry tons of manure diverted for energy generation results in 76,800 fewer non-AFO acres using manure across the basin (relative to the zero-biomass case). The forgone value of poultry litter as a manure source-based on equivalent levels of chemical N and P-is estimated at $33/dry-ton. 14  According to Pease et al. (2012), brokers in the Shenandoah Valley pay as much as $12 to $15 per ton of poultry litter, or roughly $50 per dry-ton of manure when adjusted for moisture (30 percent) and bedding (10 percent, wet weight) content. Higher purchase prices may reflect, in part, the value of additional nutrients beyond N and P, as well as soil-enhancing benefits of organic material. While manure charges paid by crop producers are not well documented and returns to applied manure would vary across the basin, high litter prices and prospects of rising manure demand for biomass energy suggest at least the potential for higher costs to the regional crop sector."}, {"section_title": "Scale Reductions in the Animal Sector", "text": "The challenge of managing manure nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay watershed is essentially one of nutrient flows and balance-large imports of animal-feed nutrients supporting an increasingly concentrated animal industry, and only a limited amount of available cropland to assimilate excess manure nutrients. Where excess nutrients cannot feasibly or economically be addressed through dietary regimes, improved management practices, increased landowner acceptance of manure, or expansion of non-cropland uses-all of which must be part of an integrated solution-reductions in the scale of animal production may be viewed as a reasonable approach. The Florida buyout of dairy operations in the northern Everglades basin suggests that voluntary, compensated reductions in animal herd size to improve water quality and environmental resources may represent a viable policy option. Here we consider the effect of reducing the scale of the animal sector in the Chesapeake Bay watershed on (1) off-farm manure hauling costs and (2) returns (above operating costs) to animal production. Using WTAM50 scenario as a benchmark, we consider three levels of reductions in manure-N excess-5, 10, and 15 percent-roughly equivalent to reductions of 2, 4, and 6 percent of animalunits 15 basinwide. Excess manure is removed on a uniform percentage basis across all manure types in the watershed, and reductions in animal-units are assumed to be applicable only where AFO manure exceeds onfarm crop requirements. Figure 11 shows the effect of a reduction in animals on manure hauling costs and returns (above operating expenses 16 ) to the animal industry. Basinwide, a 2-percent reduction in animal-units results in a loss of approximately $52 million to the animal sector, measured as weighted net returns across animal species types. Reducing nutrient excess by 15 percent would require roughly 6 percent fewer animal-units in the basin, valued at more than $150 million. The number and total value of animal-units forgone to meet manure-nutrient excess targets would vary over sub-basins, reflecting both the concentration of excess manure and the species composition of animals. The potential savings in off-farm hauling costs-ranging from $16 to $44 million depending on the level of nutrient excess targeted-are well below the forgone returns to animal production. Moreover, as forgone returns increase linearly with higher targeted levels of excess, the increase in sector savings decline as less costly hauls are eliminated. While operators facing exceptionally high manure hauling distances would have increased incentive to participate in a voluntary herd/flock reduction program, savings in manure hauling costs alone may not be a significant driver for many operators. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The animal sector faces increasing costs for off-farm manure hauling as it moves toward full NMP compliance for manure nutrients-both in terms of share of manure managed under approved plans and level of conservation treatments. The magnitude of these additional costs (about $18 million assuming nutrient management and 50 percent of farmers willing to accept manure; $22 million assuming full conservation treatment and the same WTAM) is much smaller than the costs estimated for the design-based policy scenarios that require treatment on large shares of cropland ($337 million to $1.2 billion). Increased hauling costs, while important to animal operations, appear to be a relatively small portion of the total costs to the agriculture sector of meeting TMDL goals. Our analysis suggests these costs may be potentially mitigated through incentives to increase the willingness of landowners to accept manure. This might involve technical assistance for NMP development and cost-sharing for improved manure storage and handling technologies. The development of local markets for manure transfers, already occurring in the CBW (Pease et al., 2012), may further promote application of manure on land. Targeting areas where competition for manuresuitable land is greatest and landowner willingness to accept manure is relatively low may achieve the greatest benefits. Costs may also be mitigated through point/nonpoint water quality trading, as for cropland. For those animal operations not covered by Federal or State nutrient management requirements, or those operations that have already met their nutrient management requirements, moving manure off the farm as part of a nutrient management plan and applying it to cropland elsewhere under an approved plan could be a way to create credits for sale in a market. However, confined animal operations are likely to be at a competitive disadvantage relative to crop producers, who do not incur  the manure hauling costs (Sneeringer, 2013). Any decrease in the application of manure nutrients on cropland controlled by an animal operation necessitates an increase in the amount of manure moved elsewhere. In contrast, reducing nutrient application rates on a crop farm to generate credits actually reduces fertilizer costs. Biomass energy generation has been suggested as a potential strategy for management of excess manure. If biomass facilities were to successfully address financial and environmental concerns raised with earlier proposals, increased demand for manure as a biomass feedstock could reduce manure hauling costs while increasing prices paid to animal producers. Siting of plant facilities would be important to maximize access to available manure supplies. However, manure diverted for energy expansion could impose costs on the regional crop sector if producers who had been using manure were required to rely more exclusively on commercial fertilizer. Reducing the number of animals that contribute to manure-nutrient excess represents perhaps the most direct response to addressing concerns of excess manure. However, a voluntary animal buyout program is likely to be quite expensive and would be inconsistent with the watershed States' stated goal of preserving agriculture in the watershed. Moreover, our simple analysis does not consider the broader costs of restructuring and potentially relocating animal production to other regions. But it does provide some insight on the magnitude of costs that may be involved in downscaling the animal sector to meet regional water-quality goals. Efficiency can be improved by targeting practices to cropland that has lower unit abatement costs. This can be accomplished by identifying observable factors or proxies that are closely related to pollutant creation and delivery. Nonpoint-source contribution in a watershed is not evenly distributed but tends to originate from a limited number of locations (Diebel et al., 2008), as indicated by the unequal geographic distribution of treatment under our Optimal scenario. We explored several potential proxies for pollutant delivery in order to target fields with higher pollution losses and lower unit abatement costs. As expected, focusing only on the characteristics of the land, such as erodibility, and ignoring management measures was not cost-effective. Taking into account distance to water and an NRCS assessment of treatment needs provided the least cost design-based approach (of the options we evaluated) for meeting the TMDL. However, enhanced targeting did not approach the efficiency of the Optimal scenario. Our best enhanced targeting scenario was still about six times more costly than the Optimal scenario. The benefit of performance-based policies was demonstrated not only by the lower overall cost, but by the smaller average per-acre treatment costs ($108 per acre vs. $248 per acre). Since performancebased policies induce those fields that can produce the most abatement at least cost to implement management, fewer management systems need to be adopted. Because the relatively simple targeting criteria of the design-based approaches could not target the same cropland receiving management in the Optimal scenario, more treatment was needed per acre and more acres needed to be treated in order to meet the TMDL abatement goals. Further research with additional data on management options and observable proxies for water quality impacts from fields could improve the recommended targeting criteria. In addition, the development of acceptable modeling tools could have major benefits, enabling the implementation of performancebased approaches. Water quality goals could then be met with fewer acres treated and less extensive treatment on those acres, which is particularly desirable under tight conservation budgets."}, {"section_title": "Fostering Political Agreement May Require Some Sacrifice in Efficiency", "text": "Focusing the bulk of management changes in a particular region may seem inequitable, especially if the region does not enjoy the benefits of improved water quality (as in the case of Pennsylvania). \"Spreading the pain\" over the entire watershed may be politically desirable to achieve buy-in from all the CBW States. However, as demonstrated with the design of performance-based approaches, a policy becomes increasingly less efficient as it engages fields in parts of the watershed that contribute relatively little to the problem. There can be a significant tradeoff between efficiency (least cost) and equity (treating political jurisdictions more equally). Still, there may be local benefits from improving cropland management over a wider area that we do not account for in our analysis."}, {"section_title": "Purely Voluntary Approaches Have Some Notable Drawbacks", "text": "Meeting the TMDL requires significant reductions in agricultural nonpoint-source pollution. The history of voluntary approaches for meeting watershed water quality goals is not encouraging. Under a voluntary approach, it is difficult or expensive to entice those farmers who can provide the most abatement at least cost to enroll in programs and to adopt the most cost-effective practices for improving water quality. Our models indicate that when farmers are allowed to select which management systems to implement, the TMDL goals are usually not met. Farmers adopted those systems that are least costly to them for meeting the policy, and not necessarily those that reduced pollution at least cost. It may be possible to address this through changes in the way conservation resources are directed. For example, our analysis indicated that the Susquehanna watershed can provide much abatement at a relatively low cost. The proactive development of relationships by resource managers with those farms in the watershed most in need of improvement (rather than waiting for farmers to ask for assistance) and the provision of appropriate education, technical, and financial assistance could greatly improve the efficiency of a voluntary approach. While the administrative costs may be higher, the benefits in terms of increased program efficiency may be significant. Using Stringent Baselines To Obtain Additional Nonpoint-Source Abatement Hurts Trading In the absence of regulations on nonpoint-source pollution, adopting stringent eligibility baselines for nonpoint sources in a point-nonpoint trading program in order to obtain additional abatement for meeting a TMDL's Load Allocation could seriously restrict trading while obtaining very little additional abatement. A strict baseline that would require most farms to adopt additional abatement measures in order to trade so restricts credit supply that few credits are traded, and little \"extra\" abatement is provided for Load Allocation. On the other hand, a less stringent baseline that most farms could meet benefits the credit market and encourages extra abatement that goes to Load Allocation. Point sources benefit most when current practices serve as the baseline (no abatement for Load Allocation). An alternative approach could be to use incentives such as traditional conservation programs to encourage abatement for Load Allocation rather than trying to use a trading program to meet multiple goals. Our analysis shows that there is enough potential pollution abatement from nonpoint sources for both meeting the TMDL load allocation and for supporting a trading market with relatively low-cost credits."}, {"section_title": "Achieving a Better Manure Nutrient Balance", "text": "Improving the management of manure is an important part of State plans for meeting the TMDL. The proper implementation of nutrient management practices on animal operations cannot occur until excess manure nutrients are moved to where they can be applied according to standards of a nutrient management plan. This additional cost for complying with a nutrient management plan is an important consideration for animal producers. Such costs range between $18 million and $22 million per year in the CBW, assuming half of crop producers are willing to accept manure as a nutrient source. Off-farm hauling costs could be mitigated through education, technical assistance, and financial incentives related to manure management that increase the willingness of crop producers to substitute manure nutrients for commercial fertilizer. Targeting program efforts to areas where competition for suitable land is greatest may achieve the greatest benefit. The cost of such efforts would have to be weighed against the benefits from reduced hauling. Public entities may also help to facilitate market exchanges for manure. A 2011 follow-up survey to the 2003-2006 NRCS CEAP survey found that cropland receiving manure from off-farm sources increased from 17 percent of manured cropland in 2006 to 34 percent in 2011 (USDA, NRCS, 2013). This could be in response to State efforts to encourage more effective use of manure resources under the TMDL. Developing alternative uses for manure, such as biomass energy, could reduce the hauling problem while providing additional income for animal producers. However, farmers who have come to rely on manure as a source of nutrients and a valuable soil amendment may face rising manure prices or limits on manure supplies as manure is diverted for power generation. Such costs would have to be weighed against the benefits of local energy production. Given the costs of alternative fuels such as natural gas and concerns over local air quality, the current outlook for biomass options is uncertain. Reductions in manure nutrient production may be part of a broader solution to addressing nutrient imbalances in the watershed. Changes in feed management and other animal production practices have contributed to reduced nutrient loss in the animal waste. Reducing herd size is a more drastic approach for achieving a manure-nutrient balance, but there is precedent in Florida. However, the savings in reduced hauling costs would be outweighed by the value of lost production.

For the analysis, 756 National Resources Inventory (NRI) sampling points in the watershed were treated as representative farms growing major field crops (excluding vegetables) using sampling weights to describe farm production and environmental conditions on 97.9 percent of agricultural land in the watershed. Cost data and other information reflecting conditions in the watershed States (DE, MD, NY, PA, VA, WV) were obtained from various sources, including State Watershed Implementation Plans, contract data from USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Chesapeake Bay Program, published literature, and subject matter specialists within government and various universities. manure model-was designed to capture the competition for land, which is an important determinant of manure hauling distance and cost. Area-to-distance relationships were updated for the TMDL analysis to more accurately reflect current conditions in the regional animal sector. The number of confined animal feeding operations, obtained through the NRCS animal-manure database, was derived from reported animal production in the 2007 Census of Agriculture. The spatial land cover of cropland and permanent pasture was drawn from the 2012 Cropland Data Layer (CDL), developed by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Revised estimation procedures for GIS area-to-distance functions provided a more realistic assessment of potential hauling distances for use in the TMDL study. Estimation procedures were improved in several ways: \u2022 The assignment of AFOs by county and sub-basin is potentially more spatially accurate relative to earlier studies based on AFO counts by county, as the 2007 Census of Agriculture collected data to identify farm locations, including AFOs by county and HUC-6. \u2022 Consistent with NRCS assumptions, half of permanent pasture acreage-randomly drawn from pastureland coverage in the watershed-was assumed unsuitable for manure spreading due to terrain, tree cover, soil erodibility, and other factors. \u2022 For each unique intercounty manure transfer from source-county grid to farmland perimeter in receiving counties, distances were calculated based on actual road mileage-in contrast with the prior estimation, which adjusted linear distances by rough factor adjustments to reflect water bodies and other natural barriers. \u2022 For each intercounty transfer, a unique area-to-distance function is estimated for the receiving county, measured from the perimeter point of access to farmland. \u2022 For all intra-and intercounty area-to-distance functions, county-specific circuity factors that convert from linear to road distance, and are estimated from actual road miles, replace State-level circuity factors applied in the prior analyses. As with the prior analyses, slope coefficients for the area-to-distance functions were adjusted in the simulation model to reflect alternative levels of willingness to accept manure. Lower (higher) WTAM levels result in lesser (greater) available acreage on which to spread manure, as well as longer (shorter) hauls to access a given land area. In addition, the TMDL analysis introduces an index adjustment to intracounty slope coefficients to better reflect AFO size considerations and resulting intensity of onfarm manure production on competition for land. The effect is to slightly increase hauling distances required to access a given land area in counties where average drymanure tonnage per AFO is greatest. Other Model Data. Various production and cost data were used in updating the regional manure model for use in the TMDL study. The distribution of manure system types by animal species was revised based on USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data for poultry, hogs, and dairy. Annual returns above operating costs were drawn from livestock sector data in the ERS-REAP national agricultural sector model, based on ERS cost/return estimates and other source; costs per live-animal weight were converted to animal-unit equivalents using conversion"}]
