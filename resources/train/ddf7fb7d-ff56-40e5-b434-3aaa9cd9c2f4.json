It is anticipatedthattheaveragingof the variousdata from multiple calibrationsiteswill yield improvedcalibrationof the altimeters. Most of the siteswill alsoattempt to provide calibrationsof multiple altimetersystems(Jason, GFO, andEnvisat). The currentoperationalandplannedsites includeHarvest, Bumie, British Channel, andBaltic Sea(operating), andCorsica,Catalunya, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Erie,North SeaandNew Caledonia(planned). The following Jasoncalibration/validation plans,which haveour involvement, havebeensubmittedto the JasonProject: The GPS buoy was also used to \"link\" T/P altimeter measurement with a NOAA tide gauge, Holland West, located in Lake Michigan (Fig.  3). That is, water level measurements obtained by GPS-buoys at the tide gauge and at the altimeter track during March 1999, were used to compare with the closest T/P altimeter data for the entire mission 20 km away, by using the tide gauge historic data. Fig. 7  , shows an estimated bias of 4 + 5 mm based on a 7-parameter fit (Fig. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Coastal", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ocean Tide Modeling", "text": "Since the accuracy assessment of global ocean tide models in 1997 [Shum et al., 1997] and JPL (Desai and Wahr) models.

Fig. 10 and 11  associatedbiasesand drifts in the geophysicaland mediacorrectionsand the links of variousaltimetersystems represent the currentlimitationsto fully exploit the use of radar altimeters. We have conducted improvement of the historic and present altimeter measurements and the determination of their relative biases. Fig. 14, 15, and 16 show A, B, C, D, E, F, G). The validation and the resulting determination of relative biases between the altimeter systems and different mission phases (Fig. 17) are considered an improvement of previous work [Guman, 1997]. Fig. 17 illustrates shows some stringent technical details needed to exploit the use of multiple mission radar altimeter measurements for the measurement of the global sea level. WOCE (and Great Lakes) tide gauges have been used to \"link\" or determine the relative instrument biases between different altimeter systems [Guman, 1997;Kruizinga, 1997;Urban et al., 1999;Shum et al., 1999b].  et al., 1999b]. This represents the first such determination and illustrates the potential of using satellite measurements to measure sea level changes.    "}]
