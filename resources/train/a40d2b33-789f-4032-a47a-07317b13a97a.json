[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Coastal erosion has been analyzed extensively along ocean shorelines, but more recent attention has focused on the movements and mechanisms of estuarine shoreline change (Benoit et al., 2007). Sheltered from energetic open-ocean processes, estuaries are complex systems, enduring storms and offering a place of refuge for many organisms. Estuaries are biologically rich, productive ecosystems that are important for fish and shellfish growth and associated fisheries; approximately 75% of fish caught in the United States use estuaries during at least one stage in their lifetime (Martin et al., 1996). Estuarine shorelines also act as natural buffers, diminishing the physical energy from waves and currents. Shorelines show great variability, accreting and eroding at different rates; this is evident in research performed by Riggs and Ames (2003), who measured considerable variations in erosion rates (0 to 27.6 m yr 21 ) for shoreline types in eastern North Carolina. The objective of this study is to analyze estuarine shoreline change at a high resolution (,100 m) over a large area to better understand how rates of shoreline change vary along Cedar Island and how this variation relates to the controlling processes. A new point-based approach was created to facilitate the effort and was applied to shorelines digitized from 1958 and 1998 imagery. Previous research (Price, 2006) used points to calculate shoreline change by pairing points located on each digitized shoreline spaced the same distance along the shoreline. However, the point-based approach created for this analysis calculated shoreline-change rates (SCRs) differently, using the closest linear distance between shorelines. The newly created point-based approach therefore calculates a conservative rate of shoreline change. Points were also used to analyze shoreline change for this study because of the ease with which additional parameters hypothesized to be important in estuarine erosion can be determined and analyzed. Parameters that reflect wave energy and shoreline composition are calculated from the shoreline points. These parameters are statistically analyzed to evaluate whether wave energy (using fetch and a wave exposure index as proxies) and shoreline composition (using elevation and vegetation as proxies) are critical controls on shoreline change along Cedar Island, North Carolina (Figure 1). The long-term shoreline-change results from the new point-based approach, based on digitized shorelines from 1958 and 1998, are compared with results from a commonly used transect-based approach. et al. (2002) document a 12% loss in marsh area over a 39-year period (1959 to 1998) in which local sea level rose 10.5 cm. Although sea-level rise is one important factor affecting coastal erosion, other processes are expected to contribute, such as winds, waves, currents, bioerosion, and anthropogenic influences (Davis and Fitzgerald, 2004). Waves impacting the shoreline can suspend sediment, while currents can transport these materials elsewhere, causing erosion. Wave energy is a product of wind, bathymetry, and fetch. Erosion potential is higher in areas with larger fetches due to greater anticipated Figure 1. Location maps for the study area, including (A) the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System, (B) the Cedar Island study area (red square) with the KHSE weather station location (closed triangle), and (C) the Cedar Island study area with 1998 digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles used in shoreline digitization. A color version of this figure is available in the online journal. wave buildup (Phillips, 1985). Waves impacting the shoreline are influenced by many factors, including shoreline elevation and vegetation. For example, Moller (2006) determined density and type of marsh vegetation were significantly related to wave height dissipation. While marshes are able to vertically accrete when flooded through sediment deposition, shorelines with elevations above sea level are expected to accrete more slowly, and depending on their size and lithology, these areas may experience mass wasting when acted upon by high-energy waves. For example, Phillips (1999) found that repeated storm events caused slope failure and recession on unconsolidated shoreline bluffs with relief of at least 1.5 m, while less shoreline retreat occurred on areas of lower elevation (e.g., marsh, cypress fringe, and low-relief banks)."}, {"section_title": "Calculating Shoreline Change", "text": "Shoreline change can be calculated through the time-series comparison of various data, including ground surveys, National Ocean Service topographic sheets, aerial photography, satellite imagery, synthetic aperture radar, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and global positioning systems. Although new satellite and other remotely sensed approaches are becoming feasible (e.g., LIDAR; Li, Di, and Ma, 2001), aerial photography analysis remains the most commonly used method to calculate shoreline change (Boak and Turner, 2005). Due to the complex physical processes creating and moving sediments within the shore zone, spatial and temporal errors are potentially created when using aerial photography to calculate shoreline change. Spatial distortion is present in aerial photographs in the form of tilt, radial distortion, and relief displacement (see Crowell, Leatherman, and Buckley, 1991;Moore, 2000; and references therein). However, these distortions are generally corrected when the image is rectified. Rectification gives the image a spatial reference and is necessary before shoreline delineation. Temporal shoreline error exists because an aerial photograph is a snapshot in time of a dynamic system. For example, an image taken after a storm may display a shoreline that has retreated but has not yet recovered, and large storms can rapidly erode the shoreline, taking more than a year to recover (Douglas, Crowell, and Leatherman, 1998). However, through analyzing shoreline change in excess of a century, Fenster, Dolan, and Morton (2001) determined that storm-influenced data values are not outliers. Despite these inherent errors, Crowell, Leatherman, and Buckley (1991) determined a ''worst-case error estimate'' of 7.7 m using non-tide-coordinated aerial photography and geomorphic control, which exceeds the National Map Accuracy Standards (612.2 m; U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 1999). Shoreline change can be calculated through various methods, including endpoint rate (EPR), average of rates, linear regression, and jackknifing, as discussed by Dolan, Fenster, and Holme (1991). The EPR is the most commonly used method due to its computational ease and because only two shorelines are required (Dolan, Fenster, and Holme, 1991). The EPR is calculated by measuring the distance between the shorelines and dividing by the time difference between the shorelines. Analysis of shoreline change has often been conducted using an automated transect-based approach. In this approach, transects are created perpendicular to a baseline that is positioned landward or seaward of the shorelines being analyzed (Forbes et al., 2004;Morton, Miller, and Moore, 2005;Thieler and Danforth, 1994a;Thieler, O'Connell, and Schupp, 2001). An EPR is calculated from the distance between shorelines along these fixed transects. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), created by and available from the USGS (Thieler and Danforth, 1994b), is a commonly used tool for transect-based shoreline-change analysis."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREA", "text": "Cedar Island is located in Carteret County (34u579 N, 76u229 W), approximately 64 km northeast of Beaufort, North Carolina (Figure 1). It is part of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System (APES), the second-largest estuary in the United States, and is considered 1 of 28 ''nationally significant'' estuaries (Martin et al., 1996). Cedar Island encompasses 58.6 km 2 , with 44.5 km 2 consisting of flooded brackish marsh (Freske, 2007). Brinson, Bryant, and Jones (1991) describe three vegetation zones on Cedar Island; at the shoreline is zone 1, which consists primarily of Juncus roemerianus and Distichlis spicata, with the later being less abundant. In terms of physical energy, the shoreline of Cedar Island varies dramatically, from sheltered areas contained within the Thoroughfare, a canal separating the island from the mainland, to areas exposed to the vast fetches of Pamlico Sound and, thus, vulnerable to wave action. Cedar Island is sheltered from ocean processes and is dominated by wind waves and wind tides because the inlets of the Outer Banks chain of barrier islands restrict the flow of open-ocean waves and water into the estuarine system. Astronomical tides in the area are less than 10 cm (Benninger and Wells, 1993)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Shoreline-Change Rates", "text": "To calculate SCRs in this study, 1998 digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQs) and 1958 black-and-white aerial photographs were used; the methodological steps are illustrated in Figure 2. The 1998 DOQQs (1 3 1 m ground spatial resolution, in NAD 1983 State Plane NC FIPS 3200 projection) were obtained from the USGS in digital format. The 1958 aerial photographs were obtained from the North Carolina Geological Survey but were originally collected by Aerial Park Surveys, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Commodity Stabilization Service. The 23 3 23 cm (9 3 9 inch) positive contact prints of the 1958 photographs were scanned using a Microtek ScanMaker 9800XL at 8-bit pixel resolution with a 600-dpi image resolution and were saved in TIFF format. Once in digital form, the 1958 photographs were rectified using the 1998 DOQQs and the georeferencing tools within ArcGISH. Using the second-order polynomial transformation, the photographs were rectified with a minimum of eight ground control points. For the Cedar Island study area, 26 aerial photographs from 1958 were rectified with an average rootmean-square error of 1.68 m. Once aerial photographs were rectified, the wet-dry line was delineated on sediment shorelines (see Boak and Turner, 2005, and sources therein), whereas the apparent shoreline was digitized on vegetated shorelines (i.e., the vegetation boundary; Ellis, 1978). The shorelines were digitized on-screen as a polyline using a zoom tolerance of 1 : 3500 to 1 : 3000 (Poulter, 2005). After digitization, a point was created every 50 m along the 1998 shoreline using the ArcGIS DIVIDE function (within the Editor toolbar), and the points were saved as a point shapefile. The EPR method was used to calculate the SCR at each point. The distances from the 1998 shoreline points to the 1958 shoreline were determined using the NEAR tool in ArcGIS (available with an ArcInfo license). The distance value was then divided by 40 years to calculate the SCR over the fourdecade period between photographs. A polygon shapefile was generated from the 1958 shoreline polyline to define the initial land area. By intersecting the 1998 shoreline points with the 1958 polygon land area, the shoreline points that had moved landward were identified, i.e., indicating erosion or negative shoreline change. The points that intersected the 1958 polygon were populated with a negative SCR value. The SCR of points that did not intersect the 1958 polygon-those that had accreted or where no shoreline change had occurredremained positive. Because the nearest distance is used to calculate SCRs, the point-based approach determines conservative shoreline-change values. An example of the SCR methodology is shown in Figure 3 for a subset area from the study area. Shoreline recession occurred on the headland shorelines and the embayed shoreline; between, the headlands accreted. The total positional uncertainty (U T ) of the shorelines and SCRs determined within this study were calculated based on work performed by Genz et al. (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2003). Of the error variables used by Genz et al. (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2003), three were used to calculate U T for this study: the digitization error of the 1998 shoreline (E d1 ), the digitization error of the 1958 shoreline (E d2 ), and the rectification error (E r ): For shoreline-change analysis using aerial photography, the tidal fluctuation error can be incorporated; however, since the tidal fluctuation within the study area is minimal, this variable was not included in the positional uncertainty analysis. Through multiple digitization of the same area, a digitization error of 0.55 m was calculated for the 1998 and the 1958 shorelines. As stated previously, the 1958 rectified aerials had a root-meansquare error of 1.68 m; therefore, the U T of the shorelines and SCR data is 61.85 m, or 0.05 m yr 21 over the 40-year period. The calculated SCRs based on the point-based approach developed for this study were compared to values obtained through the more common transect-based approach using the DSAS program, version 3.0 (Thieler et al., 2005). Within DSAS, SCRs were calculated along transects extending from baselines at multiple distances from the 1998 shoreline. Baselines were created by buffering the 1998 shoreline and then converting the polygon buffer to a polyline. The polyline was then clipped, and the landward portion of the line was used as the baseline.\nUsing the point-based approach, the SCR of the study area ranged from 21.89 to 1.74 m yr 21 and had an average of 20.24 m yr 21 , with 88% eroding, 2% showing no change (SCR 5 0 m yr 21 ), and 10% accreting (Table 1 and Figure 5A). As shown in the histogram within Figure 6, the SCR distribution was negatively skewed (skewness 5 20.96), with 78% of the points clustering between 0 and 20.5 m yr 21 . Locations with greater erosion rates (more negative SCRs) occurred in the higher fetch areas on the northeast side of Cedar Island and on headland areas, whereas higher SCRs (less erosion and accretion) were located in embayed, sheltered areas ( Figures 5A  and D). Using the transect-based approach (DSAS version 3.0; Thieler et al., 2005), SCRs were calculated and varied depending on the baseline distance used (Table 2). For a 50m baseline, the SCRs ranged from 26.9 m yr 21 to 1.2 m yr 21 with an average of 20.4 m yr 21 . The average SCR using a 200m-baseline distance was similar (20.4 m yr 21 ), but the range was larger (39.5 m yr 21 ) than that determined using a 50-m baseline distance (8.1 m yr 21 )."}, {"section_title": "Controlling Parameters", "text": "Several parameters identified in previous studies considered to affect estuarine erosion were determined at the 1998 shoreline points, including those reflecting wave energy and shoreline composition. To represent wave energy, a relative exposure index (REI) and fetch were calculated using a wave exposure model (WEMo). The WEMo is an ArcGIS tool developed by and available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and has been used as a measure of wave exposure in submerged aquatic vegetation research (Fonseca et al., 2002; see Malhotra and Fonseca, 2007, for a detailed description of WEMo). This numerical model calculates an REI, using directional wind speed, frequency of wind, fetch data, and bathymetry, to evaluate how exposed a site is to wind-generated waves in comparison to any other site. In WEMo, fetch is determined by radiating 32 lines at 11.25u angle increments from the point of interest. The fetch lines are then clipped to the area occupied by the bathymetric dataset to obtain the fetch length. To create a single representative metric of fetch, the 32 fetch lengths are averaged, producing the ''mean fetch'' value at each shoreline point. Fetch, bathymetry, and wind data are used to calculate the REI, a unitless value representing relative exposure. Bathymetry data is extracted from the NOAA Topographic Digital Elevation Model (TDEM) created from North Carolina Federal Emergency Management Agency LIDAR data, Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission data, Figure 2. Flowchart of steps used to calculate parameters in this study. The methodology is derived from a combination of ArcGIS, wave exposure model, and Hawth's Tools. the USGS Digital National Elevation Dataset, National Ocean Service sounding data, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sounding data, Coastal Relief Model data, and digitized NOAA paper nautical charts (Hess et al., 2004). The NOAA TDEM has a 6-m horizontal resolution and 20-cm vertical accuracy (North American Vertical Datum 88). Values less than zero were masked, using the ArcGIS spatial analyst extension, to create a raster dataset of values below sea level. Hourly wind data was obtained from the KHSE weather station, located in Hatteras, North Carolina (35u149 N, 75u379 W; Figure 1), for the fourdecade period . From the wind data, average wind speeds and durations were calculated for the eight major compass-heading directions (Figure 4). Shoreline composition was evaluated by determining the elevation and vegetation at the shoreline points. Shoreline elevation in this study is the elevation of the area surrounding each shoreline point and was determined using the topographic data within the NOAA TDEM. Elevation values greater than zero were masked, using the ArcGIS spatial analyst extension, to generate a raster dataset of land elevation values. The elevation at each point was assigned by determining the average value within a 25-m buffered area using zonal statistics within Hawth's Tools' (Beyer, 2007). Vegetation is a categorical variable that was determined using the 1997 NOAA land-use land-cover (LULC) dataset. This dataset consists of portions of three Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover and subsequent change detection (Dobson et al., 1995). The pixel resolution of the dataset is 30 m. Categories are high-intensity developed, low-intensity developed, cultivated land, grassland, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, scrub/shrub, palustrine forested wetland, palustrine scrub/shrub wetland, palustrine emergent wetland, estuarine forested wetland, estuarine scrub/shrub wetland, estuarine emergent wetland, unconsolidated shore, and bare land. Because shoreline points did not perfectly overlie the LULC data, the nearest value was associated with each shoreline point. This was accomplished by converting the LULC raster dataset to a point shapefile and then using the NEAR tool to determine the LULC type at each shoreline point."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wave Energy", "text": "Comparing the fetch values of the shoreline points for the eight major compass-heading directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW,  W, and NW), the mean northeastern and northern fetches were the largest while the mean western fetch was the lowest (Table 1). The ''mean fetch'' (average of 32 fetch lengths of the individual shoreline points) had a maximum value of 9285 m, with an overall average of 1478 m for the study area ( Figure 5D and Table 1). The majority (95%) of the shoreline points with a mean fetch value greater than 1500 m were eroding. The REI values ranged from 0 to 8387, with an average of 318 (Table 1 and Figure 5C). Most shoreline points (95%) with an REI greater than the average (318) were eroding. "}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Composition", "text": "The mean elevation of shoreline points in the study area was 0.6 m, with a range from 0 to 3.2 m. Half of the shoreline analyzed was at or below a 0.5-m elevation ( Figure 5B), and the majority (90%) of the shoreline points were less than 1 m in elevation. Because the vertical accuracy of the elevation data is 20 cm, the elevation values were binned into 30-cm intervals and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether the mean SCRs located at higher elevation intervals were significantly different from the mean SCRs at lower elevation intervals (Figure 7). A Tukey test performed with 95% confidence in the ANOVA concluded that mean SCRs of elevation intervals greater than 1.2 m (mean SCRs , 20.60 m yr 21 ) were significantly different from mean SCRs of elevation intervals lower than 1.2 m (mean SCRs 5 20.18 to 20.26 m yr 21 ). Of the 16 LULC types within the C-CAP dataset, 13 types were present on the shoreline of the study area: bare land, cultivated land, estuarine emergent wetland, evergreen forest, grassland, high-intensity developed, low-intensity developed, mixed forest, palustrine emergent wetland, palustrine forested wetland, palustrine scrub/shrub wetland, scrub/shrub, and unconsolidated shore. The majority (79%) of the shoreline was composed of estuarine emergent wetland ( Figures 5E and 8). Evergreen forest (7%) and scrub/shrub (5%) were the second and third most abundant LULC types, respectively. Together, the three LULC types covered 91% of the study area shoreline. The average parameter values of the three most abundant LULC types are listed in Table 3. Using an ANOVA (Table 4), it was determined that the average SCR of the evergreen forest (20.40 m yr 21 ) and scrub/shrub (20.39 m yr 21 ) was significantly different from the average SCR of the estuarine emergent wetland (20.22 m yr 21 ) LULC type. A significant difference also was found between average elevations of the estuarine emergent wetland (0.51 m) and the evergreen forest (1.13 m) and scrub/shrub (1.09 m) LULC types. However, average fetch and REI values were not significantly different between LULC types."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Transect versus Point-Based Approach", "text": "Although the transect-based approach is commonly used to calculate shoreline change on ocean beaches and more sheltered coastlines (Morton, Miller, and Moore, 2005;Thieler and Danforth, 1994b;Thieler, O'Connell, and Schupp, 2001), some limitations occur when using it on highly sinuous shorelines. Transects generated using DSAS are also problematic when calculating SCRs along highly sinuous and headland shorelines (Figure 9). For example, Figure 9A displays a morphologically complex area that experienced both spitgrowth accretion and shoreline erosion. In this area, the cuspate formation precludes the creation of the necessary transects to calculate shoreline movement. Highly sinuous areas are problematic using the transect method because transects are generated at varying angles from which highly oblique (i.e., too large) SCRs are calculated. Figure 9B clearly   illustrates how transects spaced 50 m along the baseline have angles that overestimate the SCR values. It is also evident from our investigation that the distance of the baseline is critically important in calculating SCRs. Increasing the baseline distance decreases the number of transects created and therefore decreases the number (i.e., resolution) of SCRs on headland areas, as shown in Figure 9C. Other options are available when using DSAS to calculate SCRs, which include using an offshore or a straight baseline and creating smoothed transects. Creating an offshore or straight baseline may calculate accurate shoreline-change calculations on straight coastlines but would have problems similar to those previously discussed. The option of smoothed transects was not used within this study due to problems with software operation. Experienced users of DSAS may successfully employ this transect-based approach to calculate SCRs in complex areas; however, the trial-and-error process of determining the best application of the transect-based approach is time consuming and somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, the repeatability of the results may be limited. Although the point-base approach is not yet an automated tool, it was found to be a simple, accurate, and efficient way to determine shoreline change over a large area at a high resolution. However, it is not without its limitations. Because the point-based approach determines SCRs using the nearest distance between shorelines, it is a conservative calculation of shoreline change. In addition, since the approach is not yet automated, it is manually executed. If shoreline change is being analyzed along a straight coastline, a transect-based approach may be more time efficient. However, as shown in this study, analysis of the estuarine shoreline benefits from a shorelinechange approach that is more sensitive to the sinuosity and morphologically complex areas, such as the point-base approach."}, {"section_title": "SCRs of Cedar Island, North Carolina", "text": "Previous work conducted on Cedar Island determined SCRs at 21 sites located 1 km apart from 1986 to 1987 and at 20 sites from 1987 through 1988 (Brinson, Bryant, and Jones, 1991). In this work, the average SCR from 1986 to 1987 was 20.47 m yr 21 , which is almost double the SCR determined in this study (20.24 m yr 21 ). However, the average SCR in this study was close to the SCR calculated by Brinson, Bryant, and Jones (1991) during the second year of analysis (20.27 m yr 21 ). Although these data have different spatial extent and resolution, the general agreement between the datasets is encouraging. The variation in the Brinson, Bryant, and Jones (1991) datasets may reflect the short-term variability in SCRs, and the similarity to the long-term rates calculated within this study suggests consistency at different timescales. Through the analysis of 21 sites within the APES, SCRs were calculated by Riggs and Ames (2003); these sites were categorized into various shoreline types, including mainland marsh and low-sediment bank. The mainland marsh consisted of seven sites and had an average SCR of 20.91 m yr 21 , a considerably higher erosion rate than that determined for the estuarine emergent wetland shoreline (20.22 m yr 21 ) in this Figure 8. Histogram and cumulative frequency curve of land-use landcover (LULC) types. The number of shoreline points is indicated in the white and black text corresponding to the bar for each LULC type.

The three most abundant LULC types (estuarine emergent wetland, evergreen forest, and scrub/shrub) compose 91% of the shoreline.  Analyzing Estuarine Shoreline Change study. However, considerable intersite variability in the average SCR was found within their study. For example, the northern side of Swan Quarter, which is described as more sheltered, i.e., having low fetch, has a average SCR of (20.37 m yr 21 ), which is more comparable to our results. The higher rates observed in the APES study by Riggs and Ames (2003) were largely from sites that had been anthropogenically modified or experienced more exposed conditions; only a few sites were located in low fetch areas, which may explain the dramatic difference in mean rates. Also, the mainland marsh SCRs were measured over various periods, ranging from 14 to 42 years. In comparison, similar average SCRs have been calculated on marshes in Rehoboth Bay, Delaware. Swisher (1982) determined an average SCR of 20.23 m yr 21 from aerial photography analysis from 1938 to 1981 on the southern shoreline of Horse Island, consisting of mainland marsh. On a shorter timescale (1995 to 1998), Schwimmer (2001) calculated an average SCR of 20.23 m yr 21 for the same area. Both shortand long-term SCR calculations are comparable to the average SCR for estuarine emergent wetland (20.24 m yr 21 ) calculated in this study."}, {"section_title": "Control of Wave Energy on SCRs", "text": "Wave energy is widely considered to be an important control on shoreline erosion rates. In previous work in Delaware Bay, wave energy flux, calculated from fetch, bathymetry, and wind data, was correlated with shoreline change (Schwimmer, 2001). To test the relationship between wave energy and SCR Figure 9. Location map and three subarea maps where the transect-based and the point-based approaches are compared. The shoreline area that has eroded, accreted, and not changed is represented as red, blue, and taupe, respectively. Shoreline-change rates (SCRs) are represented by transects and points using the same color scheme; therefore, in areas where transects and points do not have the same color, a different range of SCR is calculated. (A) The transect-based approach does not calculate shoreline change that occurred on the migrating spit. (B) Transects created perpendicular to the sinuous shoreline are at dramatic angles, therefore calculating SCRs larger than observed. (C) Baseline distance affects the SCRs calculated using the transect-based approach. As the baseline distance increases, the SCRs calculated decrease due to the decreased number of transects created. along the shoreline, fetch and REI were measured to compare with SCRs. Qualitatively, in certain areas fetch and REI appear to have an obvious control. For example, headlands on the northern shore of the study area are found to have higher erosion than the embayed areas, lying between the headlands ( Figure 5A). This pattern coincides with the general concept of wave refraction, where oncoming wave energy is focused on the headland area and the embayed area between headlands receives a reduced amount of wave energy in comparison. Lower average fetch areas have higher SCRs (less erosive; Figure 10A), whereas higher average fetch values have higher erosion (more negative SCRs; Figure 10B). However, these patterns are not continuous throughout Cedar Island, as shown in Figure 10C, where an area of higher SCRs (little to no erosion) has high average fetch. When the collective dataset is analyzed, the statistical linear relationship between SCR and fetch and REI explained less than 15% of the variation in the data (Figure 11). Similarly, Brinson, Bryant, and Jones (1991) observed no apparent pattern between annual erosion rates (1986)(1987)(1988) and fetch in the same study region. This may be attributed to the method of marsh erosion in the area, a function of undercutting softer sediments below the rhizosphere during low water, leading to slumping of the banks (Brinson, Bryant, and Jones, 1991;Knutson et al., 1981). This occurs during low water driven by offshore winds. High water and waves created along the dominant fetch may be less erosive due to the armoring of marsh shorelines (Goodbred and Hine, 1995;Knutson et al., 1982), leading to a lack of correlation between fetch and SCR."}, {"section_title": "Shoreline Composition Effects on SCRs", "text": "Data in this study indicate SCR may vary qualitatively with elevation of the coastline and among vegetation types, Figure 10. Location map and three subarea maps of mean fetch (triangles) and shoreline-change rate (SCR) values (circles). In some areas, mean fetch and SCRs exhibit the general relationship of (A) low mean fetch on shorelines with little to no erosion and (B) higher mean fetch on shorelines having higher erosion. However, these relationships were not observed throughout the study area. For example, (C) moderate-to-high mean fetch values occur on shorelines that are accreting. suggesting the importance of shoreline composition. Elevation intervals greater than 1.2 m have more negative average SCRs and are significantly different from average SCRs from areas with elevation intervals less than 1.2 m. However, like fetch and REI, the statistical linear relationship explained little (,20%) of the variation in the data (Figure 11) Among the three dominant LULC types (estuarine emergent wetland, evergreen forest, and scrub/shrub), the distribution of elevation shows a similar trend, where the lower-elevation LULC type (estuarine emergent wetland, 0.51 m) is significantly different from the higher-elevation LULC types (evergreen forest and scrub/shrub, each ,1 m) ( Table 3 and Figure 12). These data suggest elevation, shoreline type, or both may be useful in predicting SCRs at these shoreline types. The observed relationships between shoreline composition and SCRs are not surprising. It is known that marshes are difficult to erode due to their cohesive sediments, their binding roots, and the ability of marsh grass to accumulate sediments (Goodbred and Hine, 1995), aiding their ability to vertically accrete through sediment and organic matter accumulation (Craft, Seneca, and Broome, 1993;Nyman, Delaune, and Patrick, 1990;Nyman et al., 2006). Recent work draws closer attention to shoreline composition (i.e., bulk density, water content, percentage of organic matter, and grain size) as a primary control of lateral erosion rate (Feagin et al., 2009). Riggs and Ames (2003) determine a higher SCR (less erosive) for marsh shorelines relative to low-sediment bank shorelines, which are nonmarsh areas with elevations of less than 1.5 m. Similarly, Riggs and Ames (2003) find low-sediment bank shorelines to have a relatively high SCR, comparable to our observations for evergreen forest and scrub/shrub. To summarize, the evergreen forest and scrub/shrub mean SCRs are more negative (more erosional) than the estuarine emergent wetland LULC type (Table 3). This relationship is similar to the SCRs Figure 12. Histograms of elevation (m) for the three most abundant landuse land-cover (LULC) types (estuarine emergent wetland, evergreen forest, and scrub/shrub). The dominant LULC type (estuarine emergent wetland) has a lower mean elevation compared to the evergreen forest and scrub/shrub LULC types. Figure 11. Linear relationship between shoreline-change rate and potential controlling parameters (mean fetch, relative exposure index, and mean elevation). A linear regression (solid line) has been applied, as well as the 95% confidence (long dashed) and prediction (short dashed) intervals. Note the low correlation coefficients for each parameter. exhibited by the mainland marsh and low-sediment bank shorelines in Riggs and Ames (2003). Note, however, that the evergreen forest (20.40 m yr 21 ) and scrub/shrub (20.39 m yr 21 ) mean SCRs on Cedar Island (Table 3) are less negative (less erosional) compared to the low-sediment bank shorelines (20.98 m yr 21 ) analyzed by Riggs and Ames (2003). This may be related to different conditions (e.g., water and nutrients), shoreline characteristics (e.g., lithology or land use), or both. Further research is under way to explore statistical relationships over a larger area of coastal North Carolina. Through the present and previous studies, it is evident that a multiparameter approach is necessary to determine how estuarine shorelines change."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The development and management of coastal areas can benefit from the analysis of shoreline movement with time, including morphologically complex shorelines. A new pointbased approach to calculate shoreline change at high resolution in sinuous and dynamic areas is presented and has been demonstrated to be effective. Using this methodology, the study area is shown to have an average SCR of 20.24 m yr 21 for the 40-year period analyzed . Based on the parameters analyzed, it is evident that shoreline composition (reflected by elevation and vegetation) appears to have an important control on SCRs, potentially more in this environment than wave energy (represented by fetch and a wave exposure index).
