Of these, the most common is Alzheimer disease (AD), which is pathologically diagnosed based on abnormal amyloid and tau pathology but is also highly comorbid with additional pathologic processes. 1, 2 To date, clinical trials that target amyloid and tau have been largely unsuccessful, suggesting that other factors that affect cognition either independently or in concert with amyloid and tau are at play and warrant deeper consideration. 3 CSF levels of \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau 181p ) are two of the most clinically utilized biomarkers of AD [4] [5] [6] and are related to the presence of A\u03b2 plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. 7 Autopsy studies, however, have demonstrated the presence of AD pathologies in the cerebral cortices of individuals who had fully intact cognitive functioning, as well as a lack thereof in individuals who passed away with a clinical diagnosis of AD. 8, 9 There is a strong body of evidence suggestive of a cerebrovascular component to AD. [9] [10] [11] White matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) as seen on MRI are used as a surrogate marker of cerebrovascular damage in vivo 12, 13 and are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. 14, 15 Previous work ranges from suggesting a synergistic role of WMSA and CSF biomarkers on cognition to no relationship between the two. 9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Of note, it is unclear whether WMSA have a prominent role in future cognitive decline and how they are related to CSF biomarkers in this context.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the relationships among WMSA, A\u03b2 42 , and p-tau 181p and their combined effect on cognitive decline. We assessed the ability of these markers to classify clinical diagnoses as well as to predict longitudinal changes in cognition.

Along with these new insights, our results confirm much of what is already known regarding the clinicalpathologic mismatch seen in AD diagnosis. The results of our classification experiments reflect real-world clinical misdiagnosis rates of AD that have been reported to be as high as 25% in the literature. 8, 42 Based on previous studies of WMSA and cognitive decline, we hypothesized that WMSA would hold predictive power for changes in continuous cognition measurements. 25, 43 Across all patients, regardless of diagnosis, WMSA showed a strong relationship with a 1-year change in EF but they were not a robust predictor of memory decline. Particularly in the individuals whose cognitive profiles do not match their CSF pathologic profiles (e.g., individuals with impairment in Q3), however, we demonstrate that WMSA provide added information that is predictive of future cognitive decline in both memory and executive functioning domains. Our findings combined with others' suggest that other factors must be at play for the manifestation of AD-like symptoms, and that as the burden of classic AD pathologies increases, the impact of WMSA on cognitive function decreases. This also suggests, however, that WMSA are most important when classic AD pathologies are low and that WMSA may be critically linked to AD conversion, a concept supported by the previous works of others. 9, 28, 44 To this end, our findings suggest that therapeutic studies focused on the periconversion period of the disease process may be most vulnerable to WMSA influence.\nReflective of the accuracy levels that were revealed by our classification experiments, 25% of individuals with an AD diagnosis fell into the biomarker quadrant whose p-tau 181p and A\u03b2 42 levels were in a normal clinical range (Q3).\nSimilarly, 34% of individuals with MCI fell into this quadrant. These individuals presented an opportunity for deeper study and possible discovery of novel biomarkers to explain their cognitive symptoms. In these individuals, WMSA were the strongest predictor of a 1-year change in memory when assessed against the CSF biomarkers, and were the only predictor of a 1-year change in executive function. Because all of the individuals with MCI-C in this study converted to AD within 3 years of the time that CSF measurements were taken, our findings suggest that this 3-year time window is not a sensitive period for A\u03b2 42 and p-tau 181p in the CSF, and this is supported by the work of others. 5 These findings are particularly important in the context of choosing participants for clinical trials in which therapeutics are aimed at classic AD pathologies, as it is more likely that WMSA or a related process is the primary cause of the cognitive clinical presentation in individuals similar to those in Q3 of our study. Two interesting findings that add to the complexity of the current picture are the lack of difference in hippocampal volumes of individuals with impairment in Q1 and Q3, and the increase in APOE e4 prevalence in Q1 individuals with impairment over Q3. While hippocampal atrophy is typically considered to be a hallmark biomarker of AD, it is also associated with other unrelated neurodegenerative conditions such as hippocampal sclerosis, and it is possible that the individuals with impairment in Q3 reflect this process. It is also possible, however, that this AD-like hippocampal atrophy is due to the same upstream process in all individuals with impairment, but that the cognitive symptom manifestation necessary for a clinical AD diagnosis requires a second hit. 45 Under this hypothesis, the second hit could be the development of tau and amyloid pathologies or it could be a cerebrovascular process such as those that lead to WMSA. The low prevalence of APOE e4 in the Q3 individuals with impairment further suggests that these individuals are protected from the development of classic AD pathologies. Such complexities between and misalignments of pathologic and cognitive presentations may be explained by the notion of cognitive reserve 18, 46, 47 and warrants future study into whether there are common risk factors among individuals in each given quadrant that may explain their susceptibility to a unique manifestation of pathologic findings. For example, there may be particular aspects of cognitive reserve (e.g., level of education) that protect an individual from the development of classic AD pathologies, and if there are other aspects of cognitive reserve that protect an individual from the development of WMSA, then the combination of these protective mechanisms may lower an individual's risk of cognitive decline and development of AD altogether.\nTaken together, we interpret our results to suggest the following. Individuals with impairment in Q1 embody the classic AD pathologic profile with high levels of CSF p-tau 181p , low CSF A\u03b2 42 , and prevalent APOE e4. These pathologies are the main drivers of memory loss leading to a clinical AD diagnosis in Q1. In these individuals, tau and amyloid have a saturating effect on memory loss and WMSA do not further contribute to impairment. In the Q3 individuals with impairment who lack classic CSF biomarkers, however, WMSA are the dominating pathology that drives memory loss, and their effect can be appreciated in the absence of p-tau 181p and A\u03b2 42 saturation. This is further supported by the finding that Q3 individuals with impairment have a greater WMSA burden than those in Q1, which would presumably have a greater effect on memory. Across all individuals and within quadrants, WMSA demonstrate a longitudinal relationship with executive function. This has been reported in other studies as well, 48, 49 and perhaps reflects a robust and general association between WMSA and cognitive function that exists even in the presence of other strong neurodegenerative pathologies.\nThe results presented in this work hold clinical utility in understanding patients who present with AD-like cognitive symptoms but do not have remarkable CSF biomarker profiles. The more immediate value of this work, however, may relate to the researchers who study AD and conduct clinical trials for therapeutic interventions in that it demonstrates an important role of white matter disease in AD. The results of this work suggest that the combined relationship between WMSA and CSF biomarkers of AD should be assessed when designing novel therapeutic interventions. In addition, this work may aid in the task of screening individuals for enrollment in specific clinical trials, which is a current challenge as the relationships between complex biomarker profiles and future cognitive decline are not well understood. Future work should address the more immediate clinical utility of such results by aiming to create disease-related thresholds of white matter disease in the context of other pathologies and risk factors for clinical assessment."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "Emily Lindemer: study concept and design, analysis and interpretation.
