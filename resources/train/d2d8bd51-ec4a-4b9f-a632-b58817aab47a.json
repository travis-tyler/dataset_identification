[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. On 11th\nMarch 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (1) . Since then, an estimated 50 million people have been infected of whom up to 2.5% have died (2) . A number of studies have assessed nasal and oropharyngeal viral load data from longitudinally sampled SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Their findings reveal wide variations in viral load at presentation (3- 6) . However, milder disease and clinical recovery are associated with lower and declining viral load respectively, pointing to its potential use as a biomarker for antiviral drug response.\nRemdesivir, an RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, has been shown in one large randomised clinical trial (RCT) to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, although another large study, showed no clinical benefit and smaller studies have shown limited or no impact on clinical recovery (3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Where clinical trial data are lacking or contradictory we have previously used deep pathogen sequencing, mutational analysis and evolutionary modelling to gain insight into the impact of repurposed drugs, including RdRp inhibitors similar to remdesivir, on serious respiratory RNA viral infections in hospitalised patients (12, 13) . These studies have revealed drug-related mutational signatures, evidence of viral compartmentalisation in the lung and previously unrecognised synergy between combination therapies associated with changes in viral loads and improved clinical outcomes. Here we report the application of similar methods in a personalised-medicine-approach to investigating the impact of remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 within an individual and to evaluate potential biomarkers that can be used to monitor clinical efficacy. The data provide further insights into fundamental questions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and co-infection."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Patients", "text": "We analysed nine hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 positive paediatric cases with a mean age at time of infection of 4.7 years old (range 0-14 years old), who were repeatedly sampled during the course of their SARS-CoV-2 infection. A summary of their clinical features is shown in Table   1 . Five patients had pre-existing co-morbidities associated with primary or secondary immunodeficiency ( Table 1) (Table 1 ). Figure 1 shows the viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (ct) values for all nine patients for forty days following their first positive nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) available to us. Viral RNA was measured in NPAs for all patients and/or upper airway secretions for those who were intubated (patients A, D, G, and H). Patients A also had a Bronchoalveolar lavage. In agreement with earlier studies (14) , the ct values showed considerable day-to-day variation of between 0.16 and 14.4 cycle numbers (median 5.5 cycle numbers). Viral RNA continued to be detectable for 7 to over 50 days (median 16 days) following the first positive sample (supplementary figure 2) . Of the three patients who received remdesivir, only patient D had total suppression of viral RNA during treatment followed by rebound of virus after treatment cessation (figure 1). The four ICU patients were clinically most unwell, requiring assisted ventilation. All three remdesivir-treated patients showed clinical improvement after starting the drug, associated with falls in temperature (all) and inflammatory markers (A and G) (supplementary figure 3). All three were weaned from conventional ventilation before the treatment course was completed with decreases in oxygen requirements."}, {"section_title": "Viral load trajectories by cycle threshold and clinical markers of infection", "text": "In patient D, a significant reversal of respiratory deterioration was noted once remdesivir was started; inhaled nitric oxide was stopped within 96 hours coincident with weaning from high frequency oscillatory to conventional ventilation. Patient D, who alone required inotropic support, achieved haemodynamic stability off inotropes within 5 days of starting remdesivir."}, {"section_title": "Inter and intra-host phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "To investigate the possibility of remdesivir resistance in patients A and G, neither of whose viral RNA was suppressed by remdesivir treatment (figure 1), and in patient D whose virus rebounded following cessation of treatment, we deep sequenced all samples as well as those from untreated patients for comparison. The sequencing metrics for the samples are summarised in Supplementary Table 1 . Relative to their first available sample, there were nine polymorphisms identified in viruses from patients A, H and I of which five were nonsynonymous with four in the ORF1ab (nsps 1,3,4,5) and one in the Spike protein, S2 subdomain (supplementary table 2 ). This latter mutation P812L in patient I is located in a Tcell epitope (15). None of the identified SNPs were sites identified as common homoplasies or those known to be susceptible to Illumina sequencing error, none have been associated with of ORF1ab (18, 23, 24) . Nsp5 has been shown to mediate the maturation of nsps downstream which is an essential part of the viral lifecycle (23); this has made it a desirable target for antiviral drug production (25,26). However, the nsp5 mutation P241L observed in patient A was not found to be in an active site. Virus from patient D, which rebounded following cessation of remdesivir treatment, was genetically identical to pre-treatment virus.\nPatients H and I who did not receive remdesivir, also had consensus level sequence changes (supplementary table 2 ). Only one of four mutations for patient H was non-synonymous and this was in nsp3 (a papain-like protease) in ORF1ab. Two of three mutations in patient I were non-synonymous, one in nsp1 (responsible for cellular mRNA degradation and inhibition of interferon signalling) in ORF1ab and the other upstream of the furin cleavage site and the S2' cleavage site in the spike protein (27,28). This Spike mutation although not predicted to alter structure, does lie within a known CD4 epitope although it is not known whether it would abrogate T cell binding (supplementary figure 4) was identical to all other sequences from this patient. We observed changes in the consensus sequences between different samples from patients A, H and I. Sequences A at time point 6, 7, and 8 were identical to those of samples sequenced from patient D as depicted in Figure 2 A.\nNo evidence of laboratory contamination to explain the identity between A and D sequences was found, with samples from these patients being sequenced in separate batches on separate days. mutagenic effect is associated with loss of infectivity and with an effective clinical response (29). In vitro studies have not shown lethal mutagenesis to be a feature of remdesivir (30, 31) .\nHowever, to exclude non-lethal mutagenesis as a possible explanation for continuing high viral RNAs despite remdesivir treatment, we compared the mutational burden and patterns of transitions and transversions in treated and untreated patients. In accordance with current understanding of its mode of action, we found neither an increased mutational burden in remdesivir-treated patients nor any evidence of associated mutational signature (supplementary figure 5 and supplementary figure 6 ). We found no evidence that the proportion of transitions and transversions distribution of mutation was dependent on the treatment (Fisher t-test, p=0.13)."}, {"section_title": "Measurement of subgenomic RNA", "text": "To determine whether, despite stable viral ct values, remdesivir treatment may have inhibited viral replication we analysed subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) detected by the genome sequencing using the program Periscope (32) . sgRNA derives from negative stranded RNA intermediates generated during SARS-CoV-2 replication (33, 34) . SARS-CoV-2 elaborates ten canonical transcripts, although ORF 10 sgRNA has never been detected (32, (35) (36) (37) . To optimise recovery, we excluded genomes with <90% coverage and <100 mean read depth (MRD).\nStacked bar-plots of the frequency of sgRNA reads per 100,000 mapped reads (sgRPHT) for each gene and corresponding ct values for each patient are compared in figure 3A . Unlike previous reports, no correlation was found between sgRPHT and ct-values (supplementary figure 7A) (35) . We have excluded patient D from the comparative analysis below as their virus was suppressed below the limit of detection during remdesivir treatment, which does not permit us to measure sgRPHT by the current technique. sgRNA levels in samples taken during remdesivir treatment for patients A and G were lower than in samples off treatment (Mann-All rights reserved.

As proof of concept we reconstructed haplotypes for four of the sequences, each of which had optimal MVA distribution (as detailed in the methods) for HaROLD analysis. We found between two and three closely related haplotypes for each patient clustered by patient as described for samples A, B, H, and I (supplementary figure 10) . As was the case for A, H and I, only one haplotype per patient was represented among freely circulating viruses in global sequence alignment provided by COG-UK, reinforcing the likelihood that the variant genotypes had arisen within each host.\nA possible exception to this conclusion was patient A. It is conceivable that haplotype Hap1_A, which is identical to the viral sequence from patient D, could have resulted from superinfection.\nPatients A and D were co-located in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Supplementary Figure 1 ).\nHaplotype Hap1_A was not identified in the sample taken from patient A before their transfer to the ICU but was detected approximately 28 hours later in a sample taken two hours before starting remdesivir (Figure 4 B) . Were superinfection the explanation, the appearance of Hap2_A could be explained either by recombination between Hap3_A and Hap1_D following transfer of patient A to the ICU or by within-host mutation of Hap 3_A. However, no other healthcare associated transmissions were reported in the ICU and local epidemiological investigation made it unlikely. Moreover, in view of the rapid appearance of Hap1_A following transfer to ICU and the variation in haplotype frequencies over time, it is perhaps more probable that Hap1_A and 2_A were present in the patient's first sample but not detected. This would support within host evolution of these three closely related strains, for one of which, Hap3_A, there is no evidence of circulation in the population.\nAll rights reserved.

While several drugs with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, only remdesivir has shown any clinical promise (10) . However, reports of its efficacy are mixed (3, [7] [8] [9] 11) and only one other report of it having an effect on viral replication in vivo has been described (46) . We show evidence of clinical improvement in all three patients whilst on remdesivir. In patient D clinical improvement was associated with a fall in viral RNA levels within two days of starting remdesivir. Viral RNA remained undetectable until treatment was stopped, when it again rose.\nIn patient A no change in viral RNA levels occurred during remdesivir treatment, however, SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA levels appear to have been reduced, increasing again following cessation of treatment (figure 4). sgRNA levels have been shown to have a weak association with viral replication in in vitro culture (47) , however the extent to which sgRNA levels, mainly of the E gene which are most often measured, reflect viable virus better than viral RNA remains controversial (35) . Overall, for samples obtained during remdesivir therapy we observe lower perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted November 20, 2020. ; of virus from upper respiratory samples is decreased and clinical scores are improved, despite no change in viral RNA levels (48). The possibility that sgRNA, may, together with viral load, provide a biomarker of response to remdesivir should now be explored.\nWe have previously used deep sequencing and evolutionary modelling of influenza and norovirus genomes to gain insight into the in vivo action and efficacy of ribavirin and favipiravir, drugs with similar modes of action to remdesivir (13, 29) . Using a similar approach, we show considerable variation in the consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from four of the nine patients, which appears unrelated to remdesivir treatment. The heterogeneity is explained by the presence of between 2-4 stable viral haplotypes that vary in abundance "}, {"section_title": "Tissue compartmentalisation is well described for other inflammatory lung infections including", "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and influenza and has been associated with uneven drug penetration, leading to poor resolution of infection and predisposing to drug resistance (29,50,51).

In patient A, the persistence of different viral populations at variable frequencies including in bronchoalveolar lavage material supports the presence of viral compartmentalisation. Other patients may also have had tissue compartmentalisation but, in the absence of distinct viral populations, this could not be detected. Another possibility is that the effective remdesivir dose was too low, for example in patient G who was obese (table 1) or that duration of treatment too short, as in patients A and High fidelity deep sequencing of multiple samples from the same patient together with computational methods that discard poorly supported MVAs minimised the contribution of artefact for the interpretation of within-host diversity in our sample set (17, 38) . Many of the persistent MVAs were present in early samples. As seen in other RNA viruses MVAs in SARS-CoV-2 may be more common in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted November 20, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.18.20230599 doi: medRxiv preprint haplotypes found within our patients, making it possible that the latter were in fact independent strains that were too rare to have been previously sampled. Such strains would have to have been acquired through co-transmission or superinfection. Although this is possible for patient A, on balance the data do not support this. Another possibility is that mixed haplotypes represent co-transmission of different strains (56) . To explore the likelihood of this scenario, we used a large, independent and well curated data set of 318 geographically co-located SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We show that sequences that were phylogenetically closer did not share more MVAs (supplementary figure 10) , suggesting the co-transmission of infections is unlikely. The result was not changed by excluding strains sharing single MVAs which are the most likely to be artefact. Analysis of four randomly chosen samples with multiple well supported MVAs at levels of 15-85% (optimal for haplotype reconstruction), generated identical findings to those of our patients, namely sister taxa within hosts with only one viral sequence per patient found among freely circulating lineages. We conclude that early withinhost evolution most logically explains the diversity seen in patients A, B, H, and I. Within evolution of stable viral haplotypes (clones) is well described for norovirus and influenza in immunocompromised patients (57, 58) Patients B, H and I were known to be immunocompromised, while Patient A remains under investigation for immune dysfunction.\nIn contrast none of the four adult patients with mixed haplotypes from the independent cohort, were classified as immunocompromised (data not shown). More extensive analysis to understand better the frequency with which within-host variants evolve, why they arise in some patients and not others and whether there are any correlations with underlying clinical condition or outcomes is ongoing.\nA major caveat to our findings is that our cohort is paediatric, for which both the clinical picture and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections are known to differ from adults.

Moreover, both clinical and viral sequence data from the use of repurposed drugs to treat other severe RNA viral infections has shown similarities in adults and children (12, 50, 55) . Larger studies using deep clinical and viral profiling of multiple samples from adult patients treated with remdesivir alone and in combination would provide better insight.\nIn summary, we show that treatment with remdesivir is capable of reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral and subgenomic RNA in vivo and demonstrate that the latter, in particular, needs further investigation as a potential biomarker for monitoring antiviral therapy. Our data suggest that heterogeneous response to remdesivir is likely in many cases to be due to non-viral factors including, potentially, inadequate dosing and duration of treatment. The patterns of SARS-CoV-2 within-host genetic heterogeneity uncovered by deep sequencing may be most parsimoniously explained by viral compartmentalisation within lung-tissue, a factor that is already known to impede drug penetration in patients with other lung infections. This may compound inherently poor remdesivir tissue penetration and rapid clearance of active metabolites in those with normal renal function. We and others have shown that where compartmentalisation occurs in influenza (29) and M. tuberculosis (50), combination therapies improve outcomes. Based on our experience of using similar drugs for the treatment of serious RNA viral infections, we propose that a more personalised medicine approach combining in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic measurements, viral RNA and sgRNA profiling together with viral evolutionary modelling is likely to yield important insights into the optimal use of remdesivir both alone and in combination for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our data point to the presence of mixed genotypes in a subset of patients, which are most likely explained by within-host evolution rather than co-transmission.\nAll rights reserved.
