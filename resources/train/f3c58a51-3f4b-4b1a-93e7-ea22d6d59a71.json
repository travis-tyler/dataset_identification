[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "[1] The spatial and temporal variations of oceanic new primary production have a crucial importance for the study of biogeochemical fluxes in the ocean; however, they have been poorly documented. In this paper, we propose a revision of the ''shift-up'' new production model developed for upwelling areas by , and later adapted by Kudela and Dugdale (1996) , using ocean color and sea surface temperature satellite data as inputs. The major improvement of the model is that the estimation of nitrogen uptake rates takes into account the phytoplankton community size structure, estimated for each pixel using the method of Uitz et al. (2006) . Appropriate physiological parameters are then used for each size class. This revised model has been applied to Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer data acquired over the year 2003, using the Benguela upwelling area as a test site. The combination of the new production model with a total production model allows the seasonal variations of new and total productions (including the respective contributions of the three size classes) to be estimated and compared. Even though microphytoplankton are generally considered to be responsible for new production, our results show that the contribution of small cells should not be overlooked in the upwelling-affected areas.\nCitation: Sili\u00f3-Calzada, A., A.

While synoptic views of algal biomass and oceanic primary production, generated by combining satellite data and light-photosynthesis models [e.g., Behrenfeld et al., 2001] , have become available both at the global and regional scales, the spatial-temporal variations of new production are much less documented. New production has been defined as the fraction of primary production which is supported by nitrogen imported from outside the euphotic zone [Dugdale and Goering, 1967] . This fraction of primary production has a crucial importance for the study of biogeochemical fluxes as, in a steady state system, it is usually considered to correspond to the flux of organic matter exported out of the euphotic zone [Eppley and Peterson, 1979; Sarmiento and Siegenthaler, 1992] . The major part of new production is nitrate-based production, even if other sources (e.g., atmospheric nitrogen fixation) can contribute to this new production [Dugdale and Goering, 1967; Dugdale et al., 1990; Flynn and Fasham, 1997] .\n[3] The first model for deriving oceanic new production from satellite data was proposed by , and applied to CZCS (chlorophyll and sea surface temperature) data for the Mauritanian upwelling area. The basic assumptions of this model were that (1) the nitrate (NO 3 ) surface concentration can be derived from sea surface temperature (SST), and (2) the phytoplanktonic nitrate uptake rate is both nutrient-dependent and time-dependent, owing to the inhibitory increasing presence of ammonium during upwelling development. The operation of the model was limited at that time by the insufficient acquisition frequency of CZCS, and by the fact that thermal CZCS data were available only in relative (uncalibrated) values. This model was later adapted by Kudela and Dugdale [1996] and Kudela and Chavez [2000] , and applied to SeaWiFS and AVHRR data from the coastal upwelling region off California [Kudela and Chavez, 2002] . Simpler models were also tested in other areas, such as the Georges Bank region off Massachusetts [Sathyendranath et al., 1991] or the North Pacific Ocean [Goes et al., 2000] . The spatial-temporal variations of new production remain, however, largely unknown in most areas.\n[4] The present availability of multisensor data, such as those acquired by the ENVISAT platform, allows new production models to now be applied in better conditions, with quasi-simultaneous ocean color and SST data as inputs. In parallel, some progress has been made in the knowledge of the kinetics of nitrate uptake by phytoplankton, and its variability both with environmental factors and with phytoplankton size structure [e.g., Stolte et al., 1994; Carr, 1998; Collos et al., 2005; Irwin et al., 2006] . Finally, large in situ data sets have become available during the last decade (e.g., the World Ocean Database [Stephens et al., 2002; Boyer et al., 2006] ), allowing some empirical relationships involved in the models (e.g., the nitrate-SST relationships) to be better documented, and adapted to the study areas. Advances in these various aspects open the way to an update and revision of the new production model.\n[5] Recently, the estimates of total primary production have also been refined, by taking into account the variations of photophysiological parameters among phytoplankton size classes, and partitioning total production into the contributions of three size classes, pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton [Uitz, 2006; Uitz et al., 2008] . The developed procedure thus provides the fraction of total primary production attributable to microphytoplankton, defined as the fraction of phytoplankton larger than 20 mm. As new production is generally attributed to this size class [Michaels and Silver, 1988; Goldman, 1993] , comparing the estimates of new production and microphytoplankton production should provide information on the validity and consistency of these models, which are based on independent approaches.\n[6] The Benguela region (14\u00b0S-36\u00b0S, $10\u00b0E-22\u00b0E) off the southwest coast of Africa is one of the four major coastal upwelling regions of the world oceans, and has been found to be the most productive, with a potential production of 0.37 Gt C a \u00c01 [Carr, 2002] . Therefore, this region represents an ideal test site for the analysis of spatialtemporal variations of algal biomass and primary production in highly dynamic upwelling areas.\n[7] The objectives of this paper are (1) to propose a revised version of the new production model proposed by and Kudela and Chavez [2000] , taking into account the phytoplankton size structure; (2) to apply this model to the Benguela upwelling area as a test site, so as to derive the spatial variations of new production in this area along 1 year (2003) , and its repartition among the three phytoplankton size classes; and (3) to compare the estimates of new and total primary production, along the same year.\n[8] Because of the data limitation due to cloud cover, monthly satellite images were used in this study. It is acknowledged that this temporal resolution is insufficient to resolve the actual physical and biogeochemical variability of the Benguela system, which typically has a 3-to 6-day period, due to the frequency of upwelling favorable winds (see below). Therefore, the seasonal variability of the system is presented in this study only as a test of the method, as the actual variability is largely undersampled. As an example, satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations in the inshore area may present standard deviations between 1 and 55% in summer, and from 5 to 80% in winter."}, {"section_title": "Data and Models", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "[9] The area selected for this study covers most of the Benguela system, from 15\u00b0S to 35\u00b0S, and from 10\u00b0E to 20\u00b0E (Figure 1 ). Physical and dynamical features of the Benguela system have been described in detail in several reviews [Nelson and Hutchings, 1983; Shannon, 1985; Shannon and Nelson, 1996; Shillington, 1998; Strub et al., 1998] , and therefore only a brief summary is provided here. The Benguela system is physically dominated by a surface current flowing equatorward from its southern border at approximately 35\u00b0S (although occasionally it stretches farther south to Cape Agulhas), alongshore Namibia, to a position varying between 14\u00b0S and 17\u00b0S off Angola [Lutjeharms and Meeuwis, 1987; Shannon et al., 1987; Field and Shillington, 2004] . The cool Benguela Current is bounded by two warm currents, the Angola Current at the northern end and the Agulhas Current at the southern end. The combined equatorward Benguela Current and the southeast trade winds result in upwelling of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water along the west coast of southern Africa (14\u00b0S-36\u00b0S). The extent and intensity of the coastal upwelling is mostly determined by the wind and pressure fields that, together with topographic features and the orientation of the coast, are responsible for the formation of a number of upwelling cells [Lutjeharms and Meeuwis, 1987; Shannon and Nelson, 1996; Shannon and O'Toole, 1999] . The dominant physical forcing mechanism of the Benguela upwelling region is the SE Atlantic high-pressure anticyclone. Seasonal shifts in its position are responsible for the temporal variability of the upwelling-favorable winds. This seasonality is most evident in the southern Benguela region, south of 30\u00b0S, where very little upwelling takes place during austral winter (June-August), a period when the South Atlantic anticyclone presents its northernmost position. Upwelling in the northern Benguela region, north of 25\u00b0S, although mostly perennial, shows a pronounced maximum from April to November, whereas the central (25\u00b0S-30\u00b0S) and northern bounds of the system are unaffected by upwelling relaxation [Boyd, 1987; Shannon and Nelson, 1996] .\n[10] As stated in previous studies [Shannon, 1985; Shannon and O'Toole, 1999; Mackas et al., 2005] , the Benguela upwelling system presents four major levels of temporal variability affecting the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of the area: diurnal, daily to weekly (typically 3 -6 days), seasonal and interannual, all of which are highly influenced by the pulsed nature of the upwellingfavorable winds. In the present study, owing to satellite data constraints, only a rough view of the seasonal variability is obtained."}, {"section_title": "Data 2.2.1. In Situ Data", "text": "[11] The estimation of surface nitrate concentrations in the upwelling system is based on empirical relationships using both SST and chlorophyll a surface concentrations (section 2.4.1; for more details see Sili\u00f3-Calzada et al. [2008] ). In situ data from the study area were used in the development of such algorithms. The in situ measurements were provided by the ''World Ocean Database 2005'' (WOD05) of the NOAA-NESDIS-National Oceanographic Data Center [Boyer et al., 2006] , which includes vertical profiles of water temperature, salinity, nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations collected in the Benguela system. The procedures for data quality control and data fusion are described at the address: http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/ WOD05/docwod05.html."}, {"section_title": "Satellite Data", "text": "[12] The new production model requires sea-surface temperatures (SST) and chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a), derived from satellite data, while the total production model requires SST, Chl a, and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) values. For these various inputs monthly averages were used, as weekly averages generally suffered from insufficient coverage of the studied area, due to cloud cover. As stated before, this results in an inevitable undersampling of the short-term variability of the system, and the perception of its dynamics will be biased.\n[13] As many as 1278 level 2 AATSR daily images were used for the computation of SST monthly averages for the year 2003. Only images from ascending passes (nighttime) were used in order to avoid daylight heating. During daytime, solar heating may lead to the formation of a very thin warm layer, particularly in regions with low wind speeds. Since SST signals originate from this layer, this diurnal warming effect strongly influences the measurements, and result in notable differences between daytime and nighttime measurements. Nevertheless night measurements may be also affected by warming, owing to the early time at which the satellite passes at night over the Benguela region (between 1900 and 2300 local time). The error (resulting from the limited time for the water cooling between the sunset and the satellite pass) is likely variable with the season. This possible bias should be kept in mind when considering the seasonal trends in SST. Monthly averages (''maximum likelihood'' [Campbell et al., 1995] ) of SST were computed with a 4 km spatial resolution, as a compromise between the high spatial variability of the area and the data limitation due to cloud cover.\n[14] Chl a concentrations were obtained via the ESA GRID Processing on Demand service, that generated upon request monthly estimates from the standard Level 2 MERIS ''algal 1'' daily images. Such monthly estimates were calculated after discarding the pixels affected by sun induced glint (high and medium glint), white scatterers (whitecaps and coccolithophores), and dust and aerosol anomalies, using the appropriate flags. Case 2 pixels were also identified, and were essentially confined around the outlet of the Orange River. The corresponding pixels were also discarded. As for SST, monthly maximum likelihood averaged composites of Chl a were computed with a 4 km spatial resolution.\n[15] Monthly estimates of PAR, derived from 9.3 km SeaWiFS Level 3 data, were provided by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Distributed Active Archive Center. These monthly estimates are derived from daily PAR images, obtained by the use of the algorithm proposed by Frouin et al. [2003] . These data were then regridded to be spatially consistent with SST and Chl a 4 km data using a customized program."}, {"section_title": "Total Primary Production Model: A Size-Class Approach", "text": "[16] To quantify the spatial-temporal variations in total primary production of the Benguela system, a light-photosynthesis model [Morel, 1991] , adapted to satellite data , was used. This model accounts for the absorption of radiant energy and its subsequent transformation into photosynthetic assimilate, expressed as mass of organic carbon fixed per unit of time and volume, P, based on chlorophyll content, Chl, chlorophyll-specific absorption, a*, photosynthetically available radiation, PAR, and quantum yield for carbon fixation, f m ,:\n[17] In the original model, estimates of total primary production are based on the chlorophyll a content for the whole water column (actually the layer comprised between the surface and 1.5 times the bottom limit of the euphotic zone), derived from surface chlorophyll measurements. Satellite-derived estimates of surface chlorophyll concentration are used for determining the vertical pigment profile, based on the estimation of the euphotic-to-mixed-layerdepth ratio [Morel and Berthon, 1989] . In the present study, the estimation of primary production was limited to the surface layer, in accordance with the new primary production estimations which are based on surface-oriented, and not column-integrated, algorithms (see section 2.4). The reason for this limitation resides in the difficulty of reconstructing nitrate concentration profiles in the water column within highly dynamic areas, characterized by a succession of upwelling cells and quiescent zones. The model was then adapted to run on a pixel-by-pixel basis (instead of using look-up tables, as in work by ), and for the surface layer only.\n[18] In the standard version of the model, mean photophysiological parameters are applied regardless of the trophic state of the system (note however that the assimilation number is made temperature-dependent [Morel, 1991] ). This constitutes a major source of uncertainty, as these photophysiological parameters (chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients a*, maximum quantum yield for carbon fixation f mmax , assimilation number P Bmax ) may vary significantly according to the trophic state and the algal populations present [e.g., Babin et al., 1996] . In the current study, the relative contributions of three phytoplanktonic size classes, microphytoplankton (20 -200 mm), nanophytoplankton (2 -20 mm), and picophytoplankton (0.2 -2 mm), to total biomass were derived for each pixel from the surface chlorophyll a concentration, using the method developed by Uitz et al. [2006] . This method requires the identification of the trophic state of the water column corresponding to each pixel. This identification is performed using the euphotic-to-mixed-layer-depth ratio, derived from estimates of the euphotic depth [Morel and Berthon, 1989] and the mixed layer depth (monthly climatologies from de Boyer-Mont\u00e9gut et al. [2004] ). Independent estimates of primary production were then calculated for each size class, with appropriate photophysiological parameters, as described by Uitz [2006] and Uitz et al. [2008] (Table 1) . Essentially, these phytoplankton classspecific parameters were obtained from the statistical analysis of a large database comprising HPLC-determined pigment concentrations, algal specific absorption coefficients, and photosynthesis-irradiance curve parameters, collected in various tropical and temperate open ocean regions. The range of variation in these parameters may reach a factor of 1.5 for P Bmax , or 18 for f mmax, for example, from microphytoplankton to picophytoplankton. Total primary production was then estimated as the sum of the contributions of each phytoplanktonic size class. A similar approach was used for the new primary production estimates (see section 2.4)."}, {"section_title": "New Production Model: A Revised Version Taking Into Account the Phytoplankton Community Structure", "text": "[19] New primary production is generally estimated as the result of nitrate uptake by phytoplankton, with a smaller contribution from atmospheric nitrogen fixation. In our study, only nitrate uptake is considered in the estimation of new primary production. The model that we have used as a basis was first developed by , and later adapted by Kudela and Dugdale [1996] and Kudela and Chavez [2000] . This model was previously referred to in literature as the ''shift-up'' model. The ''shift-up'' hypothesis Dugdale et al., 1990; Kudela and Dugdale, 1996; Kudela and Chavez, 2000] states that phytoplankton at depth are initially in a low-light, high-nutrient environment. The vertical upwelling flux of water to the surface imposes a physiological adaptation due to the high-light exposure; while environmental changes associated with upwelling processes initially stimulate carbon fixation, phytoplankton are not yet adapted to fully consume the available nitrogen. In terms of nitrate uptake, the adaptation process starts with low uptake values that will progressively increase (''shift up'') until the increasing presence of ammonium causes a preferential selection against nitrate uptake, leading to a ''shift down,'' or deceleration in the nitrate depletion. Wilkerson and Dugdale [1987] and Zimmerman et al. [1987] showed that the acceleration at which nitrate is consumed is not constant, but dependent on the initial nitrate concentration in the upwelling center. The time and nutrient dependency of new primary production may then be explained by these assumptions.\n[20] New primary production (i.e., the nitrogen assimilation rate per unit volume of seawater, r NO3 , in mg-at N m \u00c03 h"}, {"section_title": "\u00c01", "text": ") can be analytically expressed as the product of the specific rate of nitrate uptake (V m , in h \u00c01 ) and the biomass present in the area, expressed in the form of particulate organic nitrogen (PON, in mg-at N m \u00c03 ) . Kudela and Chavez [2000] modified this expression by including the length of daylight (D, in h), as a limitation factor,\n[21] Daylight limitation was included according to the analysis performed by Glibert and Garside [1992] and Kudela et al. [1997] , among others. These studies showed that nitrate uptake in the dark is less efficient, as it requires more energy during the absence of light. This is not the case for ammonium, which can be assimilated similarly in both dark and light [Kudela et al., 1997; Mulholland et al., 1999] . The day length D is derived from the year day and latitude [see, e.g., Kirk, 1994] .\n[22] Despite the known variability in the organic carbonto-organic nitrogen ratio, we have adopted the approach, according to which particulate organic nitrogen (PON) is obtained from the conversion of satellitederived chlorophyll surface concentration. Unlike who used a general relationship (derived from in situ data in the Mauritanian upwelling), and Kudela and Chavez [2000] who used a constant PON:Chl ratio (1 mg-at N (mg Chl)\n\u00c01 [Eppley et al., 1992] in the Equatorial Pacific, we derived PON versus Chl relationships specific to phytoplankton size classes. The in situ data collected in the Benguela southern system by Probyn et al. [1990] were used for establishing the following empirical relationships (Figure 2 where PON is in mg-at N m \u00c03 and Chl is in mg m \u00c03 . Figure 2 shows that the PON versus Chl a relationships differ notably between phytoplankton size classes, especially at low (<0.5 mg m\n, as in work by and Kudela and Chavez [2000] .\n[26] The V max 0 term represents the calculated potential maximum uptake rate, assuming a complete physiological shift-up. It was expressed by Kudela and Chavez [2000] as\nwhere V 0 (in h\n) is the initial biomass-specific uptake rate, and A max (in h\n) in the surface layer estimated for each of the phytoplankton size classes. Each season is characterized by the same month as in Figure 9 . (Figure 11 ). Note also that in these areas, the contribution of nanophytoplankton (around 15-30%) is higher than that of picophytoplankton (<10%). In the offshore areas, the contribution of nanophytoplankton (2 -20 mg C m \u00c03 d \u00c01 , Figure 11 ) becomes the most significant (around 30-55% similar to the 20-50% contribution for new production)."}, {"section_title": "\u00c03", "text": ") and high (>2 mg m \u00c03 ) Chl a concentrations. Note that the relationship observed for microphytoplankton is close to that used by Kudela and Chavez [2000] .\n[23] In the shift-up model, the specific rate of nitrate uptake, V m , is assumed to be dependent on both nutrient concentration and time. It is estimated according to the Michaelis-Menten equation,\nwhere the half-saturation constant, K s , represents the nutrient concentration at which V m = V max /2, and V max , the maximal (i.e., not nutrient-limited) specific nitrate uptake rate, varies with time (see section 2.4.2). Operating the model pixel by pixel using equations (2) -(4) therefore needs, in addition to the computation of PON and D, the estimate of (1) the surface NO 3 concentration, (2) the time dependence of V max , and (3) the half-saturation constant K s ."}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Surface Nitrate Concentration", "text": "[24] This estimate is based on the inverse correlation between SST and NO 3 concentrations existing in upwelling areas [e.g., Sathyendranath et al., 1991; Morin et al., 1993] , owing to the fact that when water is upwelled to the surface, progressive heating occurs simultaneously to nitrate consumption. The regional biogeochemical characteristics and hydrodynamic conditions, however, strongly influence the NO 3 -SST relationships, which reveal high spatial-temporal variability. In order to reduce the scatter in the NO 3 versus SST relationships, Sili\u00f3-Calzada et al. [2008] have proposed replacing SST with the difference between SST and T up (hereafter called dT), where T up is the temperature of upwelled source water. The rationale for this modification is that nitrate consumption is expected to be related to the surface heating of upwelled water rather than to SST. The temperature of upwelled water was estimated using the simultaneous in situ profiles of temperature and salinity collected in the Benguela upwelling area, and available in the WOD05 data set (see details in work by Sili\u00f3-Calzada et al. [2008] ). This temperature was found to vary notably with latitude and season. The use of dT instead of SST reduced the scatter associated with latitudinal and seasonal variability, and dT was found to be more tightly correlated with nitrate concentration than SST. The scatter in nitrate-temperature relationships was further reduced by taking into account the variations in chl a concentration in regression analyses, as demonstrated by Goes et al. [1999 Goes et al. [ , 2000 . Finally, the algorithms obtained by multiple regression analysis are for the spring-summer period (October-March), equation (5a), and autumn-winter period (April-September), equation (5b), respectively,\nOne advantage of the approach proposed by Sili\u00f3-Calzada et al. [2008] is that it allows the development of a single algorithm representative of the whole Benguela system ), for each phytoplanktonic size class. In situ data were collected in the Benguela southern subsystem by Probyn et al. [1990] .\n(15\u00b0S-35\u00b0S), and avoids the strong discontinuities provoked by the regionalization of the area into several subsystems."}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Maximum Specific Uptake Rate V max", "text": "[25] In the original model of , the shift-up hypothesis was represented by a linear dependence of V max with time (their equation (5)). Kudela and Chavez [2000] proposed a still more dynamic approach for the V max estimation,\nin which A t represents the acceleration term of the nitrate uptake experienced during the shift-up phase, and its deceleration, or shift-down, once the potential maximal nitrate uptake rate, V max 0 , is reached. This term is expressed as a function of the ''age of the upwelled water,'' (i.e., time elapsed since its arrival at the surface), t w , and a parameter, x, which rules the physiological response of phytoplankton,\nwith x = 0.5 if t w < 2.7 days; x = 0.08 if t w >2.7 days, and where t Amax , the time required to reach the maximum acceleration value, is considered to be 64.8 h (2.7 days). The age of water t w is computed as the difference between SST and the temperature of upwelled source water, T up , divided by the water heating rate, DT. While Kudela and Chavez [2000] assumed that T up was constant (and equal to the temperature at 60 m at the upwelling center), in our study T up was made variable with the latitude and season, as described before (see section 2.4.1 and Sili\u00f3-Calzada et al.\n[2008]). The water heating rate was assumed constant and taken equal to 0.02\u00b0C h"}, {"section_title": "\u00c02", "text": ") is the potential maximum acceleration rate. All three parameters were estimated from shipboard experiments and led to an average value of 0.0943 h to be constant regardless of the phytoplankton community structure, differences in the nutrient affinity were observed for different phytoplanktonic groups [Dortch, 1990; Stolte et al., 1994; Wafar et al., 2004] . The cell surface area regulates the exchange of nutrients, therefore many researchers have hypothesized that the surface area-to-volume ratio affects the ability of cells to assimilate nutrients by defining the maximum area across which nutrients can pass [Costella et al., 1979; Stolte et al., 1994] . Therefore, instead of using Kudela and Chavez's estimate, we estimated V max 0 for each of the phytoplankton groups, using the parameterization proposed by Stolte et al. for pico-, nano-and micro-phytoplankton, respectively. The average value of 0.0943 h \u00c01 used by Kudela and Chavez [2000] is included in this range, however it appears more representative of nanophytoplankton than of microphytoplankton which is expected to dominate algal populations in the upwelling areas."}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Half-Saturation Constant K s", "text": "[27] The half-saturation parameter, K s , represents a good indicator of the affinity of phytoplankton for nutrients, and has been observed to vary according to the phytoplanktonic group [e.g., Chisholm, 1992] . It has also been reported that small species have lower K s values for nitrate, ammonia and phosphorous than larger species [Eppley and Thomas, 1969; Collos et al., 2005] . Finally, Collos et al. [2005] have shown that local environmental factors (water temperature, upwelling frequency, nutrient concentration, etc.) may affect the acclimation of cells, leading to significant differences in K s for the same species in different locations. K s is proportional to the number of carrier sites per unit area of membrane [Neame and Richards, 1972; Caperon and Meyer, 1972] , therefore any increase in K s could be due to an increase in the number of such sites [Collos et al., 2005] .\n[28] Former versions of the new production model were based on the assumption of constant values, regardless the phytoplankton community composition (K s = 3 mg-at N m Chavez, 2000, 2002] ). This latter formulation was proposed to account for the dominance of microphytoplankton and picophytoplankton in high-nutrient and low-nutrient waters, respectively. Collos et al. [2005] went a step further, evidencing a continuous variation of K s as the nitrate concentration increases, and proposed the following parameterization: log Ks \u00bc 0:62 \u00c2 log NO 3 \u00bd \u00c00:09:\n[29] Still more recently, Irwin et al. [2006] proposed a new parameterization of K s based on the phytoplankton community size class composition,\nwhere V cell is the phytoplanktonic cell volume (mm 3 ); the size-scaling exponent is based on theoretical considerations concerning cell membrane diffusion and size-dependent nutrient requirements as stated by Aksnes and Egge [1991] , and the factor 1.0 is derived from nitrogen uptake measurements by Eppley and Thomas [1969] , as interpreted by Stolte et al. [1994] . The average sizes for phytoplankton size classes considered for the K s estimations are identical to those used for V max 0 . This provides K s values equal to 0.8, 4.0 and 15.7 mg-at N m \u00c03 for pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton, respectively.\n[30] The main modifications of the new production model, with respect to the previous versions Kudela and Chavez, 2000] , can be summarized as follows: (1) the particulate organic nitrogen concentration, PON, is estimated by taking into account the local phytoplankton community composition, as derived for each pixel; (2) the surface nitrate fields are estimated from seasonal empirical relationships linking the NO 3 concentration to the SST increase with respect to the temperature of upwelled source water (variable with latitude and season) and chl a concentration; and (3) both the maximum specific uptake rate V max and the half-saturation constant K s are made variable with the phytoplankton community composition for each pixel. The general computational scheme is summarized in Figure 3. 3. Application to the Benguela Upwelling Area 3.1. Seasonal Cycles of Chlorophyll Concentration, SST, and Surface Nitrate Concentrations\n[31] As previously mentioned, a complete set of monthly estimates of averaged chlorophyll a concentration was produced for 2003 using MERIS data (Figure 4) , as an input to the productivity models but also as an observational tool for discerning biomass seasonal trends. During summer (January-March), strong chlorophyll gradients are visible from the coast toward offshore. High chlorophyll values (4 -16 mg m \u00c03 ) are confined along a narrow fringe between the coastline and the continental shelf, generating a strong front between eutrophic and oligotrophic waters. Approaching autumn and winter, chlorophyll gradients decrease in intensity, accompanied by marked differences between northern and southern subsystems. While biomass increases offshore in the northern area, in the southern region the high biomass area remains confined close to the coast. The histograms of Chl a concentrations for each month (not shown) confirm that, as reported by Barlow et al. [2004] , biomass is ''generally lower along the Namibian coast than in South African water, because the phytoplankton are more uniformly distributed, with less well-defined chlorophyll fronts at the oceanic boundary.'' In the southernmost Benguela region, maximum concentrations tend to occur inshore, although exceptions may appear when strong upwelling processes occur.\n[32] The above mentioned biomass front is also reflected in the monthly AATSR SST products (Figure 5 ), although much less intense. Thermal infrared imagery also shows this discrepancy between the northern and the southern Benguela regions, in terms of seaward extension of the upwelling domain. Because of major differences in wind regimes, in shelf morphology and in direction of the coastline between the two regions [Shannon, 1985; Holmes et al., 1997; Shannon and O'Toole, 1999; Giraudeau et al., 2000; Blanke et al., 2005] , the upwelling tends to cover a narrower area with a sharper front in the south, and a broader area with a weaker front in the north, exceeding 150-250 km from the coast [Bakun and Nelson, 1991] . Between May and October there is a wide-scale cooling of the system, with coastal upwelling phenomena and the intrusion of waters from the Agulhas Current breaking the Figure 3 . Scheme of the new production model dependent on phytoplankton community structure. uniformity. Permanent upwelling cells (Walvis Bay, L\u00fcderitz and Orange River) are discernable in the SST monthly images.\n[33] The monthly maps of surface nitrate concentrations, derived from Chl a and SST maps using equations (5a) and (5b), are displayed in Figure 6 . As expected, the spatialtemporal variations of nitrate concentrations mimic those of SST, with some nuances induced by variations in chlorophyll concentration."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Cycles of New and Total Primary Production", "text": "[34] Figures 7 and 8 show the seasonal variability of new and total primary production, respectively, in the Benguela upwelling area for the year 2003. Not surprisingly, the estimates of new primary production reproduce the seasonal and latitudinal variability encountered in surface temperature, with the highest production values from June to September when SST is lowest. The chlorophyll distribu- tion, which determines the PON values, also directly governs new production patterns. Overall, there is a strongly marked seasonal cycle, with a general trend toward high and low values in winter and summertime, respectively. For most of the year, the new production patterns seem consistent with the South Atlantic anticyclone seasonal displacement that reaches its northernmost position through winter, progressively descending toward summertime. Between January and March, however, new production might be underestimated, because the lowest SST values are disregarded in SST monthly estimates. Note also that SST images (and consequently, new production images) suffer large gaps, particularly in summer and in the northern subsystem.\n[35] The total primary production values are mostly governed by the chlorophyll a distribution and to less extent by PAR values. Seasonally, the northern and southern subsystems present a relatively stable pattern, with a permanent fringe of primary production along the coast, associated with the upwelling activity. Maximum produc- The 3 months for each season are displayed from top to bottom.

Several studies conducted in the past [Malone, 1980; Raimbault et al., 1988; Wafar et al., 2004; Kameda and Ischizaka, 2005] showed that the composition and size structure of the phytoplankton communities are major determinants of the quality (new or regenerated) and quantity of primary production in a given ecosystem [Wilkerson et al., 2000] . It has been observed that in most natural populations, the small-sized phytoplankton fraction have higher preference for ammonium over nitrate, compared to the larger-sized fraction [Dortch, 1990] . As briefly explained in section 2.4.2, cell size can influence rates of nutrient uptake and assimilation, photosynthesis, respiration and growth. The commonly accepted trend, regarding nitrogenous nutrients, is that larger cells become dominant in high-nitrate waters whereas smaller cells tend to dominate in low-nitrate waters [Chisholm, 1992] . [37] The spatial and seasonal variations of the f-ratio, defined as the new-to-total primary production ratio [Eppley and Peterson, 1979] , could in principle be derived at this stage. As new production is expressed in terms of nitrogen whereas total production is expressed in terms of carbon, however, such computation requires a knowledge of the actual C:N ratio. While the C:N ratio was assumed to be equal to the Redfield ratio (6.6) in the model we used as a basis , more recent studies [Kudela et al., 1997; Geider and La Roche, 2002] have evidenced large deviations in this ratio. In particular, Kudela et al. [1997] , in their study performed in the upwelling area of Monterey Bay (California), observed a large variability in this ratio associated to the upwelling stage, with values lower than 2 in the early stage of the upwelling and at low incident light. Therefore, any estimate of the f-ratio using the above new and total primary production values would be very speculative."}, {"section_title": "Contributions of Phytoplankton Size Classes to New and Total Primary Production", "text": "[38] Taking in account the phytoplankton community structure, in terms of its size class distribution, represents one of the main modifications introduced in the scheme of the new primary production model. So far it has been commonly accepted that the new primary production is mostly due to microphytoplankton activity. This is based on the fact that following an upwelling event, high nitrate concentrations favor the increase in the abundance of large cells (with high K s and V max values), and consequently the increase in new primary production [Chisholm, 1992; Agawin et al., 2000] . Progressively, as nitrates become depleted, smaller organisms (nanoflagellates and picophytoplankton) with lower K s values, and with a preference for ammonium rather than nitrate uptake [Dortch, 1990] , would be favored. Despite the undersampling of the short-term temporal variability due to the necessary use of monthly data, this differentiation of the phytoplankton size classes allows a better understanding of the role played by each class in primary production in these highly dynamic areas. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate respectively the phytoplankton class-specific new primary production, and the relative contributions of the three phytoplankton size classes to the new primary production over the year 2003 (for sake of simplicity, only 1 month is shown for each season). ) in the surface layer estimated for each of the phytoplankton size classes. Each season is characterized by its middle month, except for summer, in which the lack of data coverage led us to choose the month January.\nsubsystem shows an evident dominance of microphytoplankton, whereas the southern region does not display such a net dominance of one class. For other seasons, in spite of the lack of data, it seems that the two subsystems present similar distributions, with a major microphytoplankton bloom, located between 23\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S, representing 60-97% of the new production.\n[41] Aside the existence of the two subsystems, there is also an important division between the inshore and offshore areas. In the fringe between the coastline and the edge of the continental shelf (located approximately at 500 m depth; see Figure 1 ), new production is dominated by microphytoplankton, with a relative contribution varying between 50% and 97% of new production. These figures seem realistic considering the high values of nitrate concentrations and new production, due to the existence of several upwelling cells. While the contribution of picophytoplankton is virtually negligible near the coast, the contribution of nano- Figure 10 .

Note that picophytoplankton contributions (>80%) in the offshore area around 33\u00b0S in winter are likely artifactual, as in that area new and total primary production are virtually negligible.\nphytoplankton is significant (10 -50%). These results are in accordance with those obtained by Barlow et al. [2005] and Irwin et al. [2006] , which have shown that small cells may contribute significantly to new production.\n[42] In the offshore area (more than 1500 m depth), contributions to new production are more evenly divided between microphytoplankton (20 -55%), and the contributions of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton, which may reach 30 -50% and 15 -40%, respectively, of new production. Nevertheless, these contributions should be considered carefully, as new production due to nano-and pico-phytoplankton varies between 0.01 and 0.8 mg-at N m \u00c03 d \u00c01 (Figure 9 ). [43] The same type of analysis was done for total primary production, following the approach proposed by Uitz et al. [2008] . The results obtained (Figures 11 and 12) show that the relative contributions of size classes to total production are slightly different from those observed for new production. In the inshore regions, for instance, the contribution of microphytoplankton is approximately 95% of the total primary production (instead of around 80% for the new production), with values ranging from 150 to 600 mg C m \u00c03 d \u00c01 Figure 11 . Annual cycle of total primary production (mg C m \u00c03 d"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "[44] The major improvement in the new production modeling proposed in this study is the estimation of individual contributions of the three main phytoplankton size classes, instead of considering phytoplankton as a whole. This estimation was possible by the inclusion of their respective nitrate uptake rates, their specific contributions to biomass, and size-specific Chl a-to-PON transformations. This approach allowed us to perform a spatial-temporal analysis of the role played by each class in the new primary production along the Benguela upwelling system. The results obtained show that, even though microphytoplankton is responsible for most of the new primary production in the inshore area (reaching a contribution up to 98% in some restricted areas), the role played by nanophytoplankton should not be neglected, with a Figure 12 . Contributions (%) of the phytoplankton size classes to the annual cycle of total primary production. Each season is characterized by the same month as in Figure 9 . relative contribution of 10 -30%. This is an important aspect to consider for a better understanding of the variability in export production, and therefore of the role of the upwelling system as a carbon sink. Even though traditionally the contribution of nano-and pico-plankton has been considered negligible, these results suggests otherwise, similarly to those obtained in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Sea by Richardson and Jackson [2007] , who observed that ''all primary producers, and not just the large cells, can contribute to export from the surface layer of the ocean at rates proportional to their production rates.'' Note, however, that in the absence of in situ validation (for lack of in situ measurements of new production simultaneous to satellite data), the values of new production cannot be ascertained and must be considered with caution.\n[45] In terms of seasonal variability, the Northern ecosystem (14\u00b0S$26\u00b0S) presents higher fluctuations throughout the sampled year, as well as wider areas with a predominance of new production. On the basis of the analyzed satellite data, the Southern ecosystem (26\u00b0S$35\u00b0S), on the contrary, seems to be mostly ruled by regenerated production, which might be linked to the upwelling frequency and wind field variability. Nevertheless, both the spatial and temporal analysis was challenged by the presence of clouds in MERIS and AATSR images. Monthly estimates with a 4 km spatial resolution were used as a compromise, however such spatial and temporal resolutions provide only rough information in highly dynamic areas like the Benguela system. Note that the spatial coverage was largely incomplete even with monthly composites. For future studies, the use of combined data from different satellite sensors (e.g., SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS) should greatly improve the coverage, especially in those areas where the cloud cover is important, although variable along the day. A better spatial and temporal coverage of the area will allow a refined analysis of the variability in the productivity of the system to be performed."}]
