Increasingly, postsecondary students of all types are working while in school. In a comprehensive review of college student employment rates using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey (CPS) data, Stern and Nakata (1991) documented a rise in student employment from 45 to 56 percent between 1959 and 1986. The increase was greatest for white females-35 to 56 percentwhile white/males experienced an increase from 50 to 57 percent. The authors also examined the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Labor Market Experiences (NLSY) and reported a rise in student employment from 49 percent in 1979 to 67 percent in 1986.1 Studies examining the effects of student employment have focused on persistence, performance, and posteducation wages as outcome indicators. These analyses indicate that working while enrolled in postsecondary education can be both beneficial and detrimental to a student's academic and labor force success. For example, researchers have found that student employment may reduce a student's likelihood of completing college or lengthen the time it takes for those who do complete postsecondary education. At the same time, such employment may increase expected postgraduation wages San 1985). The strength and direction of these relationships, however, vary according to a number of factors related to a student's working while enrolled in postsecondary education, such as the number of hours employed and location of employment (i.e., on or off campus). With respect to persistence, for example, Ehrenberg and Sherman (1986) reported that longer hours of work were associated with higher dropout probabilities for first-and second-year undergraduates. On the other hand, Astin found that if a job was located on campus, particularly during the first year of school, the undergraduate's chance of finishing college actually increased. Similarly, Ehrenberg and Sherman found that off-campus employment adversely affected completion probabilities, while on-campus hours did not. Carroll and Chan-Kopka (1988) examined the association between student employment and persistence on a subsample of the 1980 High School and Beyond senior cohort (those entering postsecondary education immediately after high school graduation and attending full The authors noted that CPS is a household survey and the primary respondent in the household may be unaware of the employment status of students living in dormitories, thus underestimating the number working. They further noted that NLSY data may more accurately reflect employment during the school year than do BLS annual data because the NLSY survey is conducted in the spring. .1.4 time until completion). They found that students who worked during the academic year were more likely to persist than were those who worked only during the summer. In terms of performance, most studies have shown that student employment does not affect grades, especially if employment intensity does not exceed 20 hours of work per week. Moreover, there is some evidence that under certain circumstances, particularly when a job is related to the undergraduate's field of study, working while enrolled may actually enhance academic performance (Stern et al. 1990). Labor market success has been shown to be positively affected by student employment. For example, posteducation earnings tended to be higher for students who were employed while enrolled in school, according to the review by Stern and Nakata. These authors noted, however, that no study has yet investigated whether this advantage persists beyond 5 years. The relationship between employment and future wages may also be influenced by the characteristics of the particular job, especially with regard to how many hours undergraduates work. San (1985), for instance, found that the positive effect of in-school employment on postcollege earnings tended to decline if a student worked more than about 27 hours per week. While most research has focused on persistence, grades, and postgraduation labor force success as outcomes of student employment, some studies have noted other effects as well. Ehrenberg and Sherman, for example, found that working on campus in a student's senior year increased the chances that the undergraduate would enter a postgraduate educational program. Exploring less academically related effects of student employment, Hammes and Haller (1983) found that working students made time for employment by reducing leisure and social time, possibly denying themselves some of the social interactions that are part of the student experience. At the same time, however, these authors also reported that students who work while enrolled in school may use their time more efficiently, may feel more competent, and may be earning money that enhances their quality of life. Furthermore, these students may also be using their jobs as a way to meet other students or initiate informal contacts with faculty. In summary, most studies examining student employment indicate that, overall, working while attending college can have both beneficial and adverse outcomes. Findings to date include that working while enrolled has 1) little effect on performance (using CPA as an indicator); 2) a negative effect on persistencestudents who work are more likely to drop out or take longer to complete their program; and 3) a positive effect on postcollege earnings up to 5 years after completion. With the availability of data from the 1989-90 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:90), researchers can begin to examine ways in which, on a national level, working while attending school is related to undergraduates' postsecondary education experiences. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, causal directions and outcomes of 2 L5 undergraduate employment cannot be determined with NPSAS:90; however, these data can help to formulate a descriptive profile describing which undergraduates work, how much they work, and the type of jobs they have. In addition, the association between performance (using GPA) and work, as well as how likely an undergraduate who works will change from full-time to part-time enrollment during 1989-90 can also be examined. Such a profile can also serve as a basis for examining other outcomes of student employment using the forthcoming longitudinal components of NPSASBeginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) and Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B). In addition to identifying students who work while enrolled in school, NPSAS data provide invaluable financial aid information, allowing researchers to compare students' employment patterns with their financial aid status. Such information can provide, for example, insight into whether or not undergraduates who work rely less on borrowing to finance their postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this report is to present a detailed description of undergraduates who work while enrolled in postsecondary education. This report examines both institutional and undergraduate characteristics relative to employment, and attempts to answer questions such as: What proportion of undergraduates work while enrolled in postsecondary education, and how much do they work? How do undergraduates who work differ from those who do not work? How do undergraduates who work part time differ from those who work full time? How do postsecondary institutional characteristics vary with undergraduate employment? How is financial aid related to undergraduates' working patterns? Do undergraduates who work more have higher education costs (taking financial aid into account)? Do undergraduates who borrow for their education work more or less than nonborrowers? Is there an association between undergraduates' grade-point average and the amount they work? How likely are undergraduates to change from full-time enrollment to part-time enrollment relative to how much they work?"}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The results presented in this report are based on data from NPSAS:90. This survey was designed to answer fundamental questions about financial aid and provides detailed information about students' education expenses, sources of funds, and types of financial aid. With respect to employment information, students were asked to provide information for all the jobs in which they had worked during the 1989-90 academic year including the kind of job, the beginning and ending dates, and the average weekly hours."}, {"section_title": "Now Employment Is Defined", "text": "Based on starting and ending dates, the employment data were aggregated to monthly variables with regard to hours worked per week (adding over all jobs reported during that month). The final variable used to estimate the average number of hours worked per week while enrolled was derived by averaging the hours worked for those months in which the student was both employed and enrolled. For example, if a student was employed for six months of enrollment but not employed for the remaining three months of enrollment, the average hours worked while enrolled reflects only the hours worked during the six months in which the student was both enrolled and employed. In order to examine the length of time a student was both working and enrolled, a ratio of employment and enrollment to total enrollment was created. These estimates are presented as the percentage of time a student was both enrolled and employed during the student's enrollment. This report also presents other employment-related variables including the number of jobs that undergraduates reported having, work-study or assistantship participation, and the type of occupation undergraduates reported as their primary job during their enrollment. While this report examines employment intensity according to mean hours worked, the focus of the analysis is on the distribution of students broken into the following five The focus is on this particular distribution rather than the mean hours worked since other studies have found that working while enrolled does not necessarily have a linear relationship to education outcomes. Working can be either beneficial or detrimental depending upon the number of hours worked while enrolled (see \"background\" discussion above)."}, {"section_title": "Classification of Undergraduates' Enrollment", "text": "A number of factors may influence the amount of time an undergraduate works while enrolled. The most obvious is how much time a student is enrolled in school (referred to as attendance status in this report). There are two ways in which attendance status is determined in NPSAS:90: one is the attendance status for the term in which a student first enrolled (usually the fall); and the second is a student's attendance for the entire academic year (attendance persistence). Since the average number of hours undergraduates worked while enrolled was averaged over all the months they were both employed and enrolled for the entire academic year (July 1, 1989to June 30, 1990, attendance persistence was used to identify an undergraduate's overall enrollment status. All detailed tables presented in this report contain subsets to indicate attendance status as either full-time for a full academic year (enrolled full time for at least 9 months), or not full-time, full-year (referred to in this report as part-time and/or part-year). The purpose of this division was not to focus on full-time, full-year undergraduates (who make up only about 30 percent of the NPSAS undergraduates), but to maintain at least one homogeneous enrollment category. NPSAS:90 undergraduates who are part time and/or part yea: can vary in the amount of time during which they are enrolled, from being full time for one term and just less than full time for the second term to attending less than half time for part of the academic year. Classifying these undergraduates according to more specific enrollment patterns would have produced subsets too small to find statistical significance when making comparisons among subsets.2 Therefore, in order to provide more information for undergraduates attending part time and/or part year without reducing their sample size, attendance status for the term in which they first enrolled (full-time, at least half-time, or less than half-time) is presented as a row in the tables."}, {"section_title": "Institutional and Underkraduate Characteristics", "text": "Institutional characteristics are identified in three ways in this report: according to control (that is, whether an institution is controlled publicly or privatelyeither not-for-profit or for-profit); level (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, and 4-yeareither doctoral or nondoctoral); and both control and level (referred to as \"type\").

Any differences noted in the text were statistically determined using a two-tailed t-test adjusted for multiple comparisons. (The reader is referred to appendix B for details on statistical methodology.) While most differences that are of both practical and statistical significance are noted, the scope of this report does not allow discussion of all statistically significant differences. When reviewing tabular findings, readers should keep in mind that a third factor, or variable, may explain an association that appears between two other variables. For example, one might expect that undergraduates attending public institutions (with lower costs) may work less than those enrolled in private, not-for-profit institutions. However, a greater proportion of older and part-time undergraduates attend public institutions and such students generally work more (due to higher living expenses and more time available for work) than their counterparts who attend private, not-for-profit institutions. Most of the obvious interactions will be pointed out in the text, and some will be controlled for in the multivariate analysis (chapter 5). However, there may be other relationships that cannot be disentangled in a descriptive analysis. Thus readers should view this report as a foundation for alternative analyses that focus on only one or two issues."}, {"section_title": "Organization of this Report", "text": "This report includes four additional chapters. Chapter 2 examines institution and student characteristics relative to undergraduate employment, while chapter 3 focuses on financial aid status with regard to employment. Chapter 4 examines undergraduate employment in relation to GPA and changes in enrollment status. Finally, chapter 5 presents results from a multivariate analysis conducted to control for variables that may be interrelated. To further explore the extent to which undergraduates were working, a comparison was made between NPSAS:90 and the Current Population Survey (CPS) with respect to the distribution of undergraduate employment.3 The findings from these two surveys were quite similar (figure 2.2). During October 1989 (when CPS data were collected), 34 percent of NPSAS undergraduates reported not working; 30 percent were working part time; and 36 percent were working full time. During this same period, 37 percent of CPS college undergraduates were not working; 31 percent were working part time; and 32 percent were working full time. These surveys confirm that most undergraduates are working while enrolled and that many of these undergraduates are working full time. This chapter focuses first on the relationship between undergraduate employment and the postsecondary institutions they attended; and second, on how specific undergraduate characteristics such as gender' and age were associated with working patterns."}, {"section_title": "Attendance Status and Institution Type", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Employment Intensity", "text": "Clearly, the number of hours that undergraduates reported working while enrolled was related to their attendance status (table 2.1). Undergraduates who were enrolled full time for a full academic year were about half as likely as those enrolled on a part-time and/or partyear basis to work full time (22 percent compared with 48 percent). At the same time, fulltime, full-year undergraduates were more than twice as likely to work 1-15 hours per week than were part-time and/or part-year undergraduates (18 percent versus 7 percent). About one in four and one in five, respectively, of full-time, full-year and part-time and/or part-year students did not work at all white enrolled.    The type of institution undergraduates attended was somewhat associated with their employment patterns. These associations primarily were related to the control of the institution. Generally, undergraduates who attended private, for-profit institutions were more likely not to work while enrolled (39 percent) than were undergraduates in either public (22 percent) or private, not-for-profit institutions (23 percent). This pattern existed for both fulltime, full-year and part-time and/or part-year undergraduates (tables 2.2a and 2.2b). Similarly, undergraduates in less-than-2-year institutions (75 percent of whom attended for-profit institutions) were more likely not to work while enrolled (42 percent) than were undergraduates attending 2-to 3-jear or 4-year institutions (from 20 to 22 percent) (table 2.1). This difference may reflect the fact that students often attend less-than-2-year (forprofit) institutions because they lack the necessary work skills to be successful in the labor market. In addition, these students may also be more likely to attend short-term concentrated programs, postponing work until they are finished. Undergraduates in 4-year institutions (both doctoral and nondoctoral) were more likely than undergraduates in other level institutions to work 1-15 hours per week, while those in 2-to 3-year institutions were most likely to work full time. However, the higher proportion of undergraduates working full time at 2-to 3-year institutions held only for those attending less than full time, full year (tables 2.2a and 2.2b)."}, {"section_title": "Average Number of Hours Worked", "text": "Among undergraduates who worked at any time while they were enrolled during the 1989-90 academic year, the average number of hours they reported working was relatively high-30 hours per week (table 2.3).4 As expected, full-time, full-year undergraduates reported working fewer hours (25 hours per week) than did part-time and/or part-year undergraduates (32 hours per week). There was little variation among institution types and undergraduate degree programs with regard to the average number of hours undergraduates worked. For example, the average hours reported by part-time and/or part-year undergraduates by institution control, ranged from a low of 31 hours per week in private, not-for-profit institutions to a high of 33 hours per week for those in public institutions. While this difference is statistically significant, it is relatively small.

Full-time, full-year undergraduates worked about 74 percent of the time they were enrolled, while part-time and/or part-year undergraduates worked, on average, 90 percent of the time they were enrolled. The duration of employment for undergraduates during their enrollment varied somewhat according to the institutions they attended. Undergraduates in 2-to 3-year institutions (more likely to attend part time) worked almost the entire time they were enrolled (91 percent), and undergraduates in 4-year doctoral institutions worked about three quarters of the time they were enrolled. In most types of institutions, undergraduates enrolled full time for a full year worked a smaller percentage of the time they were enrolled than did part-time and/or part-year students. For example, among undergraduates in 4-year doctoral institutions, those enrolled full time, full year worked about 70 percent of the time they were enrolled, while those enrolled less time worked 83 percent of the time they were enrolled."}, {"section_title": "Number of Jobs Reported", "text": "Nearly one-half of undergraduates reported being employed in only one job during the 1989-90 academic year. However, working several jobs during that time (not necessarily concurrently) was not uncommon: about one in four reported working two jobs, and 10 percent reported working three or more (table 2.5). Undergraduates in 4-year institutions and those seeking a bachelor's degree more often reported working two or three or more jobs than did those in nonbachelor degree programs or undergraduates in less-than-4-year institutions. For example, about 13 percent of undergraduates in 4-year institutions (either doctoral or nondoctoral) reported working in three or more jobs during the academic year, compared with 7 percent for those in less-than-4-year institutions. Not surprisingly, undergraduates who worked part time during their enrollment (at all three levels of part-time work) were more likely to report having multiple jobs (three or more) than were undergraduates who worked full time (15 to 19 percent for those working part time, compared with 9 percent of full-time workers).  Undergraduates who participate in work-study programs are typically full-time, 4-year college undergraduates. As shown in table 2.6, even among these undergraduates, about 12 percent reported work-study earnings.

About 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, reported working in professional/technical occupations or in education.  "}, {"section_title": "Student Characteristics", "text": "In order to determine whether or not certain undergraduates were more or less likely to be employed while they were enrolled in postsecondary education, they were characterized in a number of ways. For instance, they were identified according to gender, age, race-ethnicity, financial dependency status, marital status, local residence, citizenship, year in school, and income. Though not strongly related, some student characteristics including gender, age, marital status, dependency status, and race-ethnicity (table 2.8) were associated with undergraduates' working patterns.6 Women, for example, were somewhat more likely than men not to work while enrolled in school (25 percent versus 19 percent), and, if they did work, they were somewhat less likely to work full time (35 percent compared with 47 percent). These differences existed for both full-time, full-year and part-time and/or part-year attendance (tables 2.9a arid 2.9b). This gender difference in working intensity may suggest greater family responsibilities on the part of women, thus limiting the amount of time they have to work. In fact, the gender difference in working intensity appeared only for students over age 23 (figure 2.3). Regardless of gender, about one in four undergraduates age 23 or younger did not work while enrolled. Other student characteristics related to age also varied with working intensity. Undergraduates who were married and those who were financially independent (who are by definition over 23 years old) tended to work full time more than their unmarried and financially dependent counterparts. For example, about 55 percent of married undergraduates worked full time, compared with 35 percent of unmarried undergraduates. This difference, however, held only for part-time and/or part-year undergraduates. As shown in table 2.9a, married and unmarried undergraduates attending full time for a full year were equally likely to work full time (23 percent and 22 percent, respectively). With regard to racial-ethnic group differences, Asian undergraduates were more likely not to work while enrolled than were either Hispanic or non-Hispanic white undergraduates: one-third of Asian undergraduates did not work while enrolled, compared with 24 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of Hispanic and non-Hispanic white undergraduates (table 2.8). Moreover, it also appeared that Asian undergraduates were less likely to work full time (28 percent) than were black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white undergraduates (about 40 percent in all three groups worked full time). When attendance status was held constant, only the differences between Asian and white undergraduates remained significant (tables 2.9a and 2.9b).7 Finally, with respect to undergraduates' year in school, first-year students were somewhat more likely not to work (25 percent) than were second-, third-, or fourth-year undergraduates (about 20 percent).   "}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3", "text": "Financial Aid, Undergraduate Costs, and Borrowing In 1989-90, about 43 percent of undergraduates received some form of financial aid for their postsecondary education, and about one-half of that aid was in the form of loans (Byte 1993). As students assume loans to help pay for their education, it is important to determine how financial aid and borrowing are related to students' working intensity while they are enrolled. For example, one might want to know whether students who get financial aid work less than nonrecipients, and further, whether students who borrow work less than nonborrowers. This chapter examines a number of financial indicators in relation to undergraduate employment, including the following:"}, {"section_title": "Receipt of financial aid;", "text": "Amount of financial aid received; Education costs after subtracting grant aid; and Borrowing versus nonborrowing."}, {"section_title": "Receipt of Financial Aid", "text": "As shown in table 3.1, the receipt of financial aid was more likely to influence how much a student worked than whether a student worked. Aid recipients were less likely to work full time than were nonrecipients (32 percent versus 45 percent). Aid recipients and nonrecipients had similar tendencies to work (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of recipients and nonrecipients did not work while enrolled). These differences, however, reflected primarily the working patterns of undergraduates attending less than full time, full year (figure 3.1). The differences for full-time, full-year undergraduates were slight: 56 percent of aid recipients worked part time and 21 percent worked full time, compared with 52 percent of unaided undergraduates who worked part time and 24 percent who worked full time.  "}, {"section_title": "Amount of Financial Aid Received", "text": "How much undergraduates worked while enrolled and the amount of financial aid they received were clearly related ( figure 3.2a). Overall, the more financial aid undergraduates received, the less likely they were to work full time (and the more likely they were to work part time). For example, the percentage of undergraduates who worked full time dropped from 53 percent for recipients of less than $1,000 in aid to 30 percent for those who were receiving between $1,000 and $2,499, and further dropped to 23 percent for recipients of $5,000 or more in financial aid. When institution control was examined separately, the variations in the amount of financial aid and employment intensity were different for private, not-for-profit institutions (where costs tend to be higher) when compared with public institutions (table 3.2). For example, the percentage of undergraduates in private, not-for-profit institutions working full time declined for each increase in the level of aid. In public institutions, on the other hand, nearly twice the percentage of recipients of less than $1,000 in aid worked full time as those who received from $1,000 to $2,499 (53 percent versus 26 percent worked full time); and virtually the same percentage worked full time at all other levels of aid from $1,000 to $5,000 or more. Those in public institutions receiving less than $1,000 in aid who work full time, however, may reflect the prevalence of older students already in full-time career jobs who enroll in community colleges part time to attend classes for career advancement or for their own personal benefit. In fact, as was true for the receipt of financial aid, the relationship between financial aid amount and working intensity was primarily reflective of part-time and/or part-year undergraduates (figure 3.2b). Differences were less apparent for full-time, full-year undergraduates. For example, regardless of the amount of financial aid received, about one-quarter (20 to 24 percent) of full-time, full-year undergraduates worked full time. This may, in fact, reflect the limited amount of time that full-time undergraduates have to work, regardless of the amount of aid received. Undergraduates who attend less time, on the other hand, may be more able to adjust their working schedule according to how much ad they receive.   "}, {"section_title": "Education Costs", "text": "In this analysis, undergraduates' net costs were determined by subtracting their grant awards from their total education costs. This is the amount of money that undergraduates (and their families in the case of dependents) would be responsible for providing toward their schooling through family contributions, employment earnings, or loans. The relationship between net costs and employment intensity was the opposite of that seen for financial aid amount. Undergraduates with higher net costs were more likely to work and to work full time than were those whose net costs were lower (figures 3.3a and 3.3b, table 3.3). For example, among all undergraduates with net costs of less than $1,000, about 26 percent worked full time. This percentage increased to 39 percent for undergraduates with net ceqs between $3,000 and $5,999, and further increased to 46 percent for those with net costs of $10,000 or more.    "}, {"section_title": "Borrowing and Working", "text": "Not all undergraduates are eligible for loans and not all of those who are eligible actually borrow. In fact, only about 18 percent of undergraduates took out loans for their education in 1989-90 (Horn and Khazzoom 1992). In order to have a comparable sample of undergraduates who may or may not choose to borrow, only financial aid recipients who had financial need (after subtracting grants and expected family contribution (EFC) from costs) were considered for this particular analysis.8 This group accounted for 26 percent of all undergraduates and 70 percent of financial aid recipients. These undergraduates presumably have some discretion in how much they choose to borrow or to work to fill this need. Table 3.4 illustrates the relationship between borrowers and nonborrowers. Among all who may have been eligible for student loans, borrowers were more likely than nonborrowers to work part time (52 percent versus 39 percent) and were less likely to work full time (26 percent versus 37 percent). However, this particular relationship held only for part-time and/or part-year undergraduates (figure 3.4). Not only did borrowers attending fulltime, full-year work part time more than nonborrowers (59 percent versus 53 percent), but also they were more likely to work in general than were nonborrowers. Full-time, full-year undergraduates are limited in terms of how much time they have available for work, and it appears that work was therefore not a substitute for borrowing, but rather was used in addition to borrowing to meet greater financial need than nonborrowers. On the other hand, part-time and/or part-year undergraduates may be more able to adjust their schedule to work more or less as needed. For these undergraduates, it does appear that those who borrowed were less likely to work full time (31 percent versus 46 percent) and were more likely to work part time (44 percent versus 32 percent) than wer,-nonborrowers. The overall relationship between work, financial aid, and borrowing is shown in figure 3.5. This figure illustrates several points. First, it shows that financial aid receipt had little association with whether or not undergraduates worked: about one-quarter (22 to 24 percent) of undergraduates did not work at any time during their enrollment in 1989-90, regardless of financial aid receipt. Second, for undergraduates who did work while they were enrolled, the receipt of financial aid reduced the likelihood of working full time. And third, among financial aid recipients with a need greater than their aid and EFC, borrowing further reduced the likelihood of working full time.   "}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4", "text": "Undergraduate Employment, GPA, and Persistence There were two education outcome measures available in NPSAS:90 that were examined relative to how much undergraduates worked in 1989-90. Cumulative grade point average (GPA) was used as a measure of academic performance, and full-time enrollment that continued for an entire academic year (at least 9 months) was used as a measure of attendance persistence. These two measures are discussed in turn in the following sections."}, {"section_title": "Cumulative Grade Point Average", "text": "For this analysis, cumulative GPA was divided into three categories: less than 3.0. 3.0-3.49, and 3.5 or higher. These correspond to an average grade of less than a B, B to B+, and B+ to A. The distribution of undergraduates who fell into these categories was examined according to their working intensity. While there appears to be a trend of higher GPAs as working hours decline for fulltime, full-year undergraduates, the only paired differences that were statistically significant were between students working 1-15 hours per week and those working more (figure 4.1).9 For example, undergraduates who worked 1-15 hours per week were more likely to have high GPAs of 3.5 or higher (22 percent) than were those working more hours (14 to 17 percent). Full-time, full-year undergraduates who worked 1-15 hours per week also appeared to perform better than undergraduates who did not work while enrolled (for example, 57 percent of undergraduates not working had a GPA under 3.0, compared with 53 percent of undergraduates working 1-15 hours), but the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, for part-time and/or part-year undergraduates, when comparing undergraduates working 1-15 hours with those working 16-24 hours or 25-34 hours per week, the results followed those found for full-time, full-year undergraduates (table 4.1).10 9A significant F-test (p < .05) was found using a one-way ANOVA for the average GPAs of students for each working category.   "}, {"section_title": "Persistence", "text": "Approximately 56 percent of undergraduates initially enrolled full time for their postsecondary studies in 1989-90 (the term in which they were sampled for NPSAS:90). However, only about one-third remained full time for the full academic year. Thus, about 42 percent of undergraduates who initially enrolled full time dropped to less than full-time attendance status or stopped attending in a subsequent term during the academic year. When these undergraduates were examined according to how much they worked while enrolled, it appeared that the more undergraduates worked, the more likely they were to drop from their full-time enrollment status at some point during the year (figure 4.2). For example, 70 percent of undergraduates working 1-15 hours per week while enrolled remained full time for the entire academic year, compared with 51 percent of undergraduates working 35 or more hours)1 Moreover, it appears that undergraduates working 1-15 hours per week were also more likely to persist as full-time undergraduates than were those who did not work at all while enrolled-56 percent of whom remained full time for a full year. It is possible that some undergraduates who stopped attending subsequent to their fulltime enrollment may have done so because they finished their program or for other than financial considerations. However, even when all students who started full time and stopped attending before the end of the year were removed from the analysis, working intensity still had a negative influence on full-time enrollment persistence (figure 4.3). Thus, these results are consistent with other studies (discussed in chapter 1) showing the adverse effect of working long hours on persistence. Adjustments for Background Variation The previous chapters have compared averages or proportions of undergraduates in relation to their working status while enrolled in postsecondary education. Differences important to the topic were highlighted and discussed. To compensate for differences in populations, wherever possible, the populations were subdivided (e.g., into full-time or parttime enrollments) and cross-tabulated into various strata (e.g., by gender, age, institution type, income group, financial aid amount, and so on). This approach of controlling for group differences by cross-tabulation has limitations with survey data, since sample size limits the number of cells that can usefully subdivide the data. The limitations imposed by sample size are unavoidable and linear models are frequently used to examine several sets of variables simultaneously. This chapter proposes one such model (linear regression) to estimate these effects (adjusted means).12 The regression model is used to take into account the effect of all variables simultaneously and, hence, to control for overlapping effects that can affect tabular findings. By estimating the joint effect of all variables taker. together, regression models are often used to test individual parameters while \"holding constant\" the influence of other variables. In chapter 2 of this report, for example, a number of institutional and student characteristics were found to be associated with undergraduates' employment status while enrolled in postsecondary education. These characteristics included attendance status, control and level of institution, gender, race-ethnicity, age, financial dependency status, and marital status. However, several of these variables are interrelated and the findings from the tables cannot always take this into account. For instance, as reported in an earlier NCES publication, most less-than-2-year institutions (75 percent) are privately controlled, for-profit institutions (Horn and Khazzoom 1992). The same publication also showed that a greater proportion of black and Hispanic students attended these institutions than non-Hispanic white students. Another characteristic shown to be related to institution level was age: older students were more likely to attend community colleges (public 2-to 3-year institutions) than were younger students. It follows, then, that the differences found for institution level in the tables may h due to related variables such as institution control, age, and race-ethnicity. For example, table 2.1 shows that undergraduates in less-than-2-year institutions were less likely to work than students attending other institutions and that those attending 2-to 3-year institutions were more likely to work full time while enrolled than students in other level institutions. The differences in table 2.1 may actually be related to institution control and student age and race-ethnicity rather than to institution level. 12See appendix B for means adjustment method."}, {"section_title": "i39", "text": "In fact, this hypothesis was borne out by the regression model. When all parameters were fitted, institution level was no longer significant in relation to either the proportion of undergraduates who worked while enrolled, or to the proportion who worked full time. This indicates that the different distributions of other variables at each institution level accounted for the apparent differences ascribed to level of institution. Thus this variable was redundant and removed from the model. In order to investigate whether specific findings discussed earlier using tabular analyses may owe some of their statistical significance to their association with other variables, regressions of relevant variables were conducted on: The proportion of undergraduates who worked; Among students who worked while enrolled, the proportion who worked full time; and Among students who initially enrolled full time, the proportion who persisted full time for the full year. The models were reduced by removing redundant variables (such as institution level as discussed above).13 The regression coefficients were then used to adjust the means (in this case, proportions). Table 5.1 shows the adjusted proportions of undergraduates who worked while enrolled in postsecondary education when taking into account the variation of the variables listed in the table (the unadjusted means are included for comparison). Most of the subgroup differences found in the tabular analysis were still apparent in the adjusted proportions. For example, as found in chapter 2 (table 2.1), undergraduates who attended private, for-profit institutions were less likely to work than were those in public institutions. Initial differences found for gender and racial-ethnic groups (table 2.8) also held after controlling for background variation: women were less likely than men to work while enrolled, and Asian students were less likely to work than white students. Since a majority of 1989-90 undergraduates worked at one time 'IT another during their enrollment, most of the findings in this report reflected differences in working intensity (i.e., the proportion who worked full or part time) rather than working in general. Therefore, table 5.2 shows the adjusted proportions for working full time among students who worked after controlling for background variation. \"See the note at the bottom of each table in this chapter to see which variables were removed from the initial model.  Some of the student characteristics initially found to be associated with the likelihood of working full time changed in the regression analysis and were therefore removed from the model (see the note on the bottom of table 5.2 for a list of the variables that were removed from the model). For example, it was initially found that Asian students were less likely than white students to work full time while enrolled (table 2.8). However, Asian students tend to be younger and more often financially dependent than white students (Horn and Khazzoom 1992). When these variables were taken into account, the racial-ethnic group differences originally found to be significant disappeared. The same was true of marital status, probably for the same reasons. The initial finding indicated that married students were more likely to work full time than unmarried students. However, similar to Asian students, unmarried students are younger and more often financially dependent-thus, when these variables were factored into the model marital status was no longer associated with the likelihood of working full time."}, {"section_title": "50", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "UV", "text": "On the other hand, the gender difference discussed in chapter 2, which indicated that men were more likely to work full time while enrolled than women (table 2.8) persisted in the regression model. In fact, the adjusted means shown in table 5.2 changed little when other variables were taken into account. Similarly, the differences associated with age, dependency status, and attendance status also persisted in the regression analysis, though the magnitude of the differences (that is, the difference between the lowest and highest proportions) was reduced. The change for attendance status (i.e., the reduction in the difference between full-time, full-year undergraduates and those attending part time and/or part year) is especially notable. The unadjusted proportions were 29 percent versus 61 percent working full time, while the adjusted proportions were 40 percent versus 56 percent. This change reflects the different nature of the student populations attending full time, 11111 year compared to those attending less time. The former are more likely to be younger, financially dependent on their parents, and to attend 4-year institutions. The latter, on the other hand, are more likely to be returning students who attend primarily community colleges (Horn and Khazzoom 1992). When these characteristics are factored into the model, the difference between these groups in the likelihood of working full time, while still significant, narrowed substantially. Table 5.2 also shows the adjusted proportions of full-time workers for increasing levels of financial aid. The original finding discussed in chapter 3 that showed increasing levels of financial aid accompanied by decreasing proportions of students working full time held in the regression model. Again, however, when controlling for related factors (e.g., cost of attendance), the magnitude of the difference narrowed. On the other hand, the relationship initially found between net cost of attendance and working intensity (increasing net costs associated with an increased likelihood of working full time), did not appear to hold for total cost of attendance. In the tabular analysis, net cost (total cost minus grant aid) was used in place of total cost to take into account differential levels of income and need (reflected in the amount of grant aid awarded) which could not be controlled for in the tables. However, in the regression model, both income and financial aid were taken into account. Therefore, total cost of attendance was the appropriate indicator of cost. Nevertheless, it appears that after removing the variation associated with income and financial aid (as well as other variables), the association between costs and working full time disappears (no significant differences were found among the cost categories, so it was removed from the model). Borrowing for one's education, however, continued to be associated with a lower rate of working full time when controlling for background variation.'4 Again, however, even though significantly different, the magnitude of the difference between borrowers and nonborrowers declined. * p < = .C5 ** p < = .01 NOTE: The variables total cost, citizenship, institution level, marital status, and race-ethnicity were redundant (no significant differences) and removed to produce the reduced model. Finally, the relationship discussed in chapter 4 (table 4.3) between working while enrolled and persisting full time for a full year is still clearly shown in the adjusted means in table 5.3. The more students worked, the less likely they were to continue their full-time enrollment for a full year. With the exception of students who worked 1-15 hours per week, the adjusted means were relatively similar to the unadjusted estimates.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsqmpling errors. Sampling errors happen because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous deflnitinns; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and estimating missing data. Comparisons were made in this report only when p .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that when k comparisons were made within a family of possible tests, the significance level of the comparisons would sum to p < .05.'8 For example, in a comparison of average hours worked per week while enrolled between males and females, only one comparison is possible (males v. females). In this family, k = 1, and the comparison can be evaluated with a Student's t test. When students are divided into five racial-ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k = 10 and the significance level of each test must be p s .05/10, or .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: k = j * (j 1)/2, where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race-ethnicity, there are five racial-ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian, black, Hispanic, and white), so k = 5*(5-1)/2=10."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments of means", "text": "Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, in exploring the relationship between institution level (e.g., less-than-4-year and 4-year institutions) and how much students work, it might appear that students attending le s-than-4-year institutions work more hours while enrolled than do students in 4-year institutions. However, one must take into account enrollment status (full-time/part-time), since students in less-than-4-year institutions are much more likely to attend on a part-time basis, and thus, have more time to work than do students in 4-year institutions. For those cases where the sample size becomes too small to support controlling for another level o.' variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. In the multivariate analysis, we use regression coefficients to adjust the means (or proportions) to take into account variation due to other interrelated factors. The formula for calculating the adjusted mean for level (i) of category (j) is as follows: = A + E * Bd E * Bid) Bu where: MI-4. is the adjusted mean for level (i) of category (j), A is the intercept from the reduced regression model, 131 are the reduced regression model parameters, and * PO are the products of regression parameters and the proportions of the weighted sample that are characterized by level (i) and category (j). The regression coefficients used for this adjustment are estimate from a. multivariate model where the dependent variable is the mean or proportion under study and the independent variables are selected from those that have been shown earlier in the report to be statistically interrelated. The model uses binary (0,1) variables for each level of the categorical variables to include nonlinear effects. To avoid overidentification, redundant parameters are eliminated at one level within each variable (so that (i) has a single value for gender, (i) goes from 1 to 4 for the five racial-ethnic groups, etc.). Although the reference level is eliminated, its adjusted mean can still be computed by setting the value of 13ii to zero in the above equation. It is relatively straightforward to produce a multivariate model using NPSAS:90 data, since one of the output options of the DAS is a correlation matrix, computed using pair-wise missing values.19 This matrix c2n be used by most commercial regression packages to input the matrix and produce weighted least-square estimates of the parameters. That was the general approach used for this report, with two additional adjustments described below to reduce the effect of redundant parameters and to incorporate the design effect for statistical testing. Since many of the independent variables are interrelated (as previously discussed in the report), the presence of some variables in the model is redundant. That is, the variance explained by them will have been accounted for by other variables in the model. Accordingly, redundant variables were removed from the model, resulting in a reduced regression model that was used to produce the parameter estimates shown in the above formula. Most commercial regression packages compute parameter standard errors on the assumption of simple random sampling. For the NPSAS:90 data, this assumption is incorrect. A better approximation of their standard errors is to multiply each standard error by the DEFT of the dependent variable,20 where DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and is available with the correlation matrix."}]
