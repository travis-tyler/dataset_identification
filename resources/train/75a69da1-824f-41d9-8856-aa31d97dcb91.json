Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics.\nContact: John G. Wirt (202) 502-7478 John.Wirt@ed.gov\n\n\fExecutive Summary\nChapter 1 serves as an introduction to the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). It includes an overview and history of the National Center for Education Statistics program of longitudinal high school cohorts, summarizes the ELS:2002 objectives, and supplies an overview of the base-year and longitudinal study design.\nChapter 2 describes the data collection instruments, including both the development and content of the tests and questionnaires used in the three rounds of data collection. It also documents the first follow-up transcript and course offerings studies and provides information about linkages to external data sources.\nThe sample design is documented in chapter 3, while data collection procedures and results are presented in chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes data preparation and processing, including data file preparation.\nChapter 6 provides an account of the weighting procedures used in the study, with special emphasis on the most recent (2006) round. The chapter also covers statistical procedures, such as imputation, disclosure avoidance, and the calculation of design effects. Chapter 7 describes the contents of the data files, including the data structure and analysis populations.\nThe appendixes include, among other topics, an introduction to the base-year to second follow-up electronic codebook (ECB); a flow chart and facsimile for the second follow-up instrument; a crosswalk between occupation coding schemes; a glossary of terms; information about making cross-cohort comparisons; a listing of the superset of variables to be found on the ELS:2002 second follow-up restricted-use ECB and the subset of the same variables provided by the ELS:2002 second follow-up Data Analysis System (DAS); a description of the second follow-up composite variables; and a synopsis of the ELS:2002 second follow-up field test.\niii\n\n\f\fForeword\nThis manual has been produced to familiarize data users with the procedures followed for data collection and processing for the base year through second follow-up of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). It also provides the necessary documentation for use of the data files, as they appear on the ELS:2002 base-year to second follow-up electronic codebook (ECB) (NCES 2008-346), and information that may be helpful to users of the ELS:2002 Data Analysis System (DAS).\nAnalysts do not need to be sophisticated statisticians or computer programmers to use the ELS:2002 ECB or DAS. Most social scientists and policy analysts should find the dataset organized and equipped in a manner that facilitates straightforward production of statistical summaries and analyses. This manual provides extensive documentation of the content of the data files and how to access and manipulate them.\n\nJohn Wirt ELS:2002 Project Officer Elementary/Secondary & Libraries Studies\n\nJeffrey Owings Associate Commissioner Elementary/Secondary & Libraries Studies\n\nv\n\n\f\fAcknowledgments\nJeffrey A.

ELS:2002 is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), U.S. Department of Education. The base-year and follow-up studies were conducted through a contract to RTI International, a university-affiliated, nonprofit research organization based in North Carolina. This document contains information about the purposes of ELS:2002; the base-year, first, and second follow-up data collection instruments; the sample design; and the data collection and data processing procedures. The manual provides guidance for understanding and using data from all components of the base year and its two follow-ups.\nThe ELS:2002 base-year to second follow-up dataset has been produced in a restricteduse electronic codebook (ECB) version (NCES 2008-346) as well as a public-use web-only Data Analysis System (DAS). The data files reflect alteration or suppression of some of the original data. The data were edited to minimize the risk of disclosing the identity of responding schools and individuals. Although the primary focus of this manual is the ECB (because it is more inclusive), much of the information supplied is also applicable to the DAS version of the dataset. Because the ELS:2002 second follow-up ECB is restricted use only, second follow-up sample sizes in this report have been rounded to tens or hundreds (numbers of less than four digits have been rounded to tens; numbers of four or five digits have been rounded to hundreds). Because base-year and first follow-up data were earlier released on public-use ECBs, exact sample sizes\u2014in conformity to previously released documentation and published reports\u2014have been provided.\nChapter 1 addresses three main topics. First, it supplies an overview of the NCES education longitudinal studies program, thus situating ELS:2002 in the context of the earlier NCES high school cohorts studied in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Second, it introduces ELS:2002 by sketching some of the research and policy issues it can address and by delineating its study design. Third, it provides an overview of the various modes of data analysis that the design supports and touches on files and systems that have been provided for analysis.\nIn subsequent chapters, additional topics are addressed: instrumentation (chapter 2), sample design (chapter 3), data collection methods and results (chapter 4), data preparation and processing (chapter 5), weighting and estimation (including imputation, bias analysis, and design effect analysis) (chapter 6), and data file structure and contents (chapter 7).\nAppendixes provide additional information, including special information on crosscohort comparisons (appendix A), an introduction to the restricted-use ECB (appendix B), a synopsis of the ELS:2002 second follow-up field test (appendix C), base-year to first follow-up Data File Documentation errata (appendix D), flow chart and facsimile for the second follow-up questionnaire (appendix E), an occupational coding crosswalk (appendix F), transcript standard errors and design effects (appendix G), supplemental weighting nonresponse adjustment tables\n1\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n(appendix H), average weight adjustment factors (appendix I), second follow-up design effects (appendix J), nonresponse bias tables (appendix K), documentation of differences between the public-use and restricted-use files (appendix L), a listing of all ECB and DAS variables (appendix M), further information about composite variables and ancillary or ecological data drawn from relevant extant databases (appendix N), and a glossary of terms (appendix O).\n1.2 Historical Background\n1.2.1 NCES High School Longitudinal Studies Program\nIn response to its mandate to \u201ccollect and disseminate statistics and other data related to education in the United States\u201d and the need for policy-relevant, nationally representative longitudinal samples of elementary and secondary students, NCES instituted the National Education Longitudinal Studies program. The aim of this continuing program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various stages in their educational careers and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development.\nNCES (and ELS:2002) is authorized by section 406(b) of the General Education Provision Act (20 U.S.C. 1221e) as amended by the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 replaced the former Office of Educational Research and Improvement with the IES, in which NCES is now housed.\nThe high school longitudinal studies program consists of three completed studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72), the High School and Beyond (HS&B) longitudinal study of 1980, and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). In addition, base-year through second follow-up data (2002\u201306) for ELS:2002, the fourth longitudinal study in the series, are now available. Taken together, these studies describe the educational experiences of students from 4 decades\u2014the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s\u2014and also provide bases for further understanding of the correlates of educational success in the United States. A fifth study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) is presently in its design phase. Figure 1 is a temporal presentation of the four longitudinal high school cohort studies for which data are currently available, and highlights their component and comparison points. Figure 1 does not identify all future follow-up points for ELS:2002; final decisions have yet to be made concerning them. However, the general expectation is that the ELS:2002 cohorts will be followed until about age 26\u201330.\n1.2.2 National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972\nThe National Education Longitudinal Studies program began over 30 years ago with the implementation of NLS:72.1 NLS:72 was designed to provide longitudinal data for education policymakers and researchers who link educational experiences in high school with important downstream outcomes such as labor market experiences and postsecondary education enrollment and attainment. With a national probability sample of 19,001 high school seniors from 1,061\n1 For documentation on NLS:72, see Riccobono et al. (1981) and Tourangeau et al. (1987). While recent NCES reports and user documentation may be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov), some older documentation may be unavailable. NLS:72 and older HS&B manuals may be downloaded from the International Archive of Education Data at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu). Materials may also be obtained in microfiche or photocopy format from the Education Resources Information Center database (http://www.eric.ed.gov).\n2\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\npublic, Catholic, and other private schools, the NLS:72 sample was representative of approximately 3 million high school seniors enrolled in 17,000 U.S. high schools during the spring of the 1971\u201372 school year. Each member of this cohort was asked to complete a student questionnaire and a cognitive test battery. In addition, administrators at the sample members\u2019 schools were asked to supply information about the schools\u2019 programs, resources, and grading systems, as well as survey data on each student. No parent survey was conducted. However, postsecondary education transcripts were collected from the institutions attended by students. Five follow-up surveys were completed with this student cohort, with the final data collection taking place in 1986, when the sample members were 14 years removed from scheduled high school graduation and approximately 32 years old.\nA wide variety of data was collected in the NLS:72 surveys. For example, in addition to background information about the students and their families, the base-year and follow-up surveys collected data on each respondent\u2019s educational activities (e.g., schools attended, grades received, and degree of satisfaction with educational institutions). Participants were also asked about their work experiences, periods of unemployment, job satisfaction, military service, marital status, and children. Attitudinal information on self-concept, goals, community involvement, and personal evaluations of educational activities were also included.\n1.2.3 High School and Beyond The second in the series of NCES longitudinal studies was launched in 1980. HS&B\nincluded one cohort of high school seniors comparable to the NLS:72 sample; however, it also extended the age span and analytical range of NCES longitudinal studies by surveying a sample of high school sophomores. Base-year data collection took place in the spring term of the 1979\u2013 80 academic year with a two-stage probability sample. More than 1,000 schools served as the first-stage units, and 58,000 students within these schools were the second-stage units. Both cohorts of HS&B participants were resurveyed in 1982, 1984, and 1986; the sophomore group also was surveyed in 1992.2 In addition, to better understand the school and home contexts for the sample members, data were collected from teachers (a teacher comment form in the base year asked for teacher perceptions of HS&B sample members), principals, and a subsample of parents. High school transcripts were collected for a subsample of sophomore cohort members. As in NLS:72, postsecondary transcripts were collected for both HS&B cohorts; however, the sophomore cohort transcripts cover a much longer time span (to 1993).\n2 For a summation of the HS&B sophomore cohort study, see Zahs et al.

Introduction\nWith the study design expanded to include a sophomore cohort, HS&B provided critical data on the relationships between early high school experiences and students\u2019 subsequent educational experiences in high school. For the first time, national data were available that showed students\u2019 academic growth over time and how family, community, school, and classroom factors promoted or inhibited student learning. Researchers were able to use data from the extensive battery of achievement tests within the longitudinal study to assess growth in knowledge and cognitive skills over time. Moreover, data were then available to analyze the school experiences of students who later dropped out of high school and, eventually, to investigate their later educational and occupational outcomes. These data became a rich resource for policymakers and researchers over the next decade and provided an empirical base to inform the debates of the education reform movement that began in the early 1980s.3\n1.2.4 National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988\nMuch as NLS:72 captured a high school cohort of the 1970s and HS&B captured high school cohorts of the 1980s, NELS:88 was designed to study high school students of the 1990s\u2014 but with a premeasure of their achievement and status, prior to their entry into high school. NELS:88 represents an integrated system of data that tracked students from junior high or middle school through secondary and postsecondary education, labor market experiences, and marriage and family formation. Because ELS:2002 repeats so many of its innovations and design features, it will be useful to provide a detailed, round-by-round picture of NELS:88.\nData collection for NELS:88 was initiated with the 8th-grade class of 1988 in the spring term of the 1987\u201388 school year. Along with a student survey, NELS:88 included surveys of parents (base year and second follow-up), teachers (base year, first and second follow-ups), and school administrators (base year, first and second follow-ups). The sample was also surveyed after scheduled high school graduation, in 1994 and 2000.4\n1.2.4.1 NELS:88 Base Year\nThe NELS:88 base year (1988) successfully surveyed 24,599 students, out of some 26,432 selected 8th-graders, across 1,052 public, Catholic, and other private schools. In addition to filling out a questionnaire, students also completed assessments in four subjects (mathematics, science, reading, and social studies). The base year also surveyed one parent, two teachers, and the principal of each selected student. The base-year research instruments collected information about home, school, and individual factors that could serve as predictors for later outcomes (e.g., viewed in terms of positive outcomes, graduating from high school, making a smooth transition into the workforce, or completing postsecondary education). Information collected in the base year included family income, parental education, and occupation; parental aspirations for their 8th-grader; the 8th-grader\u2019s educational and occupational aspirations and plans, school\n3 For a summary of reforms instituted between the time the HS&B cohort was in high school and the NELS:88 cohort was in middle/junior high and high school, see Rasinski et al. (1993). For a summary of state education reforms instituted during the earlier school years of the ELS:2002 cohort, see Hurst et al. (2003). 4 The entire compass of NELS:88, from its baseline through its final follow-up in 2000, is described in Curtin et al. (2002). Final outcomes for NELS:88 (in 2000) are reported in Ingels et al. (2002). The most extensive documentation of the NELS:88 assessment battery is found in Rock and Pollack (1995). The quality of NELS:88 data in the in-school rounds is examined in Kaufman and Rasinski (1991) and McLaughlin and Cohen (1997). The sample design is documented in Spencer et al. (1990). Eligibility and exclusion issues are addressed in Ingels (1996). NCES keeps an updated version of the NELS:88 bibliography on its website. The bibliography encompasses both project documentation and research articles, monographs, dissertations, and paper presentations employing NELS:88 data (see http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/Bibliography.asp).\n5\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nexperiences, extracurricular activities, jobs and chores, television viewing, and reading; teacher perceptions of the 8th-grader\u2019s classroom performance and personal characteristics; curricular and instructional information about the classes in which teachers taught the 8th-grader; the teacher\u2019s own background and activities; and the principal\u2019s reports on the educational setting and environment of the school.\n1.2.4.2 NELS:88 First Follow-up\nA first follow-up took place in 1990. In the NELS:88 first follow-up (initial data release), there are 19,260 participants (18,220 students and 1,040 dropouts) from a sample of 20,700. (There were some changes to the file in the second follow-up rerelease of the 1990 data, which shows a revised sample size of 20,840.) The first follow-up sample was freshened to represent 1990 spring-term sophomores nationally. At that time, student cohort members, their teachers, and their principals were resurveyed. The first follow-up presented three major new analytic opportunities: (1) longitudinal analysis of gains in tested achievement and the correlates of achievement gains, (2) identification of high school dropouts and factors associated with persistence and dropping out, and (3) cross-cohort comparison (1990 high school sophomores could be compared to sophomores in 1980).\n1.2.4.3 NELS:88 Second Follow-up\nThe second follow-up took place in the spring term of the 1991\u201392 school year, when most sample members were in their final semester of high school. There were 21,188 student and dropout participants. This follow-up provided a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school and also collected information to help investigate student transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. As in the first follow-up, the sample was freshened, this time to represent the spring-term high school senior class of 1992. Trend comparisons can be made to the high school classes of 1972 and 1980 that were studied in NLS:72 and HS&B respectively. The NELS:88 second follow-up also surveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990 and identified and surveyed additional students who had left school since the prior wave. In late 1992 and early 1993, high school transcripts were collected for sample members.\n1.2.4.4 NELS:88 Third Follow-up\nThe third follow-up took place in 1994, when most sample members had completed high school. The primary goals of the 1994 round were first, to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS:72 and HS&B; second, to address issues of employment; third, to address issues of postsecondary access and choice; and fourth, to ascertain how many dropouts had returned to school and by what route. There were 14,915 participants.\n1.2.4.5 NELS:88 Fourth Follow-up\nThe fourth follow-up took place in 2000, when most sample members who attended college and technical schools had completed their postsecondary education. The study data address issues of employment, family formation, and postsecondary persistence and attainment. There were 12,144 participants in the questionnaire phase of the study. In fall 2000 and early 2001, postsecondary transcripts were collected, further increasing the analytic potential of the data and the possibility of examining trends over time.\n6\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n1.3 Education Longitudinal Study of 2002\nELS:2002 represents a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they proceed through high school and into postsecondary education or their careers. The 2002 sophomore cohort is being followed, initially at 2-year intervals, to collect policy-relevant data about educational processes and outcomes. These data pertain especially to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and high school correlates of students\u2019 access to and persistence and attainment in postsecondary education, and their entry into the workforce.\nIn the spring term of 2002, the base year of the study, high school sophomores were surveyed and assessed in a national sample of high schools with 10th grades. Their parents, teachers, principals, and librarians were surveyed as well.\nIn the first of the follow-ups, base-year students who remained in their base-year schools were resurveyed and tested (in mathematics) 2 years later, along with a freshening sample that makes the study representative of spring-term 2004 high school seniors nationwide. Students who had transferred to a different school, had switched to a homeschool environment, graduated early, or who had dropped out were administered a questionnaire. In the first follow-up, academic transcripts were requested for all students who participated in either the base year or the first follow-up. The transcripts normally cover 4 years of coursework\u2014for students who were seniors in 2004, typically 9th through 12th grade. School course offerings information for the base-year schools was also collected.\nThis section introduces ELS:2002, lists some of the major research and policy issues that the study addresses, and explains the four levels of analysis\u2014cross-sectional, longitudinal, crosscohort, and international comparison\u2014that can be conducted with ELS:2002 data.\n1.3.1 ELS:2002 Research and Policy Issues\nApart from helping to describe the status of high school students and their schools, ELS:2002 is providing information to help address a number of key policy and research questions. The study is intended to produce a comprehensive dataset for the development and evaluation of education policy at all government levels. Part of its aim is to inform decisionmakers, education practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time. Issues that can be addressed with data collected in the high school years include the following:\n\u2022 students\u2019 academic growth in mathematics;\n\u2022 the process of dropping out of high school;\n\u2022 the relationship between family background and the home education support system, and students\u2019 high school outcomes;\n\u2022 the relationship between coursetaking choices and success in the high school years (and thereafter);\n\u2022 the distribution of educational opportunities as registered in the distinctive school experiences and performance of students from various subgroups; such subgroups include the following:\n7\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\u2212 students in public and private high schools; \u2212 language minority students; \u2212 students with disabilities; \u2212 students in urban, suburban, and rural settings; \u2212 students in different regions of the country; \u2212 students from upper, middle, and lower socioeconomic status levels; \u2212 male and female high school students; and \u2212 students from different racial or ethnic groups. \u2022 steps taken to facilitate the transition from high school to postsecondary education or the world of work. Now that most ELS:2002 students have completed high school, a new set of issues can be examined with the help of data collected in 2006. These issues include the following: \u2022 the later educational and labor market activities of high school dropouts; \u2022 the transition of those who do not go directly to postsecondary education or to the world of work; and \u2022 access to and choice of postsecondary educational institutions. Future data collections will support further investigations, such as the following: \u2022 persistence in attaining postsecondary educational goals; \u2022 rate of progress through the postsecondary curriculum; \u2022 degree attainment; \u2022 barriers to persistence and attainment; \u2022 entry of new postsecondary graduates into the workforce; \u2022 social and economic rate of return on education to both the individual and society; and \u2022 adult roles, such as family formation and civic participation. These various research and policy issues can be investigated at several distinct levels of analysis. The overall scope and design of the study provide for the four following analytical levels: \u2022 cross-sectional profiles of the nation\u2019s high school sophomores (2002), seniors (2004), and post-sophomore-year dropouts (2004); \u2022 longitudinal analysis (including examination of life course changes); \u2022 cross-cohort comparisons with American high school students of earlier decades; and \u2022 international comparisons: U.S. 15-year-olds to 15-year-olds in other nations, including longitudinal outcomes for the United States that can be related to scale\n8\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nscores in mathematics and reading from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).\n1.3.2 ELS:2002 Study Design\nELS:2002 is designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young people as they progress from 10th grade through high school and on to postsecondary education or the world of work, or both.\nELS:2002 has two distinctive features. First, it is a longitudinal study, in which the same units (schools and students) are surveyed repeatedly over time. Individual students have been followed through high school and will be followed for a number of years thereafter. The baseyear schools were surveyed twice, in 2002 and in 2004. Second, in the high school years, ELS:2002 is an integrated, multilevel study that involves multiple respondent populations. The respondents include students, their parents, their teachers, and their schools (from which data are collected at four levels: from the principal, the librarian, a facilities checklist, and school course catalogues and records, which support a school course offerings component). Each of the two distinctive features\u2014the longitudinal nature of the ELS:2002 design and its multilevel focus\u2014 will be explained in greater detail below.\nThe transition through high school and beyond into postsecondary institutions and the labor market is both complex (youth may follow many different paths) and prolonged (it takes place over a period of years). The complexity and time frame for this transition make longitudinal approaches especially appropriate. By surveying the same young people over time, it is possible to record the changes taking place in their lives. Gathering information about the ways that their earlier achievements, aspirations, and experiences predict what happens to the respondents later is also possible. In the baseline data collection (spring 2002), ELS:2002 measured students\u2019 tested achievement in reading and mathematics. ELS:2002 also obtained information from students about their attitudes and experiences.\nThese same students were resurveyed 2 years later (in 2004), in the ELS:2002 first follow-up, to measure changes such as achievement gains in mathematics and changes in enrollment status (e.g., the situation of students who drop out of school compared with those who persist in their education). The cohort members were resurveyed 4 years after the base year (2006), and the second follow-up data supply information about postsecondary educational access and choice, or transition to the labor market for cohort members who did not continue their education.\nCohort members will be followed for a number of years after this follow-up so that later outcomes (e.g., their persistence in higher education and baccalaureate attainment, or their success in the labor market) can be understood in terms of their earlier aspirations, achievement, and high school situation.\nELS:2002 gathers information at multiple levels. It obtains information not only from students and their school records, but also from students\u2019 parents, teachers, and the administrators (principal and library media center director) of their schools. Data from their teachers, for example, provide information both about the students\u2019 and the teachers\u2019 backgrounds and activities. This multilevel focus supplies researchers with a comprehensive picture of the home, community, and school environments and their influences on the student.\n9\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nThis multiple-respondent perspective is unified by the fact that for most purposes, the student is the basic unit of analysis.5\nIn addition, information from (or linkages to) external data sources has been integrated into the ELS:2002 dataset. These external sources include the decennial Census (2000), NCES school databases such as the Common Core of Data and Private School Survey (PSS), as well as post-high school institutional information such as the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Additional sources that have been drawn upon or linked to include student application and loan information, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and various sources of test scores (SAT, ACT, and the GED testing program) and the National Student Loan Data System.\nWith the addition of postsecondary data in the 2006 second follow-up, ELS:2002 greatly enlarges its ability to connect high school antecedents to later outcomes. For students who continue on to higher education, researchers can use ELS:2002 to measure the effects of their high school careers on subsequent access to postsecondary institutions, their choices of institutions and programs, and, as time goes on, their postsecondary persistence, attainment, and eventual entry into the labor force and adult roles. For students who go directly into the workforce (whether as dropouts or high school graduates), ELS:2002 can help to determine how well high schools have prepared these students for the labor market and how they fare within it.\nKey elements in the ELS:2002 longitudinal design are summarized by wave below.\n1.3.2.1 Base Year (2002) The ELS:2002 base year achieved the following: \u2022 Completed the baseline survey of high school sophomores in spring term 2002. \u2022 Administered achievement tests in reading and mathematics. \u2022 Completed surveys of parents, English teachers, and mathematics teachers. Collected school administrator questionnaires. \u2022 Included additional components for this study\u2014a school facilities checklist and a media center (library) questionnaire. \u2022 Established sample sizes of 7526 participating schools and 15,362 participating students. Schools are the first-stage unit of selection, with sophomores randomly selected within schools.\n5 Base-year school administrator, library media center, and facilities data can be used to report on the nation\u2019s schools with 10th grades in the 2001\u201302 school year. A first follow-up course offerings file further enriches the information available about high schools with 10th grades in 2002. However, if history is a guide, most analysts will employ the school-level data to provide further contextual information on the student. 6 Note that exact sample sizes are provided for the base year and first follow-up of ELS:2002, consistent with past documentation (NCES 2004-405, NCES 2006-344) and the released public-use files in ECB format. However, since there is no public release file for the second follow-up, exact sample sizes are not given for the 2006 round. Rather, to perturb the data, as is required in reporting on restricted-use files, sample sizes of less than four digits are rounded to tens, and sample sizes of four or five digits are rounded to hundreds.\n10\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\u2022 Oversampled Asian7 and Hispanic students and private schools.\n\u2022 Designed linkages with PISA (reading in 2000 and math in 2003) and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP 2005 math); scored reporting linkages to the prior longitudinal studies.\nThe ELS:2002 base-year study was carried out in a national probability sample of 752 public, Catholic, and other private schools in the spring term of the 2001\u201302 school year. Of 17,591 eligible selected sophomores, 15,362 completed a base-year questionnaire, as did 13,488 parents, 7,135 teachers, 743 principals, and 718 librarians.\nSeven study components comprise the base-year design: assessments of students (achievement tests in mathematics and reading); a survey of students; surveys of parents, teachers, school administrators, and librarians; and a facilities checklist (completed by survey administrators, based on their observations at the school). The student assessments measured achievement in mathematics and reading; the baseline scores can serve as a covariate or control variable for later analyses. Mathematics achievement was reassessed 2 years hence, so that achievement gain over the last 2 years of high school can be measured and related to school processes and mathematics coursetaking. The student questionnaire gathered information about the student\u2019s background, school experiences and activities, plans and goals for the future, employment and out-of-school experiences, language background, and psychological orientation toward learning.\nOne parent of each participating sophomore was asked to respond to a parent survey. The parent questionnaire was designed to gauge parental aspirations for their child, home background and the home education support system, the child\u2019s educational history prior to 10th grade, and parental interactions with and opinions about the student\u2019s school. For each student enrolled in English or mathematics, a teacher was also selected to participate in a teacher survey. The teacher questionnaire collected the teacher\u2019s evaluations of the student and provided information about the teacher\u2019s background and activities. The head librarian or media center director at each school was asked to complete a library media center questionnaire, which inquired into the school\u2019s library media center facility, its staffing, its technological resources, collection and expenditures, and scheduling and transactions. Finally, the facilities checklist was a brief observational form completed for each school. The form collected information about the condition of school buildings and facilities.\n1.3.2.2 First Follow-up (2004)\nThe ELS:2002 first follow-up involved the following:\n\u2022 Most sample members were seniors, but some were dropouts or in other grades (early graduates or retained in an earlier grade).\n\u2022 Student questionnaire (different versions for students who remained in the base-year school, transferred to a new school, completed high school early, or were homeschooled), dropout questionnaire, assessment in mathematics, and school administrator questionnaire were administered.\n7 Except where indicated otherwise, race/ethnicity is reported as follows: Black includes African American, Hispanic includes Latino, Asian includes Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian includes Alaska Native. All race categories exclude individuals of Hispanic or Latino origin.\n11\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\n\u2022 The survey returned to the same schools but separately followed transfer students and surveyed them outside of school.\n\u2022 The survey freshened for a spring-term 2004 senior cohort.\n\u2022 There was a high school transcript component in 2004\u201305 (coursetaking records at the student level for grades 9\u201312) and a course offerings component at the school level.\nThe basis for the sampling frame for the first follow-up was the sample of schools and students studied in the ELS:2002 base year. There were two overlapping but conceptually different target student populations, or populations of inferential interest, for the first follow-up. One population (the ELS:2002 sophomore cohort) consists of those students who were enrolled in the 10th grade in the spring term of 2002. The other population (the ELS:2002 senior cohort) comprises those students who were enrolled in the 12th grade in the spring term of 2004. The former population includes students who dropped out of school between 10th and 12th grades, students who graduated early, students who went from a school setting to a homeschooling setting, and students who fell behind the modal grade progression of their peers (e.g., students who repeated a grade and were 11th-graders in spring 2004). Because of these two target populations and the major analytical subgroups, the full-scale sample encompasses the following types of students in the spring of 2004:\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sophomores enrolled (in either the 12th grade or some other grade) in the school in which they were originally sampled;\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sophomores who dropped out of school prior to first follow-up (2004) data collection;\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sophomores who finished high school early, including those who graduated from high school early as well as those who did not graduate because they achieved alternative certification (e.g., exam-certified equivalency such as a GED);\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sophomores who transferred out of the school in which they were originally sampled (including homeschooled students);\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sample sophomores who were deemed unable to participate directly during the base year owing to severe disability or insufficient command of the English language such that they could not complete a questionnaire; and\n\u2022 students at the base-year sample school who were enrolled in the 12th grade in the spring term of 2004 but who were not in 10th grade in the United States during the 2001\u201302 school year. In spring term 2002, such students may have been out of the country, been enrolled in school in the United States in a grade other than 10th, had an extended illness or injury, been homeschooled, been institutionalized, or temporarily dropped out of school. These students comprised the first follow-up \u201cfreshening\u201d sample.\nWhile all groups in the sample as categorized above were eligible to complete a questionnaire, different instruments were tailored to different study populations. The guiding intuition was to provide a core of items that all sample members would respond to, supplemented by items specific to the circumstances of a particular group (such as dropouts, for example, for whom questions about their current school situation would not be relevant). In chapter 2, the\n12\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nvarious questionnaires\u2014student, abbreviated student, transfer student, early graduate, homeschool, out-of-school (dropout), and new student supplement\u2014are briefly described.\nFor some classifications of the sample, a first follow-up test score in mathematics was either collected (students still in the base-year school) or imputed (students who have transferred to a new school). For other categories of sample members, such as dropouts, early graduates, and homeschooled students, a test score has neither been collected nor imputed. (Note that missing base-year test score data have been imputed for base-year nonrespondents who became respondents in the first follow-up.)\nFor all classifications of sample members, information about student coursetaking (covering all years of high school and including the sequence in which courses were taken and grades earned) were collected late in 2004 and early 2005 through the high school transcript component of the ELS:2002 first follow-up study. Further information about the transcript component is contained in this volume and in Bozick et al. (2006).\nAt the school level, the first follow-up extended information about base-year schools through administration of a school administrator questionnaire. In addition, information about school course offerings was collected in the first follow-up transcript study. Finally, further information about participating schools at the time of the first follow-up survey can be obtained on the restricted-use ECBs by linking (via the NCES identification code [NCESID]) to the CCD or PSS, and, via ZIP codes, to 2000 Census data. The NCES school district database and its Census data also are accessible on the restricted-use file by means of the NCESID.\n1.3.2.3 Second Follow-up (2006) The ELS:2002 second follow-up had the following characteristics: \u2022 Post-high-school follow-up with web-based instrument for self-administration, computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), or computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). \u2022 Survey 2 years after the cohorts\u2019 modal high school graduation captures six distinct groups: \u2212 high school late completers; \u2212 nonenrollers in higher education; \u2212 prompt postsecondary education enrollers; \u2212 delayed postsecondary education enrollers; \u2212 higher education leavers (versus persisters) and returnees; and \u2212 delayer-leavers. \u2022 Three distinct (and sometimes alternating or combined) transitions: \u2212 transition to the work force; \u2212 transition to postsecondary education; and \u2212 transition to adult roles.\n13\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nThe second follow-up in the spring of 2006 employed a web-based self-administered instrument with CATI and CAPI data collection for nonresponse follow-up. The focus of the interview was on transition to postsecondary education and labor force participation. Out of a sample of about 15,9008 cases, about 14,200 sample members completed interviews, for a weighted response rate of 88 percent.\nThe ELS:2002 second follow-up provides data to map and understand a key transition: the transition of the majority of cohort members out of high school. For the cohort as a whole, the second follow-up obtained information that will permit researchers and policymakers to better understand issues of postsecondary educational access and choice. Thus, a major focus of the second follow-up interview was the postsecondary decision-making process as reflected in applications to college and initial postsecondary enrollment histories. ELS:2002, unlike studies that sample only postsecondary students, is uniquely positioned to address these issues because it tracks respondents who attended postsecondary institutions before they enrolled. Additionally, it follows students who did not attend college and thus provides information on reasons students did not attend. The second follow-up also provides information about high school completion (for students who dropped out or were held back), as well as information about the status of dropouts and students who have obtained an alternative credential, such as the GED. For noncollege-bound students, the second follow-up mapped the transition into the labor market (or family formation). In addition to its focus on postsecondary (or sometimes secondary) education and work experiences, the second follow-up survey also obtained information about family formation, community involvement, and negative life events.\nThe principal innovation of the ELS:2002 second follow-up\u2014one that represents a technological improvement over the data collection methods used in its predecessor, NELS:88\u2014 is application of computer methods to self-administered questionnaires for the out-of-high-school population, in which the questionnaire is completed on the Web. The survey used a web-enabled survey system to program the instrument for self-administration. The same electronic instrument was used in the CATI and CAPI instruments as well. (The self- and interviewer-administered survey instruments are indistinguishable in terms of screen text and skip patterns in each of the three modes.) The advantages of a web-based instrument include real-time data capture and access, including data editing in parallel with data collection.\n1.3.2.4 Further Follow-ups\nThe number of (and dates for) further web/CATI/CAPI and postsecondary education transcript follow-ups will be determined at a later date.\n1.3.3 ELS:2002 Modes of Data Analysis\n1.3.3.1 Cross-Sectional Profiles\nCross-sectional data permit characterization of the nation\u2019s high school sophomores in the spring term of the 2001\u201302 school year. Initial cross-sectional findings from the base year are\n8 As earlier noted, only approximate sample sizes are provided for the 2006 round, because restricted-use data are used. Exact sample sizes from restricted-use data cannot be published unless the data are perturbed in some ways. The perturbation approach taken here was to round the exact sample sizes to tens (for one- to three-digit numbers) or hundreds (for four- to five-digit numbers). In contrast, a public-use ECB was produced for the 2002 (base-year) and 2004 (first follow-up) rounds. For this reason, exact sample sizes can be reported for the earlier rounds.\n14\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\navailable in an NCES report, A Profile of the American High School Sophomore in 2002.9 Because of sample freshening, the results 2 years later provided a basis for profiling the nation\u2019s high school seniors in the spring term of the 2003\u201304 school year. A report on seniors has also been released10 as well as findings pertaining to high school graduates that uses data from the ELS:2002 high school transcript study.11 Finally, a \u201cfirst look\u201d report containing some basic tabulations of second follow-up data accompanies the release of the 2002\u201306 combined data.\n1.3.3.2 Longitudinal Analysis\nLongitudinal analysis became possible with the release of data from the 2004 first followup12 and has been further extended by the addition of the 2006 data point. The primary research objectives of ELS:2002 are longitudinal in nature. The study provides the basis for within-cohort comparison by following the same individuals over time to measure postsecondary educational and workforce entry and relate these outcomes to antecedents identified in earlier rounds, including individual, home, school, and community factors.\n1.3.3.3 Cross-cohort Comparisons\nAs part of an important historical series of studies that repeats a core of key items each decade, ELS:2002 offers the opportunity for the analysis of trends in areas of fundamental importance, such as patterns of coursetaking, rates of participation in extracurricular activities, academic performance, and changes in goals and aspirations. An NCES report is available that details the experiences of HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 high school sophomores.13 With completion of the second follow-up in 2006, researchers can now compare ELS:2002 high school seniors\u2019 experiences 2 years out of high school with those of the NELS:88 cohort in 1994, HS&B in 1982 and 1984, and NLS:72 in 1974. With the ELS:2002 academic transcript data, researchers can also make trend comparisons with academic transcript data containing students\u2019 high school course histories and sequences because comparable transcript studies have been conducted with spring-defined senior cohorts, starting with HS&B14 (1982) and including NELS:88 (1992) and NAEP (1987, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2000, and 2005). (See appendix A.)\n1.3.3.4 International Comparisons\nA feature of ELS:2002 that expands the study\u2019s power beyond that of the predecessor studies is that it can be used to support international comparisons. A concordance has been generated to link the ELS:2002 scale to that of PISA. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s PISA (Lemke et al. 2001, 2004) is an internationally\n9 See Ingels et al. (2005a) (NCES 2005-338). A small, but growing, ELS:2002 bibliography can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/Bibliography.asp. 10 See Ingels, Planty, and Bozick (2005), A Profile of the American High School Senior in 2004 (NCES 2006-348). 11 See Planty, Bozick, and Ingels (2006), Academic Pathways, Preparation, and Performance\u2014A Descriptive Overview of the Transcripts from the High School Graduating Class of 2003-04 (NCES 2007-316). 12 For an example of longitudinal analysis, see Bozick and Ingels (2007), Mathematics Coursetaking and Achievement at the End of High School: Evidence from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (NCES 2007); or Bozick and Lauff (2007), A First Look at the Initial Postsecondary Experiences of the Sophomore Class of 2002 (ELS:2002) (NCES 2008-308). 13 See Cahalan et al. (2006), United States High School Sophomores: A Twenty-Two Year Comparison, 1980\u20132002 (NCES 2006327). A cross-cohort analysis of coursetaking trends, based on academic transcripts, has also been completed\u2014see Dalton et al. (2007), Advanced Mathematics and Science Coursetaking in the Spring High School Senior Classes of 1982, 1992, and 2004 (NCES 2007-312). 14 However, the HS&B sophomore cohort 2 years later (1982) did not include a freshening sample of seniors; this introduces a small conservative bias in its estimates (see Dalton et al. 2007 for details).\n15\n\n\fChapter 1. Introduction\nstandardized assessment administered to 15-year-olds in groups in their schools. PISA covers three domains: reading literacy, numeracy, and scientific literacy; ELS:2002 test results have been linked to PISA reading (2000) and mathematics (2003) scores so that the PISA scale can be used in ELS:2002 analyses. PISA aims to define each domain not merely in terms of mastery of the school curriculum, but also in terms of important knowledge and skills needed in adult life. Emphasis is placed on the mastery of processes, the understanding of concepts, and the ability to function in various situations within each domain. 1.3.4 Analysis Files and Systems\nWhile the base-year and base-year to first follow-up ELS:2002 data deliveries include both a public-use ECB and a restricted-use ECB, there is only a restricted-use ECB for the combined base year to second follow-up. Restricted files require that analysts obtain a special institutionally based license from NCES. However, a base-year to second follow-up web-housed public-use DAS has also been produced. Full details about the ECB are provided in later chapters, particularly chapter 7. A \u201cquick guide\u201d to use of the base-year to second follow-up ECB appears as appendix B of this document. Although this document is primarily oriented to the ECB, information that will be helpful to DAS users is also included.\n1.4 High School Longitudinal Study of 2002\nA fifth study in the series\u2014the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)\u2014is currently in its development phase. HSLS:09 will survey a nationally representative sample of high school students, their parents, teachers, and school administrators at several time points during students\u2019 secondary and postsecondary years. In the high school years, it will include assessments in both mathematics and science. Unlike previous studies in the series, HSLS:09 will collect data from students in the fall of their 9th-grade year, with a second round of data collection at the end of 11th grade in 2012, when most of the student cohort will be completing their junior year. The new schedule will allow researchers and policymakers to learn if and how 9th-grade plans are linked to students\u2019 subsequent behavior, from coursetaking to postsecondary choices, and how these plans evolve over time. In subsequent waves of data collection, the sample members will be followed into college and beyond.\n16\n\n\fChapter 2\nBase-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n2.1 Introduction\nThis chapter is divided into five main sections. Section 2.1 is an introduction to instrumentation issues. Section 2.2 provides information about the base-year and first follow-up questionnaires. Section 2.3 describes the base-year and first follow-up achievement tests. Section 2.4 introduces the academic transcript component. Finally, section 2.5 provides information about the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006) questionnaire.\nThe base-year (2002) data collection instruments for the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) consisted of five separate questionnaires (student, parent, teacher, school administrator, and library media center), two achievement tests (assessments in reading and mathematics), and a school observation form (facilities checklist).\nThe first follow-up (2004) data collection instruments comprised seven questionnaires and an achievement test in mathematics. The first follow-up questionnaires included a student questionnaire, a transfer student questionnaire, a new participant student questionnaire (NPSQ), a homeschool student questionnaire, an early graduate questionnaire, a dropout (not currently in school) questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. A new participant supplement (NPS) (repeating questions from the base year) and an abbreviated version of the student questionnaire were also offered.15 The base-year and first follow-up questionnaires can be found as portable document format (PDF) files on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) ELS:2002 website (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/).\nIn the first follow-up, information was also collected about the course offerings of the base-year schools, as well as the transcript records (including both courses taken and grades and credits received) of the sophomore and senior cohorts.\nIn the second follow-up (2006), a single electronic questionnaire was administered in three modalities\u2014a web-enabled self-administration, an interviewer administration of computerassisted telephone interviews (CATI), and computer-assisted personal interviews.\n2.1.1 Instrument Development Process and Procedures\nIn general, the development and review process for each questionnaire consisted of the following steps:\n1. Sharing of draft data elements. Draft elements of the questionnaires were shared with other government agencies, policy groups, and interested parties.\n2. Technical review panel (TRP) review. The ELS:2002 TRP, a specially appointed, independent group of substantive, methodological, and technical experts, reviewed the questionnaires.\n3. NCES review. The questionnaires underwent interdivisional review at NCES.\n15 In fact, the new participant student questionnaire is simply the new participant supplement and abbreviated first follow-up student questionnaire, joined together to create one booklet, for convenience of administration.\n17\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n4. Questionnaire revision. The survey instruments were revised based on reviewer comments.\n5. Writing of justification. A justification was written for the data elements, noting issue areas, constructs to be measured within each, and items that would be used to measure each construct.\n6. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. The federal OMB reviewed the instruments.\n7. Questionnaire revision. The questionnaires were revised based on OMB comments.\n8. Field testing and revision. The instruments were field tested and revised based on field test results.\nSpecific assessment items for the base-year mathematics and reading tests and first follow-up mathematics test were typically not subject to these reviews, but the larger assessment framework and goals and the results (as seen in overall item statistics from the field test) were an integral element within the review process and, in particular, in the deliberations of the TRP.\nThe field testing of procedures, questionnaires, and assessments was an especially important step in the development of the full-scale surveys. Field test instruments were evaluated in a number of ways. For the questionnaires, field test analyses included evaluation of item nonresponse, examination of test-retest reliabilities, calculation of scale reliabilities, and examination of correlations between theoretically related measures. For the achievement tests in mathematics and reading, item parameters were estimated for both 10th and 12th grade in the base-year field test. Both classical and Item Response Theory (IRT) techniques were employed to determine the most appropriate items for inclusion in the final (base-year main study) forms of the two tests. Psychometric analyses included various measures of item difficulty and discrimination, investigation of reliability and factor structure, and analysis of differential item functioning. In the first follow-up field test, similar classical and IRT psychometric analyses were conducted but with a slightly different end in terms of final format: adaptiveness was ensured through a two-stage test in the base year, whereas the test designed for the first followup main study based assignment of form on the base-year mathematics ability estimate. The base-year field test report is available from NCES (Burns et al. 2003). Findings of the first follow-up field test are summarized in appendix J of Ingels et al. (2005b), while second followup field test results are reported in appendix C of this volume.\n2.1.2 Instrument Development Goals and Constraints\nThe primary research objectives of ELS:2002 are longitudinal in nature; therefore, the first priority was to select the items that would prove most useful in predicting outcomes as measured in future survey waves.\nThe second priority was to obtain needed cross-sectional data, whenever consistent with the longitudinal objectives, particularly data that could be used for cross-cohort comparison with past studies or linkage to certain current data collection efforts. Wherever possible, all ELS:2002 instruments were designed to provide continuity and consistency with the earlier education longitudinal studies of high school cohorts. Where appropriate, ELS:2002 drew items from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, the High School and Beyond (HS&B) longitudinal study, and, most particularly, the National Education Longitudinal Study of\n18\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n1988 (NELS:88). In addition, the study used coding frames and taxonomies that were comparable to those employed in past high school transcript studies, or (in the case of occupation coding) could be crosswalked to them. Apart from the cross-cohort comparisons that can be sustained through use of the test, questionnaire, and transcript data, ELS:2002 provides score linkages with the testing programs of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (reading and mathematics) and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) (mathematics).\nAlthough maintaining trend items to support cross-cohort comparisons was a major aim of instrument development, there was also a need to provide new items to address new areas of policy concern and to reflect recent advances in theory. For example, in the base year in particular, educational technology items were developed to reflect the fact that computers have become a major factor in learning in recent years. Psychological scales that reflect recent work in self-efficacy theory and related areas were also added.\nAnother consideration in the development of the ELS:2002 instruments was the need to obtain factual information from the best source among the various respondent populations. This was an issue both for the base year, in which both parents and students were surveyed, and first follow-up, where administrative records were pursued (transcript component) as well as selfreports (questionnaire).\n2.2 Base-Year and First Follow-up Questionnaires\n2.2.1 Base-Year Questionnaires The various ELS:2002 base-year questionnaires can be found at\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/index.asp. Some detail about them is provided below.\n2.2.1.1 Student Questionnaire The ELS:2002 base-year student questionnaire was typically self-administered.\nSophomore sample members normally completed the questionnaire in a group setting in their schools. A small number of students were surveyed outside of school, with a shortened version of the questionnaire in a CATI. Assessments in reading and mathematics were given at the same time (i.e., during the group administration), in a two-stage process in which the first stage was a routing test. The full questionnaire was available only in English, although a shortened Spanish version was also produced.\nThe student questionnaire was divided into seven sections: (1) locating information, (2) school experiences and activities, (3) plans for the future, (4) non-English language use, (5) money and work, (6) family, and (7) beliefs and opinions about self.\n2.2.1.2 Parent Questionnaire The parent questionnaire was to be completed by the parent or guardian most familiar\nwith the sophomore\u2019s school situation and experience. Guided by this definition of the preferred respondent, the parent survey respondent was self-selected.\n19\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nThe parent questionnaire was available in both English and Spanish. Both a hardcopy version and an electronic CATI version16 were produced. The parent questionnaire addressed the following five topic areas: (1) family background, (2) their child\u2019s school life, (3) their child\u2019s family life, (4) their opinions about their child\u2019s school, and (5) their aspirations and plans for their child\u2019s future.\n2.2.1.3 Teacher Questionnaire\nThe teacher questionnaire was to be completed by the English teacher and the mathematics teacher of each ELS:2002 sophomore. The teacher questionnaire was designed to address questions of the quality, equality, and diversity of educational opportunity by obtaining information in two content areas:\n\u2022 Teacher evaluations of students. The teacher\u2019s assessment of the student\u2019s schoolrelated behavior and academic performance and educational and career plans and goals. Respondents completed this section with respect to the sample members they instructed in a particular subject.\n\u2022 Teacher background. Information about the teacher\u2019s background and activities (e.g., academic training, subject areas of instruction, years of teaching experience, and participation in professional growth activities).\n2.2.1.4 School Administrator Questionnaire\nThe base-year school administrator questionnaire collected information on the school in six areas: (1) school characteristics, (2) student characteristics, (3) teaching staff characteristics, (4) school policies and programs, (5) technology, and (6) school governance and climate. The school administrator data can be used contextually, as an extension of the student data, when the student is the fundamental unit of analysis. At the same time, the ELS:2002 base-year school sample is nationally representative and can stand alone as a basis for generalizing to the nation\u2019s regular high schools with sophomores in the 2001\u201302 school year.\n2.2.1.5 Library Media Center Questionnaire\nFor the school library media center component, the school librarian, media center director, or school administrator supplied information about library media center size, organization, and staffing; technology resources and electronic services; extent of library and media holdings, including both collections and expenditures; and levels of facility utilization, including scheduling for use by students and teachers. Finally, the questionnaire also supplied information about the library media center\u2019s use in supporting the school\u2019s curriculum; that is, how library media center staff collaborate with and support teachers to help them plan and deliver instruction. Information in the library media center questionnaire can be used as contextual data with the student as the unit of analysis or to generalize to libraries within all\n16 The approach to parent telephone interviews in the ELS:2002 base year differed from that followed in NELS:88. In NELS:88, to minimize the possibility of mode of administration effects, the parent was asked to read along in the hardcopy questionnaire as the questions were read over the telephone. The interview was not computer assisted. In ELS:2002, the decision was made to take advantage of the logical consistency editing and other features of CATI, and considerable effort was made to constrain the hardcopy questionnaire to items and formats compatible with a CATI administration. ELS:2002 parents were not interviewed over the telephone with the hardcopy questionnaire in hand. This fact accounts for some of the differences between the NELS:88 and ELS:2002 parent survey instruments.\n20\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nregular high schools with 10th grades in the United States in the 2001\u201302 school year (for ELS:2002 library component findings, see Scott 2004).\n2.2.1.6 School Facilities Checklist\nInstrumentation for the facilities component comprised a checklist to be completed by the survey administrator. The survey administrator was asked to observe a number of conditions at the school, including the condition of the hallways, main entrance, lavatories, classrooms, parking lots, and surrounding neighborhood. Of special interest were indicators of security (metal detectors, fire alarms, exterior lights, fencing, security cameras, etc.) and maintenance and order (trash, graffiti, clean walls and floors, noise level, degree of loitering, etc.). Information gathered in the facilities checklist can be used as contextual data with the student as the unit of analysis, or data can be used at the school level to generalize to all regular high schools with 10th grades in the United States in the 2001\u201302 school year. (For findings drawing on the Facilities Checklist, see Planty and DeVoe 2005.)\n2.2.2 First Follow-up Questionnaires\nThe various ELS:2002 first follow-up (2004) questionnaires can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/index.asp. Some detail about them is provided below.\n2.2.2.1 Introduction\nThe following questionnaires were employed in the ELS:2002 first follow-up: student questionnaire, dropout questionnaire, early graduate questionnaire, transfer student questionnaire, homeschool student questionnaire, and NPSQ. A school administrator questionnaire was also offered. For the ELS:2002 data user, it is necessary to specify which items are common to various questionnaires and which are unique, and how each questionnaire group relates to the analytic populations of interest. The ELS:2002 Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (Ingels et al. 2005b, NCES 2006-344) includes as its table 2 a crosswalk that shows shared and unique items across the first follow-up questionnaires.\n2.2.2.2 Questionnaire Assignment and Content\nFirst follow-up student questionnaire assignment and content. The student questionnaire was administered to sophomore cohort members who had remained in their base-year school as well as to a freshening sample of spring-term 12th-graders in those same schools. Students who completed the student questionnaire also were normally eligible for the first follow-up mathematics assessment. Some students were administered an abbreviated version of the questionnaire (these cases are flagged on the data file). The questionnaire was primarily selfadministered in in-school survey sessions, and secondarily, for some students, out of school through CATI or occasionally through mail or field interviews.\nSome alterations were required to adapt the paper-and-pencil questionnaire to CATI. Generally, the wording of the paper-and-pencil questions was made more conversational for the telephone interview to facilitate interviewer-respondent interaction. On occasion, adaptations were made to account for the fact that those interviewed by telephone did not have the benefit of seeing the entire question with all of its elements at once. For example, students were asked to report how much coursework they had taken in various subject areas. Respondents who completed the paper-and-pencil form were able to see the full range of mathematics courses\n21\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nlisted more or less in the sequence in which they are taught. In this context, it was clear to respondents that \u201cgeneral math\u201d referred to a basic math course as opposed to a catchall category. However, without the visual cues, telephone respondents may have misinterpreted general math to include all math courses. Therefore, for the telephone interview, general math was moved to the end of the list of math courses. Similar adaptations were required for the other telephone-administered questionnaires as well (transfer student, dropout, and so on). Generally, CATI telephone data collection took place subsequent to in-school data collection. Also, there was more ambiguity about the status (dropout, early graduate, transfer, homeschooled, and so on) of sample members interviewed outside the school setting. For this reason, the CATI interview included a series of screening questions to ensure that the proper questionnaire was administered. Such a screener was also used for field cases subject to in-person interview.\nThe student questionnaire comprised eight content modules. Part I of the questionnaire requested contact information in support of the longitudinal design.\nPart II covered the student\u2019s school experiences and activities. Data generated from this section provide information about extracurricular participation, computer use in English and math, the transition process from sophomore year to upper-level secondary school, and the relationship of curricular programs and coursetaking to educational achievement and persistence. Some of these data may be viewed as outcomes, influenced by factors studied in the base year, and others as predictors of outcomes in future rounds.\nPart III, \u201cHow You Spend Your Time,\u201d inquired about time usage on homework, television viewing, video and computer games, computers, nonschool reading, library use, and other activities. Part IV focused on plans and expectations for the future. It included questions that elicited information about students\u2019 educational and life goals and values. Part V, on education after high school, contained items on postsecondary planning steps and choice criteria. Part VI dealt with plans for work after high school. Part VII inquired about working for pay, including hours worked per week. Finally, Part VIII consisted of items on community, family, and friends.\nFirst follow-up dropout questionnaire assignment and content. Dropouts were defined as sophomore cohort members who were out of school in the spring term of 2004, who had not received a high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) credentials on or before March 15, 2004, and who had missed 4 or more consecutive weeks not due to accident or illness. Students who had a dropout episode but who had been in school for at least 2 weeks at the time of their school\u2019s Survey Day were administered the student questionnaire. The dropout questionnaire was administered in multiple modalities\u2014self-administration, in-person interviewer administration, and over the telephone by means of CATI.\nThere was considerable overlap between the student and dropout questionnaires. Part I collected locating information for longitudinal follow-up. Part II contained items on school experiences and activities. Dropouts were asked questions about the school they last attended and their participation in alternative educational programs. In addition, they were asked to supply their specific reasons for leaving school prior to graduation. They were asked as well about plans to get a GED or return to high school. Part III covered time use (reading, library patronage, television, videogames, computer use, and so on). Part IV asked about plans and expectations for the future. Part V provided information to identify the type and amount of work that dropouts were engaged in. It gathered information about students\u2019 work status and history, how much they\n22\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nearned, and how many hours they worked. Part VI asked about volunteer or community service work and the educational behaviors of friends.\nEarly graduate questionnaire assignment and content. Early graduates were interviewed outside the school setting, in multiple data collection modalities but most commonly by telephone. Early graduates were defined as sophomore cohort members who had graduated from high school or received a GED on or before March 15, 2004. The approach to early graduates differs somewhat across the several NCES high school cohort studies. In HS&B, the group that was captured was high school completers who finished early (i.e., prior to March 1, 1982). In NELS:88 and ELS:2002, an additional group is included, those who completed by alternative means (e.g., GED) prior to their classmates who were in the modal graduation sequence. In both HS&B and NELS:88, early graduates completed supplementary questions in addition to the full student questionnaire (answering from the vantage point of their recent high school experience). In ELS:2002, early graduates completed only a subset of the items on the student questionnaire, complemented by additional items pertaining to their situation. More specifically, early graduates were asked with whom they consulted when deciding to graduate early, the basis for that decision, and the means by which they did so. They also provided a history of their work and educational experiences since leaving high school.\nTransfer student questionnaire assignment and content. Sophomore cohort members who had transferred out of their base-year school to a new school received the transfer student questionnaire. Transfer students were asked a subset of items from the student questionnaire, covering the following topics: school experiences and activities; time use; plans and expectations for the future; education after high school; work after high school; and community, family, and friends. In addition, transfer students were asked when they transferred and their reasons for doing so. Transfer students did not complete a cognitive test, but their test scores have been imputed. Thus, 2004 math scores are available for both sophomore cohort \u201cmovers\u201d and \u201cstayers\u201d as well as freshened spring seniors (though not for dropouts or the homeschooled).\nHomeschool student questionnaire assignment and content. ELS:2002 does not provide a representative sample of homeschooled high school students. (In the base year, all study sophomores were selected from regular U.S. high schools.) Instead, homeschooled students in ELS:2002 generalize only to sophomores in regular high schools in spring term 2002 who were in a homeschool situation 2 years later. The primary motive for administering a separate questionnaire to this subset of the sophomore cohort was that neither the transfer student questionnaire items nor the dropout items fully fit their situation.\nHomeschooled students were asked about their schooling activities and status, including their grade, coursework completed in science and math, and steps taken toward college; how they spend their time; their plans and expectations for the future, including education and work after high school; work experiences; and community, family, and friends.\nNew participant supplement questionnaire assignment and content; NPS. There are essentially three categories of students who were ELS:2002 new participants in the first followup. One class is the spring-term high school seniors who entered the study through the freshening sample. A second class of new participants is that of base-year nonrespondents who completed a questionnaire in the first follow-up. The third and final class is that of sophomore cohort\n23\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\nmembers who were questionnaire-incapable17 in 2002 because of disability or a language barrier, but who were reclassified as capable of completing a questionnaire in 2004. (An example might be an English language learner who was not proficient in English in 2002 but, with 2 additional years of instruction, had reached a level of English proficiency sufficient to deal with the ELS:2002 first follow-up questionnaire.) While the first of these three classes is by definition a student, the second and third groups include both students and out-of-school members of the sophomore cohort (such as dropouts and early graduates).\nAny student new to the study at any of the core (base-year) schools was administered the NPSQ. However, transfer students and out-of-school cohort members were administered the relevant questionnaire and an NPS containing the key base-year items. For example, any student new to the study who had transferred to a new school was administered the transfer student questionnaire and an NPS. Any new respondent who was out of school, however, such as a dropout or early graduate, was administered the appropriate out-of-school questionnaire, as well as an NPS. Table 1 summarizes, for all new participants, use of the NPS and NPSQ, as well as base-year and first follow-up assessment status.\n\nTable 1.

These items are identical to those on the NPS. In addition, a subset of items included on the student questionnaire was also posed to new participants. These items (which are identical in content to the abbreviated student questionnaire) relate to topics such as school experiences and activities; time use; plans and expectations for the future; education and work\n\n17 Students who were questionnaire-incapable were ineligible for the assessment and were ineligible for the questionnaire, based on language barriers or severe disabilities. Nonetheless, contextual data were gathered for them in the base year, and in the first follow-up, transcripts were collected and their questionnaire status was re-assessed, in order to capture any change in status. In some ELS:2002 documentation, the questionnaire-incapable group is referred to as \u201cquestionnaire-ineligible.\u201d\n\n24\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\nafter high school; and work, community, family, and friendship experiences. In contrast, the NPS gathered the key base-year variables that also were included on the NPSQ.\nSchool administrator questionnaire content and content linkages. The school administrator questionnaire collected information on the school in four areas: school characteristics, structure, and policies; student characteristics and programs; teacher and library staff characteristics; and principal reports on the school environment. Many school-level variables of analytic interest also pose a high risk of disclosure of school identities. For this reason, a number of analysis variables have been limited to the restricted-use electronic codebook (ECB) or may be accessed through a link provided only on the restricted-use ECB.18\nSchool-level data are not nationally representative of American high schools in 2004, because the first follow-up sample did not factor in \u201cbirths\u201d of new schools and \u201cdeaths\u201d of existing schools between 2002 and 2004. First follow-up school data, however, do provide a statistical portrait of a nationally representative sample of American high schools with 10th grades in 2002 (2 years later).\n\n2.3 ELS:2002 Base-Year and First Follow-up Assessment Battery\nBefore considering test development and the mathematics and reading assessment frameworks, it is useful, as a point of entry into the first follow-up achievement tests, to consider the fact of test availability in conjunction with the main sample populations for which questionnaires were designed. As table 2 makes clear, the entire responding questionnairecapable sophomore cohort was eligible to be tested in the base year. However, as table 2 also makes clear, not all groups were tested in the first follow-up, nor were test scores imputed for all groups.\n\nTable 2. Assessment availability status, by sample group: 2004\n\nSample group (status in 2004) 2002 sophomores in core (base-year) schools in 2004 2002 sophomores in transfer schools in 2004 2004 freshened spring-term seniors 2002 sophomores: 2004 dropouts 2002 sophomores: 2004 early graduates 2002 sophomores: homeschooled in 2004\n\nBase year Tested1 Tested1\n\u2014 Tested1 Tested1 Tested1\n\nFirst follow-up Tested2 Imputed Tested2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n\u2014 Not available. 1 Imputed for base-year nonrespondents. 2 Imputed for first follow-up participant test noncompleters.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cFirst Follow-up, 2004.\u201d\n\n18 An example of the latter is the link to the NCES Common Core of Data and Private School Survey provided via the NCES identification code (BYNCESSI). An analyst with a restricted-use license can import into the analysis such variables as, for example, grade span (highest grade and lowest grade of school for any of the relevant academic years); percent minority; proportion free lunch qualifiers; enrollment; grade 9 enrollment (2000\u201301), grade 10 enrollment (2001\u201302), grade 11 enrollment (2002\u201303), grade 12 enrollment (2003\u201304); metropolitan status (urbanicity): locale code; student/teacher ratio; FTEs: total number of full-time classroom teachers; student enrollment: overall; school type (regular, vocational, special education, other); and so on. A further example of such a restricted-use link is to school ZIP code, which permits locale variables to be imported from the 2000 decennial Census, and residential geocoding at the level of state, county, tract, and block. For the second followup, the link to the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System is especially important, and additional links to extant data have been supplied in the second follow-up, and are fully described in appendix N.\n\n25\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n2.3.1 Test Design and Development Test specifications for the ELS:2002 base year and first follow-up were adapted from\nframeworks used for NELS:88. There were two levels to the framework: content areas and cognitive processes. Mathematics tests contained items in arithmetic, algebra, geometry/ measurement, data/probability, and advanced topics (including analytic geometry and precalculus but not calculus). The tests also reflected cognitive process categories of skill/ knowledge, understanding/comprehension, and problem solving. The test questions were selected from previous assessments: NELS:88, NAEP, and PISA. Most of the base-year items were multiple choice (about 10 percent of the base-year mathematics items were open-ended). In the first follow-up, all items were multiple choice.\nBoth 10th-grade and 12th-grade items were field tested in 2001, and 12th-grade items were field tested again in 2003.19 Items were selected or modified based on field test results. Final forms were assembled based on psychometric characteristics and coverage of framework categories.\nThe ELS:2002 assessments were designed to maximize the accuracy of measurement that could be achieved in a limited amount of testing time while minimizing floor and ceiling effects by matching sets of test questions to initial estimates of students\u2019 achievement. In the base year, this was accomplished by means of a two-stage test. In 10th grade, all students received a short multiple-choice routing test, scored immediately by survey administrators, who then assigned each student to a low, middle, or high difficulty second-stage form, depending on the student\u2019s number of correct answers in the routing test. In the 12th-grade administration, students were assigned to an appropriate test form based on their performance in 10th grade. Cut points for the 12th-grade low, middle, and high forms were calculated by pooling information from the field tests for 10th and 12th grades in 2001, the 12th-grade field test in 2003, and the 10th-grade national sample. Item and ability parameters were estimated on a common scale. Growth trajectories for longitudinal participants in the 2001 and 2003 field tests were calculated, and the resulting regression parameters were applied to the 10th-grade national sample. Test forms were designed to match the projected achievement levels of the lowest and highest 25 percent, as well as the middle 50 percent of the base-year sample 2 years later. An additional test form with a broad range of item difficulty was assembled for administration to follow-up participants who were new to the sample or who had not received a mathematics score in 10th grade. Additions to and deletions from the base-year sample resulted in 23 percent, 42 percent, and 26 percent of the follow-up sample taking the low, middle, and high difficulty forms, respectively, with the remaining 10 percent taking the broad-band form. Each of the four test forms contained 32 multiple-choice items.\n19 For more details about the field tests, see Burns et al. (2003) and appendix J of the Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation, Ingels et al. (2005b).\n26\n\n\fChapter 2.

Additional tables are presented later that break down assignments of items by content and process by test form, and thus show the impact of overlap (any given unique item may appear on one or more forms).21 Table 4 and table 5 show the numbers and percentages of unique mathematics test items devoted to each content area for the base-year and the first follow-up test batteries.

Robitaille et al. (1993) point out that such grids somewhat oversimplify the interrelatedness of elements in the scheme. Analysts should consider that knowledge and abilities or behavior in one area of mathematics are not unconnected to knowledge and skills in other areas. As the National Assessment Governing Board has remarked on its 2005 NAEP mathematics framework (NAGB 2004), its divisions \u201care not intended to separate mathematics into discrete elements. Rather, they are intended to provide a helpful classification scheme that describes the full spectrum of mathematical content assessed by NAEP. Classifying items into one primary content area is not always clear cut, but doing so brings us closer to the goal of ensuring that important mathematical concepts and skills are assessed in a balanced way.\u201d 21 There was also overlap across waves, in that some items were used both in the base year and first follow-up.\n27\n\n\fChapter 2.

Again, forms were assigned on the basis of performance on a routing test in the base year, but were assigned on the basis of the base-year ability estimate in the first follow-up. As earlier noted, those who had not been tested in the base year were given a broad range form in 2004. While all examinees received a 32-item form in 2004, the number of items ranged from 40 to 42 in the base year, except for a handful of students who received the single-stage 23-item version of the base-year assessment.\n\nTable 7.

There are four content areas:\n\u2022 biographical;\n\u2022 literary (including both poetry and prose);\n\u2022 scientific (includes graphical displays as well as prose); and\n\u2022 social studies.\nThere are three cognitive process areas: reproduction of detail, comprehension of thought (translating verbal statements into concepts), and inference/evaluative judgment (drawing conclusions based on the material presented). In the reading assessment (conducted in the base year only), there are 51 unique items, 11 of which are used twice (i.e., across two forms). Distribution of unique items (again, some items were repeated, to link forms) across the content areas is summarized in Table 10, while distribution across cognitive process areas is summarized in table 11.\n\n22 IRT stands for Item Response Theory. In ELS:2002, IRT was used both for vertical equating (linking the tests across grades 10 and 12) and lateral (or horizontal) equating (linking to HS&B in 1980 and to NELS:88 in 1990 and 1992). More generally, IRT is a test analysis procedure that applies mathematical models to the probability that any given examinee will provide a correct test response. Specifically, IRT uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted answers to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across different test forms within a domain. In estimating a student\u2019s ability, IRT also accounts for each test question\u2019s difficulty, discriminating ability, and a guessing factor. For introductory information on IRT, see Embretson and Reise (2000) or Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991).

For examples of the use of the ELS:2002 IRT-estimated number-right and probability of proficiency scores in cross-cohort analysis, see Cahalan et al. (2006). For an example of their use in\n\n32\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\nlongitudinal analysis, see Bozick and Ingels (2007). For an example (from NELS:88) of use of a NAEP-scaled score, see Scott and Ingels (2007).\n\n2.3.4.1 Norm-referenced Scores: Standardized Scores (T-scores)\nThe standardized scores (theta or T-scores) are overall measures of status at a point in time, but they are norm-referenced rather than criterion-referenced. They do not answer the question, \u201cWhat skills do students have?\u201d but rather, \u201cHow do they compare with their peers?\u201d The transformation to a familiar metric with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 facilitates comparisons in standard deviation units. For example, an individual with a T-score of 65 (or a subgroup with a mean of 65) has demonstrated achievement one and one-half standard deviations above the national average for 12th-graders, whereas a score of 45 would correspond to half a standard deviation below the norm. These numbers do not indicate whether students have mastered a particular body of material, but rather what their standing is relative to others. Base-year and first follow-up T-scores are documented in table 15.\n\nTable 15.

Quarter 1 corresponds to the lowest achieving quarter of the population, quarter 4 to the highest. Table 16 contains variable names, descriptions, and ranges for the quartile scores.\n\nTable 16.

The criterion is the set of skills defined by the framework and represented by the assessment item pool. These scores are useful in identifying cross-sectional differences among subgroups in overall achievement level. They provide a summary measure of achievement useful for correlational analysis with status variables, such as demographics, school\n\n33\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\ntype, or behavioral measures, and may be used in multivariate models as well. These scores may also be used as longitudinal measures of overall growth, when an aggregated measure is preferred. (When a disaggregated measure is desired, in order to measure and compare gains made at different points on the score scale [that is, to target a hierarchy of specific sets of skills], the probability of proficiency scores may be preferred in longitudinal analysis.)\nFor mathematics, 10th- and 12th-grade IRT-estimated number-right scores are available on both the ELS:2002 and the 1992 NELS:88 scale. Tenth-grade math scores are also available on the 1990 NELS:88 scale, to which 1980 HS&B scores can also be linked. For base-year reading, the scores are available on the NELS:88 scale as well as the ELS:2002 scale. The 1990 NELS:88 scale is documented in Ingels et al. (1994a,b) while the 1992 scale is documented in Rock and Pollack (1995). Linkage between NELS:88 and ELS:2002 was achieved through common item (anchor) equating.

For example, students who made 5-point gains by mastering arithmetical operations are learning very different lessons from those gaining 5 points at the high end of the scale by learning more advanced mathematics. Although the gains in number of scale score points may be the same, the interpretation, and the relationship with other factors such as coursework, can be expected to be quite different. For this reason, a continuous score representing the probability of proficiency at each of five mastery levels in mathematics and three mastery levels in reading was generated.23\nCriterion-referenced proficiency probability scores are based on clusters of items that mark different levels on the reading and mathematics scales developed in NELS:88. Clusters of four items each were identified in the NELS:88 tests that marked three hierarchical levels in reading and five in mathematics. While clusters of four items anchor each mastery level, the probability of proficiency is a continuous score that does not depend on a student answering the actual items in each of the clusters but, rather, on the probability of a correct answer on these items given the overall pattern of response on the items completed. The three mastery levels for reading, and five for mathematics, are indicated below:\n\n23 For an illustration of the use of probability proficiencies in ELS:2002 math gain analysis, see Bozick and Ingels (2007). For further discussion of the nonequivalence of scale score points and consequent need (if achievement gain is to be fully interpreted) for multiple criterion-referenced proficiency levels that mark distinct learning milestones, see Rock (2007).\n35\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nProbability of Proficiency, Reading Mastery Levels:\n1. Simple reading comprehension, including reproduction of detail, and/or the author\u2019s main thought, such as identifying the objective of a character\u2019s action.\n2. Simple inferences beyond the author\u2019s main thought and/or understanding and evaluating abstract concepts, such as identifying the author\u2019s state of mind, or inferring the meaning of a metaphor from context.\n3. Complex inferences or evaluative judgments requiring multiple sources of information.\nProbability of Proficiency, Mathematics Mastery Levels:\n1. Simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers, such as simple arithmetic expressions involving multiplication or division of integers.\n2. Simple operations with decimals, fractions, powers, and roots, such as comparing expressions, given information about exponents.\n3. Simple problem solving, requiring the understanding of low-level mathematical concepts, such as simplifying an algebraic expression or comparing the length of line segments illustrated in a diagram.\n4. Understanding of intermediate-level mathematical concepts and/or multistep solutions to word problems such as drawing an inference based on an algebraic expression or inequality.\n5. Complex multistep word problems and/or advanced mathematics material such as a two-step problem requiring evaluation of functions.\nThe mastery levels are hierarchical in the sense that mastery of a higher level typically implies mastery at lower levels. The proficiency probabilities were computed using IRTestimated item parameters calibrated in NELS:88. Each proficiency probability represents the likelihood that a student would pass a given mastery level defined as above in the NELS:88 sample. It should be remembered that probability of proficiency scores are IRT-derived estimates based on overall performance rather than counts of actual item responses. The NELS:88 and ELS:2002 tests were semi-adaptive, with different forms keyed to different ability levels. Owing to the multiple test forms used in NELS:88 and ELS:2002, not all sophomores received all items. Nevertheless, the IRT model permits proficiency probabilities to be estimated, even for those sophomores who were not administered a particular proficiency/mastery cluster. The mean of a proficiency probability score aggregated over a subgroup of students is analogous to an estimate of the percentage of students in the subgroup who have displayed mastery of the particular skill. Because the range of the scores is 0 to 1, means can be expressed in percentage form.24 For example, the weighted mean for mastery of math level 1 in ELS:2002 is 0.92, which is equivalent to saying that 92 percent of the sophomore cohort had achieved mastery at this level (simple arithmetical operations on whole numbers). The probability of proficiency scores are summarized in table 21 (base year) and table 22 (first follow-up) below.\n24 On the interpretation of a probability as a proportion, see, for example, Fleiss, Levin, and Paik (2003, p. 1).\n36\n\n\fChapter 2.

IRT scaling and linking procedures follow the NELS:88 precedent, using a 3-parameter IRT model in PARSCALE (Muraki and Bock 1991); the NELS:88 procedure is described in Rock and Pollack (1995).\nReliabilities were computed using the variance of the posterior distribution of plausible values for each test-taker\u2019s theta (ability estimate), compared with the variance of the thetas across the whole sample (i.e., error variance versus total variance). The reliability estimates are the proportion of \u201ctrue variance\u201d (1 minus error variance) divided by total variance (see Samejima [1994] on this procedure).\nFor the combined base-year and first follow-up tests, the reliability was 0.92. This reliability is a function of the variance of repeated estimates of the IRT ability parameter (withinvariance), compared with the variability of the sample as a whole (Ingels et al. 2005b). This 0.92 reliability applies to all scores derived from the IRT estimation. Imputed test scores were not included in the reliability estimation.\nThe use of IRT-scale scores and the adaptive testing approach used in ELS:2002 limit the concern that gain scores may be unreliable due to floor and ceiling effects.\n\n37\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n2.3.4.6 Indicators of Student Motivation at Both Testing Points\nOne major concern in measuring achievement is whether students are motivated to do their best on low-stakes tests, such as the mathematics assessment in ELS:2002. This concern may be particularly strongly felt with reference to spring-term seniors, who may be in the process of disengaging from high school in anticipation of the transition to postsecondary education or the work force, and who may have had their fill of assessments, in the form of such high-stakes tests as exit exams and college entrance exams. Although the greatest concern may be felt about spring-term seniors, concerns about motivation rightly encompass high school sophomores as well.\nWhile there is no single definitive measure of student motivation on the tests, there are several possible indicators of the comprehensiveness and quality of the test data collected. For example, in scoring the 2002 and 2004 tests, the assessment subcontractor examined \u201cpattern marking\u201d25 and missing responses. They did not find evidence of pattern marking, nor high levels of omitted items. For example, in the ELS:2002 first follow-up with around 11,000 mathematics assessments completed, 17 assessments were discarded for these reasons: 11 test records were deleted because tests were incomplete (fewer than 10 items answered) and 6 more because response patterns indicated lack of motivation to answer questions to the best of the student\u2019s ability. In the base year, 10 assessments were discarded for incompleteness, and none for pattern marking.\nGiven that participation in the survey was voluntary, and that a student could have opted to not participate, or to participate by completing the questionnaire only, the student response rate may also be an indirect indicator of student test-taking motivation. Generally NAEP sees a drop in participation in grade 12, compared to grades 4 and 8. For ELS:2002\u2019s predecessor study, NELS:88, lower participation rates were registered in 12th grade as well.26\nFor the ELS:2002 base year, the weighted participation rate was 87 percent. Of the 15,362 participants, 95 percent (weighted) also completed the test. (Some who did not complete the test could not be validly tested for language or disability reasons.)\nFor the ELS:2002 first follow-up (2004), when most sample members were high school seniors, the overall participation rate increased slightly from the base year, to a weighted 89 percent. Of the test-eligible questionnaire completers, some 87 percent (weighted) of\n25 An example of \u201cpattern marking\u201d would be responses of \u201cA\u201d for all answers or ABCABCABC through most or all of the test. Patterned responses such as \u201c11111111\u2026\u201d or \u201c12345432123454321\u2026\u201d or \u201c1515151515\u2026\u201d can be identified by a simple algorithm sequentially comparing the difference between each test item and the next one, and calculating the variance of the absolute differences. In the first example given, the inter-item differences are always zero, in the second, always 1 or -1, and in the third, 4 or -4. In each case, the variance of the absolute differences is equal to zero, whereas for four- or five-choice test items, the variance of absolute differences for motivated respondents tends to be close to 1.0. All tests with variances of less than .5 were reviewed and those few with identifiable pattern marking were deleted. 26 Fully interpreting the senior year decline in test completion in NELS:88 is difficult. There was sample dispersion, and the policy was to test transfer students, though the resources for doing so were limited. In consequence, often a questionnaire might be completed over the telephone and the test sacrificed, despite the student\u2019s willingness to be assessed. In contrast, in ELS:2002, transfers were ineligible for the first follow-up test and did not count against the assessment response rate\u2014however, test scores were imputed for all transfers. No test score imputation was undertaken in NELS:88. Because studies such as NELS:88 and ELS:2002 induct their initial samples prior to 12th grade, they may be less affected by a \u201csenioritis\u201d phenomenon, in that students have already committed to the study and may have developed a sense of membership in the panel. Certainly for HS&B, the prior longitudinal cohort study that in its sophomore cohort most closely resembles ELS:2002 in design, participation was higher in the modally 12th-grade first follow-up than in the 10th-grade base year (and higher than the 12th-grade participation rate for the HS&B senior cohort that was selected in the same schools in 1980).\n38\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nquestionnaire completers also completed the test. Looking specifically at questionnaire completion for senior cohort members who remained in the same school at both points in time, a 97 percent survey participation rate was obtained both overall and for each race/ethnicity groups (Ingels et al. 2005b, table 39). If voluntary participation rates are to some degree indicative of student motivation, then there is some evidence that seniors may have taken the assessment seriously.27 The overall pattern\u2014lack of high numbers of omitted response, lack of \u201cpatternmarking,\u201d high test reliability,28 and high participation rates in both rounds of the study\u2014argue for the credibility and quality of the test data. In short, while lack of motivation for some students surely affected test results in ways that could not be identified and edited out, most test takers answered all or almost all the items, and internal-consistency reliabilities were high for all subgroups examined, both in the field tests and full-scale studies. These are good indications that interpretation of test results in the aggregate should not be significantly compromised by low test-taking motivation.\n2.3.4.7 Score Linkages With External Assessments: NAEP and PISA\nThe ELS:2002\u2014NAEP 12th-grade linkage. One new assessment variable has been produced subsequent to the release of the first follow-up student data in 2005. More specifically, the ELS:2002 12th-grade mathematics test has been linked to 12th-grade NAEP. The 2004 ELS:2002 first follow-up mathematics tests did not share common items with the NAEP 2005 mathematics assessment. As a result, common item equating was not possible, so score scales were linked by means of an equipercentile transformation.\nEquating\u2014\u201cthe process of developing a conversion from the system of units of one form of a test to the system of units of another form so that scores derived from the two forms after conversion will be equivalent and interchangeable\u201d (Angoff 1982)\u2014is the strongest form of test linkage. It ensures that the scores that are linked are truly equivalent and statistically and conceptually interchangeable. However, a variety of stringent conditions must be met to successfully equate. These conditions include essential alikeness in content such that the two tests are congeneric (i.e., they measure the same underlying factor); the tests must measure the same populations; they should be of similar reliability; they should meet the condition of equity (it should be a matter of indifference to the result which test examinees take); and they should be symmetric (the function equating X to Y should be the inverse of the function equating Y to X) (see Kolen and Brennan 2004; Linn 1993; Lord 1980; Mislevy 1992).\nArguably, NAEP and ELS:2002 mathematics content is quite similar, and both tests attempt to measure the same underlying factor. At grade 12 in 2005, NAEP\u2019s primary emphasis was on geometry/measurement and algebra (NAGB 2004). This is also the case for the ELS:2002 tests in both the high and medium form. (Of course the ELS:2002 assessment is individually adaptive, and for this reason, understandably, there is proportionately more arithmetic [number properties and operations, in NAEP parlance] and less geometry in the ELS:2002 low form [taken by the bottom 23 percent of examinees] than in the NAEP test.)\n27 Note that ELS:2002 sample members were given a cash incentive for participation. The effects of payment on test-taking motivation are unknown. Because test reliabilities were high and incomplete tests and pattern marking did not seem to be a problem, one interpretation might be that students made a reasonable effort, regardless of whether they did so out of a sense of obligation for being paid to do a task or for more idealistic reasons. 28 Imputed test scores were not included in the calculation of reliabilities.\n39\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nThe tested populations are also highly similar\u2014spring-term high school seniors\u2014though not identical (ELS:2004 tested 2004 seniors, and NAEP 2005 seniors). However, there are also many important differences between ELS:2002 and NAEP that impact the linking procedures and interpretation of linked scores. Though test content is similar, item formats were somewhat different (a mixture of free response and multiple choice for NAEP, but only the latter for the ELS:2002 12th-grade math test). While both the NAEP and ELS:2002 mathematics assessments are highly reliable, they achieve this end through different means (the ELS:2002 tests assigned different forms to candidates of different ability; NAEP, on the other hand, includes auxiliary information in calculating the posterior estimates of ability). Nonetheless, the NAEP design is driven by the need to maximize reliability for group-level measurement, and, unlike ELS:2002 scores, NAEP scores are not designed to be reliable at the individual level (Beaton and Gonzalez 1995). The condition of equity (that examinees should be indifferent as to which test they take) is difficult to meet given the difference between an adaptive test in ELS:2002 and a test based on a matrix sample of items in NAEP. Finally, scoring methods differed in several respects, and may particularly have affected the ability to transform the scores in the tails of the distribution.\nThe NAEP-ELS:2002 linked mathematics score should therefore be described as a concordance29 rather than an equating. Though the scores may be comparable (there is a linkage that is based on distributional similarities), no claim is made that the scores may be treated as equivalent (that is, that they have precisely the same meaning). The NAEP-scale score represents the score level achieved by students of the same percentile rank in two populations that were matched as closely as was possible given the differences in sample (e.g., only ELS:2002 12thgraders were used in the linking exercise). Linking scales to yield concordant scores relies on minimal assumptions about the comparability of the tests involved (on concordance, see Dorans 2004 and Pommerich and Dorans 2004). Neither means, standard deviations, reliabilities, nor standard errors of measurement are assumed to be the same. The tests need only be roughly congeneric in that they measure essentially the same basic underlying factor.\nLinking procedures for the ELS:2002 NAEP-scaled math score. To maximize the likeness of the two linking samples, a subsample of ELS:2002 students was used to compute equivalent percentiles. Transformations were computed based only on the subset of ELS:2002 first followup participants who were in 12th grade in spring 2004 (using the \u201cG12COHRT\u201d flag to select cases, and the \u201cF1QWT\u201d weight to generalize to the national population of 12th-graders).\nThe equipercentile transformation was carried out using 3-moment smoothing of the weighted frequency distributions. Plots of the equipercentile-equated scores showed extreme deviations in the tails of the distribution from a trend line based on linear approximation. These deviations are probably due to the methodology employed in NAEP scoring: the NAEP scores are transformations of normally distributed IRT ability estimates, which if no shrinkage is imposed, tend to have long tails. The ELS:2002 scores, which are sums of probabilities, do not. As a result, the equipercentile conversion becomes distorted in the tails of the distributions. Throughout most of the score range, a 1-point difference in ELS:2002 mathematics scale corresponds to a difference of about 2.25 points in the NAEP metric. But in the extreme tails of the distribution a 1-point difference in ELS:2002 mathematics score corresponds to a difference of up to 4 points in the NAEP metric. Although these distortions occur only for a small number of students, a combination of the equipercentile transformation and a linear approximation of the\n29 Another test score concordance appears on the ELS:2002 second follow-up data files, a concordance between sample members\u2019 ACT and SAT scores.\n40\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\ntransformation was used to assign scores. The cut points for using equipercentile versus linear transformation were selected such that the ELS:2002 to NAEP link would be monotonic, and are indicated in table 23.\n\nTable 23.

While the historical NAEP vertical scale has been expressed in a 0\u2013500 range, NAEP 2005 12th-grade mathematics results have not been vertically scaled with 8th- and 4th-grade results, and are on a 12th-grade scale of 0\u2013300. (The ELS:2002 scale has a range of 0\u201385.)\n\nAs further documentation of the linkage, sample differences in weighted population estimates were reviewed for each survey. Percentages of racial/ethnic groups were quite similar (given slightly different definitions). Detecting whether the small differences are due to sampling variability or adjustments, or other factors such as differences in race/ethnicity classification schemes, is impossible (table 24).\n\nTable 24.

Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nscores could also be assigned for ELS:2002 first follow-up participants who were not high school seniors (for example, 2002 sophomores who were held back a grade between 2002 and 2004), making the NAEP-scaled score available for all 13,702 sample members with an ELS:2002 first follow-up mathematics score.\nAs described above, differences between the ELS:2002 and NAEP tests, scoring methods, and populations mean that the link reported here cannot be regarded as a true equating. Although procedures were carried out to compensate for population differences and scoring methods, no claim is made that the scores may be treated as equivalent. It is more appropriate to refer to this link as a concordance: the NAEP-scale score represents the score level achieved by students of the same percentile rank in two populations that were matched as closely as was possible given the differences described above.\nPISA linkage. In addition to the NAEP linkage, two further external linkages were carried out, both of them with PISA\u2014reading (2000) and mathematics (2003). The PISA-scaled reading score is BYPISARE; the PISA-scaled math score is BYPISAME. For full documentation of these linkages, see Ingels et al. (2004, 2005b).\n2.4 High School Transcript Component; Course Offerings File\nThe ELS:2002 high school transcript data collection sought information about coursetaking from students\u2019 official high school records (e.g., courses taken while attending secondary school, credits earned, year and term a specific course was taken, and final grades). When available, other information, such as dates enrolled, reason for leaving school, and standardized test scores such as ACT and SAT30 results, was collected. Because of the size and complexity of the file and the reporting variation by school, additional variables were constructed from the raw transcript file to facilitate analyses. These variables include standardized grade point averages, academic \u201cpipeline\u201d measures, and total credits earned by subject area. The construction of many of the transcript variables is based on Carnegie units. A Carnegie unit is equal to a course taken every day, one period per day, for a full school year. All transcript items and composite variables have been appended to the ELS:2002 restricted-use data files and require special access for individual analysis. However, summary variables, such as Carnegie units in the main academic subjects, have been included on the ECB and the Data Analysis System (DAS).\nIn addition to high school transcripts, information is also provided about the course offerings of the base-year schools. For analysis purposes, school course offering information can be attached to the student record.\n2.5 Second Follow-up Questionnaire Content\nA single web-based instrument was developed for ELS:2002 second follow-up sample members, in which the respondents could self-administer the interview or complete it assisted by a telephone interviewer or field interviewer. In all modes of administration, the identical webbased instrument was accessed. This approach eliminated the potential for mode of\n30 Transcript-reported SAT and ACT scores have been augmented in the second follow-up by additional scores obtained through records-matching with the test developers. Data from the multiple sources were merged, and an SAT-ACT concordance was created, so that both sets of scores would be on a common scale.\n42\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nadministration effects due to differences in question wording or response options.31 Also, content areas most susceptible to interviewer (versus self-administration) effects, such as sensitive items with high potential for eliciting social desirability biases, were largely avoided. Finally, the instrument design process took into account the need to ensure that items would reflect similar levels of cognitive demand across modes (e.g., formats requiring extensive visual information to be easily understood would not be appropriate, since visual cues could not be provided in a telephone interview).\nThe instrument development process was launched with a meeting of the study\u2019s TRP in August 2005. Panelists recommended that the full-scale interview capitalize on the study\u2019s rare opportunity to examine the transition from high school to postsecondary education. Project instrument development staff were urged to concentrate on issues related to college access and choice in this round of the study. The project team reworked the field test instrument, consulting with experts in postsecondary education as needed. Instrument items were drawn from a number of studies including Baccalaureate and Beyond, Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study, HS&B, NELS:88, and the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.\nThe interview was organized into four substantive sections: High School, Postsecondary Education, Employment, and Community. The interview concluded with a Locating section. Appendix E includes flowcharts for each of the four substantive sections of the interview. They document the sequence of questions and the web-based instrument\u2019s routing logic. A facsimile of the instrument, also found in appendix E, documents question wording and response options. An in-depth description of each of these sections follows.\nThe first section, High School, collected retrospective information about high school completion. The majority of respondents skipped this section entirely because their high school completion date and the type of high school credential they earned were preloaded into the instrument at the start of data collection. The preloaded information was drawn from high school transcripts when available or from the first follow-up early graduate (see F1S15 and F1E27) and dropout (see F1D41 and F1D45) interviews. The high school transcript data were still undergoing quality control procedures when the second follow-up data collection began. In an effort to preload only stable transcript data, transcript information was only preloaded for cases where the following conditions were met: (1) the high school completion date was May or June 2004, the modal dates of completion; (2) the credential was a high school diploma or a certificate of attendance; and (3) quality control had been completed.32 In summary, second follow-up respondents were asked whether they had completed high school, the date they had completed high school, and the credential earned if they had not already provided this information in a first follow-up interview and any one of the following conditions were met: (1) their high school transcript was not collected, (2) their high school transcript data (at the start of data collection) indicated that they had completed high school in a month other than May or June 2004, (3) their high school transcript data (at the start of data collection) indicated they had earned a GED, or\n31 Of course, eliminating these two sources of mode effects is not to say that mode effects could not have occurred (for example, on the basis of differences such as self- versus interviewer administration). However, methodological work with similar items, age groups, and populations in the NCES postsecondary longitudinal studies (which also employ both web self-administration and computer-assisted interviewer administration) has not uncovered mode effect problems (see, for example, the following NCES methodology and field test reports: NCES 2004-02, NCES 2006-01, and NCES 2005-02). 32 Despite this effort, the preloaded transcript information was later determined to be incorrect for some of the cases. Consequently, the preloaded data do not match the final released transcript data for a small number of cases. F2PHSDG indicates the credential earned as it was preloaded. The preloaded high school completion dates are found in F2PHSDT.\n43\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n(4) their high school transcript data (at the start of data collection) indicated that a high school credential had not been awarded by the high school(s) providing transcripts. As will be discussed in greater detail where appropriate, high school completion dates, as preloaded or reported in the interview, played an important role in instrument routing logic and composite variable construction (see section 7.2.2.1).33\nA second important purpose of the High School section was to retrospectively classify respondents as spring-term 2004 12th-graders, spring-term 2004 dropouts, neither, or for a small set both (see G12COHRT and F2SP04DO). The spring term of 2004 is of interest as this was the reference period for the first follow-up data collection. For a more detailed description of the classification procedures see section 7.2.2.1.\nFirst follow-up nonrespondents who were identified as spring-term 2004 dropouts as well as those identified as early alternative completers (earned a GED prior to April 2004) were asked a series of retrospective questions about why they had dropped out of high school prior to or during the spring term of 2004. These questions were repeated from the first follow-up dropout and early graduate interviews. Responses to these items from the first follow-up and the second follow-up interviews are combined in composite variables (see F2WYLV1\u2013F2WYLV14).\nFirst follow-up questions about the GED were also repeated in the second follow-up High School section. All second follow-up respondents who reported earning a GED since they were last interviewed were asked a series of questions on the topic of their high school credential. Like the questions related to dropping out of high school, data collected from both rounds of the study were combined in composite variables (see F2GEDPRG, F2GEDOTH, F2GEDST, and F2WYGED1\u2013F2WYGED6).\nQuestions in the High School section of the interview also identified a small set of respondents who were attending high school in the spring term of 2006 (F2RTYPE = 6). Many of the questions in the remainder of the interview, particularly those related to postsecondary education, did not pertain to these individuals. Therefore, these high school students were not asked to answer the majority of the questions in the Postsecondary Education section and select questions thereafter.\nThe Postsecondary Education section of the interview, the point of entry for most respondents, focused on education after high school. Questions pertained to the application process, admissions, financial aid offers, institutions attended, experiences at these institutions, and educational expectations. Retrospective information about dual enrollment experiences at postsecondary institutions during high school was not collected.\nSince the primary focus of this interview is the transition out of high school, respondents who submitted applications more than once, as for example, to transfer from one postsecondary institution to another, were asked to identify only those postsecondary institutions they had applied to as part of their first round of applications. For the same reason, the first postsecondary institution the respondent attended after high school received special attention in a series of questions (see F2PS1, F2B13A\u2013F, F2B14, F2B15, F2B16A\u2013C, F2B17A\u2013D, F2B18A\u2013G). In most cases, the school of interest in these questions was the postsecondary institution with the\n33 The data user is cautioned that many of the variables that provide data as it was collected in the High School section of the second follow-up interview, that is, variables with an \u201cF2A\u201d prefix, are not standalone variables to be used in analyses. They serve as inputs to composite variables only. They are only provided on the ECB for reference or validation of composite variable construction.\n44\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\nearliest enrollment date after high school completion or exit. In cases for which enrollment in a fall-term postsecondary institution was immediately preceded by summer school attendance, the fall-term institution was selected as the first.34\nComplete month-by-month enrollment histories for all postsecondary institutions attended after high school were collected in the Postsecondary Education section. These enrollment histories in conjunction with the date of high school completion or exit, as preloaded or reported in the High School section of the interview, were used to classify respondents into one of six mutually exclusive categories (see F2RTYPE): Standard enrollees, Delayers, Leavers, Delayer-Leavers, Nonenrollees, and High School students. Table 25 indicates the characteristics of each respondent type.\n\nTable 25.

First we will address those who reported some postsecondary enrollment following high school. Standard enrollees were respondents who enrolled in a postsecondary institution \u201con time,\u201d that is, within the first enrollment window following their high school completion or exit date35 and had some postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. Delayers were enrollees who started their postsecondary education after the first enrollment window following their high school completion or exit date36 and had some postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. Leavers were enrollees who began their postsecondary education \u201con time,\u201d but had no postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. Note that leavers did not necessarily drop out of their postsecondary program. Leavers may have completed a postsecondary credential. Delayer-leavers were both delayers and leavers.\n\n34 These questions pertained to a fall-term postsecondary institution following summer school enrollment when the following conditions were met: (1) the respondent completed high school, enrolled in a summer school (in May, June, or July), ended summer school (in May, June, July, or August), and enrolled in a postsecondary institution for the fall term (in August, September, or October) within the same calendar year; and (2) the earliest and most recent dates of enrollment at the fall-term postsecondary institution spanned a greater number of months than the dates of enrollment at the summer school. 35 Respondents who completed or dropped out of high school from January through July were considered \u201con time\u201d if they began their postsecondary education by October of the same calendar year. Respondents who completed or dropped out of high school from August through December were considered \u201con time\u201d if they began their postsecondary education by the following February. 36 Respondents who completed or dropped out of high school from January through July were classified as delayers if they did not begin their postsecondary education by October of the same calendar year. Respondents who completed or dropped out of high school from August through December were classified as delayers if they did not begin their postsecondary education by the following February.\n\n45\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\nRespondents in the remaining two categories had no postsecondary enrollment following high school. The vast majority had completed or dropped out of high school. These respondents were classified as Nonenrollees. As noted previously, a small number of respondents reported that they were still enrolled in high school. These respondents are identified as High schoolers.\nTable 26 illustrates which questions associated with various postsecondary education topics were administered to each respondent type. All respondents, with the exception of high school students, were asked if they had applied to a postsecondary institution since high school. Those who reported that they had were asked follow-up questions about those applications, whether those applications were accepted, and the financial aid offers received. All of these posthigh school respondents, regardless of whether they reported applying to a postsecondary institution, were asked whether they had attended a postsecondary institution following high school. Respondents who indicated they had not were then classified as nonenrollees. All others were then asked to name the institution(s) they had attended and provide the dates of their enrollment. Based on these enrollment dates and the date of their high school completion or exit, enrollees were subdivided into the standard enrollees, delayers, leavers, and delayer-leavers as described previously.

The initial two topics pertained to employment nonconcurrent with postsecondary education. The questions in the first of these two sets of questions referred to the first job after high school. Delayers, delayer-leavers, and nonenrollees were eligible for these items since these respondents all had a significant period of time after high school when they were not enrolled at a postsecondary institution. The second employment module focused on employment at the time of the interview. Nonenrollees, delayerleavers, leavers, and high schoolers were subject to this module because they were not enrolled at a postsecondary institution at the time of the interview. The next set of questions focused on jobs held by postsecondary students during the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 academic years. All four types of postsecondary enrollees were eligible for these questions if their postsecondary attendance coincided with these academic years. In contrast, only nonenrollees were eligible for the next topic. They were questioned about months of unemployment when a gap existed between high school and their first job, their first job and their current job, and/or their first job and the date of the interview if they were not currently working. Based on these responses as well as the employment dates provided in the first two modules, month-by-month employment status variables were constructed beginning with June 2004 (see F2EM0206-F2EM0608\u2013\n\n47\n\n\fChapter 2. Base-Year Through Second Follow-up Instrumentation\n\nF2EM0608). Most of the remaining questions in the Employment section pertained to all respondent types. Topics included income, finances, and occupational expectations at age 30.\n\nTable 27.

With one minor exception, all questions pertained to all respondent types. The interview concluded with the Locating section which collected information that will be used to contact the respondents in the next round of the study. Since these data are not provided on the ECB or the DAS, documentation for this section is not provided.\n\nA complete list of variables provided on the second follow-up ECB and DAS is presented in appendix L. See appendix N for a discussion of ancillary data that were collected in the second follow-up to augment sample members\u2019 records. Several sources of extant data were tapped including the College Board, ACT, ACE GED testing service, and federal loan and grant databases. Appendix M lists second follow-up composite variables with brief descriptions. A descriptive overview of composite variables constructed from second follow-up data and extant data is provided in chapter 7 (section 7.2.2).\n\n48\n\n\fChapter 3 Sample Design\n3.1 Base-Year and First Follow-up Sample Design\n3.1.1 Overview\nThis chapter describes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) base-year, first follow-up, and second follow-up sample designs, including the design of the first follow-up high school transcript component.\nSection 3.1 provides a historical summary of sample design issues for the base year and first follow-up. Starting with section 3.2, the chapter provides an expanded discussion of the sample design in the context of the ELS:2002 second follow-up in 2006.\nThe ELS:2002 base-year sample design comprises two primary target populations\u2014 schools with 10th grades and sophomores in those schools\u2014in the spring term of the 2001\u201302 school year. ELS:2002 used a two-stage sample selection process. First, schools were selected. These schools were then asked to provide sophomore enrollment lists, from which students were selected.\nSchools and students are the study\u2019s basic units of analysis. School-level data reflect a school administrator questionnaire, a library media center questionnaire, a facilities checklist, and the aggregation of student data to the school level. Student-level data consist of student questionnaire and assessment data and reports from students\u2019 teachers and parents. (School-level data, however, can also be reported at the student level and serve as contextual data for students.)\nThe basis for the sampling frame for the first follow-up (2004) was the sample of schools and students used in the ELS:2002 base-year sample. There are two slightly different target populations for the first follow-up. One population consists of those students who were enrolled in the 10th grade in 2002. The other population consists of those students who were enrolled in the 12th grade in 2004. The former population includes students who dropped out of school between 10th and 12th grades, and such students are a major analytical subgroup, as are transfer students. Note that in the first follow-up, a student is defined as a member of the student sample; that is, an ELS:2002 spring 2002 sophomore or a freshened first follow-up spring 2004 12thgrader. In the first follow-up, high school transcripts were also collected. The basis for the transcript sample was all student sample members who had participated in either the 2002 base year, the 2004 first follow-up, or both.\n3.1.2 Base-Year Sample Design\nThe sample design for ELS:2002 is similar to the designs used in the three prior studies of the National Education Longitudinal Studies Program: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72), the High School and Beyond (HS&B) longitudinal study, and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). ELS:2002 is different from NELS:88 (but similar to HS&B) in that the ELS:2002 base-year sample students are 10thgraders rather than 8th-graders. As in NELS:88, Hispanics and Asians were oversampled in\n49\n\n\fChapter 3. Sample Design\nELS:2002. However, for ELS:2002, counts of Hispanics and Asians were obtained from the Common Core of Data and the Private School Survey to set the initial oversampling rates.\nELS:2002 used a two-stage sample selection process. First, schools were selected with probability proportional to size.37 School contacting resulted in 1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other private schools from a population of approximately 27,000 schools containing sophomores. Of the eligible schools, 752 agreed to participate in the study. These schools were then asked to provide sophomore enrollment lists. In the second stage of sample selection, approximately 26 students per school were selected from these lists. Additional information on the base-year sample design can be found in chapter 3 and appendix J of the base-year data file user\u2019s manual (Ingels et al. 2004, NCES 2004-405).\nThe target population of schools for the ELS:2002 base year consisted of regular public schools, including state Department of Education schools and charter schools, and Catholic and other private schools that contained 10th grades and were in the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia).\nThe sampling frame of schools was constructed with the intent to match the target population. However, selected schools were determined to be ineligible if they did not meet the definition of the target population. Responding schools were those schools that had a Survey Day (i.e., data collection occurred for students in the school).38 Of the 1,268 sampled schools, there were 1,221 eligible schools and 752 responding schools (68 percent weighted participation rate).\nA subset of most but not all responding schools also completed a school administrator questionnaire and a library or media center questionnaire (99 percent and 96 percent weighted response rates, respectively). Most nonresponding schools or their districts provided some basic information about school characteristics, so that the differences between responding and nonresponding schools could be better understood, analyzed, and adjusted. Additionally, RTI field staff completed a facilities checklist for each responding school.\nThe target population of students for ELS:2002 consisted of spring-term sophomores in 2002 (excluding foreign exchange students) enrolled in schools in the school target population. The sampling frames of students within schools were constructed with the intent to match the target population. However, selected students were determined to be ineligible if they did not meet the definition of the target population. Of the 19,218 sampled students, there were 17,591 eligible sophomores. The 15,362 participants on the public-use file represent a weighted student response rate of 87 percent.\nThe ELS:2002 base-year survey instruments comprised two assessments (reading and mathematics) and a student questionnaire. Participation in ELS:2002 was defined by questionnaire completion. Although most students were asked to complete the assessment battery in addition to the questionnaire, there were some cases in which a student completed the questionnaire but did not complete the assessments. Guidelines were provided to schools to assist them in determining whether students would be able to complete the ELS:2002 survey instruments.\n37 The size used was a composite measure of size based on school enrollment by race/ethnicity. See Appendix J of the Base Year Data File User\u2019s Manual (Ingels et al. 2004) for more details. 38 One eligible school had no eligible students selected in the sample. This school was considered a responding school.\n50\n\n\fChapter 3. Sample Design\nStudents who could not complete the ELS:2002 questionnaire (by virtue of limited English proficiency or physical or mental disability) were part of the expanded sample of 2002 sophomores who were followed in the study and eligibility status was reassessed 2 years later. There were 163 such students. To obtain additional information about their home background and school experiences, contextual data were collected from the base-year parent, teacher, and school administrator surveys.\nThe student sample was selected, when possible, in the fall or early winter so that sample teachers could be identified and materials could be prepared well in advance of Survey Day. However, selecting the sample in advance meant that some students transferred into the sample schools and others left between the time of sample selection and Survey Day. To address this issue, sample updating was conducted closer to the time of data collection. Complete enrollment lists were collected at both the time of initial sampling and the time of the sample update.\nOne parent of the sample student and English and mathematics teachers of the sample student were also included in the base-year sample.\n3.1.3 First Follow-up Sample Design\nThere are two target populations for the ELS:2002 first follow-up. Because of these two target populations and the major analytical subgroups, the sample included the following types of students:\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year student respondents who were currently enrolled in either the 12th grade or some other grade in the school in which they were originally sampled. All such students were included in the first follow-up sample.\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year student respondents who finished high school early, including those who graduated from high school early, as well as those who obtained alternative certification (e.g., exam-certified equivalency such as the General Educational Development credential). All such students were included in the first follow-up sample.\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year sample students who were deemed unable to participate during the base year owing to disability or insufficient command of the English language. All such students were included in the follow-up sample.\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year student respondents who dropped out of school prior to data collection in the 12th grade. All such students were included in the follow-up sample.\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year student respondents who transferred out of the school in which they were originally sampled, including those who transferred to a homeschool setting. All such students were included in the follow-up sample.\n\u2022 A subsample was included of base-year nonrespondents (including those who did not have parental consent). Some base-year nonrespondents had remained at the baseyear school, while others finished high school early, transferred, or were dropouts or homeschooled in spring term 2004.\n\u2022 Students at the base-year sample school who were enrolled in the 12th grade but who were not in 10th grade in the United States during the 2002 school year. During spring term 2002 such students may have been out of the country, enrolled in school\n51\n\n\fChapter 3. Sample Design\nin the United States in a grade other than 10th, had an extended illness or injury, been institutionalized, been homeschooled, or temporarily dropped out of school. A spring term-based \u201cfreshening\u201d sample of such students was included in the first follow-up.\nIf a base-year school split into two or more schools and ELS:2002 base-year sample members moved en masse to a new school, the study followed them to the destination school and sought the school\u2019s participation in the first follow-up. These schools can be thought of as additional base-year schools in a new form. Specifically, a necessary condition of adding a new school in the first follow-up was that it arose from a situation such as the splitting of an original base-year school, thus resulting in a large transfer of base-year sample members (usually to one school, but potentially to more). Four base-year schools split, and five new schools were spawned from these four schools. At these new schools, as well as at the original base-year schools, students were tested and interviewed. Additionally, the 12th-grade sample was freshened, and the administrator questionnaire administered.\n3.1.3.1 Eligibility\nAll spring-term 2002 sophomores in eligible schools (i.e., schools that matched the target population as defined in section 3.1.1), except for foreign exchange students, were eligible for the base-year study. Base-year-eligible students were assumed to again be eligible in the first follow-up, regardless of school enrollment status. Additionally, all spring-term 2004 seniors in the base-year schools, except for foreign exchange students, were eligible for the first follow-up. Some base-year students were out of scope for the first follow-up (but sometimes were in-scope again in the second follow-up). Reasons for being temporarily (for the particular round of data collection) out of scope included being institutionalized or out of the country and thus unavailable through the data collection period. Reasons for being permanently out of scope included mortality and correction of sampling errors in which a noncohort member had been mistakenly selected.\nSeveral categories of students who were ineligible for HS&B and NELS:8839 were eligible for ELS:2002 (though it did not mean that such students were necessarily tested or that they completed questionnaires). In NELS:88, the following categories of students were deemed ineligible:\n\u2022 students with disabilities (including students with physical or mental disabilities, or serious emotional disturbance, and who normally had an assigned Individual Education Program) whose degree of disability was deemed by school officials to make it impractical or inadvisable to assess them (i.e., they could not validly be assessed, or testing them could cause harm or discomfort); and\n\u2022 students whose command of the English language was insufficient, in the judgment of school officials, for understanding the survey materials and who therefore could not validly be assessed or surveyed in English.\nIn ELS:2002, such students were deemed (test and) questionnaire-incapable, while remaining eligible for the sample. Base year contextual data were collected for such students (who appear only on the restricted-use files), and their eligibility status was reassessed in the first follow-up. Some students could be administered a questionnaire but could not complete a test. Students\n39 For a summary of ineligibility and exclusion issues in HS&B and NELS:88 see Ingels (1996).\n52\n\n\fChapter 3. Sample Design\ndeemed capable of responding to a questionnaire but not capable of completing an assessment40 were treated as regular sample members.\n3.1.3.2 First Follow-up Subsampling\nA base-year nonrespondent student was defined as a student who was selected in the base year and did not complete a student questionnaire. For the first follow-up, a subsample of 1,000 nonrespondent students was selected from the 2,229 base-year nonrespondents. Initially, a subsample of 1,620 nonrespondents was selected. All nonresponding students were included with certainty (i.e., probability equal to one), except for White students in public schools who were randomly subsampled. Then, to help the response rate and to conserve resources, the subsample of 1,620 was randomly subsampled across all student types to 1,000 nonrespondents.\n3.1.3.3 Sample Freshening\nBecause part of the target population consists of those students who were enrolled in the 12th grade in the spring of 2004, the first follow-up included students at the base-year sample school who were enrolled in the 12th grade in the spring41 of 2004 but who were not in the 10th grade in the United States during the spring of 2002. During this time, such students may have been out of the country or may have been enrolled in school in the United States in a grade other than 10th (either at the sampled school or at some other school). In addition, some students may have reenrolled, although in spring 2002 they were temporarily out of school, owing to illness, injury, institutionalization, homeschooling, or school dropout. Some 238 new students were added to the study under the freshening procedure, although 31 of the 238 were incapable of completing the questionnaire.\nThe total sample for the public-use file in the first follow-up comprised 16,515 individuals of whom 14,989 participated for a weighted response rate of 88.7 percent.\n3.1.3.4 High School Transcript Study Sample Design\nIn autumn 2004, high school transcripts were requested for all sample members who participated in at least one of the first two student interviews: the base-year interview or the first follow-up interview. Thus, sample members who were dropouts, freshened sample members, transfer students, homeschooled students, and early graduates are included if they were respondents in either the 2002 or 2004 interview. Transcripts were also requested for students who could not participate in either of the interviews because of a physical disability, a mental disability, or a language barrier. Further information about the transcript component may be found in Bozick et al. 2006 (NCES 2006-338), available to licensed users of the transcript data.\n3.2 Second Follow-up Sample Design\nThe target populations of the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006) were the 2002 sophomore cohort and the 2004 senior cohort. The sophomore cohort consists of those students\n40 For example, a student with vision problems might not be able to complete a written test, but might be able to respond to an interviewer\u2019s oral administration of a questionnaire. 41 The ELS:2002 cohorts, like the NAEP 12th-grade samples and the prior high school longitudinal cohorts (NLS:72, HS&B, and NELS:88), are spring-defined. For ELS:2002 this means that fall-term 2003 12th-graders who were not in 10th grade in the United States 2 years before (spring term 2002) and were not in 12th grade in the spring term of 2004 are not represented in the sample. Such individuals would normally be either fall-term dropouts or fall-term 2003 early graduates.\n53\n\n\fChapter 3. Sample Design\nwho were enrolled in the 10th grade in the spring of 2002 and the 12th-grade cohort comprises those students who were enrolled in the 12th grade in the spring of 2004. The sophomore cohort includes students who were in the 10th grade in 2002 but not in the 12th grade in 2004 (i.e., sophomore cohort members but not senior cohort members). The senior cohort includes students who were 12th-graders in 2004 but were not in the 10th grade in U.S. schools in 2002; they were included through a sample freshening process as part of the first follow-up activities.\nThe basis for the ELS:2002 second follow-up sampling frame was the sample of students selected in the base year when they were 10th graders in 2002 combined with the sample of freshened students who were in the 12th grade in 2004.\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the approximately 17,600 eligible students sampled from 750 schools in the base year (BY) plus the 240 students added during freshening in the first follow-up.42 For the first follow-up full-scale study, there were a total of 18,000 eligible sample members that included 15,400 BY respondents, 2,200 BY nonrespondents, 160 questionnaireincapable43 BY students, 210 freshened students, and 30 questionnaire-incapable freshened students.\nFor the second follow-up full-scale study, there were 17,900 eligible sample members who included all first follow-up eligible sample members except deceased students (approximately 20), study-ineligible44 members (approximately 10), and base year nonrespondents or freshened sample members who were out-of-scope sample members in the first follow-up study (about 20). The second follow-up fielded sample consisted of 16,400 sample members (see figure 2) as follows:\n\u2022 respondents for both the BY and F1 rounds (14,100);\n\u2022 F1 nonrespondents who were BY respondents (1,200);\n\u2022 BY nonrespondents who were subsampled in the F1 and responded in the F1 (650);\n\u2022 BY or F1 questionnaire-incapable members (210);\n\u2022 freshened respondents in F1 study (170); and\n\u2022 BY respondents who were determined to be out-of-scope in the F1 (100).\nThe sample members listed above made up the second follow-up sample that was fielded, but there were some prior-round nonrespondents who, while eligible members of one or both of the ELS:2002 target populations, were not fielded.45 These nonrespondents included the following types of sample members:\n\u2022 BY nonrespondents who were also nonrespondents in the F1 study;\n42 Readers are reminded that second follow-up sample sizes for subgroups are approximate. There was no public-use data file for the second follow-up. Exact sample sizes from restricted-use data files cannot be published unless the data are perturbed in some way. The perturbation approach taken here was to round the exact sample sizes of cells to tens or hundreds. 43 Questionnaire-incapable students were ineligible for questionnaire or test completion owing to language barriers or severe disabilities but were included in the sample; contextual data were collected for them, and their eligibility status reassessed. 44 Study-ineligible sample members are individuals who were not members of the relevant cohort (2002 sophomores or 2004 freshened seniors) but were initially included owing to sampling error and subsequently reclassified as permanently out of scope. 45 The nonfielded sample members who were base year-first follow-up nonrespondents or first follow-up freshening sample nonrespondents were treated as eligible sample members classified as nonrespondents for the weighting adjustments and in the nonresponse bias analysis.\n54\n\n\fFigure 2.

Sample Design\n\n\u2022 freshened nonrespondents; and\n\u2022 sample members who asked to be removed from the study.\nSome 330 base-year and first follow-up nonrespondents and 40 freshened nonrespondents were not fielded since lack of base-year and first follow-up high school information for these sample members meant that these sample members would have no analytical value in the fullscale study.46 A handful of sample members who asked to be removed from the study were treated as permanent nonrespondents. The sample excluded members who were determined to be study-ineligible in either the base year or the first follow-up, such as sample members who are deceased (whose ineligibility begins with their date of death) or were sampled in error based on cohort membership information later found to be erroneous.\nOnce fielded, some members of the sample of 16,400 were determined to be out of scope. There were 460 out-of-scope second follow-up sample members, who fell into five basic groups, as indicated in table 28.\n\nTable 28. Numbers of out-of-scope cases in the second follow-up, by out-of-scope reason: 2006\n\nOut-of-scope reason Deceased Out of country Institutionalized/incarcerated Questionnaire incapable/incapacitated Unavailable for duration of 2006 data collection\n\nNumber 40\n210 50 80 80\n\nNOTE: Numbers are rounded to tens.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up, 2006.\u201d\n\nApart from the deceased, these individuals are regarded as temporarily out of scope only. If available for future interviews, they will be asked to participate. The portion of the sample that is out of scope is in flux across rounds. However, sample members are more likely to temporarily out of scope, as they disperse after high school and assume new roles, including roles in the military or work force that may take them out of the country or otherwise render them inaccessible. (Military personnel could fall into any of the above categories; their status cannot be separately distinguished.)\n\n46 There were also 1,200 base-year nonrespondents who were sampled out of the study prior to first follow-up data collection, with another 1,000 base-year nonrespondents retained. The subsample of 1,000 base-year nonrespondents became the basis for nonfielded sophomore cohort cases in the second follow-up, in those instances in which they were nonrespondents in the first follow-up as well.\n56\n\n\fChapter 4 Data Collection Results and Methodology\n4.1 Base-Year and First Follow-up Data Collection Results\nThis chapter briefly describes data collection for the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) base-year and first follow-up surveys and, more expansively, data collection for the second follow-up. The discussion of the first follow-up includes data collection for the high school transcript component as well as information about the administration of the test and questionnaires.\nMore detailed accounts of the base-year and first follow-up data collections can be found in the following NCES publications:\n\u2022 Education Longitudinal Study of 2002: Base Year Data File User\u2019s Manual (Ingels et al. 2004; NCES 2004-405);\n\u2022 Education Longitudinal Study of 2002: Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation (Ingels et al. 2005b; NCES 2006-344); and\n\u2022 Education Longitudinal Study of 2002: First Follow-up Transcript Component Data File Documentation (DFD)47 (Bozick et al. 2006; NCES 2006-338).\nBase-year data were collected in spring term 2002. The base-year survey collected data from students, parents, teachers, librarians, and school administrators. Pre-data-collection activities included securing endorsements from educational organizations and gaining cooperation from state education agencies, school districts, and individual schools. Selfadministered questionnaires and achievement tests were the principal research instruments. Data collection primarily took place during in-school survey sessions conducted by an RTI field survey administrator.\nFirst follow-up data were collected in spring term 2004, from students (including transfers) as well as dropouts; transcripts were collected in the next school year.\nA total of 752 high schools participated in the base year, resulting in a weighted school response rate of 67.8 percent. School cooperation results are set out in table 29.

Weighted student-level coverage rates for teacher data were 91.6 percent (indicating receipt of a report from either the math teacher, the English teacher, or both). School administrators and library media coordinators also completed a questionnaire (weighted response rates were 98.5 percent and 95.9 percent, respectively). Mail questionnaires were sent to parents with a telephone follow-up for nonresponders. Student coverage for parent questionnaires was 87.5 percent (weighted). RTI survey administrators completed a facilities checklist at each school. The number of completed instruments and both weighted and unweighted response rates are summarized in table 30.\n\n48 In a two stage-sample, a final response rate should be viewed as the product of both levels of participation. For example, with a school response rate of 67.8 percent and a student response rate of 87.3 percent, the final response rate taking both stages of the design into account is 67.8 * 87.3 = 59.2 percent. A school nonresponse analysis was conducted in the base year to establish that nonresponse bias at the school level was minimal and to provide a fuller basis for nonresponse adjustments in the final weighting. Similar analysis and adjustment were undertaken at the student level. For details see Ingels et al.

In other words, the student questionnaire sample was drawn from base-year sophomore cohort members who remained at their base-year school or seniors brought in through the freshening process at those same schools. There were 13,092 individuals in the sample eligible to complete a student questionnaire, and 12,427 did so. The overall response rate for this group was 93.4 percent, weighted (94.9 percent unweighted).\n\nThe mathematics assessment was administered to about 87 percent (weighted) of the student questionnaire sample (again, the individuals who remained in, or were freshened in, the\n\n59\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nbase-year schools). For this same sample (students associated with a base-year school 2 years later), school administrator data are available 95 percent (weighted) of the time.\nNot all sophomore cohort members remained in their base-year schools. Many transferred to a new school. These students completed a transfer student questionnaire. (Although they did not complete the mathematics assessment, a mathematics score was imputed for them.) For transfer students, a 68.4 percent weighted (70.9 percent unweighted) response rate was achieved.\nDropouts were defined in ELS:2002 as sample members who were absent from school for 4 consecutive weeks or more at the time of the survey, and not absent due to accident or illness. The weighted sophomore cohort dropout participation rate was about 73 percent (over 78 percent unweighted).\nFor all sample types (including questionnaire-incapable students), high school transcripts were also collected in the first follow-up, in the course of the 2004\u201305 school year. About 91 percent of sample members had a complete or incomplete49 transcript. Table 3250 provides information about transcript coverage overall and by selected subgroups. Table 33 breaks out coverage information by cohort as well as subgroup.\n49 Note that some transcript records were necessarily incomplete (for example, the transcripts of a dropout, or of a student who repeated a year between the two surveys), while other records may be incomplete (especially for transfers) because complete information could not be obtained. 50 Note that because first follow-up transcript data (and second follow-up questionnaire data) are available in restricted-use electronic codebooks (ECBs) only (supplemented by a public-use Data Analysis System), sample size information has been perturbed, by a process of rounding, as an additional protection against inadvertent or deductive disclosure of respondents\u2019 identifying information. Because a public-use ECB was produced for the ELS:2002 base year and first follow-up (other than the transcript component), precise sample sizes for the public-use file (which differs slightly in number from the restricted use files [e.g., questionnaire-incapable sample members do not appear on the public-use files]) appear in text and tables describing the 2002 and 2004 rounds. Exact sample sizes are also provided for the second follow-up field test (2005); field test data are not released, even in restricted form, and therefore pose no danger of deductive disclosure.\n60\n\n\fChapter 4.

Data Collection Results and Methodology\n4.2.1 Base-Year Data Collection Methodology\nBefore public school recruitment could begin, it was necessary to obtain permission to contact the schools, first from the states and then from districts. For Catholic schools, permission was sought at the diocesan level, while other private schools were contacted directly, without intermediary.\nSchools were initially contacted by mail, with a package of materials about the study. Several days after the package was sent, the school was contacted by telephone. If the school agreed to participate, a school coordinator was identified to serve as a point of contact and to help handle the logistical arrangements for the survey. Dates for a Survey Day and two Makeup Days were scheduled. At the same time, staff members were designated to receive the school administrator and library media center questionnaires. It was determined whether the type of parental consent used by the school was active (written) or passive (implicit). Schools were offered the opportunity to provide endorsement letters to be included with the consent letter to the parents. Every effort was made to \u201cconvert\u201d noncooperating schools. Nonetheless, there were substantial numbers of refusals; indeed, about 38 percent (unweighted) of the contacted eligible schools refused to participate.\nIn each cooperating school, the coordinator was asked to provide an enrollment list of 10th-grade students, which was used as the basis for sample selection. Since some students may have transferred into or out of the school\u2019s 10th grade over subsequent weeks, the sample was updated before the Survey Day, with new students given a chance of selection into the sample.\nThe actual survey session was conducted by RTI staff, as a group administration, for all students who wished to participate and whose parents had given their implied or explicit consent. First, students were given a timed routing test in math and reading. After completing the routing tests, the students completed the student questionnaire. While the students completed the questionnaire, the survey administrators graded the routing tests and used the resulting scores to determine which of the second-stage test forms in math and reading (low, medium, high ability) to assign to each student. While the students completed the second-stage tests, RTI survey administrators edited the student questionnaires for completeness by checking critical items and attempting to retrieve missing information or clarify ambiguities.\nThe routing test was allotted 12 minutes in math and 14 minutes in reading. The second stage test was 18 minutes for math and 16 minutes for reading. The questionnaire was to be completed in 45 minutes.\nIf less than 100 percent of the eligible students participated on Survey Day, the RTI survey administrator attempted to confirm the Makeup Day that had been scheduled during the school recruitment process. Of the 15,362 participants, 85.4 percent were surveyed in their school on Survey Day, another 11.1 percent were surveyed on a Makeup Day, and 3.5 percent were surveyed outside school over the telephone.\nSchool administrator and librarian questionnaires were also collected. Survey administrators completed a facilities checklist that evaluated the school\u2019s physical plant and safety features. Finally, by the end of the data collection period, at least one teacher report had been received for 92.4 percent of all of the participating students.\nIn addition to surveys of within-school populations, a parent survey was conducted. Parent questionnaires were mailed on or soon after the school\u2019s scheduled Survey Day to all\n63\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nparents for whom addresses had been obtained through the school. For parents with no address available, the parent questionnaire was not mailed until the student questionnaire was sent in and the locator information (which included home address) was recorded. Parents returned the questionnaire to RTI in a postage-paid envelope. RTI staff followed up with nonresponding parents by telephone and in person. Of the 15,362 responding students, parent data (either by mailed questionnaire or by telephone interview) were received from 13,488 of their parents for a weighted coverage rate of 87.4 percent.\n4.2.2 First Follow-up Test and Questionnaire Data Collection Methodology\nStates and districts had been informed in the base year that there would be another study round 2 years hence. For districts, a courtesy letter was mailed reminding them about ELS:2002 and stating that their schools would be contacted to gain permission to collect follow-up data.\nSome 752 schools participated in the base-year study (although one had no eligible selected 10th-graders). When base-year schools were recontacted for the first follow-up, it was learned that five of the schools no longer had sample members (enrolled in any grade at the school) or high school seniors (hence no freshening sample). These schools, therefore, were no longer eligible for the study. Of the eligible schools, 698 (93.4 percent) allowed RTI to return to collect data in the schools. In 44 cases, the school refused to allow RTI to return to the school to collect data. Three districts (representing a total of five schools) also refused to allow RTI to return to their schools to collect data. Data from students enrolled at these schools/districts were collected outside of the school setting. Students at the base-year schools completed student questionnaires and a math test at the in-school administration. School administrator questionnaires were collected. A handful of base-year schools split into multiple schools between 2002 and 2004. Thus, in addition to schools that participated in the base year, five schools that received pools of students from base-year schools were included as new schools in survey activities but were not added to the probability sample.\nIn the spring and again in the autumn of 2003, each base-year school was provided a list of ELS:2002 base-year sample members from its school. The school was asked to indicate whether each sample member was still enrolled at the school. For any sample member who was no longer enrolled, the school was asked to indicate the reason and date the student left. If the student had transferred to another school, the base-year school was asked to indicate the name and location of the transfer school. This information was gathered again in the spring of 2004, prior to the school\u2019s scheduled Survey Day. In the fall of 2003, each base-year school was also asked to provide a list of the 12th-graders enrolled at that school, so this information could be used as part of the freshening process.\nAs earlier noted, schools were asked to identify sample members who no longer attended the base-year school. At the time, contact information for those individuals was collected. However, further tracing of sample members was often required, using (when available) the locating information provided by parents and students in the base year.\nThe in-school survey sessions were essentially similar to those in the base year. However, there was no reading test. In addition, while there were multiple test forms each tailored to ability level, the math test form was not assigned on the basis of a routing test as in the base year. In the first follow-up, the math test form was assigned on the basis of the prior (base-year) test score, as was done in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). For the mathematics\n64\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nassessment, 26 minutes was allotted, with 45 minutes for the student questionnaire. A school administrator questionnaire was also administered in the first follow-up, and course offerings information was collected for base-year schools as well. Of those who participated in in-school survey sessions, 87.5 percent (9,737) were interviewed on Survey Day, and the remaining 12.5 percent on a Makeup Day. Some 10.1 percent (1,126) participated on the first Makeup Day, and 2.4 percent (262) on a subsequent Makeup Day. Of course, for schools that did not allow a Makeup Day, students were pursued outside of the school setting.\nNot all spring 2002 sophomores remained in their base-year schools. Some had dropped out of high school; others had transferred. A few shifted to a homeschool setting, while others graduated early. Therefore, a large segment of the data collection took place outside the school setting. No attempt was made to test students who had transferred out of their base-year schools by 2004; however, test scores were imputed for this group. For students not in their original schools, telephone data collection began in February 2004. For sample members under the age of 18, parental permission was obtained by telephone prior to initiating contact with the sample member. As a last resort, cases were also assigned to field staff for an in-person interview.\nAs shown in table 34, the majority of those who responded (74 percent) did so during the in-school Survey or Makeup Day. Approximately 20 percent participated as a result of the telephone interview follow-up. Just over 5 percent were interviewed by a field interviewer and less than one half of one percent completed a mail questionnaire.\n\nTable 34.

Transcripts were collected from the students\u2019 base-year school. However, if it was learned during the first followup data collection that the sample member had transferred, transcripts were collected from two schools: the base-year school and the last known school of attendance. For students who were added to the study during the spring term of their senior year (known as \u201cfreshened\u201d students), transcripts were only collected from their senior-year school. Transcripts were collected for regular graduates, as well as dropouts, students still in high school, early graduates, and students who were homeschooled after their sophomore year.\nTranscripts were collected for all sample members who participated in at least one of the first two student interviews: the base year or the first follow-up. These sample members include base-year respondents who were first follow-up nonrespondents and base-year nonrespondents who were first follow-up respondents. Thus, sample members who were dropouts, freshened\n\n65\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nsample members, transfer students, homeschooled students, and early graduates were included if they were respondents in either of the first two student interviews. Transcripts were also requested for students who could not participate in either of the interviews because of a severe physical disability, a mental disability, or a language barrier. A total of approximately 1,500 base-year and transfer schools responded positively to the transcript request by providing transcript data for ELS:2002 sample members. Ninety-one percent (weighted) of the ELS:2002 student sample have transcript information (about 14,900 out of 16,400).\nRecords were necessarily incomplete for sample members who had dropped out of school, had fallen behind their cohort\u2019s modal progression sequence, or were enrolled in a special education program requiring or allowing more than 12 years of schooling. Eighty-six percent of transcript respondents have 4 complete years of high school transcript information.\n4.2.3.1 Transcript Data Collection Materials\nThe development of data collection materials and procedures was informed by the NELS:88 high school transcript study, the National Assessment of Educational Progress high school transcript study, and the field test for ELS:2002 transcript data collection. Data collection materials were mailed to schools beginning in December 2004. The materials were sent to the ELS:2002 school coordinator at all schools that participated in ELS:2002. If the school was new to the study (e.g., a school attended by a sample member who transferred out of his or her baseyear school), the materials were sent to the principal. The materials guided school personnel in the preparation of transcripts and related documents. Each school was asked to provide basic enrollment, testing, and coursetaking information for each student, as well as information about the school\u2019s grading and graduation policies and requirements. The information requested included the following:\n\u2022 Student-level information, including \u2212 type of diploma awarded (e.g., standard, honors, or General Educational Development certification);\n\u2212 date diploma awarded; \u2212 date student left school; \u2212 reason student left school (e.g., graduated or transferred); \u2212 cumulative GPA; and \u2212 test scores for the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, Scholastic Assessment\nTest, ACT,51 and Advanced Placement tests.\n\u2022 Coursetaking histories for grades 9 through 12,52 including \u2212 course title and number; \u2212 year, grade level, and term course taken;\n51 Formerly called the American College Testing Assessment. 52 Schools were also encouraged to provide information about coursetaking immediately prior to 9th grade, especially algebra or geometry courses. These courses appear on the course-level file but are not included in any of the composite measures on the student-level file.\n66\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2212 number of credits earned; and \u2212 grade assigned. \u2022 School-level information, including \u2212 grade scale; \u2212 course grade weighting system used, if any; \u2212 availability of student-level information; \u2212 GPA formula; \u2212 Carnegie unit conversion information; \u2212 term system; \u2212 course catalogs (if not collected previously); \u2212 types of diplomas granted; and \u2212 credits required for different types of diplomas. The data collection materials requested from school personnel also included the following: cover letter, instructions for preparing transcripts, student transcript checklist, transcript cover sheet, disclosure notices, value and uses of transcript research document, and signed consent forms (if the school required explicit consent).\nThe instructions for preparing student transcripts requested that photocopies or printouts of transcripts be prepared for the students listed on the Student Transcript Checklist. They also requested that the transcripts, when available, include coursetaking histories for 9th through 12th grades. In the rare instances in which 9th-grade records were unavailable, the preparer was asked to submit photocopies or printouts of transcripts for the 10th through 12th grades.\n4.2.3.2 Transcript Data Collection Procedures\nFrom December 2004 through June 2005, survey materials were sent to over 2,000 schools. This group included schools that participated either in the base-year or first follow-up survey and transfer schools that were first contacted regarding ELS:2002 during transcript data collection. Transcripts were not requested from 10 base-year schools because they had refused to participate in the first follow-up survey. Additionally, transcripts were not requested from one base-year school that had no eligible students. Schools were paid $5 for each transcript.\nTranscripts were requested for over 16,000 sample members. Included were sample members who were ineligible to participate in the base year or first follow-up because of a physical disability, a mental disability, or a language barrier. Ninety-five schools required explicit consent from sample members or their parents/guardians before releasing transcript information. Of the sample members who attended these schools, about a quarter provided signed release forms.\nTwo weeks after the survey materials were sent to the school, a follow-up postcard was sent as a reminder to complete the data collection forms and to send the requested materials to RTI. If after an additional week RTI had not received the materials from the school, assigned institutional contactors (ICs) began telephone prompting to request that the materials be sent as\n67\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nsoon as possible. Nonresponding schools contacted during the telephone prompting frequently requested remailing of the data collection materials. During telephone contacts, the ICs also identified any additional requirements the school had for releasing transcripts.\nTelephone follow-up with schools continued through June 2005. Additional measures were implemented to ensure an adequate response rate. In June 2005, data collection materials were sent to schools that had not yet provided all of the requested transcripts. In addition, inperson visits to nonresponding schools were conducted during April through June 2005 to collect the requested materials or to assist the school transcript preparer in assembling the information. For efficiency, the schools were selected for in-person visits by their proximity to other schools. In-person visits were made only to schools that had not sent transcript materials for any requested sample members.\nCollection of transcripts for dropouts and alternative completers was impeded in some cases by the frequency with which sample members transferred schools or dropped in and out of school, and inaccurate school records. Dropouts occasionally were enrolled in a school for too brief a period to accumulate a coursetaking record. Consequently, there is often little or no record of their destination school. However, the strategy of beginning by collecting transcripts from the school of origin (base-year school) maximizes the number of 2004 dropouts for whom there are at least complete 9th and 10th grade (fall 2000 to spring 2002) records.\n4.2.3.3 High School Transcripts of Transfer Students\nIn addition to collecting data from base-year schools, transcript data were collected from the transfer schools of students who left their base-year high school. Transfer students were identified at several points in the ELS:2002 data collection process. These time periods included enrollment status update contacts in spring 2003, fall 2003, and spring 2004, as well as the first follow-up data collection in spring 2004.\n4.2.3.4 Obtaining Permission for Collecting High School Transcripts\nBecause the Department of Education, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, has the right to obtain transcripts without prior consent for evaluation purposes, and because RTI informed parents, students, and school personnel of the transcript data collection as part of base-year and first follow-up data collection/consent activities, the first approach to collecting transcripts was a direct mail request to each school. When RTI contacted schools to prompt for return of the transcripts and answer any questions, it was also noted whether the schools had additional consent requirements before they would release student transcripts. Approximately 100 schools requested explicit consent. For sample members who attended these schools, RTI sent a letter and form to the students and their parent/guardian informing them that a signed consent form was required in order for the school to release the transcript to RTI. The consent letters explained that a parent\u2019s signature was required if the sample member was under age 18 and a sample member\u2019s signature was required for students 18 years of age or older.\nAfter explicit consent forms granting permission to release the transcript were received, a second set of data collection materials was sent to each school requiring consent, including a list of students for whom signed consent was received and photocopies of the signed consent forms.\n68\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n4.2.3.5 Course Catalog Data Collection\nRTI began collecting course catalogs in the 2001\u201302 school year as part of base-year data collection activities and continued in the 2003\u201304 school year as part of first follow-up data collection activities. Course catalogs were requested for four school years covering 2000\u201304 from base-year schools and for two school years, 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304, from transfer schools. In the first follow-up, course catalogs were requested from both base-year and transfer schools, for use in coding transcripts. However, only information for base-year schools appears on the course offering file. During the transcript request activities, schools were prompted for catalogs that had not yet been collected. If a school did not have a conventional catalog, then a course list, master teaching schedule, or any other form of information from which course offerings could be extracted was accepted. The course offerings response rate for base-year schools (the basis for the course offerings file) was 88 percent.\n4.2.3.6 Definition of a Transcript Respondent\nA sample member was considered a respondent in the ELS:2002 transcript data file if the following criteria were met:\n\u2022 The sample member had at least one transcript sent from one school.\n\u2022 The sample member had at least one complete course record for at least one grade (9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th).\n4.3 Second Follow-up Data Collection Methods and Results\nThis section describes the data collection procedures and presents the data collection results for the ELS:2002 second follow-up survey. Section 4.3.1 details the data collection activities and procedures followed, including sample maintenance, tracing, respondent incentives, survey modes, and refusal conversion. Section 4.3.2 presents and discusses data collection outcomes and data quality indicators, including overall response rates, response rates across modes, response rates among key subgroups, interviewing effort, interview timing data, and quality assessment monitoring results.\n4.3.1 Data Collection Activities and Procedures\nThis section describes the data collection activities and procedures followed in conducting the ELS:2002 second follow-up in 2006. The section is divided into five primary topics: pre-data collection tracing and sample maintenance activities, use of incentives, overview of data collection modes, intensive tracing efforts, and refusal conversion procedures. Procedures and activities under these five topics are described in this section, while the pertinent results and outcomes are presented in section 4.3.2. Maintaining data security is a requirement that pervades all tasks, including, of course, data collection. It is discussed in conjunction with the related topic of confidentiality protections associated with treatment of the analytic data in chapter 6, section 6.6.\nData collection for the 2006 round was significantly redesigned to include survey modes and procedures that were completely independent of the in-school orientation of the first followup survey. Almost all of the young adults in the 2006 sample transitioned from high school to postsecondary education, the workforce, or the military between the first and second follow-up data collection periods. The 2006 data collection procedures focused on two critical elements for\n69\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nreaching and enlisting these sample members: tracing and sample maintenance activities and multiple modes of data collection (web self-administration, in-person or telephone computerassisted interviewer administration). The tracing and sample maintenance activities involved a variety of techniques to maintain current contact information for sample members and continue their identification with ELS:2002 for the second follow-up round. Offering multiple modes of data collection maximized the opportunity for sample members to participate in the ELS:2002 second follow-up. Combined, these two important features of the 2006 round of data collection plan were designed to include a very high percentage of this mobile population in the survey. In addition to drawing on experiences from conducting the second follow-up field test data collection, the second follow-up procedures drew on the experiences of other education surveys with similar populations, including Baccalaureate and Beyond 2003 (B&B:03), the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study of 2004 (NPSAS:04), and the 2004/2006 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06).\nIn addition, key characteristics of second follow-up sample members were considered in developing plans to achieve a high response rate. While the overwhelming majority of F2 sample members participated in both the base-year (BY) and F1 waves, 14 percent participated in only one of the previous two rounds. The data collection procedures anticipated that those who did not participate in 2004 would likely be especially difficult to include 2 years later. Furthermore, the sample included high school dropouts, who proved more difficult to locate and include in the 2004 data collection. As a result, second follow-up data collection procedures included features to help maximize participation among these special subpopulations in the sample.\n4.3.1.1 Pre-Data Collection Tracing and Sample Maintenance Activities\nAn important aspect of the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006) data collection was that high schools were no longer involved in providing assistance with locating sample members. High schools had played a central role in facilitating contacts and interviews with participants in both the BY and F1 rounds. In addition, as the young adults in the sample transitioned from high school to different educational and work pursuits they moved away from their previous homes. For this reason, a more extensive set of tracing and sampling maintenance techniques was warranted for the second follow-up, including the following:\n\u2022 batch tracing services for updated address information and telephone numbers;\n\u2022 updated locating information obtained from student federal financial aid applications (FAFSA);\n\u2022 direct contact with sample members and their parents via mail, telephone, or Internet;\n\u2022 intensive tracing efforts by centralized tracing specialists;\n\u2022 intensive tracing efforts by field locating specialists in local areas; and\n\u2022 tracing students through postsecondary schools applied to or attended, as specified in the 2004 interview.\nAnother important tool in this process was to continually build on the positive relations ELS:2002 staff have established and maintained with sample members. All contacts with sample members were designed to maintain cordial and respectful relations with the young adults in the sample and their parents. This section describes the pre-data collection tracing and sample\n70\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nmaintenance activities implemented prior to the start of 2006 data collection. Section 4.3.1.4 describes intensive tracing activities conducted during the second follow-up data collection period. For reference, table 35 outlines the complete schedule of all tracing and sample maintenance activities for the 2006 sample.\n\nTable 35.

Pre-data collection tracing and sample maintenance efforts for the 2006 sample began in December 2004 with the updating of sample members\u2019 contact information through batch tracing services. (To minimize costs, the full-scale sample was combined with the field test sample in these activities.) Batch tracing represents a cost-effective method of updating addresses and telephone numbers for the young adults in the sample and their parents. Two batch tracing services, National Change of Address (NCOA) and Telematch, were used to update the address and telephone information sample members provided in previous rounds. NCOA is a database consisting of change of address information submitted to the U.S. Postal Service. Matching ELS:2002 sample members\u2019 addresses against the NCOA database was useful for providing address updates, especially for those sample members who had recently moved. The Telematch service involves a database of over 130 million residential listings, including over 3 million unlisted numbers that have recently been assigned. Telematch was used to confirm or update the telephone number for each sample member matched to their most current known address. These two services are most effective when used in this sequence, because the updated addresses from NCOA can be matched to sample members\u2019 updated telephone numbers, when applicable. A total of about 16,40053 second follow-up cases were submitted to these batch tracing services in December 2004. All information returned from these batch tracing services was then updated in the sample locator database.\n\n53 Readers are reminded that second follow-up sample sizes for subgroups are approximate. There is no public-use data file for the second follow-up. Exact sample sizes from restricted-use data files cannot be published unless the data are perturbed in some way. The perturbation approach taken here was to round the exact sample sizes of cells to tens (if less than four digits) or hundreds (if four or five digits). This convention has been followed even for methodological tables containing information excluded from the ECB.\n\n71\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nThe next set of tracing and sample maintenance activities for 2006 sample members began in October 2005. At this point, three batch tracing services were used to update sample member contact information\u2014NCOA, Telematch, and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Central Processing System (CPS) for federal financial aid applications. The CPS search was added to confirm or update contact information for those sample members who had submitted the FAFSA for one or more postsecondary institutions. The CPS database was another useful source of information for locating a significant number of sample members, because 74 percent of 2006 sample members had attended postsecondary schooling and an estimated 70 percent of these attendees completed a FAFSA.\nA total of approximately 16,200 second follow-up sample members had sufficient information to send to NCOA and Telematch. Table 36, table 37, and table 38 provide the results for NCOA, Telematch, and CPS batch tracing, respectively. First, the NCOA database provided new address information for 2,300 sample members (14 percent). Approximately 210 cases (1 percent) were identified as no longer valid, but no new information was available. The most common result of this tracing service was reflected in the 13,800 cases for which no match was obtained in the NCOA database. This result could indicate that either these cases had current address information that had not recently changed or that they simply were not included in the NCOA database. Additionally, about 70 second follow-up sample members did not have sufficient current address information to be included in the NCOA batch tracing. Another 50 sample members had a finalized status such as final refusal or ineligible.\nOnce new information from the results of the NCOA batch tracing were updated in the locator database, about 16,300 cases were submitted to the Telematch batch service. Among these sample members, about 9,000 (56 percent) did not have a matching record in the Telematch database. Of the remaining 46 percent of cases, the majority (42 percent) resulted in confirmation of the telephone number on record. The other 500 cases (3 percent) did produce a match to a new telephone number.\nThe final step in this sequence of batch tracing was to match the contact information for sample members against the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s CPS FAFSA application database. Because this process included both address and telephone information, the results were somewhat more complicated than the NCOA and Telematch services. For about 3,700 sample members (23 percent), the existing contact information was confirmed in the CPS database. New information was obtained for 1,300 sample members (8 percent), which were nearly evenly divided among new address information only, new telephone number only, and both new address and telephone, as indicated in table 38. A total of about 7,200 cases (44 percent) sent for CPS matching produced no match in the database. The remaining approximately 4,100 cases did not have valid Social Security numbers and therefore could not be matched against the CPS database.\nIn anticipation of potentially contacting sample members\u2019 parents as part of 2006 data collection, address and telephone information was also sent to NCOA and Telematch for one \u201cprimary\u201d parent of 16,000 sample members. The \u201cprimary\u201d parent was selected by prioritizing all parents identified in prior rounds of ELS:2002 by their relation to the sample member, starting with mother. The remaining 320 sample members did not have sufficient information for one or more parents to be included in this batch tracing activity. Once again, the updated contact information obtained through these batch tracing activities was then used to update the second follow-up sample locator database in preparation for future contacts.\n72\n\n\fChapter 4.

In addition to maintaining current contact information for ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006) sample members and their parents, batch tracing efforts were also important preparation for direct contact with sample members and their parents. Periodic contacts with sample members and their parents maximized sample members\u2019 connection to ELS:2002 over the duration of the study. Direct mailings to sample members and their parents provided an opportunity to thank sample members for their continued participation in ELS:2002, inform them about the next steps in the research, and request that they review and update their contact information currently on record.\n\nBetween the F1 and F2 survey rounds, a direct mailing to sample members and their parents was sent in November 2005. A total of approximately 16,300 sample members and at\n\n73\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nleast one of their parents had sufficient address information for sending this packet. Of these, about 360 sample member packets (2 percent) and 770 parent packets (5 percent) were returned with no forwarding address information available. Another 670 sample member packets (4 percent) and 310 parent packets (2 percent) did return forwarding address information so that these packets could be remailed.\nThis mailing included a cover letter thanking sample members or parents for their continued participation, notifying them of the next round of data collection, and requesting that they update their contact information in anticipation of data collection. The packet also included a contact information form for sample members or parents to provide updated name, address, telephone, and e-mail information. Separate letters and forms were sent to sample members and parents to appropriately present and capture the contact information. The most current information for sample members and their parents was preprinted on the contact information forms, so that respondents could easily indicate any corrections to this information. The forms provided spaces for both permanent and current contact information, which was useful for sample members who were away at school or in the military, but still considered their parents\u2019 home address as their permanent address. Sample members and parents were provided with instructions on the form to either confirm or correct their contact information.\nTo respond to the sample maintenance mailing, sample members or their parents were able to update their contact information in one of four ways:\n1. Completing and returning the hardcopy contact information form in the return envelope provided.\n2. Updating the contact information via the ELS:2002 website, which provided a link (\u201cUpdate your Contact Information\u201d) to online forms similar to the paper contact information forms.\n3. E-mailing updated information to the dedicated ELS:2002 e-mail address.\n4. Providing updated information by calling the dedicated ELS:2002 toll-free line.\nThis sample maintenance activity was useful for both maintaining contact with sample members and obtaining updated information from those who had recently relocated to attend college, take a job, or serve in the military. In addition, because letters were sent to parents as well, a number of parents either returned the contact information forms, logged on to the website, or called the toll-free number to update their child\u2019s information.\nLike most sample maintenance activities of this kind, overall response to the November 2005 mailing to sample members was limited. Overall, about 1,620 sample members (10 percent) and about 1,850 parents (11 percent) returned the hardcopy contact information forms. The slightly greater response from parents is consistent with prior rounds of ELS:2002, where parents were consistently helpful sources of information about their children. Additionally, approximately 940 sample members or their parents updated their contact information using the study website, for an overall total of about 4,400 updates. Of the 940 updates entered via the website, about 160 were completed prior to the start of data collection on January 25, 2006, and 780 were completed once data collection began. Only a small number of those who responded to the sample maintenance mailing used e-mail or voicemail messages. The web option may have served to increase the overall response to the sample maintenance mailing by providing a mode with which sample members would be comfortable. This outcome cannot be directly assessed,\n74\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nhowever, because use of the website may have simply substituted for returning the contact information forms among responding sample members.\nPre-data collection intensive tracing. The batch tracing activities and sample maintenance mailing conducted in November\u2013December 2005 identified a set of 90 second follow-up sample members for whom no current contact information was available. These cases were sent to the centralized Tracing Operations Unit (TOPS), a part of RTI\u2019s Call Center Services, for intensive tracing. Among these cases, tracing specialists obtained new information for 40 cases (48 percent). This new information was then used to update the 2006 sample locator database for these cases. One additional case was identified as being out of scope for the 2006 data collection through tracing efforts. For the remaining 40 cases (51 percent), TOPS was unsuccessful in obtaining any updated contact information. These cases were among the first to undergo further intensive tracing efforts during the data collection period.\n4.3.1.2 Use of Incentives\nIncentive payments to respondents was one feature of the data collection plan for the ELS:2002 2006 study. Even following the best survey practices, collecting data from some respondent populations is difficult and expensive, making it almost impossible to obtain desired response rates without incentives. The results of the 2003 field test experiments and the success of the 2004 round of data collection provided evidence of the value of respondent incentives in achieving high response rates (see Ingels et al. 2005b, appendix J). A number of important factors were considered in developing and implementing the incentive plan:\n\u2022 Almost all first follow-up sample members received an incentive, including both those who participated in school and those who participated outside of school. Paying incentives to almost all first follow-up participants raised the expectation among the sample cohort that they would receive payment again for participating in the 2006 round.\n\u2022 Between the F1 and F2 surveys, the ELS:2002 sample cohort became further dispersed. In both the 2004 main study and second follow-up field test (2005) providing incentives was effective in making contact with sample members who were difficult to reach.\n\u2022 Offering incentive payments can actually reduce data collection costs by limiting the effort required to pursue sample members who are difficult to locate or those who are initially unwilling to participate. Significant cost savings are gained by reduced computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) follow-up efforts, including repeated contacting attempts, refusal conversion calls, and field interviewer travel.\n\u2022 Although cell sizes for important analytic subgroups were satisfactory after the success of the 2004 data collection, significant attrition among these subgroups was a threat to the analytic value of the second follow-up. The two most important subgroups that were offered higher incentives in the first and second follow-ups were high school dropouts and prior-wave nonrespondents. Paying differential incentives to both dropouts and first follow-up nonrespondents in 2006 was designed to ensure sufficient inclusion of these important subgroups.\n75\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nThe second follow-up incentive plan was designed to maximize respondent participation by meeting their expectations of compensation for their time and efforts, helping to locate widely dispersed sample members, and offering greater incentives to particular subgroups with limited representation in the sample. In addition, the incentive plan was generally similar to the 2004 plan and also incorporated elements of similar education studies, including NPSAS:04 and the BPS longitudinal study. In this way, the 2006 plan was as consistent as possible with both the prior round of ELS:2002 and other current education surveys of the young adult population.\nThe 2006 incentive plan was designed to address five key features of survey context:\n1. First follow-up participation status\u2014F1 respondent or F1 nonrespondent.\n2. High school dropout status\u2014identified in F1 as ever having dropped out or not.\n3. Timing of participation\u2014during the first 4 weeks of data collection or beyond this period.\n4. Difficulty in contacting or enlisting cooperation with the sample member\u2014meeting the criteria for difficult cases or not.\n5. Partial prepayment of the incentive for sample members who had not participated after all other incentive conditions had been exhausted\u2014completed prior to the final 8 weeks or beyond this period.\nThe first four of these five elements were approved by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and established prior to the start of the data collection period. The fifth element was implemented as a contingency during data collection based on discussions with and approval from OMB.\nBecause multiple criteria applied to many sample members, the incentive plan elements were combined to determine the appropriate payment level at each point of the study. In order to ensure that survey notification materials and interviewer statements matched respondents\u2019 expectations on how much they would be paid at each point in the data collection period, consistency was maintained across all points of contact with respondents regarding the amount of their incentive payments. This consistency was achieved initially and maintained throughout the study by using the same predetermined variables\u2014dropout status, F1 participation status, difficult case status, and current date\u2014in all study materials and computer programs to indicate the appropriate incentive amount. Materials included mailed letters and instructions and e-mail messages. Computer programs included web/CATI/CAPI scripts and instruments as well as the sample database. The same procedures followed in the 2006 round to ensure consistency had been used effectively in the 2004 data collection.\nTable 39 summarizes the specific elements of the 2006 incentive plan. The regular or \u201cbase\u201d incentive amount for all ELS:2002 sample members who had never been identified as dropouts and had participated in the F1 data collection was $20. For those sample members who participated in the base-year study but did not participate in 2004, the regular incentive was higher at $40. Likewise, those who had ever been identified as dropouts through the 2004 round were offered $40 as a base incentive.\n76\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nTable 39.

The early incentive period ran from the opening day of data collection on January 25, 2006, through February 19, 2006, when outbound calling began. This element was designed to offer the most responsive sample members a bonus for participating prior to when more intensive data collection procedures were implemented.\n\nA further addition to the incentive payment plan was to offer an additional $10 over the regular amount to those sample members who proved extremely difficult to contact or enlist in the study during the course of the 2006 data collection period. This increase was implemented independently of each sample member\u2019s high school completion status or F1 participation status. The criteria for the \u201cdifficult\u201d status increase included the following:\n\n\u2022 more than 20 calls were made to contact the sample member without completing an interview;\n\n\u2022 sample member refused to participate during an initial contact;\n\n\u2022 others refused multiple times on behalf of the sample member;\n\n\u2022 sample member could not be located through any of the telephone numbers previously provided, so the case was submitted for intensive tracing;\n\n\u2022 case was sent to a field interviewer for tracing; or\n\n\u2022 sample member had still not completed the interview as of June 15, 2006.\n\nOnce a case met one (or more) of these criteria, all computer programs and databases were updated with the higher incentive amount.\n\nThe preceding elements of the respondent incentive plan were all implemented at the beginning of the 2006 data collection period. On July 6, 2006, one final revision to the incentive plan was implemented for the final 8 weeks (or about 2 months) of data collection. All sample members who had not yet completed the survey were sent an express mail package with an additional $10 check as a prepayment of the full incentive amount. The remainder of the incentive was payable upon completion of the survey. If mailed packages did not reach the intended sample members and at least one alternative address was available in the sample members\u2019 records, data collection staff remailed the $10 prepaid check to these sample members. The purpose of the prepaid incentive was to assure remaining sample members that NCES and RTI were serious about obtaining their participation in the survey and compensating them for completing the survey. A total of 3,200 packages with the prepaid incentive check were mailed.\n\n77\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nAnother 10 sample members who had not yet completed the F2 interview did not have a current, valid address to be included in this mailing.\nThroughout the 2006 data collection period, all incentive payments were provided in the form of checks. The data file for incentive payments was created at the beginning of each week and the incentive checks and thank you letters were mailed to participants at the address indicated during the last section of the interview. Because address information was occasionally incomplete or inaccurate, data collection staff investigated returned incentive checks to find an accurate mailing address so that these checks could be remailed. Subsequent sections present the counts and percentages for each type of incentive payment paid over the course of the 2006 data collection.\n4.3.1.3 Overview of Data Collection Modes\u2014Web, CATI, and CAPI Multiple modes of data collection was a second important feature of the 2006 data\ncollection. Figure 3 outlines the data collection schedule and targets for each survey mode\u2014web computerized self-administered questionnaire (web CSAQ), CATI, and CAPI. Offering 2006 sample members web, CATI, and CAPI modes provided three viable, complementary modes for gaining cooperation. Providing these multiple modes also eliminated having to devise and administer a hardcopy version of the survey instrument. Because it would have been nearly impossible to anticipate the appropriate set of questions for each individual sample member, hardcopy questionnaires would have likely placed an undue burden on respondents to correctly navigate through the instrument. Furthermore, hardcopy questionnaires would not be directly comparable to the computer-assisted versions, as a number of 2006 survey items relied on computer logic, preloaded data, and help features that would not have been available in hardcopy format.\nOffering sample members the self-administered web-based survey option in addition to CATI and CAPI survey modes was a major advance in the 2006 data collection. Web selfadministration was viewed as a viable data collection mode based on data that the 19- and 20year-olds who comprised the sample would have relatively high rates of Internet access and usage. In the second follow-up field test, nearly 28 percent of sample members participated via the Web. For 2006 data collection, the expectation was that appropriate procedures to facilitate and encourage participation via the ELS:2002 website would result in about 30 percent of sample members completing via web self-administration mode. The web-based mode was expected to make a substantial contribution to overall response to the 2006 data collection and, at the same time, conserve survey resources for CATI and CAPI follow-up with remaining sample members.\n78\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nFigure 3.\n\nData collection flow across survey mode for the second follow-up full scale study: 2006\n\nNOTE: CATI = computer-assisted telephone interview; CAPI = computer-assisted personal interview. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up, 2006.\u201d\nData collection in 2006 began as scheduled on January 25, 2006. For the first 4 weeks, only web and call-in data collection was made available to sample members. To notify sample members about the start of data collection, all sample members and parent(s) were sent a packet that included the following:\n\u2022 a cover letter explaining the goals of the ELS:2002 study;\n\u2022 directions for accessing the ELS:2002 website;\n\u2022 instructions for completing the interview on the Web or calling in to complete by phone;\n\u2022 a unique user identification and password for each sample member to access the web interview (this was only included in the sample member letter);\n\u2022 a toll-free help desk phone number to call for assistance with web self-administration or completing the interview by phone;\n\u2022 a toll-free number and e-mail address for any general questions about the ELS:2002 second follow-up; and\n\u2022 an informational brochure describing the ELS:2002 study.\nTo communicate the importance of each sample member\u2019s participation, the lead letter was sent on Department of Education letterhead and signed by the NCES project officer for ELS:2002.\nAt the start of data collection (January 2006) a total of 16,100 lead letter packets were sent to sample members and 15,800 to parents of sample members. Packets were not mailed to cases if no usable address existed or if a finalized status had been determined as a result of predata collection contacts with sample members or parents. Among those mailed, 350 sample\n79\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nmember packets and 130 parent packets were remailed with updated contact information returned from the original mailing. Another 270 sample members\u2019 packets and 490 parent packets were returned without forwarding address information. In addition to informing most sample members and parents about the start of data collection, the lead letter mailing identified a small set of cases for whom some or all existing contact information was no longer valid. Most of these cases had limited contact information in the database and the address used for the lead letter mailing proved to be no longer valid.\nWeb self-administration. Offering sample members the option of completing a selfadministered interview via the ELS:2002 website was a major enhancement to second follow-up data collection. The web-based survey mode provided several important advantages in collecting data from the population of young adults who were included in the 2006 sample:\n\u2022 A high percentage of sample members would be familiar with using the Web, and many were likely to have already completed other web surveys.\n\u2022 Sample members could complete the web interview at any location where they had Internet access, which was convenient for young adults who are generally active and mobile.\n\u2022 Sample members could complete the web interview at any time that was convenient for them, which was particularly advantageous for those who were busy with work or school in the afternoon and evening hours.\n\u2022 Web self-administration allowed respondents to complete the interview at their own pace, which is attractive both to those who can move quickly through the instrument and those who need to take more time.\n\u2022 Sample members who preferred not to discuss certain aspects of their high school experiences since the last interview could achieve greater privacy through using web self-administration.\n\u2022 Because a web-enabled survey system was used to program the 2006 instrument, the web self-administered interview could be presented in a way that was virtually indistinguishable from CATI and CAPI modes.\n\u2022 The web data collection mode was relatively cost-effective because it required a small support staff compared to the larger interviewing staffs required for CATI and CAPI data collection.\n\u2022 Like CATI and CAPI interviews, web surveys provided faster access to data files than hardcopy questionnaires would have allowed, so this mode facilitated more timely review of survey data early during the fielding period.\nA key assumption in implementing a web self-administration mode for the second follow-up was that a high percentage of sample members would have access to the Internet and be familiar with using web-based applications. Experience in the second follow-up field test indicated that the majority of ELS sample members had access to and familiarity with using the Internet. As a result, we expected a majority of second follow-up sample members to be comfortable using the Internet. Based on assumptions about sample members\u2019 access to and use of the Web, a total of 30 percent of sample members, or 4,900, were projected to complete the survey via web self-administration (see figure 3). It was expected that two-thirds of web\n80\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nresponders, or 20 percent of the sample, would respond during the early completion period when the early completion incentive was in effect. Another 10 percent of the sample was expected to complete web self-administration during the remainder of the data collection period.\nWeb data collection procedures. To facilitate web self-administration, a secure, dedicated ELS:2002 website was hosted on the NCES server. The ELS:2002 website could be used by sample members both to complete the survey and also to gain more information about the study. Respondents simply logged onto the website, clicked on a link labeled \u201cLogin to the Interview,\u201d and then entered the study identification number and assigned password to begin the interview. A \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d (\u201cFAQs\u201d) link also provided information about the study procedures and instructions for completing the web interview, so that respondents could obtain immediate help with any survey completion issues. Additional background information was also provided via the link \u201cAbout ELS:2002.\u201d Through the course of the study, information on the website was added or revised to communicate any updates on data collection procedures and study timeline to sample members.\nThe primary strategy for conducting successful web-based data collection was to make self-administration as easy as possible for second follow-up sample members when they went to the website. To avoid technical problems, the web-enabled survey system was designed to function appropriately in a wide range of computing environments, including different web browsers, different Internet connections, and different computer settings. The login procedures were fairly simple and clearly explained in the lead letter mailing to sample members. Each screen of the instrument was designed so that the response task was clear. Special instructions were available at the click of a button to guide respondents through potentially problematic screens or to provide definitions of technical terms used in items. Although web help desk staff were available to assist respondents who had difficulties starting or completing the interview, development and testing of the web interview were designed to minimize these situations. When needed, web help desk staff were available through the toll-free ELS:2002 telephone line to provide technical assistance to respondents with computer, Internet, or survey issues.\nAll second follow-up sample members were initially treated as potential web respondents in the 2006 case management system (CMS). When sample members completed the web survey, this information was transmitted to the CMS. Once this information was captured in the CMS, further data collection contacts to these sample members was discontinued and the address information provided by participants was used to mail incentive checks. As detailed in section 4.3.1.2, the most responsive sample members who completed the web interview (or called in to complete a CATI interview) during the first 4 weeks were offered an early completion bonus. The expectation was that web response would be quite high during the first 4 weeks of data collection as a result of the higher incentive, and then taper off significantly in the ensuing weeks. Web self-administration was available to sample members throughout the entire 2006 data collection period. The web mode was therefore supported and encouraged over the course of data collection by CATI and CAPI interviewing staff and direct reminder contacts. Section 4.3.2.1 presents the results for web self-administration.\nWeb help desk staffing, training, and procedures. Even though the web-based survey protocol and instrument were designed to be easily completed, web help desk staff were hired and trained so that they would be available to assist sample members in completing the web interview. Initial training for help desk staff involved 20 hours total from January 20 through January 22, 2006. During or following training, all web help desk staff were required to\n81\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nsuccessfully complete certification requirements for both help-desk procedures and CATI interviewing. Help desk staff were trained to support web self-administration, call selected sample members to encourage early participation, and contact and interview sample members once outbound CATI interviewing began. Newly hired staff also had to complete basic RTI interviewer training prior to ELS:2002 web help desk training.\nThe goal of the web help desk training program was to provide staff with the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the study goals, the specific procedures, and the survey instrument, as well as the technical requirements and procedures for web self-administration. Key information on the purpose and goals of ELS:2002 and specific help desk and interviewing procedures were compiled in a manual for help desk staff to reference. All help desk staff were trained on how to address common issues or concerns of web respondents, both procedural and technical. The training provided help desk staff with technical information about web-based data collection so that they would be able to address respondents\u2019 technical questions. Technical information was summarized in an appendix to the web help desk/CATI interviewing manual provided to all help desk staff. This appendix could then be used by help desk staff to diagnose and resolve technical problems. All training topics were reinforced by group discussion and interaction, trainer demonstrations, and class practice sessions. Role-playing and individual practice were also important elements of the training. At the end of training, web help desk staff were certified for 2006 data collection by completing tests, exercises, and practice, including the following:\n\u2022 homework exercise on knowledge of the ELS:2002 study;\n\u2022 verbal test on responding to frequently asked questions from sample members;\n\u2022 verbal test on pronouncing key terms featured in the interview;\n\u2022 two complete practice interviews;\n\u2022 exercise on handling different help desk scenarios;\n\u2022 coding exercise for postsecondary fields of study, postsecondary institutions, and occupations; and\n\u2022 coding exercise on case outcomes from inbound and outbound calls.\nCompleting these activities ensured that web help desk staff were well prepared to assist sample members to complete the web self-interview, administer CATI interviews using best practices, and persuade sample members to finish either the web or CATI interview.\nOnce data collection began on January 25, 2006, help desk staff were available to take incoming calls and respond to e-mails from sample members 7 days a week. Help desk hours were Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time, Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time, and Sunday from 1:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Help desk staff monitored the toll-free call-in line for calls and voice mail messages from sample members. Each morning, help desk staff checked the ELS:2002 voice mailbox for messages left by sample members after operating hours. E-mail messages were handled similarly. Help desk staff regularly checked the inbox for e-mail messages from sample members during operating hours and checked each morning for e-mails sent after operating hours. Help desk staff primarily communicated with sample members by telephone, but also responded to e-mails as appropriate. Communication with sample members was predominantly\n82\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nin English, but the help desk staff included a sufficient number of bilingual interviewers to communicate with sample members (or parents) in Spanish, as necessary.\nAdditional web data collection activities. Beyond offering an early completion incentive to second follow-up sample members who completed the interview during the first 4 weeks of data collection, a number of additional follow-up activities were undertaken to encourage web participation in both the early completion period and beyond. During the early completion period, help desk staff conducted prompting calls to F1 nonrespondents in the sample to encourage them to participate. Because prior-round nonrespondents were likely to be difficult to contact, the prompting calls were intended to inform these sample members about the start of data collection and motivate them to participate early, either by web self-administration or CATI interviews. A secondary purpose of the prompting calls was to identify sample members who are unable or unwilling to complete the survey by web, so that help desk staff could offer to complete a CATI. Prompting calls for this subsample began on February 7, 2006, or just under 2 weeks after the start of data collection. The prompting protocol included up to three calls to F1 nonrespondents in the sample or until the interview was completed. Help desk staff communicated a brief statement on the purpose of the call to live respondents or on answering machine messages.\nA second set of prompting activities begun during the early completion period was periodic mail and e-mail reminders to sample members who had not yet participated in the 2006 round. The first e-mail reminder was sent on February 3, 2006, about 10 days after the start of data collection. A first reminder letter was sent to sample members only several days later on February 8. Two additional e-mail reminders sent during the early completion period were an e-mail to parents on February 10 and an e-mail to sample members on February 15. The February 15 e-mail included a reminder to sample members that only a few days remained in the early bonus period. Additional e-mail and mail reminders were sent to remaining sample members throughout data collection. While these reminders were intended to encourage sample members to participate by any mode available at that time, reminder e-mails generally produced a spike in web self-administration over the next few days following each reminder. Table 40 lists all of the reminder e-mail messages and mailed letters sent to sample members throughout the course of data collection. These reminders were designed to promote sample member interest by varying the approach and focus of each message. For example, the July 6 reminder letter and July 7 e-mail message to sample members and the July 7 e-mail message to parents were used to inform sample members and their parents of the $10 prepaid incentive sent to them. Later e-mail messages in August and September emphasized the limited time remaining to participate. In addition, e-mails reminders were only sent to sample members who had not previously refused to participate. The e-mails and letters were also spread out sufficiently over the course of the data collection period so that sample members and parents had sufficient time to respond and did not feel inundated with contact attempts.\n83\n\n\fChapter 4.

After the initial 4 weeks in which only web-based selfadministration and call-in CATI interviewing were offered to sample members, outbound CATI data collection efforts were necessary to include more sample members in the 2006 round. The primary purpose of CATI data collection was to complete telephone interviews with sample members when contacted, or to set up an appointment to complete the interview. Outbound calls also served as reminders for some sample members who preferred to complete the survey via the Web. In this way, CATI interviewers often acted as proactive web help desk staff by offering assistance to sample members to complete the web survey. For example, CATI interviewers could provide sample members with their user IDs and passwords for logging in to the web survey, if they did not have their lead letter materials. For more technical problems, CATI interviewers who were not trained on help desk activities could quickly connect sample members to trained help desk staff for assistance. Overall, the expectation was that over half of all second follow-up sample members (53 percent) would complete the 2006 survey via CATI mode and another 10 percent would complete the survey via the Web after outbound CATI calling began.\n\nThe projections for CATI data collection anticipated completing interviews at a significantly higher rate in the first 3 months versus the last 3 months of the outbound CATI calling period. Still, the distribution was not expected to be as skewed as web data collection, because sample members were offered the incentive bonus to complete the interview prior to outbound CATI calls and CATI participation depended on contacting sample members by telephone at convenient times. Some sample members were easier to reach during the academic year of their postsecondary institutions, others were easier to reach in the summer months, and others were equally reachable (or unreachable) across the entire data collection period. In addition, many sample members were able to participate within the first few telephone contact attempts, while others required multiple callbacks to reach them at a good time to complete the\n\n84\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ninterview. The training schedule and staffing plan considered these factors to ensure that an appropriate level of resources were available for CATI interviewing over the course of the study. Section 4.3.2.1 presents the results for CATI interviewing.\nCATI data collection procedures. All second follow-up sample members who had not yet completed web self-administration when outbound CATI data collection began were treated as part of the CATI sample in the CMS and managed via the CATI-CMS. The CATI-CMS facilitated sample management activities that included the following:\n\u2022 providing sample members\u2019 and parents\u2019 contact information to interviewers;\n\u2022 allowing scheduling of appointments to contact sample members at a specific time;\n\u2022 automatically scheduling callback attempts for unsuccessful call outcomes such as ring-no answer, busy signal, and answering machine;\n\u2022 appropriately coding sample members who were unable or unwilling to participate via CATI; and\n\u2022 allowing for recording of relevant notes after each call attempt.\nCases that did not have any valid telephone numbers at the start of data collection were assigned to tracing in CATI-CMS, if they had not already been traced, or held for field tracing and data collection, if prior tracing had been unsuccessful. When sample members completed the web survey or otherwise reached a final status, this information was updated in CATI-CMS so that interviewers would discontinue calling these cases. Notes from each successive call attempt provided a \u201ccase history\u201d that could be used by interviewers to make appropriate callback attempts and otherwise develop an effective strategy for reaching each sample member. Overall, CATI-CMS was the primary tool for facilitating efficient sample management for CATI data collection, tracing activities, and potential CAPI activities.\nRTI\u2019s Call Center was open to receive and initiate calls Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time, Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time, and Sunday from 1:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Interviewers worked shifts to cover weekday, night, and weekend hours to ensure that both outbound and inbound calls from sample members were covered. Scheduling also ensured that outbound calls could be made at appropriate times across time zones and at times when sample members were likely to be reachable. Extended weekday hours until 12 midnight Monday through Thursday and 11 p.m. Sunday were also implemented during part of the data collection period to reach households in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.\nWhen CATI interviewers contacted sample members, the CATI-CMS script prompted them to confirm the person\u2019s identity. The primary confirmation question (in addition to verifying the person\u2019s name) asked the sample member if he or she had attended the base year high school at any time in the past 5 years. If sample members did not verify attending the specified high school within the past 5 years, a follow-up question asked the person to provide his or her birthdate. If the birth date given matched, or very nearly matched, the birth date in the ELS:2002 database for the sample member, then the sample member\u2019s identity was confirmed. For a few cases, neither confirmation question was affirmed. These cases were identified as \u201cproblem\u201d cases and reviewed by data collection staff to determine whether the person truly was not the sample member, or whether the high school and/or birth date in the database were\n85\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nincorrect. CATI interviews were not completed until the interviewer confirmed the respondent\u2019s identity as the sample member. Once the person was confirmed, the interviewer read the informed consent script and then began the interview. All information collected in this part of the protocol was recorded by CATI-CMS for any further telephone contacts with the sample member.\nThe CATI instrument was virtually identical to the web self-interview. The only difference was that the CATI version provided an interviewer instruction on each screen to facilitate administration of each item. CATI interviewers adhered to standardized interviewing techniques and other best practices in administering the interview. Standardized interviewing procedures included reading questions and instructions exactly as scripted, probing insufficient answers in a nondirective way, recording respondents\u2019 answers exactly as given, and maintaining a neutral, nonjudgmental stance toward the substance of respondents\u2019 answers. This provided one potential advantage over web self-administration because CATI interviewers were able to provide appropriate guidance and probing whenever respondents were not completely clear on the response task for an item. CATI interviewers also functioned to reduce item nonresponse by ensuring that respondents attended to each question and probing respondents who were uncertain or hesitant about answering a question. All CATI interviewing procedures were conducted within the set of standardized interviewing techniques established prior to data collection and demonstrated in training. This not only ensured that interviewers were following appropriate interviewing procedures, but also minimized mode effects between self-administration and interviewer administration due to inappropriate guidance or feedback to respondents.\nCATI training and staffing. A key to successful CATI data collection was hiring and training a quality, professional interviewing staff. The staffing plan was derived directly from the expectation for the interviewing hours needed each week to reach the goal for completed CATI interviews. Although all 2006 interviews were conducted in English, the CATI interviewing staff included a sufficient number of bilingual interviewers who could converse with parents or other relatives of sample members who communicate primarily in Spanish.\nThe CATI training sessions followed a similar agenda as the initial web help desk training in January. The key difference was that CATI trainings only included a basic overview of web help desk operations. This overview ensured that CATI interviewers were familiar with the kinds of technical assistance that the web help desk could provide and when to connect respondents to help desk staff. The reduced time spent on help desk issues in these CATI trainings was used to focus on effective strategies for enlisting cooperation among the young adults in the sample, as this was a central part of CATI interviewers\u2019 role in data collection. The enlisting cooperation sessions emphasized that the early stages of a call are most important for establishing trust and understanding among sample members and their parents. Interviewers were trained to effectively answer the common reasons for reluctance to participate. This training included developing a detailed knowledge of the purpose of ELS:2002 and why the participation of all sample members was vital to the success of the study. Small group discussions, refusal avoidance exercises, and other techniques were used to address these training issues. As with the help desk training, key information on the purpose and goals of ELS:2002 and specific interviewing procedures were compiled in a manual for CATI interviewers to reference.\nAt the completion of training, all telephone interviewers were required to be certified for data collection by successfully completing the tests, exercises, and practice, including the following:\n86\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2022 homework exercise on knowledge of the ELS:2002 study;\n\u2022 verbal test on responding to frequently asked questions from sample members;\n\u2022 verbal test on pronouncing key terms featured in the interview;\n\u2022 two complete practice interviews;\n\u2022 coding exercise for postsecondary fields of study, postsecondary institutions, and occupations; and\n\u2022 coding exercise on case outcomes from inbound and outbound calls.\nCompleting these activities ensured that CATI interviewers were well prepared in both administering the interview using best practices and enlisting cooperation among sample members.\nQuality control measures in CATI. In addition to training and certification procedures, a number of procedures were implemented to ensure and maintain data quality in CATI interviewing. Supervision and monitoring were maintained throughout data collection. Supervisors and monitors attended training alongside CATI staff so that they were familiar with the CATI interviewing procedures.\nTo directly assess the quality of telephone interviewing, RTI used two different monitoring protocols for CATI data collection. The first protocol, quality assessment (QA) monitoring, was designed specifically for U.S. Department of Education studies. This protocol focused directly on errors made by interviewers in administering individual survey items. While this monitoring protocol provided useful data on interviewer performance, its primary purpose was to track errors made for each survey question, to provide statistical evidence of data quality, and to ensure that the interviewing operations remained within acceptable statistical process control parameters. Each QA monitoring session involved a sample of up to 20 questions from an interview. In each session, monitors recorded the frequency of the following two types of errors:\n1. Question administration errors that involve making changes in the question wording or response categories that significantly alters the intent of the question, or skipping the question inappropriately. Examples of question administration errors include the following:\n\u2212 changes to the reference period of the question;\n\u2212 changes to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the question (e.g., from positive to negative wording);\n\u2212 changes to the frequency or duration of the question;\n\u2212 changes to a conditional term within the question; and\n\u2212 failure to read a question that should be asked.\n2. Data entry errors such as keying an incorrect or inaccurate response to the question.\nThe data from QA sessions met multiple CATI data collection quality objectives, including identification of challenging questions, identification and reduction of any interviewer errors, and overall assessment of the quality of the data being collected. During the study,\n87\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nELS:2002 staff monitored daily results and charted the QA results on a weekly basis to detect any spikes in error rates and to make any necessary adjustments in data collection procedures. See section 4.3.2.4 for a presentation and discussion of the QA monitoring results for data collection.\nA second CATI interviewer monitoring protocol focused more directly on interviewer behaviors related to performance. This standardized monitoring procedure was designed to record interviewer behaviors during the contacting and interviewing process that could then be used to provide interviewers with feedback to improve their performance. This monitoring served to reinforce appropriate behaviors in presenting the survey to respondents, enlisting respondent cooperation, delivering questions to respondents, probing inadequate responses, and maintaining professional and positive rapport with respondents. The interviewer-focused protocol for monitoring telephone interviewers focused on the following aspects of CATI interviewing:\n\u2022 gaining respondent cooperation;\n\u2022 delivering the introduction and informed consent;\n\u2022 speech characteristics;\n\u2022 reading skills;\n\u2022 probing skills;\n\u2022 professional skills in handling the interview situation;\n\u2022 CATI navigation, coding, and data entry skills; and\n\u2022 presentation skills.\nFollowing individual monitoring sessions, CATI interviewers received timely feedback on any significant problems in enlisting cooperation or administering the interview. These monitoring session results were also compiled in a database to provide historical evidence of data collection quality for individual staff members, groups of staff members, and the entire project team.\nAnother important activity during CATI interviewing was holding regular quality circle (QC) meetings to ensure that procedures were being followed correctly and data quality was being maintained. The QC meetings provided a forum to focus on productivity goals, data quality, sample management, and related issues. The meetings also provided feedback to project managers on any issues that might require retraining of call center staff. After each meeting, managers summarized the issues discussed and provided resolutions of any problems to all call center staff in the form of QC memos. A total of 17 QC meetings were held during the course of CATI data collection, or about 1 every 2 weeks. To give all interviewers an opportunity to attend QC meetings regularly, separate meetings were held for day shift interviewers and night/ weekend interviewers.\nA final important set of activities to ensure data quality in CATI operations was to follow statistical process quality control principles, including the following:\n\u2022 measuring key indicators of data collection quality and quantity;\n\u2022 reducing variation in the data collection process to maintain consistency;\n88\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2022 monitoring data collection indicators closely; and\n\u2022 improving the process to maintain targets for both quality and quantity.\nThese principles were applied to three specific aspects of CATI operations: question administration and data entry, interviewer performance goals, and overall production goals. During data collection, these statistics were monitored daily and reported weekly so that CATI data collection could be regularly evaluated and any corrective steps taken quickly. For each indicator, we set acceptable ranges of variation against which results could be evaluated. The results were then presented in table or graphic form to facilitate quick identification of \u201cout-ofcontrol\u201d conditions.\nCAPI data collection. To reach sample members who had not yet participated by web or CATI modes, CAPI data collection commenced 8 weeks after the start of outbound CATI calling on April 17. Beginning field data collection in mid-April was intended to provide an opportunity to reach sample members in person before many of them became highly mobile over the summer. Many sample members would still be taking classes at a postsecondary institution at that time, and then follow other pursuits when classes ended in May. Experience from the F2 field test indicated that a significant number of sample members became more difficult to locate once spring classes ended. Starting CAPI data collection in April was intended to avoid situations where sample members had to be relocated once they began summer activities, such as working, traveling, or taking summer classes at another institution.\nThe data collection target for CAPI data collection was to complete 1,500 interviews, or about 9 percent of second follow-up sample members. Because of the flow of data collection across modes, field cases were expected to generally represent those cases that were most difficult to successfully locate and interview. CAPI projections followed a similar pattern as CATI data collection, but with the expectation that it would take some time to reach full production level. Field interviewing typically requires a critical mass of cases to maximize productivity, and the flow of cases from CATI or tracing to field was limited over the first few weeks of CAPI data collection. Field data collection was expected to begin to taper off in July and further still in August, as the number of pending cases ultimately declined. Section 4.3.2.1 presents the results for CAPI interviewing.\nCAPI procedures. The approach for CAPI data collection followed the strategy used successfully on B&B:93/2003 and other recent NCES studies. This approach first identified clusters according to the last known ZIP code of the sample members that could potentially be assigned to CAPI interviewing. Then, based on the distribution of cases by cluster, the geographic clusters that had the highest concentration of cases were staffed with one or more field interviewers. In reviewing caseloads across clusters, particular attention was also paid to those with a significant number of sample members identified as dropouts. Both the 2004 and F2 field test data collection indicated that dropouts would generally be more difficult to include in the study, so CAPI data collection attempted to maximize the yield from this subgroup in the sample.\nCases were assigned to CAPI data collection via a cluster control system (CCS). The CCS used geographic information systems based on ZIP codes to map out geographic clusters from where sample members reside. Clusters were identified in stages. Those with the highest concentration of cases were identified quickly and plans to staff them initiated. Initially, the 35 largest active clusters were identified and activated in the CCS. Among other potential clusters,\n89\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nfactors such as the potential caseload, distance from other clusters, and number of dropouts were used to prioritize activating these clusters. These additional clusters were activated as data collection progressed. The cluster identification and activation procedures remained flexible in the early stages of CAPI data collection to ensure that significant numbers of cases, and/or important cases such as dropouts, could be included in field efforts. Furthermore, field clusters were considered in two ranges, either a 50- or 75-mile radius from the center, to determine the optimal configuration of clusters. For example, clusters with high population density were set at the 50-mile radius, while those with a wider distribution of cases were set at the 75-mile radius. This approach was intended to optimize coverage of potential CAPI cases, while at the same time containing the costs associated with collecting data in person.\nAcross all clusters, the expectation was that a total of about 3,000 cases would eventually be assigned to CAPI data collection. Cases were assigned to CAPI data collection twice weekly on a flow basis, from the start of field data collection through the end of data collection. CAPI cases were composed of cases that met one of three criteria:\n1. Unable to locate sample member through CATI and intensive tracing efforts.\n2. The sample member declined to participate through CATI efforts or other prior contacts.\n3. Substantial efforts were made to contact the sample member via CATI, mail, and e-mail, but had not yet been successful.\nWhen a case was identified as requiring CAPI effort, one of these three codes was assigned to the case so that field supervisors and interviewers knew why each case was assigned to the field\u2014unable to locate, prior refusal, or difficulty in contacting. This procedure assisted CAPI staff in developing an appropriate approach to each case.\nAfter cases identified for CAPI data collection were assigned to specific clusters, the field manager and field supervisors used a web-based Assignment/Transfer System (ATS) to assign cases to specific interviewers. Some areas where sample is concentrated comprised a single cluster with only one field interviewer, while cases in more populous areas were assigned to multiple interviewers in the area. The web ATS also enabled field supervisors to initiate transfer of cases from one field interviewer to another, as necessary.\nTo assist CAPI interviewers in contacting each sample member, a record of prior CATI and tracing activities was provided for each case assigned to the field. Field interviewers, with the help of their supervisors, develop a strategy for making personal visits to various locations where sample members, parents, and other locator sources are known to have resided at some time. This included visits to addresses obtained during the base-year and first follow-up data collection efforts or from other sources used during previous tracing efforts. If the sample member is known to have attended a high school that did not provide a transcript, the field interviewer could occasionally contact the high school to attempt to confirm or ascertain the sample member\u2019s last known address and phone number. Field interviewers also followed up on any leads related to postsecondary institutions the sample member applied to or attended. Further locating steps taken included, for example, searching a postsecondary institution\u2019s website and/or contacting the institution by phone to confirm that the sample member was attending the school and to obtain any phone number or address information that was available. If the institution or new address obtained was beyond the interviewer\u2019s work area, field supervisors\n90\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ndetermined the best course of action for pursuing the case. Next steps included transferring the case back to CATI data collection (when a new phone number was obtained), transferring the case to another field interviewer who was nearer the institution or new address, or sending an interviewer to the sample member\u2019s area. Field locators were also added to the CAPI staff beginning in July to assist interviewers with locating the most difficult-to-find sample members.\nField staff carried a Letter of Authorization signed by the NCES project officer to validate their legitimacy as a field interviewer for ELS:2002. The letter was intended to help overcome barriers to participation that are frequently encountered when making \u201ccold\u201d contacts face-to-face, especially with persons who had not previously seen the study materials. Field interviewers also carried copies of the lead letter and brochure so they could quickly provide these study materials to sample members, parents, or others who had questions about the study. In addition, because the introductory statement, respondent confirmation, and informed consent scripts were not built into the CAPI interview, field interviewers carried laminated hard copies of these scripts so that they could be sure to present them appropriately to respondents.\nThe CAPI interview was conducted on laptop computers via a web-based interface that used personal web server software. A local database resided on each laptop to assist with coding operations and other temporary storage of data during the interview. To maintain consistency across interviewing modes, the CAPI interview was identical to the CATI interview. The same interviewer instructions presented in CATI interviews were included in the CAPI interview. CAPI interviewers also followed the same standardized interviewing procedures as CATI interviewers, including techniques for reading questions, probing insufficient answers, recording answers, and maintaining neutrality with respect to respondents\u2019 answers. All CAPI interviewing procedures were conducted within this same set of standardized interviewing techniques established prior to data collection and presented in training.\nCAPI interviewers were allowed to administer the interview over the telephone, which produced conditions even more similar to CATI interviewing. While this was not the preferred option, it proved useful for those cases where the sample member could be reached more easily by telephone than in person and was willing to do the interview when contacted. This option was also useful for completing interviews with mobile sample members who temporarily left the field interviewer\u2019s cluster area during the data collection period. For sample members who preferred to complete the survey via the Web, field interviewers ensured that they had the necessary information and instructions to complete web self-interviewing. Field interviewers typically allowed these sample members about a week to complete the interview through the Web. If they had not completed the survey during that time, field interviewers then called them back to ask if they had encountered any problems and to offer to complete the interview with them by telephone.\nWhen they found sample members who had not yet participated in the survey, field locators were allowed to assist them to either access the web self-administered interview or call in to complete a CATI interview. If the sample member agreed to complete the interview by either mode, field locators could then wait in the home until the interview was finished to provide the respondent with his or her incentive in person. In these situations, the locator instructed the respondent to alert him as soon as the respondent completed the last item, which was described to him before beginning the interview. Overall, few field interviews were conducted in this manner. In all such cases, the field locator provided the respondent with the incentive as soon as the interview was completed.\n91\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nAt the end of each workday, CAPI interviewers electronically transmitted their completed interview data and status codes for each assigned case to RTI computers. The field transmission ensured that field interviewers regularly delivered data to the main ELS:2002 database in a timely fashion and that interview data could therefore be secured in the main data files. The transmitting system also allowed field interviewers to receive new cases when they were assigned and to capture updates to case information and the survey instrument as necessary.\nCAPI staffing and training. Given the challenging nature of CAPI data collection, an experienced and skilled staff of field interviewers was critical to the success of this effort. CAPI staffing began with recruiting and hiring five experienced field supervisors to assist the CAPI manager in managing the field interviewing staff. Recruitment of the field staff targeted veteran field interviewers who had strong past performance on similar studies. In addition, those with extensive experience in locating difficult-to-find respondents and converting initial refusals were favored in staffing CAPI data collection. Because we were not able to exclusively hire interviewers with extensive experience and demonstrated skills, additional interviewer candidates with strong references, computer experience, and strong interpersonal skills were also recruited. In recruiting interviewing staff, we also considered the demographic characteristics of the set of field clusters, so that we could include interviewers experienced in interacting with persons of relevant ethnic and linguistic groups in the cluster, such as native Spanish speakers.\nThe first field interviewer training was conducted April 9 through April 12 and a second training May 21 through May 24. Both CAPI training sessions were composed of 2 hours of preclassroom home study, three 8-hour days of training, and a final 6-hour day, for a total of 32 hours. Trainees who were new to interviewing attended an additional 8-hour day of training on general interviewing and computer skills prior to the first day of each training session.\nA comprehensive, classroom-based training program was developed for the 2006 CAPI training. Key information on the purpose and goals of ELS:2002 and specific interviewing procedures was compiled in a manual for field interviewers to reference. The training emphasized quality aspects of interviewing (such as instructions on field tracing, enlisting cooperation, and correctly administering the interview) as well as data collection efficiency issues (such as using locating information and prioritizing visits to sample members or parents). Specific training sessions included the following:\n\u2022 structured practice with the web-based program, CMS, e-mail, and data transmission systems;\n\u2022 review of case documentation, procedures, and reporting, and administrative requirements;\n\u2022 standardized interview administration techniques;\n\u2022 specifics of the laptop computer and the use of the CMS; and\n\u2022 role-playing exercises to practice administering the interview and gaining cooperation from respondents.\nMost of these training modules were conducted by combining a presentation with handson practice or group discussions.\nIn addition to completing the home study exercise prior to training, all field interviewers were required to pass the following certification steps on the final day of training:\n92\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2022 A verbal test on responding to frequently asked questions from sample members and gaining cooperation.\n\u2022 A mock interview with a trainer as respondent.\n\u2022 A coding exercise for postsecondary fields of study, postsecondary institutions, and occupations.\n\u2022 An exercise on selecting appropriate event codes and entering a code in the CMS.\nCompleting these activities ensured that the CAPI interviewers were well prepared in both administering the interview appropriately and enlisting cooperation in the most challenging situations.\nQuality control measures in CAPI. Like CATI efforts, CAPI data collection included multiple procedures to ensure that data quality standards were being maintained. The CAPI task leader and field supervisors closely monitored CAPI production on a daily basis so that they could quickly address production issues and other field data collection challenges. Field supervisors held weekly conference calls with each of their field interviewers to discuss the status of each assigned case and ensure appropriate efforts were being made for each case. During these calls, particular emphasis was placed on handling refusal cases and determining appropriate steps for locating cases. The CAPI manager also held weekly conference calls with each field supervisor to discuss field production and strategies and to communicate any updates on data collection plans.\nTo maintain control of quality in CAPI data collection, verification interviews were conducted for a sample of each field interviewer\u2019s completed interviews. At the end of each CAPI interview, respondents were told that they might be contacted for quality control purposes. Verification calls and interviews were completed by in-house telephone interviewers. Training to conduct verification calls was held on May 8 and verification calls began immediately. Completed CAPI interviews were sampled randomly over the course of data collection and added to a modified CATI-CMS program to schedule the verification calls. The verification interview included a brief set of questions about the procedures followed during the original interview, including the date on which the interview occurred, the mode in which the interview was completed (by telephone or in person), the approximate duration of the interview, and the amount of the incentive paid. In addition, two key factual questions from the 2006 interview were asked again in the verification interview: whether the respondent had held a job for pay since high school, and whether the respondent had attended any postsecondary institutions since high school. Any problems detected through verifications were coded and displayed on a verification report. The report was monitored by the CAPI manager and field supervisors so that issues could be addressed with the field staff member in a timely manner.\n4.3.1.4 Intensive Tracing During Data Collection\nWhen sample members were determined to have insufficient contact information to reach them as a result of outbound CATI data collection efforts, more intensive tracing efforts were undertaken. The two primary intensive tracing modes were centralized interactive tracing and field locating. Centralized tracing was conducted by tracing specialists located in RTI\u2019s Call Center Services facility. The centralized tracing operations followed a comprehensive and proven set of procedures for locating sample members using Internet searches and telephone\n93\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ncontacts. Tracing specialists were trained exclusively in tracing procedures, resources, and investigative techniques and most had experience in tracing the young adult population that comprised the ELS:2002 sample.\nWhen cases were assigned to CAPI data collection, field tracing was performed by field interviewers or field locators as needed. CAPI staff with experience in locating difficult-to-find sample members were favored in staffing the field effort. Field interviewers and locators relied on well-established techniques to trace sample members in their local communities. Field tracing was also combined with centralized tracing procedures when field locating efforts produced specific information that could be used by tracing specialists to perform online searches.\nA third set of tracing procedures added during data collection was peer locating. This involved prompting participants to provide any information they might have about ELS:2002 sample members who attended the same high school. These activities were reserved for the latter half of data collection to assist the data collection team in obtaining leads on sample members who had proven most difficult to locate.\nCentralized interactive tracing procedures. A total of 12 tracing specialists and 7 quality control specialists were trained for the interactive tracing effort. All tracing specialists had prior experience conducting interactive tracing, and many had worked on previous rounds of ELS:2002. Tracers and tracing supervisors were trained in a 2-hour session that included background information on sample maintenance activities and prior contacts with ELS:2002 sample members, an overview of interactive tracing procedures, discussion of particular challenges in locating the young adults in the sample, and responding to frequently asked questions when contacting sample members or others. Interactive tracing efforts began on February 27 and continued through September 7, 2006. Throughout data collection, quality circle meetings were held periodically with tracing staff to ensure that best practices were being followed and to discuss strategies for successful tracing.\nThe starting point for interactive tracing efforts was the contact information provided during the baseline or first follow-up data collection, and any updates to this information acquired through the batch tracing and sample maintenance activities conducted in fall 2005, as described in section 4.3.1.1. All of this information was included in the ELS:2002 locator database. In the BY and F1 rounds, participants had been asked to provide the following information as part of the interview protocol:\n\u2022 respondent\u2019s full name, address, and current telephone number;\n\u2022 respondent\u2019s Social Security number (SSN);\n\u2022 full name, address, and telephone number of mother/father or female/male guardian of respondent;\n\u2022 full name, address, and telephone number of a close relative not currently living with the respondent who would always be likely to know how to locate the respondent;\n\u2022 full name, address, and telephone number of close personal or family friend not currently living with the respondent who would always be likely to know how to locate the respondent;\n\u2022 respondent\u2019s nickname, if any;\n94\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2022 basic occupational information about both parents/guardians; and\n\u2022 any postsecondary institutions to which they had applied and/or planned to attend.\nAlthough information about postsecondary institutions obtained in the 2004 first followup was expected to have limited usefulness, this avenue was explored in tracing efforts. Given the high proportion of sample members expected to be enrolled in postsecondary institutions, any available school directories could be used to help locate sample members.\nAnother important aspect of tracing sample members was using parent information. Because sample members were now mostly 19 or 20 years old, a significant number had information to facilitate locating them through interactive tracing. For other sample members, parent information was the most useful route to locating sample members.\nWhen CATI interviewing efforts were unable to locate sample members at any of the telephone numbers available, the case was identified as needing tracing. CATI supervisors then reviewed these cases to ensure that all available numbers had been exhausted. This effort varied in complexity, as the number of unique telephone numbers available for each sample member ranged from zero to five (or more).\nOnce reviewed cases were assigned to interactive tracing, tracing specialists implemented a systematic set of procedures for tracing sample members that had been shown to be effective on prior rounds of ELS:2002 and similar studies:\n\u2022 Check preloaded information: Check case, source/contact, lead, and case history screens for any relevant information.\n\u2022 Call all preloaded phone numbers: Verify that all preloaded phone numbers are working and whether the subject can be contacted through these numbers.\n\u2022 Trans Union: Run \u201cTrace\u201d SSN search if provided. When one does not have SSN, run the \u201cReTrace\u201d search.\n\u2022 Experian SSN search/address update: Run SSN search if SSN is provided and address when SSN is not given.\n\u2022 Fast Data address search: Run address search on the subject and contact for preload and developed contacts.\n\u2022 Fast Data DA Plus: Run a DA+ search on the generated addresses.\n\u2022 Fast Data reverse search: Run a reverse search on generated phone numbers not associated with physical addresses.\n\u2022 Fast Data name search: Run a name search for the subject in the city and state in which there are contacts for the subject. Note: A surname search can also be used to develop information for relatives.\n\u2022 Accurint: Perform name search, address search, reverse phone search, and neighbor search.\n\u2022 Repeat any of the above steps as necessary, depending on any leads developed.\nThese steps were used interactively in that tracing specialists could change the sequence of subsequent steps depending on specific leads found in initial steps. Furthermore, when new\n95\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ntelephone numbers were found through any of these sources, tracers would attempt to confirm that the sample member was in fact residing at that telephone number. Direct confirmation was a key step in the interactive tracing process, as confirming telephone numbers allowed for cases to be returned to CATI data collection immediately without further tracing efforts. When new telephone numbers could not be directly confirmed, tracing specialists would generally conduct additional searches to corroborate this information.\nAll information obtained for cases through centralized tracing was added to CATI-CMS. The most current locating information for sample members was therefore readily available for additional data collection and tracing efforts. When new telephone numbers were found via interactive tracing (confirmed or unconfirmed), the new numbers would be exported to CATICMS for continued CATI data collection efforts. When only address information was obtained for sample members, the information was exported to CATI-CMS, but the case was also identified as requiring CAPI data collection efforts. Cases for which no new information was obtained would also be assigned to CAPI data collection.\nBased on experience from the ELS:2002 2004 data collection, the expectation was that as many as 33 percent of sample members would require some level of interactive tracing during data collection. A total of 3,000 cases were assigned to interactive tracing at least once during data collection. Among these, 320 cases were assigned to interactive tracing a second time. Unlocated cases were assigned to a second round of tracing when one of the following conditions was met:\n\u2022 no field interviewer was currently available in the local area to conduct field locating;\n\u2022 new information was obtained from field locating that could be used more effectively in interactive tracing; or\n\u2022 review of the initial tracing effort indicated one or more leads could be pursued further through additional tracing efforts.\nOverall, 81 percent of cases traced interactively (one or more times) resulted in new information being obtained. No new information was obtained for 17 percent of cases traced, and work was stopped for the remaining 2 percent of cases. (Stop work orders resulted from cases being finalized prior to the completion of interactive tracing efforts.) Although the overall rate of locating information was relatively high, not all information obtained through interactive tracing was equally useful. For this reason, reports of case status were created for each type of locating information obtained (telephone, address, or both) and whether this information was confirmed. These reports allowed data collection staff to more accurately assess the ultimate value of information obtained via interactive tracing for locating and interviewing sample members. The overall response rate was highest for those cases where both a new address and telephone number were obtained through interactive tracing (83 percent), and lowest for those cases where only an unconfirmed address was found (65 percent). For cases where only sample members\u2019 parents could be located through interactive tracing, the success rate was even lower (61 percent).\nField tracing procedures. Despite the general success of finding new contact information for sample members via centralized interactive tracing, useful information could not be obtained for a significant portion of second follow-up sample members. For these cases, the next step was\n96\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nto assign them to CAPI interviewers for field locating efforts. Locating issues and strategies were included as part of CAPI training.\nThe starting point for field locating was the last known address for each sample member. For each case assigned to CAPI data collection, a record of interactive tracing results as well as the CATI call history was provided to the interviewer. CAPI interviewers, with the assistance of their supervisors, developed strategies for visiting various locations where sample members, their parents, and other locator sources are known to have resided at some point. Initial field tracing steps included revisiting or recontacting leads documented by centralized tracing efforts, calling sample members\u2019 and parents\u2019 old phone numbers, and visiting sample members\u2019 and parents\u2019 previous addresses. One advantage of field locating over centralized tracing was that field staff could use information obtained locally in combination with the information provided from previous tracing and data collection efforts to determine where sample members most likely resided. Beginning in late July, 13 experienced field locators were hired and trained to augment field locating efforts.\nWhen field interviewers or locators made contacts as part of field locating efforts, they asked a set of questions about the sample member\u2019s spouse or partner, work situation, recent moves, and related questions to generate further leads. Standard questions included:\n\u2022 Is the sample member married? What is the spouse\u2019s name?\n\u2022 Does the sample member work? Where? What kind of work does he or she do?\n\u2022 Does the spouse work? Where? What kind of work does he or she do?\n\u2022 When did the sample member move? Do you know where?\n\u2022 Did the sample member own or rent the home?\n\u2022 Does the sample member attend a local church?\nIf these questions did not produce useful information or leads, field staff would also ask contacts for suggestions on the most likely way to contact the sample member or parents. Field interviewers used a checklist of potential sources to document the steps taken to locate sample members, covering a variety of possible contacts and local institutions that could be useful for obtaining contact information or other leads. These records were useful for documenting efforts for additional field locating or centralized tracing steps.\nIn addition, field staff frequently attempted to locate sample members by using local information or leads obtained for conducting Internet searches. Websites such as http://www.whitepages.com/, http://zabasearch.com/, and http://theultimates.com/ often produced good results, especially for looking for relatives of parents and other family members. Using information obtained in sample members\u2019 communities, such as information from neighbors, often provided an advantage for field staff in searching for sample members.\nPeer locating procedures. One further tracing activity implemented during data collection was peer locating. Because of the challenges of locating highly mobile ELS:2002 sample members, peer locating was initiated in May. Peer locating involved two related activities: sending e-mail messages to participants asking for their assistance in locating sample members who attended the same high school and conducting outbound prompting calls to selected participants in order to request their assistance with locating these classmates. For both\n97\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nparticipants and interviewers who were conducting prompting calls, a special, secure web interface was established to enter any contact information for pending sample members. This web application was accessible only to respondents who were contacted as part of the peer locating effort.\nThe first step in peer locating involved sending e-mails to 9,300 participants on May 19, 2006. Those receiving e-mails included all respondents who attended the same high school as at least one second follow-up sample member who had not yet completed the interview. The e-mail message explained to participants that the data collection team was seeking their assistance in locating pending sample members and provided instructions on how they could provide this information, including a direct link to the website. When respondents logged on, they were prompted with a list of one or more classmates who had not yet participated in the survey. Once these sample members did complete the survey, they were automatically removed from the peer locating list.\nAfter allowing participants approximately 4 weeks to respond to the request for information on their peers, prompting calls were initiated to those respondents who had not yet logged on to the website to attempt to provide information for their listed classmates. Prompting calls began in late June, and included 7,500 participants. Up to three prompting calls were made to each respondent. Once successful contact was made with participants, prompting calls were completed. Otherwise, three attempts were made for each respondent.\nPeer locating efforts targeted a total of 3,600 ELS:2002 second follow-up sample members who had not yet completed the interview and had at least one classmate who had completed the interview prior to May 19. A total of 1,600 unique pieces of information for these pending cases was obtained from peers. This information pertained to 1,000 sample members, or about 28 percent of the cases targeted.\nData collection staff then evaluated the information received through peer locating efforts in terms of its usefulness. Overall, about 20 percent of peer locating information was judged as likely to be useful, which included new telephone numbers, updated addresses, or other contact information. Another 70 percent of the information was evaluated as potentially useful, such as information on which postsecondary school the sample members may have attended. The remaining 10 percent of the information was considered not useful because it did not indicate where the sample member was currently living or how the person could be contacted. Information judged likely or potentially useful was then added to the locator database and/or communicated to interviewing staff.\n4.3.1.5 Data Collection Procedures for Initial Refusals and Difficult Cases\nAnother important challenge in planning data collection was developing procedures for sample members who initially refuse to participate or who otherwise prove difficult to include in the study. As indicated in section 4.3.1.2, the design of the incentive plan considered factors likely to increase the difficulty of including certain sample members, such as those who did not participate in the previous wave and those who had dropped out of high school. The incentive plan was intended to reduce the potential for sample members to hesitate or refuse to participate when first contacted about the data collection. Because the incentive plan could not avert initial hesitation or refusal among all sample members nor address all reasons for hesitation or refusal, procedures were needed to overcome hesitation and avoid refusals among sample members. In addition, because not all refusal or difficult situations could be avoided, contingency procedures\n98\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nwere needed to address initial refusals or other difficult-to-complete cases during data collection. This section describes the procedures in place to avoid refusals, manage initial refusals, and handle other difficult situations.\nProcedures for avoiding refusals. Procedures for avoiding refusal situations included three primary sets of activities: interviewer training sessions, web/CATI quality circle meetings, and sample management. Efforts to avoid sample member refusals began in the training sessions of web help desk and telephone and field interviewing staff. Training modules addressed common reasons for reluctance or refusal, strategies to address potential refusal situations, and consideration of specific reluctance or refusal statements and behaviors. Presentations, discussion, role-playing exercises, and a team competition were all used to prepare interviewers to address potential refusal situations. These training modules included specific objections from sample members or parents and potential interviewer responses that were directly based on experiences from prior rounds of ELS:2002 and other current education studies of young adults.\nAnother important focus of interviewer training was addressing potential reluctance or specific objections among gatekeepers. Experience from prior rounds of ELS:2002 demonstrated the ways in which parents and other household members can either help or hinder efforts to contact sample members. Training modules also focused discussion and exercises on how interviewers can successfully address common gatekeeper concerns and objections. To assist CATI interviewers, the CATI-CMS program included scripted probes for interviewers to use when asking parents\u2019 or other contacts\u2019 cooperation in reaching sample members. Because many sample members had completed high school and moved out of their parents\u2019 household, gaining parent assistance in contacting sample members was often the first step in the survey participation process.\nThese training sessions all followed the same general strategy for addressing reluctant sample members or gatekeepers, including the following:\n\u2022 understanding the reason(s) for the subject\u2019s or gatekeeper\u2019s reluctance as quickly as possible;\n\u2022 being prepared to address the concern(s) quickly and directly;\n\u2022 focusing responses on why the sample member\u2019s participation is important to ELS:2002; and\n\u2022 using an effective tone and maintaining a professional approach.\nThis strategy was illustrated through specific examples used in training modules.\nIn addition, all interviewers were required to complete an exercise in responding to sample member or gatekeeper concerns as part of the certification process mentioned in section 4.3.1.3. This certification process reinforced using the refusal avoidance strategy to communicate the importance of sample members\u2019 participation in ELS:2002. The most important points interviewers were trained to communicate to sample members and other contacts included:\n\u2022 reminding sample members and parents of their previous participation;\n\u2022 the importance of sample members\u2019 continued participation;\n\u2022 the importance of ELS:2002 for education in the United States;\n99\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\u2022 the incentive payment provided to sample members;\n\u2022 explanations of the 2006 data collection procedures and options; and\n\u2022 a toll-free number to talk with the data collection manager about the study.\nKey talking points and refusal avoidance strategies were regularly reinforced in quality circle meetings held with help desk and telephone interviewing staff. As mentioned in section 4.3.1.3, QC meetings were held biweekly during 2006 data collection to ensure procedures were being followed correctly. QC meetings provided a forum for interviewers to discuss specific examples of reluctance or refusal responses among sample members and possible steps to address these concerns. After the first few QC meetings focused on basic issues, data collection managers began to regularly add a session at the end of each QC meeting devoted to role-playing potential refusal situations. These sessions provided regular practice and discussion for interviewing staff so that they were prepared to address these situations effectively. For CAPI data collection, weekly calls between field supervisors and field interviewers addressed the same kinds of issues in one-to-one conversations.\nSample management activities in CATI data collection were also an important part of refusal avoidance procedures. Call scheduling procedures were designed to avoid inundating households in the sample with too-frequent calls. For example, when answering machines were reached and a message left, the CATI-CMS call scheduling system held these cases for at least 3 days to give sample members or their parents some time to return the call. When sample members or parents requested a callback for a specific day and time, interviewers entered these appointments in CATI-CMS so that the appointment cases would be delivered to interviewers at the appropriate time. Telephone supervisors were continually aware of the need to keep all appointments, and monitored the status of upcoming appointments to ensure all appointments were covered. These procedures ensured that appointments were kept regularly, which was a significant issue for sample members and parents with busy schedules. Another important feature of CATI-CMS that provided assistance in avoiding refusal situations was the call history log. After each call, interviewers entered relevant information about the results of the call and any interaction with sample members or other contacts in this log. These notes ensured that interviewers who made subsequent calls to contact sample members were aware of the results of previous calls. The call history log allowed interviewing staff to be sensitive to any concerns sample members, parents, or other contacts had about the 2006 data collection process and to be prepared to address those concerns in subsequent contacts.\nCAPI staff also used sample management techniques to avoid refusal situations. A key difference between CAPI and CATI was that field efforts to avert refusals were based on collaborations between field supervisors and field interviewers. Field interviewers worked with their supervisors to develop an individual approach to each case based on the reason the case was sent to the field, the CATI call history for the case, and the results of any initial contact attempts by the CAPI interviewer. Field staff maintained detailed documentation of contact attempts on a \u201cRecord of Actions\u201d form and also entered this information in the field CMS. Field interviewers could then review this information when planning future contacts with each sample member and, if the case was transferred to another interviewer, provide information for those subsequent contact attempts.\nProcedures for converting refusals. Despite the procedures in place to avoid refusal situations, a total of 660 initial refusals occurred among sample members. Another 1,400 initial\n100\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nrefusals occurred across all contact attempts, including refusals where parents or other contacts attempted to decline on the part of sample members. Whenever a call resulted in a refusal, CATI interviewers followed a predetermined set of steps to classify the refusal situation. CATI-CMS produced a series of screens that allowed interviewers to specify the following information:\n\u2022 person who refused (sample member or other);\n\u2022 point at which the refusal occurred (prior, during, or after the introduction);\n\u2022 strength of refusal (mild, firm, or hostile); and\n\u2022 any specific reasons mentioned for the refusal.\nMost of the initial refusals by sample members (70 percent) were coded as \u201cmild\u201d by interviewers, indicating that in most cases interviewers simply contacted the sample member at a time or in a situation where he or she was not prepared to participate. Table 41 provides a breakdown of the point of refusal and primary reasons for sample member refusals, when provided. This table records both the timing and reason(s) for refusals, so cases are often represented two or more times. The first three rows provide support to the conclusion that a significant number of initial refusals were often quick interactions where sample members, parents, or other contacts either did not fully understand the purpose of the call or were not in a situation where they were able to participate. Just about half of all initial hangups occurred prior to the reading of the introductory script, during the introduction, or just after the introduction when the sample member\u2019s identity was being confirmed. Among reasons for refusal, the two most common reasons reported were not being interested in general (22 percent) and specifically not being interested in participating in ELS:2002 again (21 percent). Another 12 percent of sample members indicated that they were too busy to participate and 14 percent provided various other reasons for declining the interview. For some 10 percent, no information was provided as to either the timing of or reason for refusal. These results provided an overview of the nature of refusals that data collection managers and interviewing staff used to adapt procedures for converting refusals.\n\nTable 41.

After a call resulted in a refusal and the information about the interaction was entered,\n\n101\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nCATI-CMS moved the case to a special refusal queue. Cases in the refusal queue were held for at least 1 week after the initial refusal before being made available by the call scheduler for subsequent refusal conversion attempts. In practice, the time interval between the initial refusal and the next contact was often longer than 1 week, as multiple subsequent calls were often required to contact these sample members again.\nDelaying subsequent contact attempts was a key sample management procedure used to maximize the success of refusal conversion efforts. This break provided a short period to allow sample members to reconsider their participation in the study and, in some cases, to be in a more favorable situation to participate. For the same reason, CAPI interviewers who were assigned initial refusal cases from CATI data collection typically waited a week before attempting to contact these sample members. All refusal cases assigned to field data collection were reviewed carefully by the field supervisor and field interviewer. Field staff would review the statements made by the prospective respondent or gatekeeper when they declined participation and develop a refusal conversion approach for each individual case. The approach of field staff sometimes included having the supervisor contact the household first, in some cases, or transferring the case to another CAPI interviewer when the original interviewer was unable to make progress with the case.\nBecause data collection staff anticipated that a significant number of refusals would ultimately transpire, plans were made early in data collection to conduct specialized refusal conversion training sessions for telephone interviewing staff within a few weeks after the start of outbound CATI calling. The first refusal conversion training was conducted about 3 weeks after outbound CATI data collection, and a second training session was held 2 weeks later. For both training sessions, data collection staff selected interviewers with strong performance ratings to attend these trainings. Interviewers were also identified based on qualitative feedback from telephone supervisors and monitors. As a general rule, interviewers selected to be refusal conversion specialists were interviewers who had demonstrated skills in enlisting cooperation among sample members and avoiding initial refusals. The training sessions emphasized specific refusal conversion techniques tailored to the ELS:2002 sample of young adults, including overcoming objections, addressing concerns of gatekeepers, and providing alternatives for participation. Both group discussions and individual role-playing exercises were used in refusal conversion training. Only interviewers who had successfully completed one of these training sessions were allowed to call initial refusals. Section 4.3.2.3 presents the results of refusal conversion efforts across all modes of data collection.\nProcedures for addressing other difficult situations. In addition to sample member refusals, 2006 data collection efforts encountered other difficult cases. As described in section 4.3.1.2, a number of criteria (including refusal) were used during data collection to designate cases as difficult. The most common nonrefusal situations that led to the difficult case designation included the following:\n\u2022 more than 20 contact attempts were made without completing the interview;\n\u2022 the case was submitted to intensive tracing because the sample member could not be located;\n\u2022 the case was assigned to field data collection, either because the sample member could not be located or could not be contacted by telephone; or\n\u2022 the sample member had not completed the interview as of June 15, 2006.\n102\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nAs noted in section 4.3.1.2, meeting any of these criteria resulted in an increase in the incentive amount. Section 4.3.1.4 describes procedures for intensive field tracing of sample members who were difficult to locate. This section describes procedures for addressing other kinds of difficult situations, especially sample members who were difficult to reach by telephone.\nSimilarly to refusal conversion efforts, a number of additional procedures beyond the incentive increase were implemented to manage difficult-to-reach sample members. When cases were designated as difficult, CATI-CMS moved them to a special queue. Cases in the difficult queue were assigned to interviewers in a similar manner as refusal cases. Only telephone interviewers who had demonstrated skills in enlisting cooperation among sample members and handling difficult situations were assigned to call cases in the difficult queue. As with refusals, interviewing staff used both general strategies and the specific information in CATI-CMS, including the call history log, to develop an approach to address each difficult case. Based on the criteria established by the data collection staff, all pending nonrefusal cases were moved to the difficult queue on June 15, 2006. At that point, all CATI interviewing staff were prepared to call difficult cases. Like refusal situations, difficult nonrefusal scenarios were discussed with telephone interviewers in QC meetings and with field interviewers in regular calls with field supervisors.\nOne of the most common reasons for nonrefusal cases to become designated as difficult was inability to contact sample members at any of the telephone numbers available in the locating database. An important challenge in CATI data collection efforts was overcoming callscreening behavior. A significant number of households did not respond to telephone calls even after multiple attempts had been made and answering machine messages had been left. This challenge was exacerbated by the fact that contact information for many cases was initially limited only to phone numbers for sample members\u2019 parents and other relatives. As a result, telephone interviewers had to make contact with the parent households first to determine a current number where the sample member could be reached. For this reason, the number of calls required to contact sample members by phone was often increased, particularly when the parent households were screening calls and not responding to answering machine messages. A third factor that increased the difficulty in reaching sample members was that many were only reachable by cellular phone. Even when parents or other contacts provided cell phone numbers for sample members, many sample members were concerned about the costs of using their cell phone to complete a CATI interview. This same concern about costs also led some parents to be reluctant to provide cell phone numbers for sample members to telephone interviewing staff. All of these factors combined to increase the challenges of contacting some sample members and completing interviews by telephone, resulting in a significant number of cases being designated as difficult.\nSimilarly to circumstances for refusal cases, the call history log in CATI-CMS was an important resource for telephone interviewers in attempting to contact difficult cases. In addition to detailed notes, the call history log provided CATI staff with the distribution of call attempts across all numbers and the results of each call attempt. Interviewing staff could then use this information to determine the telephone number where contact was most likely to occur and the day and time when contact was most likely to occur. Likewise, the call history indicated numbers where productive contact had and had not been made, so that interviewers could prioritize calling across multiple telephone numbers. As calling attempts to reach difficult cases continued to\n103\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nprove unproductive, data collection managers increasingly assigned such cases to CAPI data collection.\nField staff experienced significant success with making telephone contact with difficult cases that had not been successful in CATI. At least part of this success likely resulted from attempts to contact households that had previously been screening calls from telephone interviewers. All calls from RTI\u2019s Call Center provide the same telephone number in caller ID systems. When field interviewers called these same households, a new, local number would appear in caller ID systems. The novelty of a new phone number, voice, and/or approach likely contributed to field interviewers\u2019 success in contacting difficult cases after substantial CATI data collection efforts had been unsuccessful. Consistent with the data collection plan, switching the most challenging cases from CATI to CAPI modes was often an effective strategy for contacting difficult-to-reach sample members. When telephone contacts did not initially prove successful for field interviewers, a personal visit to the sample member or his or her parents\u2019 homes was the next step. Field interviewers also used in-person contact as the first step to reach some difficult cases, especially when a high number of prior calls had proven unsuccessful and no alternative telephone numbers were available. Personal visits not only increased the likelihood of face-toface contact with sample members or their parents, but also proved effective for obtaining updated telephone numbers from parents or other contacts.\n4.3.2 Data Collection Results: Outcomes and Indices of Data Quality The following section provides select data collection and data quality results. Several\ndata collection outcomes are discussed, including: \u2022 response rates by various subgroups; \u2022 refusal and conversion rates; \u2022 distribution of respondents by month of interview; \u2022 distribution of respondents by questionnaire administration mode; \u2022 interview completions by incentive type; \u2022 telephone interviewer hours expended and call counts; \u2022 field interviewing results; \u2022 interview completion time; \u2022 analysis of field of study and occupation recoding; and \u2022 interviewer error rates.\n4.3.2.1 Outcomes: Case Response Rates by Subgroup and Data Collection Mode Response rates by subgroup and mode of administration are presented in this section. For\nthe second follow-up (but not the base year or first follow-up), the response rate is a conditional\n104\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\none, based on the cases that were fielded.54 In addition, refusal and refusal conversion rates are reported for both the sample member and the gatekeeper. Interview completions by select subgroups (such as sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) quarter, first follow-up response status, and respondents classified as ever having dropped out) are provided overall and by mode.\nOverall response rates. The ELS:2002 second follow-up sample consisted of 16,400 members overall. The sample represents a subset of the combined population of 10th-graders in the spring term of 2002 and 12th-graders in the spring term of 2004. Some members belong only to the 10th-grade population, some only to the 12th-grade population, but most belong to both. Of the total sample, approximately 15,900 (97 percent) were considered to be in-scope for the 2006 round. Cases classified as permanently out of scope (deceased, sampling errors) or temporarily out of scope (unavailable for duration of study, out of the country, incapable, incarcerated, institutionalized) were not counted in the response rate.55\nSecond follow-up response rates by select characteristics are presented in table 42. Weighted and unweighted completion rates56 are provided for demographic subgroups in addition to various student and school characteristics associated with the base-year and first follow-up rounds. Response rates for each subgroup are based on the number of eligible sample members who completed the interview. Completed cases included about 14,200 fully and partially completed web and interviewer-administered interviews. Weighted response rates were calculated using the design weight (i.e., the base weight\u2014the weight that reflects the selection probability but has not been adjusted for nonresponse and indeed is available for respondents and nonrespondents alike). The weighted response rate, therefore, represents the proportion of the combined 10th- and 12th-grade population that was in-scope for the second follow-up, was fielded, and that responded.\n54 An unconditional response rate would include cases that were not fielded in the second follow-up: double (base-year + first follow-up) nonrespondents, senior freshening sample nonrespondents, and sample members who withdrew from the study. The response rate as reported here excludes these unfielded cases, that is, it is conditional on the fielding of the case. The unconditional weighted response rate was 84.5 percent overall. The weighted conditional response rate (response rate as used in second follow-up reporting in this document) was 88.4 percent. Ineligible (permanently or temporarily out-of-scope cases) count neither in the case completion rate nor the response rate calculation though their numbers have been documented. 55 In addition, a handful of previously cooperating sample members asked to be removed from the sample. 56 Weighted response rates using the base weight are presented because of the importance of population estimation and because NCES survey response standards are based on weighted completions. On the other hand, this chapter\u2019s methodological tables show unweighted proportions, because of their different focus.\n105\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nTable 42.

BY = Base year. GED = General Educational Development credential. Response rate calculation excludes those cases that are permanently out of scope (deceased) or temporarily out of scope (incapable, or unavailable for duration of second follow-up data collection: e.g., out of the country, incarcerated or institutionalized). Total number of permanently or temporarily out-of-scope second follow-up sample members = 460. In addition, unfielded cases are not counted in the denominator of the response rate for the second follow-up. In addition to a handful of sample members who asked to be withdrawn from the study, the following in-scope sample members were not fielded in 2006: double (base-year + first follow-up) nonrespondents (n = 330) and first follow-up freshened senior nonrespondents (n = 40).\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Second Follow-up, 2006.\"\n\nOf the approximately 15,900 eligible sample members, about 14,200 completed the ELS:2002 second follow-up survey for an overall unweighted response rate of 89 percent. The overall weighted response rate was 88 percent. Eighty-six percent of males and 91 percent of females completed the interview (weighted). Response rates across racial/ethnic subgroups ranged from a weighted 86 to 91 percent, with White respondents at the high end. Response rates by SES quarter ranged from 86 to 93 percent (weighted), with highest SES quarter respondents at the high end.\n\nThe greatest variability in response rates is in the first follow-up response status. As expected, and due to difficulty in locating and contacting (as well as to their presumably higher nonresponse propensities) a large number of first follow-up nonrespondents did not participate in the second follow-up study. Of eligible first follow-up nonrespondents, 67 percent (weighted) completed the interview. However, the weighted response rate for those who had responded in the first follow-up was 90 percent.\n\nDropouts also historically have been a challenging group to survey. Maintaining the representativeness of this small, select subgroup is critical because the policy relevance of dropouts is high. Two response rates are provided for different classes of dropouts: those identified as ever having dropped out (who were offered a higher incentive) in the second follow-up and a subset of this group\u2014those who completed (or were eligible to complete) the\n\n107\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ndropout questionnaire in the first follow-up.57 Of those offered the \u201cever dropped out\u201d incentive, the weighted response rate was 85 percent. For first follow-up dropouts, the second follow-up weighted response rate was 83 percent.\nResponse rates for additional respondent types (as determined by completed questionnaire type for first follow-up respondents or assumed questionnaire type for first followup nonrespondents) and cohort type (2002 sophomore cohort or 2004 senior cohort) are also provided. Weighted response rates by the four first follow-up respondent types ranged from 82 to 91 percent, with \u201cstayers\u201d (those who, in 2004, remained at the 2002 base-year school) at the high end and \u201cmovers\u201d (those who transferred to a new school) at the low end. Weighted cohort response rates were similar: 88 percent of those belonging to the 2002 sophomore cohort and 91 percent of those belonging to the 2004 senior cohort participated in the 2006 data collection.\nBase-year school characteristics (sector, region, and locale) were also used to classify sample members. Weighted response rates by base-year school sector ranged from 88 to 92 percent, with respondents from Catholic schools at the high end. Weighted regional response rates ranged from 86 to 90 percent, with respondents from the Midwest at the high end. Weighted response rates by school locale ranged from 87 to 89 percent, with respondents from urban schools at the low end.\nRefusal and conversion rates. Sample members may refuse to participate for a variety of reasons, including being too busy, not being interested, or having a misconception of what is involved. In addition to refusals made directly by the sample member, gatekeepers\u2014such as a parent or spouse\u2014may refuse to provide access to the sample member or to share locating information. Table 43 and table 44 present unweighted58 refusal and conversion rates for the 2006 data collection. Table 43 includes both sample member and gatekeeper refusals. Table 44 includes only sample member refusals. A comparison of the refusal rates illustrates the extent to which gatekeepers affect response rates.\n57 To be classified as a dropout in the ELS:2002 first follow-up (F1), one had to be a sophomore cohort member who had been out of school at the time of the F1 data collection for at least 4 consecutive weeks not due to accident or illness, or a returnee who had been in school less than 2 weeks after a dropout episode of 4 consecutive weeks or more. The class of those with \u201cever dropped out\u201d status is broader in that it also includes students identified by school personnel as out-of-school in tracing who had returned to school by the spring term of the 2003\u201304 school year and were therefore not classified as sophomore cohort dropouts eligible for the dropout questionnaire but rather as students. An additional group included in the \u201cever dropped out\u201d category comprises students who had left school and earned a GED prior to March 15, 2004, but had not earned a high school diploma. 58 Readers are reminded that while both weighted and unweighted percentages were calculated for the completion rate tables (because of the importance of weighted data to population estimation) the methodological tables (which are concerned not with national estimates but rather with the characteristics and behavior of survey respondents) display unweighted percentages only.\n108\n\n\fChapter 4.

The ELS:2002 field period was relatively lengthy, beginning in January 2006, and ending in September 2006. The point in time at which a respondent was interviewed may affect the data collected\u2014for example, a change in enrollment status as of April might be recorded for a sample member interviewed in June, but not for a sample member interviewed in March. Figure 4 shows the distribution of respondents by month of interview.\n\n109\n\n\fChapter 4.

The ELS:2002 second follow-up survey was multimodal. Three modes of administration were used: self-administered web, and interviewer administration via CATI and CAPI.\n\nTwo caveats concerning mode analyses should be entered at the outset. First, no analysis of mode of administration effects on individual survey items was conducted. This is because the validity of such an analysis would depend on random assignment of respondents to modes, and this was not a practical methodology for the survey. Second, while to a great extent mode was \u201cself-assigned\u201d\u2014that is, sample members had the option of selecting web self-administration, or refusing it in preference to CATI or CAPI\u2014not everyone had equal opportunity to do so. For example, sample members who were initially unlocatable and had to be traced had less opportunity to complete a web interview: calendar time had elapsed, early completer incentives for web self-administration had normally expired, and typically the hard-to-locate sample members were urged to complete a telephone or in-person interview at first contact. Certain respondent types\u2014for example, first follow-up nonrespondents and dropouts\u2014were more likely to be hard to locate, and certain demographic subgroups associated with these statuses thus had less opportunity to opt for web self-administration. That said, given the magnitude of differences, there remains evidence that web self-administration was more attractive to some groups than to others.\n\nTable 45 provides the unweighted distribution of completed interviews by mode of administration. Some 47 percent of completions were achieved via self-administered web questionnaire. Some 43 percent were conducted in CATI, and 10 percent were gathered via\n\n110\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nCAPI. When combining the CATI and CAPI modes, a little more than half of the cases were interviewer-administered and a little less than half self-administered (53 percent versus 47 percent).\n\nTable 45.

Provided percentages are unweighted and based on total number of respondents within row. F1 = first follow-up. CATI = computer-assisted telephone interview; CAPI = computer-assisted personal interview. GED = General Educational Development credential.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Second Follow-up, 2006.\"\n\nAcross all subgroups, completions ranged from 25 to 57 percent for self-administered web, 34 to 58 percent for CATI, and 4 to 25 percent for CAPI. Many subgroups showed different mode of administration propensities, and several subgroups significantly differed from each other in this respect. Mode differences by sex showed that more females completed selfadministered web questionnaires than did males (51 percent versus 43 percent [z = 9.17, p < .01]).\n\nSeveral racial/ethnic subgroups had higher proportions of completions via CATI/CAPI than self-administered web, including American Indian (67 percent versus 33 percent, z = 3.71, p < .01); Black (74 percent versus 26 percent, z = 20.49, p < .01); Hispanic (67 percent versus 33 percent, z = 15.06, p < .01); and more than one race (55 percent versus 45 percent, z = 2.58, p < .01). Asian and White respondents, however, were more likely to complete the self-administered web instrument\u2014for Asians, 57 percent of completions were web self-administrations, as contrasted to 43 percent as interviewer administrations (z = 4.90, p < .01). For Whites, 55 percent were web completions, and 45 percent (z = 8.57, p < .01) CATI or CAPI.\n\n111\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nSES subgroups also differed by mode of administration. The self-administered web option was completed by 62 percent of highest SES quarter respondents\u2014as opposed to 32 percent for the lowest quarter (z = 25.68, p < .01).\nAs expected, more first follow-up nonrespondents were interviewed via CATI/CAPI than self-administered, 70 percent as opposed to 30 percent (z = 11.34, p < .01). Furthermore, 25 percent of the interviewed cases were conducted via CAPI, which is indicative of the importance of the field option for difficult cases. Similarly, respondents who were offered the \u201cever dropped out\u201d incentive also were more likely to be interviewed in CATI or CAPI (75 percent, versus 25 percent for web self-administered [z = 15.64, p < .01]).\n\n4.3.2.2 Incentive Results\nAs earlier noted, the incentive plan took into account sample member status, timing of interview completion, and degree of case difficulty. Specifically, a higher incentive was offered to sample members who qualified as ever having dropped out, first follow-up nonrespondents, early web respondents, and sample members requiring extra effort to find, reach, or gain cooperation. Sample members were offered incentive amounts ranging from $20 to $60 depending on the above criteria.\nIncentive results are presented in two ways. Table 46 provides incentive type by overall interview completions. Table 47 provides incentive/subgroup type by number of cases remaining. Four incentive types are shown: Early, Regular, Difficult, and Final Difficult. Those who completed the survey by web within the first 4 weeks of data collection received the Early incentive, where $10 was added to sample members\u2019 base amounts. Once the early completion window had closed, respondents received the Regular incentive which included base incentive amounts only. As data collection efforts continued and case difficulty increased, many sample members became eligible for the Difficult incentive, which once again added $10 to base amounts. By July, all remaining sample members became eligible for a final push, or Final Difficult incentive, which added an additional $10 or $20 depending on respondent type.59\n\nTable 46.

See section 4.3.1.2 for actual incentive amounts. 2 For \u201cever dropped out\u201d: classified as dropout if at least one of the following conditions was met: school reported that respondent had dropped out of school at any one of the enrollment status updates, respondent was a dropout as of spring term of 2004, or respondent was an alternative completer, that is, earned a GED on or before March 15, 2004.\n\nNOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

Also, unfielded cases are not counted in the second follow-up response rate, which is condition on cases being fielded. In addition to a handful of sample members who asked to be withdrawn from the study, the following in-scope sample members were not fielded in 2006: double (base year + first follow-up) nonrespondents (n=330) and first follow-up freshened senior nonrespondents (n=40).

CATI = computer-assisted telephone interview.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Second Follow-up, 2006.\"\n\nOf the completed interviews, 63 percent of the sample either completed the interview early or during the regular data collection period, while 26 percent completed the interview in the final incentive phases. Interestingly, just as many responded during the initial month of data collection as did those during the regular period from mid-February through June. Almost one third of respondents (31 percent) took advantage of the early web option in the first month of data collection. Respondents, however, were motivated at both ends of the data collection window. When combining the Early and Difficult incentive types, 58 percent of respondents received an incentive that was higher than the base amount offered.\n\nTable 47 provides additional detail across sample member subgroups, including prior response status and \u201cever dropped out\u201d status. For each subgroup at each incentive level, the number of cases remaining and the number of completed interviews is provided, with a\n\n113\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\ncalculated percent of respondents per row. The incentive strategy was implemented in a series of stages, to balance costs, timing, and methods. Both \u201cnondropouts\u201d (59 percent) and \u201cever dropped out\u201d qualifiers (61 percent) completed the interview when $50 and $60 were offered, respectively. The $10 sent to sample members in the form of prepayment may conceivably have helped to encourage participation. The smallest gain in cooperation for first follow-up nonrespondents (both nondropouts [13 percent] and ever dropped out qualifiers [8 percent]), came in the Early incentive period. Overall, the Regular and Final Difficult incentive opportunities proved productive, given the total number of cases remaining, 46 and 56 percent, respectively.\n4.3.2.3 Process Statistics: Interviewer Effort Select evaluations of processes related to interviewer effort are provided in this section.\nIn particular, telephone interviewer hours, call counts by response status, and field interviewing results are discussed.\nTelephone interviewer hours. The CATI component of data collection required focused effort by telephone interviewers and related staff. The main tasks of contacting and interviewing sample members take many hours, and exclude associated tasks such as training, monitoring, and supervising. Telephone interviewers for the ELS:2002 second follow-up required a total of 20,636 hours, with an average of 3.27 hours spent per completed interview. With an average interview completion time of 27.5 minutes for CATI cases, about 2.8 hours were spent in activities outside the actual interview. The majority of this time was dedicated to locating and contacting efforts. Interviewers were provided multiple contacts per sample member. Interviewers used multiple efforts to locate sample members. Other time was spent on case maintenance, including pulling up a case, reviewing the call history, and closing the case, which may have involved rescheduling an appropriate callback, providing a comment, or updating the case status accordingly.\nNumber of calls. The majority of interviewer time was dedicated to locating and contacting sample members. This activity requires an extensive outbound calling effort, with some respondent types requiring more calls than others. Table 48 provides call counts by present and prior response status, including counts by mode overall and for second follow-up respondents. About 294,000 calls were made to sample members in the ELS:2002 second follow-up survey. An average of 19 calls were made per case regardless of present or prior response status.\n114\n\n\fChapter 4.

Response rate calculation excludes those cases that are permanently out of scope (deceased) or temporarily out of scope (incapable, unavailable for duration of second follow-up data collection: e.g., out of the country, incarcerated or institutionalized). Total number of permanently or temporarily out-of-scope second follow-up sample members = 460. Also, unfielded cases are not counted in the second follow-up response rate, which is conditional on a case being fielded. In addition to a handful of sample members who asked to be withdrawn from the study, the following in-scope sample members were not fielded in 2006: double (base year + first follow-up) nonrespondents (n = 330) and first follow-up freshened senior nonrespondents (n = 40). F1 = first follow-up; F2 = second follow-up.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \"Second Follow-up, 2006.\"\n\nOf those who completed the 2006 interview, first follow-up respondents received an average of 15 calls and first follow-up nonrespondents received an average of 22 calls. A concentrated effort was made to survey second follow-up nonrespondents. In particular, those who had responded in the first follow-up but declined to participate in the second follow-up were called an average of 51 times. Conversely, those who did not respond in the first follow-up were called an average of 33 times per case.\n\nField interviewing. Field interviewers were able to pursue contacting efforts both by telephone and in person, and had advantages including local area calling and face-to-face interaction with sample members. With this enhanced accessibility, interviewers employing CAPI efforts are often able to secure participation when other data collection efforts are not successful.\n\nTable 49 presents response rates by field interviewing status. The majority of the sample (81 percent) was successfully interviewed without field follow-up. However, more than 1,330 cases (8 percent of the sample) were successfully interviewed only with the help of field followup. Of all cases sent to the field, 57 percent were successfully interviewed and 43 percent were not. Some outstanding cases (730) were not sent to the field owing to such factors as firm refusal or unusable contact information.\n\n115\n\n\fChapter 4.

Interview completion time is discussed overall, by questionnaire section, and by mode (web, CATI, or CAPI). Coding systems within the instrument for field of study and occupation are also discussed, including an analysis of coding accuracy. Telephone interviewer performance in question delivery and data entry is also assessed.\nInterview completion time. To calculate the time required to complete the survey, start and end time stamp variables were associated with each question. Time stamps were recorded using the respondent\u2019s or interviewer\u2019s computer clock time. As respondents or interviewers moved from screen to screen, actual on-screen times and transit times between screens were recorded and summed. Section times and total instrument times were then calculated accordingly.\nOn average, respondents took about 27 minutes to complete the ELS:2002 second followup survey. Table 50 shows average completion time overall and by section, and mode of administration.\n\nTable 50.

Data Collection Results and Methodology\nSection B (postsecondary education) had the longest average completion time (11 minutes). Section A (high school) was inapplicable for most respondents, lowering the average time to less than 2 minutes.\nSection C (employment) showed the second longest time, 7 minutes. Most respondents, in particular standard enrollees, were asked limited questions about employment due to being currently enrolled. Section D (community) was a relatively quicker section, taking about 3 minutes to complete. The last section, Section E (locating), took over 5 minutes to collect contact information for future follow-up.\nAnalysis of field of study and occupation recoding. The ELS:2002 second follow-up instrument enabled sample members and interviewers to code verbatim responses given for field of study and occupation. Currently enrolled respondents were asked for their field of study, while all respondents were asked about the job they expected to have at age 30. A subset of respondents, depending on their enrollment status and history, was asked about first job after high school and/or current job.\nBoth coding systems used an assisted-coding approach. Entered text describing the field of study or occupation interfaced with a database to provide a candidate for the best category match or provide a set of comparable matches. The assisted-coding approach\u2014as opposed to search-and-select or manual coding\u2014presents less burden on the respondent and interviewer, requiring less time to code, and streamlining the selection process. If the system could not make a match (e.g., owing to misspelling) or if a selection could not be made from the list displayed, respondents and interviewers were routed to a double or triple dropdown screen to make a selection manually.\nFor field of study, the category names provided by assisted coding were synonymous with the general and specific categories provided by the manual dropdowns. The field of study coder provided 33 general categories and 192 specific categories. The categorical framework was largely based on the most recent version of the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP-2000), which provides a taxonomy of instructional program classifications and descriptions.\nThe occupation coding system used O*NET (Occupational Information Network; http://online.onetcenter.org/). The O*NET database was developed for the U.S. Department of Labor and represents an extensive set of worker attributes and job characteristics. O*NET provides a nested coding scheme; 23 general-level categories expand to 96 midlevel categories, which expand to 821 specific-level categories.60 Specific level occupations can therefore roll up to broader categorizations. If an occupational match could not be found using assisted coding, a triple dropdown menu enabled manual selection. For job expected at age 30, however, the manual coder was bypassed altogether. This was done due to the hypothetical nature of asking about a future job that may be more difficult to assign a specific code. Any verbatim responses that were not coded during the interview were coded by expert staff after data collection.\nTo assess the reliability of coding procedures, two occupational coding specialists evaluated random samples of coded responses. Ten percent of field of study responses and 10 percent from each occupation variable were assessed for coding accuracy. Table 51 shows the\n60 Refer to appendix F for a detailed occupational crosswalk providing all O*NET classifications (general, midlevel, specific), in addition to their paired mappings to the original 16 occupational categories used in the base year and first follow-up of ELS:2002.\n117\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\n\nresults of the recode analysis, including the number of responses sampled by mode, accuracy of the original code, and the percentage of strings too vague for recoding. Assessment of coding accuracy is based on the specific level of coding, meaning responses were deemed correct or incorrect at the most specific category level for both field of study and occupation.\n\nTable 51.

Coding accuracy generally ranged from 77 to 86 percent for CATI/CAPI interviews and 66 to 75 percent for web respondents. As expected, intervieweradministered cases showed higher accuracy overall compared to self-administered cases\u201482 percent as opposed to 74 percent (z = 4.87, p < .01). Specifically, interviewers correctly coded field of study at a higher rate than web respondents\u201486 percent as opposed to 75 percent (z = 3.58, p < .01). Interviewers also coded occupation more accurately\u201481 percent as opposed to 73 percent (z = 3.81, p < .01). All interviewers were trained in using the coding systems, and became familiar with the mechanics of coding to minimize coding time during the interview. Web respondents, however, were provided with on-screen brief instructions to assist with coding. Any originally incorrect responses were recoded accordingly (18 percent of CATI/CAPI responses and 26 percent of web responses), in order to reflect accurate field of study or occupation categorizations and improve data quality.\n\nGiven the structure of O*NET, coding accuracy can be assessed at three levels of detail (general, midlevel, specific). Specific-level codes can roll up to midlevel and general-level categories. The 23 general-level categories within O*NET represent a comprehensive and manageable set of contemporary job categories. When assessing coding reliability at the general O*NET level, as one would expect, matches were greater at more general levels. Excluding the small number of cases deemed too vague for recoding purposes, occupation at the general level was coded correctly 88 percent of the time overall. Interviewer-administered cases showed higher accuracy compared to self-administered\u201490 percent as opposed to 84 percent (z = 3.38, p < .01). For both modes, this is a large gain in accuracy at the level containing 23 categories; an 8 percent increase for CATI/CAPI and a 10 percent increase for web respondents.\n\nFurther assessment of coding accuracy can be seen in the mapping of O*NET codes to ELS:2002 occupation codes. The base-year and first follow-up rounds of ELS:2002 used an occupation coding scheme consistent with predecessor studies, including NELS:88. To use the efficiency of O*NET, yet also provide consistency with previous rounds, all 821 specific-level\n\n118\n\n\fChapter 4. Data Collection Results and Methodology\nO*NET codes were mapped accordingly to the ELS:2002 occupation coding schema of 16 categories.61 Given this crosswalk, coding accuracy to the ELS:2002 schematic can also be assessed. With the exclusion of vague responses, associated ELS:2002 categories were coded correctly 85 percent of the time overall. CATI/CAPI also had the advantage compared to web, with 88 percent correct as opposed to 80 percent (z = 4.27, p < .01).\nQuestion delivery and data entry error rates. CATI interviews were regularly monitored throughout data collection, from late January through early September. Monitoring helps improve interviewing and enhances data quality. For studies with an interviewer component, ensuring both standardized interview delivery and appropriate data capture is important. Monitoring helps to meet the following objectives: identify problematic items, reduce interviewer error, improve interviewer performance by reinforcing procedures and strategies, and assess the quality of data collected.\nInterviewer performance was evaluated in two ways: (1) how interviewers administered items to the respondent and (2) how interviewers recorded responses. Specially trained monitors were able to concurrently view and listen to live CATI interviews without disturbing the interviewer or respondent. Monitoring equipment facilitated remote observation with the flexibility to tune into any interview. Monitors observed blocks of up to 20 questions per interview, and evaluations were conducted during all shifts, including day, evening, and weekend.\nDuring CATI data collection, 9,885 items were monitored. Of these, monitoring staff observed 89 total errors, yielding an overall error rates of just 0.9 percent. Three percent was defined as the boundary for the weekly error rate, above which direct intervention would be required. Question delivery incurred 71 errors (a 0.7 percent error rate; data entry incurred 18 errors [an error rate of 0.2 percent]). Question delivery errors and data entry errors are illustrated in figures 5 and 6, respectively. Typically, weekly error rates fell below 2.3 percent. Most fell below 1 percent; many weeks showed no errors at all. The peaks in error rate are attributable to the addition of new interviewer staff, who are more prone to errors due to inexperience. Monitoring efforts were the most intensive early on in data collection, particularly after the first major CATI interviewer training, from late February through late March. By early August, monitoring efforts were reduced given the lighter caseload and consistently low error rates.\n61 Refer to appendix F for a detailed occupational crosswalk providing all O*NET classifications (general, midlevel, specific), in addition to their paired mappings to the original 16 occupational categories used in the base year and first follow-up of ELS:2002.\n119\n\n\fChapter 4.

The discussion in this chapter includes data obtained from questionnaires, academic records (transcripts and course catalogues), and all other sources.\n5.1.1 Overview of Systems Design, Development, and Testing Most systems were developed in the base year, then redesigned if necessary during the\nfirst follow-up field test with concern for the processes needed for the first follow-up main study. The effort was to test systems in a smaller environment to reveal points in which improvements could be implemented on a larger scale. After the field test, improvements were implemented and checked in a test environment.\nThe following systems were developed in the base year and refined and tested in the first follow-up field test:\n\u2022 a recruiting system; \u2022 a Survey Control System (SCS); \u2022 a Survey Day materials generation program; \u2022 a questionnaire receipt application; \u2022 a web-based Integrated Management System; \u2022 production reports; \u2022 Teleform (application used for scanning questionnaires); \u2022 a mail return application; \u2022 an incentive tracking application; \u2022 a field reporting system to help field supervisors track the status of in-school data\ncollection and field interviewing; \u2022 a Structured Query Language (SQL) server database to store scanned data responses; \u2022 a scanned image database; and \u2022 a student computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) instrument. A full development process, including design, programming, testing, and implementation, was used in the creation of these systems. Specifications were developed in word processing documents and flowchart applications, and progress was tracked using Microsoft Project and Microsoft Excel. Specifications for questionnaires were designed in word processing documents\n123\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nand were updated to reflect what changed between the field test questionnaires and the full-scale questionnaires.\nBetween the field test and full-scale studies, systems and procedures were evaluated and the following functionality was added to the full-scale operations:\n\u2022 a field assignment system; \u2022 a field materials generation system; \u2022 mail generation invoked by requests in CATI; \u2022 a computer-assisted data entry program for the field screener; \u2022 Teleform versions of out-of-school hardcopy questionnaires (i.e., transfer, dropout,\nearly graduate);\n\u2022 quality control steps implemented during scanning, rather than later during data delivery processes;\n\u2022 data cleaning and editing programs; \u2022 a scanned image archive server that allowed instant access to scanned questionnaires\nduring the data cleaning and review process;\n\u2022 a cleaning and editing application that allowed editors to review and correct questionnaire data as appropriate, working in conjunction with actual scanned images in cases in which inconsistent data occurred;\n\u2022 a data review system that allowed reviewers to randomly review questionnaires with data to detect data deficiencies (e.g., scanning problems); and\n\u2022 an occupation coding application.\n5.1.2 Base-Year and First Follow-up Data Receipt\nThe data preparation facility received all materials returned to RTI after a school\u2019s survey was complete or school officials sent in completed questionnaires. Procedures were established to systematically receive and record all required forms; this process included the scanning of barcoded labels. Receipt events were available for the full-scale study to identify questionnaires that were not completed fully or accurately and to allow project staff to follow up promptly. Different versions of questionnaires (e.g., student, transfer, early graduate, etc.) were easily distinguishable within the receipt process and were automatically batched separately based on the questionnaire type.\nAfter questionnaires were received and added to the receipt system, a batch number was assigned to the questionnaire. To assist the project team in cases that required referring to a questionnaire, the system was able to access dynamically the status of an individual questionnaire and provide its batch number. If the questionnaire had moved beyond the scanning stage, the scanned image could be accessed as well. Questionnaires were occasionally identified for data removal (e.g., when parental consent was lacking). Rather than deal with the removal process manually, a spreadsheet was developed to document these cases, and case removal was integrated into the data delivery process. This approach was useful because it did not disrupt the\n124\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nquestionnaire processes and provided the ability to add cases back to final data files when appropriate (e.g., when parental permission was obtained).\n5.1.3 Occupation Coding for Hardcopy Instruments\nIn the base year, occupation was coded from text in the parent and student questionnaires. In the first follow-up, occupation was coded from the student questionnaire and new participant supplement. Occupation text was loaded into a coding application in which a coding specialist could select the correct code from the 16 occupation categories. The resulting codes were merged back into the data files.\n5.1.4 Base-Year and First Follow-up Data Capture for Scanned Instruments\nAfter questionnaires were received and batched, they were ready for Teleform scanning. A Teleform questionnaire contained text fields that could be recognized by scanning machines and interpreted forms text to data through optical character recognition. Verifiers reviewed data that were not interpreted accurately by the scanning machines or were not consistent with expected ranges. Once verification was complete, the data were converted to an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) file, and the questionnaire image was written to the server. This process provided immediate access to raw questionnaire data and a repository of images accessible by ELS:2002 staff.\nTeleform development began with the field test Teleform document and specifications in Microsoft Word that indicated changes made between the field test and the full-scale study. Modifications were easily made, and variable names were updated appropriately. Any new Teleform documents were first developed in Microsoft Word as a specification. As changes in the Teleform document were required, the corresponding Microsoft Word document was updated using the \u201cTrack Changes\u201d tool. Reviewers would compare the specifications to the printed version of the Teleform document to ensure that all questionnaires were the latest version. When a Teleform document was confirmed as final, internal testing of the scanning and data-writing processes occurred. About 10 forms were printed and filled out for testing purposes. The test forms were scanned so that the resulting data could be compared to the original questionnaire; this comparison would detect problems with the printed questionnaire, the scanning program, or the SQL server database.\n5.1.5 Base-Year and First Follow-up Cleaning and Editing for Hardcopy Questionnaire Data\nAn application was developed in which case/item-specific issues were reviewed and new values were recorded for subsequent data cleaning and editing. Records were selected for review based on one of the following criteria: random selection, suspicious values during frequency reviews, values out of expected ranges, and values not adhering to a particular skip pattern. The review application provided the case/item-level information, reasons for review, and a link to the scanned image of the questionnaire. Reviewers determined scanning corrections, recommended changes (if respondents had misinterpreted the question), and reviewed items randomly to spot potential problems that would require more widespread review.\nThe application was built on an SQL server database that contained all records for review and stored the recommended data changes. Editing programs built in SAS read the SQL server database to obtain the edits and applied the edits to the questionnaire data. Questionnaire data\n125\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nwere stored at multiple stages across cleaning and editing programs, so comparison across each stage of data cleaning could be easily confirmed with the documentation on recommended edits. Raw data were never directly updated, so changes were always stored cumulatively and applied each time a cleaned dataset was produced. This process provided the ability to document all changes and easily fix errors or reverse decisions upon further review.\nEditing programs also contained procedures that output inconsistent items across logical patterns within the questionnaire. For example, instructions to skip items could be based on previously answered questions; however, the respondent may not have followed the proper pattern based on the previous answers. These items were reviewed, and rules were written to either correct previously answered (or unanswered) questions to match the dependent items or blank out subsequent items to stay consistent with previously answered items.\n5.1.6 Base-Year and First Follow-up Data Capture and Editing for CATI\nIn the base year, a CATI version of the parent questionnaire was employed. In the first follow-up, for the out-of-school data collection effort, the following CATI instruments were developed to administer to sample members: student (developed from the Teleform abbreviated version), transfer, not currently in school (dropout), early graduate, and homeschool. A screener at the beginning of the CATI survey was responsible for determining which questionnaire module a respondent was to be administered.\nCATI logic was designed such that the Teleform and CATI records could be concatenated into one data file. CATI instruments were developed with logic based on the skip patterns in the questionnaires. Questions were automatically skipped during administration. The questionnaire development program (Blaise) stored data for each item answered, but respondents were allowed to go back to previously answered items. In rare cases, a previously answered item could be changed in such a way that the questionnaire logic was inconsistent with data already answered from a different logical path. Blaise automatically corrected the previously administered responses so that the skip logic was consistent.\n5.1.7 Base-Year and First Follow-up Data Processing and File Preparation\nAll Teleform questionnaire scans were stored in an SQL server database. CATI data were exported nightly to ASCII files. Cleaning programs were designed to concatenate CATI and Teleform SQL server data into SAS datasets, adjusting and cleaning variables when formats were not consistent. Special attention was focused on this concatenation to verify that results stayed consistent and to rule out possible format problems.\nOnce questionnaire data were concatenated and cleaned across modes and versions, the following cleaning and editing steps were implemented:\n\u2022 anomalous data cleaning based on review of data with original questionnaire image (e.g., scanning errors);\n\u2022 rule-based cleaning (changes that were made based on patterns in data, rather than review of images);\n\u2022 hard-coded edits based on changes recommended by a reviewer if respondents misunderstood the questionnaire (e.g., respondent was instructed to enter a\n126\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\npercentage, but there was strong evidence that the respondent entered a count instead); and\n\u2022 edits based on logical patterns in questionnaire (e.g., skip pattern relationships between gate and dependent questions).\nAll respondent records in the final dataset were verified with the SCS to spot inconsistencies. For example, it was possible that data were collected for a respondent who later was set to an ineligible status. It would not be appropriate to include those data, and the SCS served as a safeguard to ensure data integrity. Furthermore, the data files served as a check against the SCS to ensure that all respondent information was included in production reports.\nItem documentation procedures were developed to capture variable and value labels for each item. Item wording for each question was also provided as part of the documentation. This information was loaded into a documentation database that could export final data file layouts and format statements used to produce formatted frequencies for review. The documentation database also had tools to produce final electronic codebook input files.\n5.2 First Follow-up Transcript and Course Offerings Procedures\nThis section summarizes procedures associated with the processing of high school academic transcripts and course catalogs. For detailed information on archival records collection and processing based on student transcripts and high school course catalogs, see Bozick et al. (2006), which is available only with the restricted-use transcript files. The Institute of Education Sciences/National Center for Education Statistics will only accept restricted-use data license applications through its electronic application system (see http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/instruct.asp). More information about applying for restricted-use data licenses is available at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/instruct.asp and in the \u201cRestricted-Use Data Procedures Manual\u201d at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman/toc.asp.\nA concise introduction to the transcript data is provided by Planty, Bozick, and Ingels (2006).\n5.2.1 First Follow-up Transcript Procedures\n5.2.1.1 Receipt Control\nIncoming data collection forms, transcripts, and course catalogs were logged into the survey control system by staff in RTI\u2019s data preparation unit. Data editors reviewed each school\u2019s packet of materials for completeness and legibility. Data editors first recorded whether the Transcript Cover Sheet and Student Transcript Checklist were completed and returned by the school. The Transcript Cover Sheet was examined to determine if any of the requested items were unavailable, and this information was recorded in the survey control system. Data entry clerks keyed the data from Transcript Cover Sheet and Student Transcript Checklist forms in the survey control system. Assigned institutional contactors (ICs) called schools to follow up regarding any missing materials. Missing materials were retrieved by telephone or mail. The results of each school contact were recorded in the survey control system.\nAt the student level, individual transcript receipts were recorded in the survey control system by data preparation staff. Once the items were recorded, data editors reviewed them for legibility and completeness. Packets with edit problems were routed to a supervisor for\n127\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nresolution. Electronic reports were produced and monitored to identify missing or unclear information at the school and student levels. ICs followed up to obtain missing documents and to clarify information on the student transcripts. Items that were both legible and complete were routed to keying and coding.\n5.2.1.2 Course Catalog and Transcript Entry Course catalog and transcript data were entered using a web-based, computer-assisted\ndata entry system. This system consisted of sequential data entry screens grouped by type of information requested (school-, student-, or course-level data). Identifying information such as identification number, school name, and student names were preloaded into the data entry system. Quality checks such as valid ranges, data types (e.g., numeric or character), and field sizes were specified for each data element; keyer-coders were required to reenter data failing these checks. Keyer-coders were responsible for keying school-, student-, and course-level data and for coding course data. A quality control team verified all keyed data. A supervisor and a team of experienced keyer-coders were on site at all times to manage the effort and provide guidance when needed.\n5.2.1.3 Course Catalog Entry Course catalogs from ELS:2002 base-year schools were keyed and coded for the\npreparation of course offerings data. Only course offering information for base-year schools appears on the course-level file. While catalogues were collected for up to four academic years, whenever possible a school\u2019s 2003\u201304 course catalog was used. Each school was assigned to a single keyer-coder for course catalog entry. Information entered included the following:\n\u2022 School-level information: \u2212 catalog type and year; \u2212 term system; \u2212 grading system; \u2212 credits equal to one Carnegie unit (schools were asked how many credits a student would earn for taking a course that meets every day, one period a day, all schoolyear long); and \u2212 credits required for each type of diploma.\n\u2022 Course-level information: \u2212 course name, school-assigned course number, course department name; \u2212 state/district-assigned course number; \u2212 credits offered; \u2212 program type; \u2212 term(s) course offered; \u2212 restricted enrollment, if applicable;\n128\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\n\u2212 grade level(s) to which course is offered; and \u2212 Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) code (see section 5.2.1.4). The data entry system included a mechanism for setting the status of each school catalog, such as \u201cassigned for keying/coding\u201d and \u201cquality control needed.\u201d System-generated reports based on these statuses were used by project staff to monitor progress and to review/edit when necessary.\nAll transcripts received from any one school were assigned to a single keyer-coder for both student- and course-level data entry. Keyer-coders thoroughly reviewed transcripts and all related materials (e.g., Student Transcript Checklist, Transcript Cover Sheet, and course catalogs) before abstracting data. The Student Transcript Checklist was helpful in providing school-reported student-level data, such as participation in special programs. The following information was entered:\n\u2022 Student-level information: \u2212 Participation in specialized programs. \u2212 Date sample member left school\u2014the graduation or final withdrawal date was entered. Keyer-coders also entered the date the student rejoined the school, if applicable.\n\u2212 Reason sample member left school (e.g., graduated or transferred). \u2212 Type of diploma or equivalency certification received (e.g., standard, honors, or\nGeneral Educational Development).\n\u2212 Cumulative grade point average (GPA), weighted and unweighted\u2014the GPA was entered as reported by the school. When a transcript provided a GPA but did not specify whether it was weighted or unweighted, it was entered as unweighted.\n\u2212 Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ACT, Advanced Placement (AP), and/or SAT subject test scores and date taken\u2014the data entry system allowed for multiple test score entries per test type.\n\u2022 Coursetaking histories: \u2212 Course name and school-assigned course number\u2014course titles were keyed verbatim, except for the use of approved abbreviations and the conversion of Roman numerals to Arabic. When available, school-assigned course numbers were entered as separate data elements.\n\u2212 School year in which the course was taken. \u2212 Grade level (grade in which the sample member was enrolled at the time the\ncourse was taken).\n\u2212 School where the course was taken. \u2212 Term when the course was taken. \u2212 Credits received (number of credits awarded for the course as reported on the\ntranscript).\n129\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\n\u2212 Raw grade (grade received for the course as reported on the transcript).\n\u2212 Grade received\u2014a standardized letter grade was entered, converted from the raw grade based on the school\u2019s grading scale.\n\u2212 CSSC code (see section 5.2.1.4).\nSchool transcripts provided coursetaking histories at the year or term level. Year-long courses might be reported with a distinct listing (and separate grade) for each term in that school year. For example, a year-long algebra course might appear on a transcript twice, once for fall semester and once for spring semester. When the transcript reported a final (year-end) grade, the course was entered as a year-long course, along with the grade received. When no final (yearend) grade was reported, the course was entered as two semester-long courses, each with the corresponding grade received.\n5.2.1.4 Course Catalog and Transcript Course Coding\nThe CSSC, updated from the 2000 National Assessment of Education Progress high school transcript study, was used for coding all ELS:2002 catalog and transcript courses. The CSSC is designed to describe course offerings in secondary education and to provide a coherent means for classifying these courses. Each CSSC code comprises six digits, with an associated course title, alternate titles, and a course description. The first two digits identify the main program area (e.g., mathematics), the second set of two digits represents a subcategory of courses within the main program area (e.g., pure mathematics), and the last two digits are associated with the specific courses in each of the main and subcategories (e.g., trigonometry).\nFor ELS:2002 base-year schools that provided them, courses listed in course catalogs were keyed and assigned the appropriate CSSC code before transcript keying and coding. This order of procedures enhanced the quality and consistency of the coding process. Then, transcript courses could be accurately coded by simply matching their titles with the titles of courses in the course catalogs. Otherwise, each course on the transcripts would have to be matched one by one to a CSSC code based only on the course title and the CSSC course title, with none of the information describing the course content usually included in the school\u2019s course catalog.\nFor each catalog course entered, keyer-coders selected an appropriate course code from the CSSC look-up table in the data entry system. The look-up table included CSSC course codes, titles, and descriptions. Keyer-coders could search course codes by course title, description, keywords, or a combination of these. Using the look-up table in the system reduced hardcopy look-up time. The CSSC code was selected after reviewing the course description and any relevant school-level information from the course catalog. The data entry system checked the validity of each selected CSSC code before accepting it. To further increase coding efficiency, RTI developed a subset of frequently used CSSC codes. This list was also available as a look-up table in the data entry system and was expanded and maintained throughout the coding process. Because of changes in the curriculum, a handful of \u201cnew\u201d courses were identified and assigned new CSSC codes.\nAll transcripts received from a school were assigned to a single person for keying and coding. Each sample member\u2019s courses were coded individually. For ELS:2002 base-year schools that provided transcripts and a course catalog, transcript coding took place after that school\u2019s catalog had been coded and keyed. Coding consistency and speed were increased\n130\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nbecause the data entry system allowed keyer-coders to select CSSC codes for transcript courses by matching them with corresponding catalog courses. When prompted for a transcript course code, keyer-coders were supplied with a list of all courses keyed from the school\u2019s catalog. Keyer-coders could browse the entire list, or search by course name or course number. Upon selecting a matching catalog course, the keyer-coders could assign the catalog course\u2019s code to the transcript course. If the keyer-coders could not find an acceptable match, a CSSC code was selected from the master CSSC list. If no CSSC code was deemed appropriate, the keyer-coders marked the course as uncodeable (600000).\nCourse catalogs from non-base-year schools were not keyed. These schools\u2019 transcript courses were coded using the school-provided course catalog as a resource to provide a course description, an overview of the school curriculum, and other valuable information. The keyercoder used the look-up table to select the appropriate CSSC code, and the data entry system checked the validity of each CSSC code before accepting it.\nOf the 1,557 schools that provided transcripts, only 24 (2 percent) did not provide a catalog. When possible, a substitute catalog was identified from the pool of sampled schools that provided one to use as a resource for coding. Substitute catalogs were selected from schools in the same district (or state, if necessary) and on the basis of size and type (public or private; and school affiliation, where applicable). Keyer-coders then used the substitute catalog as a resource for coding transcript courses. In rare cases where no suitable substitute catalog was available, transcript courses were coded according to course title, grade level, course level, and track indicators.\nData entry of each catalog and transcript was reviewed for accuracy by a supervisor or by a group of keyer-coders trained to perform these reviews. Any inconsistencies between the source document and corresponding data entered were corrected. The data entry system recorded the corrected errors and calculated error rates for each keyer-coder. Those with high error rates were identified and retrained as necessary.\nQuality control of course entry and coding involved several components. First, preliminary work performed by each newly trained keyer-coder was reviewed. After a hands-on examination of source documents and selected codes, a coding supervisor met with each keyercoder individually to provide feedback and to make corrections. Individual guidance continued, if necessary, until the keyer-coder reached an acceptable level of independence and coding mastery.\nCourse coding was reviewed by expert coders in several key areas: coding of AP courses, coding of special education courses, coding consistency within schools, and accurate coding based on track and sequence indicators. When the expert coder disagreed with a code assigned by a keyer-coder, the code was changed in the data entry system. In addition, all catalog and transcript courses marked as uncodeable were reviewed. CSSC codes were applied where possible, including the use of recommended new codes. Unusual course abbreviations (a more common problem with transcripts than catalogs) were investigated, deciphered, and coded wherever possible. A small percentage of nondescript courses such as \u201cMini-course\u201d or \u201cTransfer Elective\u201d were left as uncodeable (600000), despite all efforts to determine an appropriate code. Of the total transcript courses, 1 percent were uncodeable. Lastly, keyers and coders inspected all student-level records to ensure that there was no duplicated information in the data file resulting from multiple transcripts.\n131\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\n5.2.1.5 Machine Edit\nProcedures for editing, coding, error resolution, and documentation were modeled after the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 second follow-up transcript component (Ingels et al. 1995). Data entry systems included valid ranges and codes, including legitimate missing codes, and CSSC code checks. Sequences of machine edits and visual data inspections were performed. Tasks included supplying missing data, detecting and correcting illegal codes, and investigating and resolving inconsistencies or anomalies in the data. Variable frequencies and cross-tabulations were reviewed to verify the correctness of machine editing.\nAfter all improperly entered data were corrected, the transcript data passed through a second step in the editing program that supplied the appropriate reserve codes to fill blank fields. The reserve codes are as follows: -4: Nonrespondent, and -9: Missing.\nTranscripts were received and systematically entered in the survey control system. They were then tracked as they continued through coding procedures. Once all transcript keying and coding was completed, the following cleaning and editing steps were implemented:\n\u2022 cleaning anomalous data based on review of data with original transcripts (e.g., keying errors);\n\u2022 removing duplicate course data erroneously provided by schools on the transcripts or duplicated across school transcripts;\n\u2022 converting course credits to Carnegie units based on a school conversion factor; \u2022 supplementing transcript information captured in the survey control system when\ninformation was missing on transcripts; and\n\u2022 applying appropriate reserve codes where information was not available. Next, the following records were examined individually because they indicate potentially anomalous and/or unlikely academic situations:\n\u2022 all courses in schools where at least one student earned more than 35 Carnegie units; \u2022 all courses in schools where at least one student earned less than 20 Carnegie units; \u2022 courses associated with students who earned more than two Carnegie units for a\nsingle course;\n\u2022 courses associated with students who earned more than typical Carnegie units in a course and/or subject area (e.g., more than four Carnegie units in math);\n\u2022 courses associated with students where patterns of grade and academic year were inconsistent (e.g., grade-level changes within year or year changes within grade level; grade levels spanning 2 academic years);\n\u2022 courses associated with students who had completed high school on time, had complete transcript information, and yet had a GPA of 0.00;\n\u2022 courses that have passing grades (greater than F) and yet have zero credit; and \u2022 courses taken during terms after the transcript indicates that the student had left high\nschool.\n132\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nAll of these records were examined and corrected when errors were detected. Additionally, all course records with \u201cAdvanced Placement,\u201d \u201cAP,\u201d \u201cInternational Baccalaureate,\u201d or \u201cIB\u201d in the title or courses with AP/IB CSSC codes were examined to ensure that they were adequately identified and coded.\nOnce these quality control measures were implemented, student-level variables (e.g., graduation status, credits earned in a subject area) were merged onto the existing student file. The student\u2019s course information was used to create a new student course file. This file contains multiple records for each student and can be linked back to the student file.\nThe same cleaning and editing procedure applied to the course catalogs. A school course offerings file was produced for the base-year schools only and provides course information that can be linked to the student course file.\nTranscript information was added to the first follow-up restricted-use electronic codebook (ECB) by\n\u2022 merging student-level transcript information to the student file in a transcript composite section;\n\u2022 appending new transfer schools to the school file to be linked with student-level and student-course-level transcript information; and\n\u2022 creating new files for student-course-level data and course offerings data.\nItem documentation was created for the transcript variables and files. The first follow-up ECB was extended and includes the following files:\n\u2022 HSTRNSTU.PRI: Course-level file;\n\u2022 BYF1TSTU.PRI: Student-level file;\n\u2022 BYF1TSCH.PRI: School-level file; and\n\u2022 HSTRNSCH.PRI: Course-offering file.\n5.3 Second Follow-up Data Cleaning, Coding, and Editing\nA database was developed in which case/item-specific issues were reviewed and new values were recorded for subsequent data cleaning and editing. Records were selected for review based on one of the following criteria: suspicious values during frequency reviews, values out of expected ranges, interviewer remarks, and values not adhering to a particular skip pattern.\nIn the second follow-up, coding was not part of the post-data collection activities, but took place in the interview itself through self- or interviewer coding (from verbatims) of field of study and occupation, using an automated assisted coding approach. An assessment of coding quality has been provided in chapter 4. The coding scheme used in the second follow-up was taken from O*NET. This scheme is documented in appendix F of this document, and includes a crosswalk to other occupational classification schemes used in ELS:2002.\nEditing programs contained procedures that output inconsistent items across logical patterns within the interview. The interview was developed as a web-based instrument available to field interviewers, telephone interviewers, and as a web-based self administered questionnaire (SAQ) for the respondent. The instrument administers a questionnaire based on skip logic. Items\n133\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Preparation and Processing\nthat are dependent on other items are only administered when the skip logic so indicates. The instrument allows the interviewer or SAQ respondent to back up in order to correct responses; however, the instrument leaves data for items that no longer apply. A SAS programmer uses the instrument specifications and programming code to step through the programs and determine where logical patterns and consistencies should be edited, and enters edit statements into a SAS program. Final edited data were passed through the original program to confirm that no item inconsistencies exist.\nItems that were related based on data consistencies, but for which a consistency check was not built into the instrument programming, were checked with SAS programs in a postprocessing step. Crosstabulations were developed to review logical consistencies across items. Values for items that are input to the crosstabulation were collapsed into similar values to make the crosstabulation more \u201creadable.\u201d The crosstabulations were reviewed as a quality control check to determine if there were programmatic errors in cleaning or editing steps. To confirm that data editing and cleaning programs were applying changes appropriately, the following steps were implemented:\n\u2022 Ran comparisons between raw data and cleaned data and reviewed the results to ensure that they were as expected.\n\u2022 Reviewed crosstabulations while following the instrument and source code from the final instruments.\n\u2022 Reviewed frequencies to confirm that values followed an expected pattern. \u2022 Ran frequencies by respondent type. \u2022 Ran SAS editing programs with a temporary step that flags values to be blanked out\nand allows for review prior to editing. This step helped prevent programming error. \u2022 Reviewed items with a high nonresponse rate to catch reserve codes that were\ninconsistently set.\n5.4 Second Follow-up File Preparation and Item Documentation\nItem documentation procedures were developed to capture variable and value labels for each item. Item wording for each question was also provided as part of the documentation. This information was loaded into a documentation database that could export final data file layouts and format statements used to produce formatted frequencies for review. The documentation database also had tools to produce final ECB/input files.\nMaintaining data security is a requirement that pervades all tasks, including, of course, data processing. Data security procedures in the data processing and preparation phase of the second follow-up are discussed in conjunction with the related topic of confidentiality protections associated with treatment of the analytic data (see chapter 6, section 6.6).\n134\n\n\fChapter 6\nWeighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.1 Overview of Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nImplicitly building on the sample design discussion in chapter 3, chapter 6 describes Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) weighting, imputation, and design effects for the base-year and first and second follow-up. A brief description of these three topics is provided for the base year and first follow-up; more detailed information is available from the base-year data file user\u2019s manual (NCES 2004-405) and base-year to first follow-up data file documentation (NCES 2006-344). A fuller discussion is provided for the second follow-up round (2006) of the study.\nThe general purpose of the ELS:2002 weighting scheme was to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the fact that not all individuals selected into the sample actually participated. Chapter 6 sketches the school and individual sample member weights developed for the base year through second follow-up, and documents the statistical properties of the weights. Imputation attempts to address the issue of item nonresponse by providing a procedure that uses available information and some assumptions to derive substitute values for the missing values in a data file. The chapter provides further information on the key items that were subject to imputation, the imputation procedures, and the results of imputation. The design effect is a measure of sample efficiency. More specifically, the design effect is the ratio of the true variance of a statistic (taking the complex sample design into account) to the variance of the statistics for a simple random sample with the same number of cases. The chapter reports overall design effects. Since no single design effect is universally applicable to any given survey or analysis, it also reports design effects for different subgroups and statistics.\n6.2 Base-Year and First Follow-up Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.2.1 Calculation of Base-Year and First Follow-up Weights; Results of Weighting\n6.2.1.1 Analysis Populations The sample design for ELS:2002 supports a number of analyses, which in turn permit\naccurate inferences to be made to three major groups or target populations: (1) Population A: spring 2002 high school sophomores; (2) Population B: spring 2004 high school seniors; and (3) Population C: spring 2002 10th-grade schools.\nFigure 7 illustrates that whereas some students are in only population A or population B, many students are in both populations\u2014that is, both a spring 2002 sophomore and a spring 2004 12th-grade student. Figure 8 further illustrates the overlap between the two populations.\n135\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects Figure 7.

Weights for cross-sectional analyses were created in the base year. BYSTUWT can be used for\n\n136\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\ncross-cohort comparisons of students capable of completing the questionnaire (on a cross-cohort time-lag basis employing the sophomore classes of 1980 and 1990). Students who were (by virtue of disability or language barrier) unable to complete a questionnaire were nevertheless retained in the ELS:2002 sample (and contextual data and transcripts were gathered). BYEXPWT generalizes to the entire population, including both students capable and incapable of completing the questionnaire.\nThe weight F1PNLWT was created for all persons who completed a questionnaire or a sufficient portion of a questionnaire, both in the base year and the first follow-up. Also, baseyear data were imputed when not available from the new participant supplement (NPS) for first follow-up respondents, and these cases also have F1PNLWT. The panel weight can be used for both intracohort (across rounds of ELS:2002) and cross-cohort (longitudinal comparative analysis) purposes. An example of using a panel weight for intracohort analysis is to take a cohort of sophomores, look at their enrollment 2 years later, and determine what proportion have dropped out. An example of using a panel weight for cross-cohort analysis is to compute math gains between sophomore and senior years using the ELS:2002 panel weight and also for the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) panel weight and then compare the gain between sophomore and senior year for the two cohorts. Missing test data were imputed, so a version of the panel weight adjusted for test nonresponse was unnecessary. The weight F1XPNLWT was created for the expanded sample of students capable and not capable of completing the questionnaire.\nBase-year nonrespondents who responded in the first follow-up are considered to be part of this population, but there is no base-year weight (BYSTUWT or BYEXPWT) for them. The NPS ensured that the standard classification variables collected in the base year were also available for this group. Key variables were imputed for base-year nonrespondents who were first follow-up respondents, so that these students could be analyzed as part of the sophomore panel using F1PNLWT and/or F1XPNLWT. BYSTUWT and BYEXPWT were not recomputed.\nTranscripts provide continuous data covering grades 9 through 12 for students who remained in school and were in the modal grade sequence (or a lesser range of data for students who dropped out or fell behind the modal progression). A cross-sectional 2004 transcript weight (F1TRSCWT) was produced, encompassing cases that met the following conditions for sample members for whom a transcript has been obtained: a member of the 10th- or 12th-grade cohort who was a student questionnaire completer in the base year, first follow-up, or both; or a member of the questionnaire-incapable62 expanded sample. This weight generalizes to the analysis population of spring 2002 sophomores by subsetting the sample through the use of a flag (G10COHRT), or 2004 seniors by invoking the senior cohort flag (G12COHRT63).\n6.2.2.2 Population B: Spring 2004 12th-Grade Students\nThis population can also be employed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Weights for cross-sectional (including cross-cohort) analyses (F1QWT) were created for students capable of completing the questionnaire. This weight should be used in conjunction with a flag\n62 Questionnaire-incapable sample members were unable, owing to severe disability or language barrier, to validly be assessed or complete a student questionnaire. Nevertheless, they were not excluded from the sample. Transcripts and contextual data were collected for this group. 63 The G12COHRT flag was updated as part of second follow-up data process activities to determine spring 2004 senior cohort membership for first follow-up nonparticipants based on responses in the 2006 data collection or transcript information.\n137\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n(G12COHRT) that identifies the sample member as part of the senior cohort.64 F1EXPWT generalizes to the entire population, including students capable and incapable of completing the questionnaire.\nNote that generalizations about the mathematics achievement of the 2004 senior class involve imputation for the transfer students and other seniors who were not tested.\nThe cross-sectional transcript weight described also generalizes to the analysis population of spring 2004 12th-graders by subsetting the sample through the use of a flag (G12COHRT), or to the 2003\u201304 graduating class through the high school exit status variable, F1RTROUT.\n6.2.3 Population C: Uses of School-level Data; School-level Weights\nThe ELS:2002 dataset supports school-level analysis using its sample of spring 2002 10th-grade schools. Weights for cross-sectional analyses were created in the base year. BYSCHWT can be used for spring 2002 10th-grade schools. In addition to the school-level data released in the base year, a restricted-use course offerings file was issued in 2006, based on course catalogues collected in the first follow-up high school transcript component.\nAlthough it is not possible to produce a cross-sectional 2004 school weight because the first follow-up school sample is not nationally representative of American high schools in 2004, the base-year school weight can be used for longitudinal analyses treating the base-year schools as a 2002\u201304 panel. Although there are two data points for analysis, the weight is generalizable only to schools in 2002.\nThe first follow-up school data can also be analyzed using the student weight, when school data are employed as contextual information attached to the student record. That is, the school-level data (administrator questionnaire, library/media center questionnaire, facilities checklist, course offerings, school geocodes, and external data linkages) can be analyzed in relation to the sophomore or senior cohorts with the student as the primary unit of analysis. To facilitate such analyses, school-level data were replicated at the student level in the data files.\n6.2.4 Base-Year and First Follow-up Weights and Their Properties\nThree sets of weights were computed in the base year:\n1. A school weight.\n2. A weight for student questionnaire completion.\n3. A contextual data weight for the \u201cexpanded\u201d sample of both questionnaire-incapable and questionnaire-capable students (reflecting the fact that some sample members were deemed incapable of completing survey instruments owing to disability or language barriers).\nFive sets of weights were computed in the first follow-up:\n1. A cross-sectional weight for the expanded sample that includes sample members who completed all or a sufficient portion of the questionnaire in the first follow-up, baseyear students who were still incapable of completing the questionnaire 2 years later,\n64 Note that there is a special case of the senior cohort as well: the subset of senior cohort members who in fact graduated in 2004, as contrasted to the small number of their peers who failed to graduate in their 2004 senior year.\n138\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nbase-year students who were newly incapable of completing the questionnaire, and freshened students who were incapable of completing the questionnaire (F1EXPWT). 2. A cross-sectional first follow-up weight for sample members who completed all or a sufficient portion of the questionnaire in the first follow-up (F1QWT). 3. A first follow-up panel weight (longitudinal weight) for the expanded sample that includes students who fully or partially completed a questionnaire in both the base year and first follow-up, students who fully or partially completed a questionnaire in the first follow-up and had base-year data imputed if not on the NPS, and students who were questionnaire incapable in the base year and/or the first follow-up (F1XPNLWT). 4. A first follow-up panel weight for sample members who fully or partially completed a questionnaire in both the base year and first follow-up or who fully or partially completed a questionnaire in the first follow-up and had base-year data imputed if not on the NPS (F1PNLWT). 5. A first follow-up weight for sample members who fully or partially participated in the transcript component was also generated (F1TRSCWT). Additionally, there are two flags that can be used in analyses to identify members of the sophomore and senior cohorts: 1. a flag indicating a member of the sophomore cohort, that is, spring 2002 10th-grader (G10COHRT); and 2. a flag indicating a member of the senior cohort, that is, spring 2004 12th-grader (G12COHRT). Finally, for the transcript component, a variable indicates final student status (i.e., mode of high school exit): \u2022 A status variable that indicates whether a student is a fall 2003\u2013summer 2004 graduate, dropout, etc. (F1RTROUT). Table 52 through 56 show the statistical properties of the base-year and first follow-up weights.\n139\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nTable 52.

Eighteen variables were selected for imputation. Four were unique to the first followup, and 14 were key demographic and family background variables that were chosen for imputation in the base year and first follow-up. These key variables were imputed when not provided by respondents in the base-year questionnaire or the first follow-up new participant supplement for first follow-up respondents. In the first follow-up, missing key variables were imputed for sample members who were one of the following: base-year nonrespondents, 12thgrade spring-term freshened sample members, or base-year questionnaire-incapable students (who were part of the base-year expanded sample only). Additionally, the 10th-grade student ability estimates for mathematics and reading were imputed for the base-year nonrespondents who became first follow-up respondents since they were included in the spring 2002 sophomore cohort. These ability estimates had been imputed, if missing, in the base year for base-year respondents.\nTwo first follow-up variables were imputed, as applicable, when the data were missing. Student enrollment status as of spring 2004 was imputed for the first follow-up respondents if enrollment status was not provided by the sample school. The first follow-up mathematics ability estimate was imputed, if missing, for first follow-up respondents who were considered in-school students: students at the base-year school or at another (transfer) school as of spring 2004. (Sample members who dropped out, finished high school early, or were being homeschooled as of spring 2004 were not defined as in-school students, so no ability estimates were determined\n\n142\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nfor them.) Only students still at the base-year schools were tested\u2014ability estimates were imputed for all transfer student respondents.\n\n6.2.6 Base-Year and First Follow-up Standard Errors and Design Effects\nThe variance estimation procedure had to take into account the ELS:2002 complex sample design, including stratification and clustering. One common procedure for estimating variances of survey statistics is the Taylor series linearization procedure. This procedure takes the first-order Taylor series approximation of the nonlinear statistic and then substitutes the linear representation into the appropriate variance formula based on the sample design. For stratified multistage surveys, the Taylor series procedure requires analysis strata and analysis primary sampling units (PSUs) (in ELS:2002, schools are the PSUs). Therefore, analysis strata and analysis PSUs were created in the base year and used again in the first follow-up. The impact of the departures of the ELS:2002 complex sample design from a simple random sample design on the precision of sample estimates can be measured by the design effect, as reported in this document and the prior manuals. Taylor series estimation was used for the base year and first follow-up. ELS:2002 base-year and first follow-up data are available as public- or restricted-use electronic codebook (ECB) systems. The data are also available in a Data Analysis System (DAS). For the DAS, balanced repeated replication (BRR) replicate weights are used.\nFigure 9 shows ELS:2002 design effects in historical perspective, that is, displayed in comparison to design effects in NELS:88 and High School and Beyond (HS&B). These have been calculated on the full sample (i.e., for NELS:88 and ELS:2002, all cohorts combined).\n\nFigure 9.\n\nFull sample mean design effects and root design effects, by longitudinal study: Selected years, 1982\u20132004\n\nValue\n\n4.0 3.6\n3.5\n3.0\n\n3.7 Design effects\nRoot design effects\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.8\n\n1.5\n\n2.3 1.9\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0 HS&B first follow-up sophomore cohort\n\nNELS:88 second follow-up\nStudy\n\nELS:2002 first follow-up\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, High School and Beyond (HS&B), \u201cFirst Follow-up, 1980\u201d; National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), \u201cSecond Follow-up, 1992\u201d; and Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cFirst Follow-up, 2004.\u201d\n\n143\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nThe design effects indicate that the ELS:2002 panel sample (sophomore cohort) was more efficient than the NELS:88 first and second follow-up (F1F2) panel sample (sophomore cohort). For means and proportions based on first follow-up questionnaire data for all respondents, the average design effect in ELS:2002 was 2.23; the comparable figure was 3.73 for the NELS:88 sophomore cohort. Figure 10 shows the mean design effects and root design effects for the NELS:88 second follow-up and the ELS:2002 first follow-up sophomore cohort. The difference in design effects is also apparent for some subgroup estimates. Ingels et al. (1994a) present design effects for 16 subgroups defined similarly to those used in the ELS:2002 analysis (Ingels et al. 2005b, table 25). For all 16 subgroups, the ELS:2002 design effects are smaller on average than those for the NELS:88 sophomore cohort.\nFigure 10.

For means and proportions based on first follow-up questionnaire data for dropouts, the average design effect in ELS:2002 was 1.31 for both the full and panel samples; the comparable figures were 2.9 and 2.8 for the NELS:88 second follow-up full and F1F2 panel samples, respectively.\n\nThe smaller design effects in ELS:2002 compared with those for NELS:88 and HS&B are probably due to the higher rates of subsampling in the latter two studies. Additionally, disproportional strata representation was introduced in the NELS:88 first follow-up, when students dispersing between 8th and 10th grade were severely subsampled. See Ingels et al. (1994b) for more details. In HS&B, the sophomore cohort members who were no longer in the base-year school were subsampled. See Spencer, Sebring, and Campbell (1987) for more details. The general tendency in longitudinal studies is for design effects to lessen over time, as\n\n144\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\ndispersion reduces the original clustering. Subsampling increases design effects because it introduces additional variability into the weights with an attendant loss in sample efficiency.\nThe smaller design effects in ELS:2002 compared with those for the HS&B sophomore cohort also may reflect the somewhat smaller student cluster size used in the later survey in the base year. Although the clusters were reduced somewhat in the first follow-up for both studies, a number of students remained in the base-year school. The HS&B base-year sample design called for 36 sophomores selected from each school. The ELS:2002 sample design called for about 26 sophomores selected from each school.\n6.2.7 First Follow-up Transcript Component Design Effects\nWithin the transcript component, standard errors and design effects were computed for the entire sample and for the following subgroups:\n\u2022 sex (male and female);\n\u2022 race/ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, More than one race, and White and all other races);65\n\u2022 school sector (public, Catholic, and other private);\n\u2022 socioeconomic status (SES) (lowest quarter, middle two quarters, and highest quarter); and\n\u2022 school urbanicity (urban, suburban, and rural).\nAdditionally, standard errors and design effects were computed for spring 2004 graduates with complete transcript information and for the above subgroups. Table 58 summarizes the average transcript mean design effects (DEFFs) and root design effects (DEFTs) for the full sample for all respondents and each subgroup. Table 59 summarizes the average transcript DEFFs and DEFTs for the spring 2004 graduates with complete transcript information for all respondents and each subgroup. Appendix G contains tables of transcript design effects for specific variables for different subpopulations.66 The standard errors and design effects were calculated using the transcript weight (F1TRSCWT). Each table includes the survey item (or composite variable), variable name and value for categorical variables, percent estimate, design standard error, simple random sample standard error, sample size (N), DEFF, and DEFT. Note that the mean DEFTs reported in this table were not calculated directly from the mean DEFF but, rather, were the average of the DEFTs over the items shown in each table in appendix G. Therefore, readers cannot derive the DEFT using the DEFF reported in table 58 and table 59. See section 3.5.2 of Ingels et al. (2005b) for more details about design effects.\n65 \u201cWhite and all other races\u201d is predominantly White, with a very small number of individuals from other race categories. All race categories exclude individuals of Hispanic or Latino origin. 66 It is important to compare design effects across cohorts (e.g., ELS:2002 versus NELS:88), so table 3.3-1 from the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Transcript Component Data File User\u2019s Manual (Ingels et al. 1995) was initially used to help guide the selection of variables. However, the ELS:2002 variables chosen differ somewhat from those used in constructing design effects for NELS:88 because there were considerable differences in the types and composition of variables produced in each study. Nonetheless, the variables presented are a good representation of the breadth of information obtained from the transcripts. These items should provide a range of design effects that will give a reasonable average for both the entire sample and for analytically important subgroups.\n145\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nThe BY-F1 DFD (Ingels et al. 2005b) shows in its table 25 the design effects for the first follow-up full sample. With the exception of respondents who reported more than one race, the design effects are higher in the transcript study than in the first follow-up. For example, of the 30 variables used to compute design effects, the mean is 4.56 for all transcript respondents and 2.26 for all first follow-up respondents.\n\nTable 58.

The degree of clustering is determined by the cluster size and the intraclass correlation. The cluster size is the number of respondents from each school. The intraclass correlation is the correlation between the data points for any two students selected from a given school. The variability of the transcript weights can be measured by computing the unequal weighting effect (UWE). The overall UWE is slightly smaller for the transcript study than for the first follow-up (1.47 compared with 1.49), so the variability of the weights is probably not much of a cause for the difference in the design effects between the transcript study and the first follow-up.\nMany of the large transcript design effects are for the variables indicating Carnegie units (CUs) earned in certain subject areas. For example, the variable \u201cTotal CUs in social studies\u201d frequently has one of the highest design effects, because these units are nearly identical for all\n\n147\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nstudents in many schools. The largest design effect is \u201cTotal CUs in general labor market preparation\u201d for Catholic school students, because such students typically have zero CUs in this subject area.\nFigure 11 shows the DEFFs and DEFTs for both the ELS:2002 and NELS:88 high school transcript studies. The design effects indicate that the ELS:2002 high school transcript sample was more efficient than the NELS:88 high school transcript sample. The average design effect in ELS:2002 was 4.57; the comparable figure was 6.75 for NELS:88.67\n\nFigure 11.

As a first step, all ELS:2002 data files (school and student) were reviewed to identify high-risk variables. As a second step, a technique called data swapping was carried out, both for school- and student-level data. The first follow-up swapping was conducted independently from the base-year swapping. As a final step, the ELS:2002 data underwent a disclosure risk analysis. In this analysis, school characteristics information available on the data files was compared with information on publicly available universe files of schools.\n\n67 The difference in design effects is also apparent for some subgroup estimates. In NELS:88, design effects were produced for 18 subgroups, 16 of which are defined similarly to those in ELS:2002. For 15 of the 16 subgroups, the ELS:2002 design effects are smaller on average than those for NELS:88. These smaller design effects in ELS:2002 compared with those for NELS:88 are probably due to the magnitude of subsampling in the first follow-up (1990) of NELS:88. High school transcript component design effects from NELS:88 can be found in Ingels et al. (1995).\n148\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.2.9 Base-Year and First Follow-up Nonresponse Bias Analyses\nThe overall weighted school response rate was 68 percent in the base year. A follow-up survey of nonresponding schools was used to collect basic school characteristics needed to support comparisons with the participating schools. Some 93 percent of the nonparticipating schools responded to the nonresponse follow-up survey. Some sample frame data were also available for both responding and nonresponding schools. Results of the analysis showed only a small potential for bias. The identified variables were used to inform nonresponse adjustments for the base-year schools and students. Bias due to nonresponse was estimated both prior to computing weights and after computing weights. For details see Ingels et al. (2004).\nThe overall weighted student response rate was 87 percent in the base year (2002). Overall response was 89 percent (including all groups, e.g., students, transfer students, dropouts) in the first follow-up (2004). Student unit nonresponse bias analyses were performed in both the base year and first follow-up. An item nonresponse bias analysis was also performed for all questionnaire variables in which response fell below 85 percent. Details of the bias analyses are given in Ingels et al. (2004, 2005b). See also appendix H of this document.\n6.3 Calculation of Second Follow-up Weights and Results of Weighting\nA variety of topics are discussed in the following subsections. Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 provide a high-level overview of the ELS:2002 target populations and potential domains of analysis for those populations and describe the analysis weights created for the second follow-up. Section 6.3.2 also lists the names of the analysis weights created for the second follow-up and lists the names of the flags used to restrict analyses to the target populations of the ELS:2002 study.\nThe model-based approached for weight adjustment is discussed in section 6.3.3.68 The list of variables used in the nonresponse models is also provided in section 6.3.3. The Chisquared automatic interaction detection analysis (CHAID) used to identify interaction terms included in the nonresponse models is described in section 6.3.3.\nDetails of the weight adjustment factors used to create the second follow-up analysis weights are given in sections 6.3.4, 6.3.5, and 6.3.6. A discussion of the BRR weights produced for the second follow-up DAS occurs in section 6.3.7 and a brief discussion of quality control methods used to produce the second follow-up weights may be found in section 6.3.8. BRR weights are also included with the ECB.\n6.3.1 Target Populations and Analysis Domains\nThe sample design for ELS:2002 was developed so that relevant samples, suitably weighted, would be representative of three target populations: spring-term 2002 10th-grade students, spring-term 2004 12th-grade students, and spring-term 2002 10th-grade schools.\n68 Propensity modeling approaches were used in nonresponse adjustment for the NELS:88 school, and ELS:2002 school and student weights. For the NELS:88 student weights, and school and student weights in HS&B and NLS:72, a weighting cell approach was used. A comparison of the two approaches is included in appendix H of this volume. The comparison shows that the two methods generate very similar results, and so are unlikely to be a source of noncomparability between ELS:2002 and the prior studies.\n149\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nWithin these three target populations are a variety of important analysis domains. These analysis domains are subsets of the three target populations and, while these subsets are themselves populations, the ELS:2002 sample design does not guarantee that the ELS:2002 sample will be representative of all subsets of the three primary target populations. The following lists give examples of analytic domains as subsets of the three target populations.\nPopulation A: Spring-term 2002 10th-grade students: \u2022 Domains69\n\u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students capable of completing the student questionnaire; \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students in base-year school in spring 2004; \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students in a different school in spring 2004 (transfers); \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students who were dropouts in spring 2004; \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students who graduated or achieved equivalency early\n(i.e., on or before March 15, 2004); \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students who graduated by August 31, 2004; \u2212 Spring 2002 10th-grade students who were homeschooled in spring 2004;70 \u2212 Spring 2002 White 10th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2002 Black 10th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2002 Hispanic 10th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2002 Asian 10th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2002 public school 10th-grade students; and \u2212 Spring 2002 private school 10th-grade students. Population B: Spring-term 2004 12th-grade students: \u2022 Domains \u2212 Spring 2004 12th-grade students capable of completing the student questionnaire; \u2212 Spring 2004 12th-grade students regardless of final spring 2004 graduation status; \u2212 Spring 2004 12th-grade students who graduated by August 31, 2004; \u2212 Spring 2004 White 12th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2004 Black 12th-grade students;\n69 The domains listed are important domains but are not the only possible domains. 70 Although conceptually spring 2002 sophomores who were homeschooled in 2004 may be thought of as an analysis population, they were not designed to be so and were therefore not subject to minimum sample size requirements. The group is of limited analytic utility owing both to the low sample size and to the narrowness of the population definition. The compelling practical reason for distinguishing this group was so that they could be administered only those items consonant with their unique situation as out-of-school students.\n150\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\u2212 Spring 2004 Hispanic 12th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2004 Asian 12th-grade students; \u2212 Spring 2004 public school 12th-grade students; and \u2212 Spring 2004 private school 12th-grade students. Population C: Spring 2002 10th-grade schools: \u2022 Domains \u2212 School type: public, Catholic, and other private; \u2212 Urbanicity: urban, suburban, and rural;71 and \u2212 Region: Northeast, Midwest, South, West. ELS:2002 student sample members were interviewed as part of second follow-up activities. Sample members who completed a certain prespecified proportion of the second follow-up questionnaire were considered to be second follow-up respondents. ELS:2002 second follow-up respondents may be in either population A (10th-grade cohort), or population B (12thgrade cohort), or in both. In order to identify those respondents belonging to a particular target population, two flag variables are provided. The flag G10COHRT denotes membership in the spring 2002 10th-grade population and the flag G12COHRT72 denotes membership in the spring 2004 12th-grade population. Figure 12 shows the distribution of ELS:2002 second follow-up respondents with respect to the two student target populations. Analytic uses of these three populations, and the weighting required to support the analyses, are discussed in section 6.3.2.\n6.3.2 Overview of Second Follow-up Analysis Weights The analysis weights for the ELS:2002 second follow-up were created in order to allow\nfor analysis of the spring 2002 10th-grade population and the spring 2004 12th-grade population. Since the ELS:2002 study is longitudinal, analyses of these two populations may focus on characteristics of these populations at one point in time or may focus on how characteristics of these populations vary over time. Second follow-up cross-sectional weights were created to allow for analysis of these two populations in 2006 and panel weights were created to allow for analysis of these two populations over multiple rounds of the ELS:2002 study.\n71 NCES has recently changed its locale code system. The new codes draw on a four-part classification: city, suburban, town, and rural. Cities and suburbs are further divided into small, mid-size, and large, and towns and rural areas can be related (via measures of proximity) to urbanized areas (urban fringe, distant, remote). While the tripartite classification was used in ELS:2002 sampling, any analyst who wants to employ the new locale codes with the ELS:2002 base-year and transfer schools can use the ELS:2002 links to the Common Core of Data (CCD) and Private School Survey (PSS) databases to do so. 72 G12COHRT includes members of the senior cohort determined in the first follow-up (G12COHRT = 1) as well as those whose membership status was determined in the second follow-up (G12COHRT = 2).\n151\n\n\fChapter 6.

While second follow-up student weights were created, no second follow-up school weights were created. Discussion of school weights in the context of the ELS:2002 second follow-up may be found in section 6.3.2.3.\n\n73 In the base year and first follow-up of ELS:2002, sample members are considered part of the expanded analysis sample if they complete at least a certain proportion of the round-appropriate questionnaire or if they are \u201cquestionnaire-incapable\u201d for that round (though eligible for contextual data and transcripts). (Again, questionnaire-incapable students were those who could not be validly assessed or surveyed owing to severe disability or language barrier.) Sample members are considered respondents in the second follow-up if they complete at least a certain proportion of the second follow-up questionnaire.\n\n152\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.3.2.1 Cross-sectional Weights\nTwo cross-sectional weights were constructed for the ELS:2002 second follow-up study. The first cross-sectional weight, F2QWT, was constructed so that the population of spring 2002 10th-grade students and the population of spring 2004 12th-grade students could be analyzed using respondent data collected in the ELS:2002 second follow-up. The second cross-sectional weight, F2QTSCWT, encompasses cases that meet the following conditions: (a) member of the 10th- or 12th-grade cohort who had a first follow-up transcript, and (b) a second follow-up respondent. This transcript weight allows for analysis of both target student populations using those second follow-up respondents who had transcript data collected in the first follow-up.\nAs noted in section 6.3.1, second follow-up respondents may be in the population of spring 2002 10th-graders, may be in the population of spring 2004 12th-graders, or may be in both populations. Analyses designed to assess characteristics of one of the populations must take care to restrict analyses to those second follow-up respondents in the population of interest. In order to identify those second follow-up respondents who are members of the two student populations, two flag variables, G10COHRT and G12COHRT, are provided in the restricted-use file. Those second follow-up respondents with a value of 1 for G10COHRT are members of the population of spring 2002 10th-graders. Those second follow-up respondents with a value of 1 (determined in the first follow-up or a value of 2 determined in the second follow-up) for G12COHRT are members of the population of spring-term 2004 12th-graders.\nThe two cross-sectional weights may be used to analyze both student populations as long as the two cohort flag variables, G10COHRT and G12COHRT, are used to select those second follow-up respondents who belong to the student population of interest. Note that if these flag variables are not used in analysis, then the set of all second follow-up respondents represents the union of the population of spring 2002 10th-graders with the population of spring 2004 12thgraders. The union of these two populations includes individuals who were in the 10th grade in spring term 2002, who were in the 12th grade in spring term 2004, or who were both in the 10th grade in spring term 2002 and in the 12th grade in spring term 2004. Such individuals may be in one or both of the target student populations.\n6.3.2.2 Panel Weights\nTwo panel weights were constructed for the ELS:2002 second follow-up study. The purpose of creating these panel weights was to facilitate analyses designed to examine how the two student populations change over time. The panel weights can be used for both intracohort (across rounds of ELS:2002) and cross-cohort (longitudinal comparative analysis) purposes. An example of using a panel weight for intracohort analysis is to take a cohort of sophomores in 2002 and determine what proportion had enrolled in a postsecondary institution by 2006. An example of using a panel weight for cross-cohort comparison would be to model the transition from high school to postsecondary outcomes, comparing the four senior cohorts\u2014NLS:72 (1972), HS&B (1980), NELS:88 (1992), and ELS:2002 (2004)\u20142 years after high school graduation.\n153\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nThe panel weight, F2BYWT, was produced for all ELS:2002 sample members who responded74 in the base year and in the second follow-up, or who responded in the second followup and had key base-year data that were collected in the first follow-up. The set of sample members who responded in the base year and second follow-up is only representative of the population of spring 2002 10th-grade students; only sample members who are members of the 10th-grade cohort will have a nonmissing value for this panel weight. It is not necessary75 to use the flag variable G10COHRT in conjunction with this panel weight since, by construction, only second follow-up respondents who are members of the spring 2002 10th-grade population will have a nonzero value for the panel weight.\nThe panel weight, F2F1WT, was produced for all sample members who responded in the first and second follow-ups. This panel weight will generalize to the population of spring 2002 10th-grade students and will generalize to the population of spring 2004 12th-grade students when used in conjunction with the two flag variables G10COHRT and G12COHRT, respectively.\nAs noted in the ELS:2002 base-year to first follow-up data file documentation, base-year nonrespondents who responded in the first follow-up are considered to be members of the spring 2002 10th-grade population, but there is no base-year weight (BYSTUWT or BYEXPWT) for them. The new participant supplement employed in the first follow-up ensured that the standard classification variables collected in the base year were also available for this group. However, key variables were imputed for base-year nonrespondents who were first follow-up respondents,76 so that these students could be analyzed as part of the sophomore panel using F1PNLWT and/or F1XPNLWT. These students who are second follow-up respondents may also be analyzed as part of the sophomore panel using F2F1WT and F2BYWT.\n6.3.2.3 School Weights and the Second Follow-up\nThe second follow-up to the ELS:2002 study surveyed base-year and first follow-up sample members but did not attempt to survey the ELS:2002 base-year schools. Since most of the ELS:2002 sample members were out of high school in 2006, the utility of information collected from base-year sampled schools as part of the second follow-up would have been extremely limited.\nAlthough it is not possible to produce a cross-sectional 2006 school weight because the second follow-up school sample is not nationally representative of American high schools in 2006, the base-year school weight can be used for longitudinal analyses treating the base-year schools as a panel. Although there are multiple data points for analysis, the weight maintains the generalizibility only to schools in 2002.\n74 Sample members who did not respond in the base year but did respond in the first follow-up were given a new participant supplement questionnaire in order to gather some of the same information that was collected on base-year respondents. Consequently, these base-year nonrespondents who responded in the first follow-up were treated as base-year respondents in the construction of first follow-up panel weights. These sample members were treated as base-year respondents in the construction of second follow-up panel weights. 75 It is possible that statistical software not designed for the analysis of sample survey data may fail to exclude records that have analysis weights of zero. The G10COHRT flag may be used to specifically restrict analyses to members of the 10th-grade cohort in order to avoid such a situation from arising. 76 However, sample members who met the dual conditions of being (1) base-year nonrespondents and (2) questionnaire-incapable in the first follow-up were given a cross-sectional weight in the first follow-up but were not given a panel weight, nor, owing to lack of information, were base-year data imputed for them.\n154\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.3.2.4 Second Follow-up Weights and Prior-Round Weights In both the base year and first follow-up of the ELS:2002 study, some sample members\nwere not able to complete the sample member questionnaires because of limited English proficiency or because of physical or mental limitations. However, information could be collected from individuals, such as school administrators, parents, and teachers associated with these sample members. In a given prior round, the set of respondents in that round combined with the set of sample members who were questionnaire-incapable was referred to as the expanded sample for that round. Expanded sample weights that encompass both the questionnaire-capable and questionnaire-incapable sample were included only in restricted-use files.\nUnlike the prior rounds, any prior-round questionnaire-incapable sample member who was unable to complete the second follow-up questionnaire was considered out of scope for the second follow-up. Since all second follow-up questionnaire-incapable sample members were considered to be out of scope, no second follow-up expanded sample weights were constructed.\nThere are several flags that can be used in analyses to identify members of the sophomore and senior cohorts:\n\u2022 a flag indicating a member of the sophomore cohort, that is, spring 2002 sophomore (G10COHRT); and\n\u2022 a flag indicating a member of the senior cohort, that is, spring 2004 senior (G12COHRT).\nTable 60 summarizes the ELS:2002 analysis weights and the associated universe flags, populations (described in section 6.3.1), and respondents.\n155\n\n\fChapter 6.

These weight adjustments were designed to account for three issues:\n\u2022 Some ELS:2002 sample members were not fielded for the second follow-up.\n\n156\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\u2022 Some of the ELS:2002 sample members fielded for the second follow-up did not respond.\n\u2022 Application of weight adjustments to account for the first two issues resulted in weight sums for key analysis domains that differed from prior-round weight sums.\nTwo simple ratio adjustments were applied to the second follow-up base weight in order to account for the first issue and details of this adjustment are given in section 6.3.4.\nThe most significant and complex weight adjustments are related to the second and third issues. The weight adjustments associated with the second issue are known as nonresponse adjustments. Two types of nonresponse occurring during second follow-up data collection were considered: nonresponse arising from the inability to locate or contact a sample member and nonresponse arising from sample member refusal to participate once contacted. After examining the nonresponse cases occurring because of refusal and the nonrespondent cases occurring because of inability to locate or contact, a determination was made to treat all nonrespondents as one group.\nThe weight adjustments associated with the third issue are known as poststratification or calibration77 adjustments. As the ELS:2002 second follow-up sample weights are not adjusted to sum to population totals, the adjustments associated with the third issue are referred to as calibration adjustments.\nIn addition to the nonresponse and calibration adjustments described above, the second follow-up transcript weight included two nonresponse adjustments followed by a subsequent calibration adjustment; the first adjustment accounted for nonresponse arising from the student\u2019s school refusing to provide a transcript, the second adjustment accounted for nonresponse resulting from student refusal to allow the transcript information to be included with the ELS:2002 data, and the third adjustment calibrated weight sums to prior-round totals.\nWhile there are several methods78 that may be used to adjust sampling weights to account for nonresponse and to calibrate weight sums, the method used to create the ELS:2002 second follow-up analysis weights followed a model-based approach, which is given below. Specific details of the nonresponse and calibration adjustments applied to produce the second follow-up analysis weights may be found in sections 6.3.5 and 6.3.6.\n6.3.3.1 Generalized Exponential Model\nAll nonresponse and calibration adjustments were calculated using RTI\u2019s generalized exponential modeling procedure (GEM) (Folsom and Singh 2000), which is similar to logistic modeling with bounds for adjustment factors.\nThe GEM approach is a general version of weighting adjustments and was based on a generalization of Deville and S\u00e4rndal\u2019s logit model (Deville and S\u00e4rndal 1992). GEM is not a competing method to weighting classes or logistic regression; rather, it is a method of creating\n77 Poststratification typically refers to the process of adjusting sample weights so that the weights sum to population totals derived from sources external to the sample of interest. Calibration is used to denote adjusting weight sums to sum to prior-round totals. 78 For example, at the school and student level in HS&B, and at the student level only in NELS:88, a weighting cell approach to nonresponse adjustment was used. For a comparison of propensity model versus weighting cell approaches, see the paper by Siegel, Copello, and Chromy that appears as appendix H of this report.\n157\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nweight adjustments that provides a wide variety of features and options that may be employed. It is a formalization of weighting procedures such as nonresponse adjustment, poststratification, and weight trimming.\nFor nonresponse adjustments, GEM controls at the margins as opposed to controlling at the cell level, as weighting class adjustments. This approach allows more variables to be considered. GEM is designed so that the sum of the unadjusted weights for all eligible units equals the sum of the adjusted weights for respondents.\nExtreme weights occur in the ELS:2002 data due to small probabilities of sample selection or due to weight adjustments. These extreme weights (either very small or very large) can significantly increase the variance of estimates. One way to account for this and decrease the variance is to trim and smooth extreme weights within prespecified domains. Note that trimming weights has the potential to increase bias. However, the increase in bias is often offset by the decrease in variance due to weight trimming. As a result, this reduces the mean square error of an estimate, defined as variance plus bias squared.\nThe innovation introduced in GEM is the ability to incorporate specific lower and upper bounds. An important application of this feature is to identify at each adjustment step an initial set of cases with extreme weights and to use specific bounds to exercise control over the final adjusted weights. Thus, there is built-in control for extreme weights in GEM.\nGEM uses the median +/\u2013 X * IQR to identify extreme weights, where X is any number, typically between 2 and 3, and IQR is the interquartile range. There are also different points in the weight adjustment process during which weight trimming can occur. GEM has options to make adjustments for extreme weights as part of the nonresponse and as part of the poststratification. GEM adjusted for ELS:2002 second follow-up extreme weights during both nonresponse adjustment and during calibration. For GEM, a variable or set of variables is identified to be used to identify extreme weights within each level of the variable(s), and the variables race and school type were chosen. Prior to running GEM, the unweighted and weighted percentage of extreme weights was examined for four levels of race crossed with three levels of school type using various values to multiply by the IQR (2.0, 2.1, 2.2,\u20264.0), and multiples of the IQR were selected for each trimming process.\n6.3.3.2 Predictor Variables for Nonresponse Models\nIn order to create weight adjustments that account for nonresponse, predictor variables must be incorporated into the modeling process. As the modeling process uses both respondents and nonrespondents, the information included in the nonresponse models must be known for both respondents and nonrespondents.\nThe second follow-up respondents include individuals who were base-year nonrespondents and include individuals who were first follow-up nonrespondents. Consequently, most information collected as part of the base-year and first follow-up surveys could not be used in the nonresponse adjustments. The variables used in the nonresponse models primarily consisted of sampling frame information, base-year sample school information, and some demographic characteristics. Table 61 lists all information that was used in at least one of the nonresponse models created for the second follow-up.\nAll school-level information was included in every nonresponse model and was only removed, where necessary, from those models in order to ensure model convergence. Because\n158\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nthe student-level information was not available for all second follow-up sample members, some information was used in some models but not in others. Details of the student-level information used in the various nonresponse models may be found in sections 6.3.5 and 6.3.6.\n\n6.3.3.3 CHAID for Nonresponse Models\nFor those nonresponse adjustments that included interactions of the items listed in table 61, CHAID was performed on the predictor variables in order to detect important interactions for the logistic models used to produce nonresponse weight adjustment factors. The CHAID analysis divided the data into segments that differed with respect to the response variable (fielded, did not refuse, or respondent, depending on the model). The segmentation process first divided the sample into groups based on categories of the most significant predictor of response. It then split each of these groups into smaller subgroups based on other predictor variables. It also merged categories of a variable that were found to be insignificant. The splitting and merging process continued until no more statistically significant predictors were found or until some other stopping rule was met. The interactions from the final CHAID segments were then defined.\nThe interaction segments and all main effects were subjected to variable screening in the GEM logistic procedure. The initial model for a given adjustment step included all of the variables listed in table 61 that were available for respondents and nonrespondents and, where interaction terms were used, included the segments identified via CHAID. The most insignificant variables were deleted sequentially until the deletion of additional variables did not appreciably improve the UWE. Different bounds on the weight adjustments, depending on whether the weights were classified as extreme, were used to accomplish nonresponse adjustment, truncation, and smoothing in one step.\n\nTable 61.

As described in the ELS:2002 base-year to first followup data file documentation, a school nonresponse adjustment (denoted WTADJ1) was applied to F1DWT for those first follow-up sample members who were part of the spring-term 12th-grade freshened sample in order to account for those schools that did not respond to the freshening process used in the first follow-up. The value of WTADJ1 was equal to 1 for those ELS:2002 sample members who were not part of the freshened sample of students added in the first followup. This same adjustment was applied to F1DWT and the resulting adjusted weight, denoted F2DWT, was taken as the second follow-up design weight. All second follow-up analysis weights were produced by applying a series of nonresponse and calibration adjustments to F2DWT.\nAs noted in section 6.3.3, some ELS:2002 sample members were not fielded as part of second follow-up data collection. These sample members included some first follow-up nonrespondents. Instead of assuming that these sample members would have retained their first follow-up status if they had been interviewed in the second follow-up, two ratio adjustments were created and applied to F2DWT in order to account for the likelihood that some of the first follow-up nonrespondents would have become out of scope for the second follow-up and to account for the likelihood that some out-of-scope cases would have become in scope for the second follow-up.\nSince the number of ELS:2002 sample members not fielded for the second follow-up is small (less than 400) the resulting scope adjustments were very close to 1. The average ratio adjustment (denoted WTADJ2) for the first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up was 1.0004. The average ratio adjustment (denoted WTADJ3) for the first follow-up out-of-scope cases not fielded for the second follow-up was 1.0006. The second follow-up adjusted, interim weight, F2IWT, calculated as:\nF2IWT = F1DWT*WTADJ1*WTADJ2*WTADJ3\nwas used to produce each of the four second follow-up analysis weights. Subsequent adjustments to F2IWT varied by second follow-up analysis weight. The nonresponse and calibration adjustments applied to F2IWT to produce the second follow-up cross-sectional weights are described in section 6.3.5. The nonresponse and calibration adjustments applied to F2IWT to produce the second follow-up panel weights are described in section 6.3.6. Figure 13 summarizes the weight adjustments applied to the first follow-up design weight in order to produce the four second follow-up analysis weights.\n6.3.5 Details of Weight Adjustments for Cross-sectional Weights\nTwo cross-sectional analysis weights were produced for the ELS:2002 second follow-up. The first cross-sectional weight was calculated for all sample members who fully or partially completed a second follow-up questionnaire. The second cross-sectional weight was calculated for all sample members who fully or partially completed a second follow-up questionnaire and for whom a transcript was collected as part of the first follow-up transcript study.

Unlike prior rounds, prior-round questionnaire-incapable sample members who did not respond in the second follow-up were considered to be out of scope.\nWith a few exceptions, first follow-up eligible sample students remained eligible for the second follow-up sample. Students who died were out of scope for the second follow-up. Students who left the country, were unavailable for the duration of the study (e.g., in military boot camp), or were institutionalized were temporarily out of scope for the second follow-up, although they may be eligible in future rounds.\n\n161\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nAs noted in section 6.3.3, two nonresponse adjustments were created in order to account for nonresponse arising via two mechanisms:\n\u2022 nonresponse arising from not fielding some first follow-up nonrespondents; and\n\u2022 nonresponse resulting from fielded sample members not responding (either because they could not be contacted, could not be located, or refused to participate).\nAlso as noted in section 6.3.3, nonresponse resulting from the inability to locate/contact fielded sample members and nonresponse resulting from direct sample member refusal were treated as one nonresponse mechanism. The rationale for treating the reasons for nonresponse as one mechanism was based on the distribution of nonresponse cases. A review of the nonresponse cases indicated that the main reason for nonresponse was direct sample member refusal. A determination was made that the number of nonresponse cases associated with inability to locate or contact was not sufficient to warrant a separate nonresponse adjustment.\nWeight adjustment for not-fielded cases. Some of the base-year nonrespondents were subsampled for inclusion in the first follow-up study; some of those base-year nonrespondents were nonrespondents or out of scope in the first follow-up. These sample members were not fielded in the second follow-up. Since the information available for the first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up was limited, only a subset of the studentlevel information listed in table 61 was able to be used to create this nonresponse adjustment. In addition to all school-level variables listed in table 61, only student race/ethnicity and student sex were known for the first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up.\nA total of 23 variables were used as main effects in the GEM process. Additionally, as the number of first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up was small, interactions of the main effects were not included in this first modeling process. The nonresponse adjustment factor resulting from this process is denoted WTADJ4.\nThe GEM process used to calculate nonresponse adjustments included a trimming process and the final weight adjustment factor is calculated in such a fashion as to produce trimmed and smoothed weights. The values of the weight F2IWT were examined and extreme weights (3.8 percent unweighted and 13.6 percent weighted) were identified. The extreme weights were flagged and used to help produce the final nonresponse adjustment factor, WTADJ4.\nTable I-1 (appendix I) lists the final predictor variables used in the student nonresponse adjustment model that accounts for those first follow-up nonresponding sample members not fielded for the second follow-up. This table also lists the number of respondents, the weighted response rate, and the average weight adjustment by each level of each predictor variable included in the final nonresponse model.

In addition to all schoollevel variables listed in table 61, all student-level variables except Enrollment Status were known for second follow-up respondents and second follow-up nonrespondents.\nA total of 32 variables were used as main effects in the GEM process.

The ELS:2002 sample members included in the weight calibration include second follow-up respondents and second follow-up out-of-scope sample members. In prior rounds, questionnaire-incapable members were considered respondents in the weight calibration, but in the second follow-up, questionnaireincapable sample members were considered to be out of scope. Since these questionnaireincapable members were included in the second follow-up calibration, the control totals used in the calibration process were derived from prior-round weight totals that include the questionnaire-incapable sample members. For the second follow-up cross-sectional weight F2QWT, control totals were calculated using the first follow-up expanded sample cross-sectional weight F1EXPWT.\nSix key variables were used in the modeling process: Census region, School type, Sex, Race/ethnicity, 10th-grade cohort, and 12th-grade cohort.

Following the process developed in the first follow-up transcript study, three adjustments were applied to F2QWT. The first adjustment was a nonresponse adjustment used to account for those ELS:2002 sample members who did not have a transcript because a school or parent refused to provide the transcript. The second was a nonresponse adjustment used to account for those sample members who refused to allow their transcript to be collected. The third adjustment was used to calibrate weight sums of the cross-sectional transcript weight in order to preserve prior-round weight totals.\nWeight adjustment for nonresponse due to gatekeepers. Since the cross-sectional transcript weight was created by applying adjustments to the second follow-up cross-sectional weight, all school- and student-level information listed in table 61 could be used in this nonresponse adjustment.

The rationale for treating these reasons for nonresponse as one mechanism was based on the distribution of nonresponse cases. A review of the nonresponse cases indicated that the main reason for nonresponse was direct sample member refusal. A determination was made that the number of nonresponse cases associated with inability to locate was not sufficient to warrant a separate nonresponse adjustment.\nWeight adjustment for no-field cases. Some of the base-year nonrespondents were subsampled for inclusion in the first follow-up study and some were nonrespondents or out of scope in the first follow-up. These sample members were not fielded in the second follow-up. Since the information available for these cases was limited, only a subset of the student-level information listed in table 65 could be used to create this nonresponse adjustment. In addition to all school-level variables listed in table 65, only student race/ethnicity and student sex were known for the base-year nonrespondents who were also first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up.\nA total of 23 variables were used as main effects in the GEM process. Additionally, as the number of first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up was small, interactions of the main effects were not included in this first modeling process. The nonresponse adjustment factor resulting from this process is denoted WTADJ13.\nThe GEM process used to calculate nonresponse adjustments includes a trimming process and the final weight adjustment factor is calculated in such a fashion as to produce trimmed weights. The values of the weight F2IWT were examined and extreme weights (3.7 percent unweighted and 13.6 percent weighted) were identified. The extreme weights were flagged and used to help produce the final nonresponse adjustment factor WTADJ13.\nTable I-10 (appendix I) lists the final predictor variables used in the student nonresponse adjustment model that accounts for those base-year nonrespondents who were first follow-up nonrespondents not fielded for the second follow-up. This table also lists the number of respondents, the weighted response rate, and the average weight adjustment by each level of each predictor variable included in the final nonresponse model. While the average adjustment factor, by variable level, was generally near 1, the individual student-level adjustment factors varied from 0.1 to 1.9 with a median of 1.1.\nThe temporary weight F2IWT*WTADJ13 was the input to the process used to calculate the nonresponse adjustment necessary to account for nonresponse among fielded cases in the second follow-up.\nWeight adjustment sample member nonresponse. Since the ELS:2002 sample members fielded for the second follow-up were base-year respondents, first follow-up respondents, or both, more student-level information could be used in the calculation of this nonresponse adjustment than for the nonresponse adjustment WTADJ13. In addition to all school-level variables listed in table 65, all student-level variables except Enrollment Status were known for second follow-up respondents and second follow-up nonrespondents. The variable G10COHRT\n171\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nwas not used in this weight adjustment process since all respondents and nonrespondents for this panel weight are in the 10th-grade cohort.\nA total of 31 variables were used as main effects in the GEM process. These variables were also used in a CHAID analysis to determine important interactions for the nonresponse adjustment model. The nonresponse adjustment factor resulting from this process is denoted WTADJ14.\nThe GEM process used to calculate nonresponse adjustments includes a trimming process and the final weight adjustment factor is calculated in such a fashion as to produce trimmed weights. The values of the weight F2IWT*WTADJ13 were examined and extreme weights (4.14 percent unweighted and 11.1 percent weighted) were identified. The extreme weights were flagged and used to help produce the final nonresponse adjustment factor WTADJ14.\nTable I-11 (appendix I) lists the final predictor variables, main effects, and interactions used in the student nonresponse adjustment model that accounts for those second follow-up fielded sample members who did not respond. This table also lists the number of respondents, the weighted response rate, and the average weight adjustment by each level of each predictor variable included in the final nonresponse model. While the average adjustment factor, by variable level, was generally near 1, the individual student-level adjustment factors varied from 0.1 to 1.8 with a median of 1.1.\nThe temporary weight F2IWT*WTADJ13*WTADJ14 was the input to the process used to calculate the calibration adjustment necessary to ensure that prior-round weight sums were preserved.\nWeight adjustment used to calibrate weight sums. A weight adjustment factor was calculated using GEM to ensure that the second follow-up panel weight F2BYWT preserved overall and marginal totals from prior rounds. The ELS:2002 sample members included in the weight calibration include second follow-up respondents and second follow-up out-of-scope sample members. In prior rounds, questionnaire-incapable members were considered respondents in the weight calibration but, in the second follow-up, questionnaire-incapable sample members were considered to be out of scope. Since these questionnaire-incapable members were included in the second follow-up calibration, the control totals used in the calibration process were derived from prior-round weight totals that include the questionnaireincapable sample members. For the second follow-up panel weight F2BYWT, control totals were calculated using the first follow-up expanded sample cross-sectional weight BYEXPWT.\nFour key variables were used in the modeling process: Census region, School type, Sex, and Race/ethnicity. Since all sample members who received a F2BYWT are in the 10th-grade cohort, there was no need to include the variable G10COHRT in the calibration model. Additionally, since the set of ELS:2002 sample members eligible for this panel weight is not representative of the 12th-grade cohort, control totals for the 12th-grade cohort were not preserved. The resulting calibration adjustment factor is denoted WTADJ15.\nThe GEM process used to calculate calibration adjustments includes a trimming process and the final weight adjustment factor is calculated in such a fashion as to produce trimmed weights. The values of the weight F2IWT*WTADJ13*WTADJ14 were examined and extreme weights (3.2 percent unweighted and 9.2 percent weighted) were identified. The extreme weights were flagged and used to help produce the final calibration adjustment factor WTADJ15.\n172\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nTable I-12 (appendix I) lists the final model variables for which weight sums were preserved. This table also lists the control total and average weight adjustment by each level of each variable used in the calibration model. While the average adjustment factor, by variable level, was generally near 1, the individual student-level adjustment factors varied from 0.1 to 1.1 with a median of 1.0.\nThe final panel weight F2BYWT is calculated as:\nF2BYWT=F1DWT*WTADJ1*WTADJ2*WTADJ3*WTADJ13*WTADJ14*WTADJ15.\nTable 65 shows various statistical properties of the final second follow-up panel weight F2BYWT.\n\nTable 65.

The 200 replicates were constructed so that there are a sufficient number of replicates for the new regression feature of the DAS. The four sets correspond to the four weights described in section 6.3.2:\n\u2022 F2Q1\u2014F2Q200;\n\u2022 F2TRS1\u2014F2TRS200;\n\u2022 F2BYP1\u2014F2BYP200; and\n\u2022 F2F1P1\u2014F2F1P200.\nThe second follow-up replicate weights were computed in a similar manner to those computed for the base year and first follow-up.\nThe BRR procedure is an alternative variance estimation procedure that computes the variance based on a balanced set of pseudoreplicates. The BRR variance estimation process involves modeling the design as if it were a two-PSU-per-stratum design. Variances were calculated using a random group type of variance estimation procedure, with a balanced set of 200 replicates as the groups. Balancing was done by using an orthogonal matrix (200 x 200\n\n173\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nHadamard matrix) and allows the use of less than the full set of 2L possible replicates, where L is the number of analysis strata. To achieve full orthogonal balance, the number of BRR strata needs to be less than the number of replicates. Therefore, we created 200 replicates in 199 strata. Section 6.3.7.1 describes the strata and PSUs (replicates) that were created for the base-year replicate weights and used again in the first and second follow-ups. Section 6.3.7.2 describes the weight adjustments made for the second follow-up, and section 6.3.7.3 summarizes the results of the replicate weighting.\n6.3.7.1 Strata and PSUs\nFor Taylor series variance estimation, 361 analysis strata containing responding schools were created from the 96 sampling strata based on the sample design. In order to replicate the school weight, it is necessary for the BRR strata to contain all sample schools (respondents and nonrespondents). For the base year, 594 analysis strata were formed for the purpose of computing school-level Taylor series variance estimates. We collapsed these 594 analysis strata into 199 BRR strata. We estimated the base-year expected sample size for each sample school in the 594 strata and then collapsed strata randomly across size groups (small, medium, large) so that the 199 strata have approximately equal sizes. Collapsing randomly allows schools of different types, regions, or urbanicities to be together in a stratum. This provides more degrees of freedom for variance estimation for domains and helps obtain more accurate variance estimates within domains. Within the 199 BRR strata, there are two PSUs. Each school in a stratum was randomly assigned to one of the two PSUs.\nThe strata were randomly assigned to the rows of the Hadamard matrix. The 200 columns of the matrix are the replicates. Within each stratum, the matrix contains values of +1 and -1; one PSU was randomly assigned +1 and the other PSU was assigned -1. For PSUs with a value of +1, the school base (sampling) weight was multiplied by 2 to create the initial BRR weight, otherwise the school base weight was multiplied by zero. Approximately half of the schools in each of the 200 replicates have initial BRR weights of zero and the other half have initial BRR weights double the initial base weight.\n6.3.7.2 Weight Adjustments\nWhile both Taylor series and BRR variance estimation methods reflect the increase in variance due to unequal weighting, the BRR weights can also be designed to reflect the variance impact (increase or decrease) of the weight adjustment process. The impact of the weight adjustment process is captured by repeating nonresponse adjustment and calibration processes on each BRR half sample.\nThe F2 replication process mirrored the F2 analysis weight construction, and the design weight was the F1 replicate design weight. All F2 weight adjustments were replicated, including the adjustment for unknown eligibility, two nonresponse adjustments, and calibration. The original F2 nonresponse and calibration models were used initially for each of the 200 replicates. However, some of the models did not converge for some replicates, so variables were deleted one by one from the models until convergence was achieved. The variables deleted were those that seemed to be causing the convergence problems, as long as they were not key design variables. The weight distribution was calibrated to the F1 weight sums. Since the F2 weights were not poststratified to external (known) totals, the estimates could legitimately reflect some variation in base-year totals due to sampling variability. To recognize the calibration to F1, each\n174\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nhalf sample was calibrated to F1 half sample replicate weight sums rather than calibrated to F1 full sample analysis weight sums.\n6.3.7.3 Results\nWhen weights are adjusted by poststratification to align sample estimates with certain \u201cknown\u201d population totals called controls, the sampling variance for estimates of the controls goes to zero, and the variance for related statistics is expected to be reduced. Repeating the poststratification (to the common \u201cknown\u201d set of external totals) step on each half sample replicate ensures that the variance estimates for the control total estimates are zero and is expected to reduce the variance estimates for statistics correlated with the totals. However, when the calibration is to previous round half sample data, such as in the F2, the variance estimates for the control total estimates are not zero. This is because the control total for each replicate is different, hence there is variance between replicates.\nUsing the set of variables used to compute the design effects (see section 6.4), standard errors were computed using both the Taylor series and BRR variance estimation methods. Taylor series variance estimates were computed using the four F2 analysis weights, and the BRR variance estimation used the four sets of F2 BRR weights. For each of the four comparisons between the two methods, the Taylor series standard error was less than the BRR standard error for about 80 percent of the variables analyzed. Since BRR takes into account the variance due to weight adjustments, these results are expected.\n6.3.8 Quality Control\nQuality control was emphasized on all activities, including weighting. Because of the central importance of the analysis weights to population estimation, a senior statistician thoroughly checked each set of weights. The most fundamental type of check was the verification of totals that are algebraically equivalent (e.g., marginal totals of the weights of eligible students prior to nonresponse adjustment and of respondents after nonresponse adjustment). In addition, various analytic properties of the initial weights, the weight adjustment factors, and the final weights were examined, both overall and within sampling strata, including\n\u2022 distribution of the weights; \u2022 ratio of the maximum weight divided by the minimum weight; and \u2022 unequal weighting design effect, or variance inflation effect (1 + CV2).\nAdditionally, two-dimensional tables of before and after weight adjustments were reviewed to ensure that the weight distribution was not distorted.\n6.4 Second Follow-up Standard Errors and Design Effects\n6.4.1 Standard Errors\nFor probability-based sample surveys, most estimates are nonlinear statistics. For example, a mean or proportion, which is expressed as \u0208wy/\u0208w,81 is nonlinear because the denominator is a survey estimate of the (unknown) population total. In this situation, the\n81 Where w is the sample weight, and y is a 0/1 variable indicating whether a certain characteristic is present for the sample member.\n175\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nvariances of the estimates cannot be expressed in closed form. One common procedure for estimating variances of survey statistics is the Taylor series linearization procedure. This procedure takes the first-order Taylor series approximation of the nonlinear statistic and then substitutes the linear representation into the appropriate variance formula based on the sample design. Woodruff presented the mathematical formulation of this procedure (Woodruff 1971). The variance estimation must also take into account stratification and clustering. There are other variance estimation procedures, such as jackknife and BRR. Taylor series estimation was used for the base year and first follow-up and also used for the second follow-up. BRR weights were produced for the second follow-up for use in the ELS:2002/06 DAS.\nVariance estimation procedures assumed a with-replacement design at the first stage of sampling. Because school sampling rates were moderately low, this assumption yields estimates that are only slightly biased in the positive direction. For stratified multistage surveys and a withreplacement sample design, the Taylor series procedure requires the specification of analysis strata and analysis PSUs. The base-year sampling design employed 96 sampling strata and 752 primary sampling units. Given that the school sample was selected using probability with minimum replacement, for variance estimation in the base year, variance estimation strata were formed consisting of two PSUs per stratum (Chromy 1981). Some 361 analysis strata, containing two PSUs per stratum, were formed by grouping together the 752 sampling PSUs. The responding schools were sorted within sampling strata in the same order as was used for sampling, and then adjacent analysis PSUs were paired to form analysis strata. However, whenever there was an odd number of schools in a sampling stratum, an analysis stratum with three PSUs would be formed. The same analysis strata and PSUs as in the base year were used in the first follow-up and in the second follow-up.\nAs described in chapter 3, the ELS:2002 base-year sampling design was a stratified twostage design. A stratified sample of schools was selected with probabilities proportional to a composite measure of size at the first stage, and a stratified systematic sample of students was selected from sample schools at the second stage. At the first stage, the school sampling rates varied considerably by school sampling strata. At the second stage, Asian and Hispanic students were sampled at higher rates than other students. Because of this complex sampling design, statistical analyses should be conducted using software that properly accounts for the complex survey design.\nMany commonly used statistical computing packages assume that the data were obtained from a simple random sample; that is, they assume that the observations are independent and identically distributed. When the data have been collected using a complex sampling design, the simple random sampling assumption usually leads to an underestimate of the sampling variance, which would lead to artificially small confidence intervals and liberal hypothesis test results (i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true more often than indicated by the nominal Type I error level) (Carlson, Johnson, and Cohen 1993).\nStatistical strategies that have been developed to address this issue include first-order Taylor series expansion of the variance equation, balanced repeated replication, and the jackknife approach (Wolter 2007). Special-purpose software packages that have been developed for analysis of complex sample survey data include SUDAAN, WesVar, and Stata. Evaluations of the relative performances of these packages are reported by Cohen (1997).\n176\n\n\fChapter 6.

The design effect is the ratio of the actual variance of the statistic to the variance that would have been obtained had the sample been a simple random sample. The design standard errors will be different from the standard errors that are based on the assumption that the data are from a simple random sample. The ELS:2002 sample departs from the assumption of simple random sampling in three major respects: student samples were stratified by student characteristics, students were selected with unequal probabilities of selection, and the sample of students was clustered by school. A simple random sample is, by contrast, unclustered and not stratified. Additionally, in a simple random sample, all members of the population have the same probability of selection. Generally, clustering and unequal probabilities of selection increase the variance of sample estimates relative to a simple random sample, and stratification decreases the variance of estimates.\nStandard errors and design effects were computed for all respondents. Standard errors and design effects were computed for 30 means and proportions overall for all respondents and for subgroups of all respondents. The subgroups are similar to those used in NELS:88, the ELS:2002 base year, and the ELS:2002 first follow-up:\n\u2022 sex (male and female); \u2022 race/ethnicity (Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, White/other, multiracial); \u2022 school type (public, Catholic, and other private); \u2022 SES (lowest quarter, middle two quarters, and highest quarter); and \u2022 postsecondary enrollment (ever enrolled in a postsecondary institution, never enrolled\nin a postsecondary institution). It is important to compare design effects across cohorts (e.g., ELS:2002 versus NELS:88), so table 5.3.1 from the Methodology Report: NELS:88 Third Follow-Up (Haggerty et al. 1996) was initially used to help guide the items picked. However, the ELS:2002 items chosen differ quite a bit from the items used in constructing design effects for NELS:88 as there were substantial differences in the types and composition of variables produced in each study. Nonetheless, the items chosen are a good representation of the different items in the ELS:2002 second follow-up survey questionnaire. These items should provide a range of design effects that will give a reasonable average for both the entire sample and for analytically important subgroups. However, because item matching with NELS:88 was difficult, the ELS:2002 design\n178\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\neffects may not be comparable with the NELS:88 repeated design effects. Ideally, one would like to compare exact items between survey systems.

For all respondents, the standard errors and design effects were calculated using both the cross-sectional weight (F2QWT) and the panel weight (F2F1WT). When using the panel weight, only panel respondents were included. The difference between the cross-sectional and panel respondents is that first follow-up nonrespondents who were second follow-up respondents are cross-sectional respondents but are not panel respondents.\n\n179\n\n\fChapter 6.

The second follow-up design effects are lower for all respondents and for all of the common subgroups used in design effects calculations than the base-year and first follow-up design effects.\n\nThe smaller design effects in the second follow-up compared with those in the base year and first follow-up may be due to the general tendency in longitudinal studies for design effects to lessen over time, as dispersion reduces the original clustering. In the second follow-up, almost all sample members had left the base-year school, the clusters of students within schools dispersed to an extent. Social characteristics of the sample members potentially varied to a greater extent as the clusters dispersed.\n\n181\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nTable 69.

Additionally, the items used to compute the mean design effects were different in the second follow-up than in the base year and first follow-up, because the design effects were not expected to change much between the two rounds of the study. It is more important to compare design effects across cohorts, as described below, so the items were chosen to be as comparable to NELS:88 third follow-up items as possible.\n\nThe design effects indicate that the ELS:2002 second follow-up full sample was more efficient than the NELS:88 third follow-up full sample and the HS&B second follow-up sophomore cohort full sample. For means and proportions based on second follow-up questionnaire data for all respondents, the average design effect in ELS:2002 was 1.90; the comparable figures were 2.94 for the NELS:88 third follow-up and 2.40 for the HS&B sophomore cohort second follow-up.

No subsampling was conducted in the ELS:2002 second follow-up, but additional subsampling was done in the other studies. In NELS:88, subsampling was performed in the first, third, and (not relevant to ELS:2002 comparisons) fourth follow-ups. (See Haggerty et al. [1996] for relevant details.) In HS&B, sophomore cohort members were subsampled for inclusion in the HS&B high school transcript study and this subsample was the basis for the HS&B second follow-up study. (See Zahs et al. [1995] for more details.) The general tendency in longitudinal studies is for design effects to lessen over time, as dispersion reduces the original clustering. However, subsampling increases design effects because it introduces additional variability into the weights with an attendant loss in sample efficiency.\nThe smaller design effects in ELS:2002 compared with those for the HS&B sophomore cohort also may reflect the somewhat smaller cluster size used in the latter survey in the base year. Although the clusters were reduced somewhat in the first follow-up for both studies, a number of students remained in the base-year school. The HS&B base-year sample design called for 36 sophomores selected from each school. The ELS:2002 sample design called for about 26 sophomores selected from each school. Clustering tends to increase the variance of survey estimates because the observations within a cluster are similar and therefore add less information than independently selected observations. The impact of clustering depends mainly on two factors: the number of observations within each cluster and the degree of within-cluster homogeneity. When cluster sizes vary, the impact of clustering (DEFFc) can be estimated by\n\n183\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nDEFFc = 1 + (b \u2013 1) rho,\nwhere b refers to the average cluster size (the average number of students selected from each school) and rho refers to the intraclass correlation coefficient, a measure of the degree of withincluster homogeneity. If the value of rho (which varies from one variable to the next) averaged about 0.05 in both studies, then the reduced cluster size in ELS:2002 would almost exactly account for the reduction in the design effects relative to HS&B.\nIf one must perform a quick analysis of ELS:2002 data without using one of the software packages for analysis of complex survey data, the design effects tables in appendix J can be used to make approximate adjustments to the standard errors of survey statistics computed using the standard software packages that assume simple random sampling designs. One cannot be confident regarding the actual design-based standard error without performing the analysis using one of the software packages specifically designed for analysis of data from complex sample surveys.\nStandard errors for a proportion can be estimated from the standard error computed using the formula for the standard error of a proportion based on a simple random sample and the appropriate DEFT:\nSE = DEFT * (p(1-p)/n)1/2.\nSimilarly, the standard error of a mean can be estimated from the weighted variance of the individual scores and the appropriate mean DEFT:\nSE = DEFT * (Var/n)1/2.\nTables 67 and 68 make it clear that the DEFFs and DEFTs vary considerably by subgroup. It is therefore important to use the mean DEFT for the relevant subgroup in calculating approximate standard errors for subgroup statistics.\nStandard error estimates may be needed for subgroups that are not shown in the appendix. One rule of thumb may be useful in such situations. The general rule states that design effects will generally be smaller for groups that are formed by subdividing the subgroups listed in the tables. (Smaller subgroups will be affected less by clustering than larger subgroups; in terms of the equation for DEFFc, b will be reduced.) Estimates for Hispanic males, for example, will generally have smaller design effects than the corresponding estimates for all Hispanics or all males. For this reason, it will usually be conservative to use the subgroup mean DEFT to approximate standard errors for estimates concerning a portion of the subgroup. This rule only applies when the variable used to subdivide a subgroup crosscuts schools. Sex is one such variable because most schools include students of both sexes. It will not reduce the average cluster size to form groups that are based on subsets of schools.\nStandard errors may also be needed for other types of estimates than the simple means and proportions that are the basis for the results presented in the above tables. A second method can be used to estimate approximate standard errors for comparisons between subgroups. If the subgroups crosscut schools, then the design effect for the difference between the subgroup means will be somewhat smaller than the design effect for the individual means; consequently, the variance of the difference estimate will be less than the sum of the variances of the two subgroup means from which it is derived:\n184\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nVar(b-a) = Var(b) + Var(a) where Var(b-a) refers to the variance of the estimated difference between the subgroup means, and Var(a) and Var(b) refer to the variances of the two subgroup means. This equation assumes that the covariance of the subgroup means is negligible. It follows from this equation that Var(a) + Var(b) can be used in place of Var(b-a) with conservative results.\nA final principle is that more complex estimators show smaller design effects than simple estimators (Kish and Frankel 1974/2003). Thus, correlation and regression coefficients tend to have smaller design effects than subgroup comparisons, and subgroup comparisons have smaller design effects than means. This principle implies that it will be conservative to use the DEFTs in the above tables in calculating approximate standard errors for complex statistics, such as multiple regression coefficients. The procedure for calculating such approximate standard errors is the same as with simpler estimates: first, a standard error is calculated using the formula for data from a simple random sample; then the standard error is multiplied by the appropriate DEFT.\nOne analytic strategy for accommodating complex survey designs is to use the mean design effect to adjust for the effective sample size resulting from the design. For example, one could create a weight that is the multiplicative inverse of the design effect and use that weight (in conjunction with sampling weights) to deflate the obtained sample size to take into account the inefficiencies due to a sample design that is a departure from a simple random sample. Using this procedure, statistics calculated by a statistical program such as SAS or SPSS will reflect the reduction in sample size in the calculation of standard errors and degrees of freedom. Such techniques capture the effect of the sample design on sample statistics only approximately. However, while not providing a full accounting of the sample design, this procedure provides some adjustment for the sample design and is probably better than conducting analysis that assumes the data were collected from a simple random sample. The analyst applying this correction procedure should carefully examine the statistical software being used and assess whether the program treats weights in such a way as to produce the effect described above.\n6.5 Second Follow-up Imputation\n6.5.1 Imputation Variables Five key analysis variables were selected for imputation for the ELS:2002 second follow-\nup study. These were five new variables from the second follow-up study. Table 70 lists the selected variables. The five variables selected for imputation include indicators of whether the respondent ever applied to or attended a postsecondary institution, whether the respondent ever held a job for pay since high school, total job earnings in 2005 calendar year, and expectations for the highest level of education to be obtained. These variables were chosen because they are classification variables typically used in NCES\u2019s descriptive reporting.\n185\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\nTable 70.

Sequential hot deck imputation is a common procedure used for item nonresponse. This method uses the respondent survey data (donors) to provide imputed values for records with missing values. The basic principle of sequential hot deck imputation involves defining imputation classes, which generally consist of a cross-classification of covariates, and then replacing missing values sequentially from a single pass through the survey data within the imputation classes. When sequential hot deck imputation is performed using the sampling weights of the item respondents and nonrespondents, the procedure is called weighted sequential hot deck imputation. This procedure takes into account the unequal probabilities of selection in the original sample by using the sampling weight to specify the expected number of times a particular respondent\u2019s answer was used to replace a missing item. These expected selection frequencies are specified so that, over repeated applications of the algorithm, the expected value of the weighted distribution of the imputed values will equal in expectation within imputation class the weighted distribution of the reported answers.\n\n6.5.3 Imputation Results\nSimilar to the base-year and first follow-up studies, these key variables were imputed for second follow-up respondents where a respondent is defined as a sample member who completes a sufficient portion of the questionnaire. The order in which variables were imputed depended on whether the response of one variable was dependent on the response of another variable. For example, the variable describing whether the respondent ever attended a postsecondary institution was imputed after the variable describing whether the respondent ever applied to a postsecondary institution. Similarly, the variable describing total job earnings in calendar year 2005 is dependent on the variable describing whether the respondent ever held a job for pay since high school. Within these dependencies, the variables were imputed starting with the variable containing the lowest percent missing up to the variable with the highest percent missing. Table 71 presents the imputation classes and sorting variables used in the weighted sequential hot deck imputation procedure. Table 72 presents the before and after weighted distributions for the imputed variables.\n\n186\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.5.4 Imputation Evaluation The key measure for determining whether the imputation methods produce acceptable\nresults is that the before- and after-imputation weighted distributions are similar. For evaluation of the imputation results, distributions were considered to be similar when absolute differences are less than 5 percent where the absolute difference is calculated by subtracting the beforeimputation weighted percent from the after-imputation weighted percent. If absolute differences were greater than 5 percent, then the unweighted distributions were examined to see if the large differences were due to small sample sizes. Any large differences were evaluated and corrected when possible (for example, by using different imputation classes), and documented when no resolution was possible.\n187\n\n\fChapter 6.

Extensive confidentiality and data security procedures were employed for ELS:2002 data collection and data processing\n\n189\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nactivities; some of those procedures are summarized briefly here. All project staff signed confidentiality agreements and affidavits of nondisclosure and are prohibited by law from using the obtained information for any purposes other than this research study. The second follow-up interview data were collected via the web on a server protected with a Secure Sockets Layer encryption policy, which forces all data transferred to or from the website to be encrypted and transmitted only via secure (HTTPS) connection to conforming web browsers. Sample members received an e-mail and a lead letter that described the purpose of the study, that contained the URL to the ELS:2002 secure website, and a user ID number and strong randomly generated credential which allowed them access to the web-based interview. The only mechanism of access to the self-administered web-based interview was through this ID number and credential. Sample members could only access their individual case using their ID number and credential; they could not access data or information about anyone else. The ID numbers provided to sample members were completely different from the data IDs included on the ECB and DAS. Data were prepared in accordance with NCES-approved disclosure avoidance plans. The data disclosure guidelines are designed to minimize the possibility of a data user being able to identify individuals on the file by matching outliers or other unique data to external data sources.\nBecause of the paramount importance of protecting the confidentiality of NCES data that contain information about specific individuals, ELS:2002 second follow-up data files were subject to various procedures to minimize disclosure risk. The ELS:2002 second follow-up data products and the disclosure treatment methods employed to produce them are described in the following sections.\n6.6.1 Second Follow-up Data Products\nThe set of data products produced for the ELS:2002 second follow-up are different than the set of data products produced in the base year and first follow-up in that no public-use data file was created for the second follow-up. A restricted-use data file and a file developed for use with the NCES DAS were created.\nThe disclosure treatment developed for the ELS:2002 second follow-up is composed of several steps:\n\u2022 Review the collected data and identify items that may increase risk of disclosure. \u2022 Apply disclosure treatment82 to these risky items in order to lower risk of disclosure. \u2022 Produce a restricted-use data file that incorporates the disclosure treated data. \u2022 Produce a file for the DAS that is derived as a subset of items in the disclosure treated\nrestricted-use data file.\nThe disclosure treatment methods used to produce the ELS:2002 second follow-up data files include variable recoding, variable suppression, and swapping. These methods are described below.\n82 The NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2003) (http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/2002/std4_2.asp), specifically NCES Standard 4-2, provide information both about the legislative background and legal requirements of maintaining confidentiality, and definitions of key terms (perturbation, coarsening, disclosure risk analysis, data swapping, and so forth).\n190\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n6.6.2 Recoding, Suppression, and Swapping\nSome of the data used during data collection activities were deemed to be too identifying and were not included in the restricted-use data file or the file for the DAS. Some restricted-use data were deemed to be too identifying for inclusion in the file for the DAS and these data were not included in the file for the DAS.\nFor items in the restricted-use file, recoding was used to produce more analytically useful variables. Some items had values that occurred with extremely low frequencies and the items were therefore recoded in order to ensure that all values of all items occurred with a reasonable frequency. Some items included in the file for the DAS were created by producing a recoded version of a restricted-use item. Since the DAS employs an automatic cell suppression methodology that suppresses cell values if the number of responders providing data for that cell is below a certain threshold, recoding of restricted-use items for inclusion in the DAS was carried out in order to reduce the number of cells that would be suppressed by the DAS, thereby increasing the analytic utility of the data included in the DAS.\nSwapping was applied to ELS:2002 data items determined to potentially increase risk of disclosure. Respondents were randomly selected for swapping to achieve a specific, but undisclosed, swapping rate. In data swapping, the values of the variables being swapped are exchanged between carefully selected pairs of records: a target record and a donor record. By so doing, even if a tentative identification of an individual is made, because every case in the file has some undisclosed probability of having been swapped, uncertainty remains about the accuracy and interpretation of the match. The swapping was done independently of the swapping conducted in the base year and first follow-up.\nSince perturbation (swapping) of the ELS:2002 data may change the relationships between data items, an extensive data quality check was carried out in order to limit the impact of swapping on relationships. Before-and-after weighted distributions and correlations for swapped variables show that, after applying the disclosure limitation techniques, the analytic utility of the data files was not compromised.\n6.7 Second Follow-up Unit and Item Nonresponse Bias Analysis\n6.7.1 Unit Nonresponse Bias Analysis\nUnit nonresponse causes bias in survey estimates when the outcomes of respondents and nonrespondents are different. For the ELS:2002 second follow-up, student response is defined as the sample member completing at least a specified portion of the questionnaire. The weighted response rate83 was 84.5 percent overall and was greater than 85 percent for all but one of the 33 domains considered in the nonresponse bias analysis. The domains selected for the unit nonresponse bias analysis were derived from the domains listed in section 6.3. Examples of domains used in the nonresponse bias analysis are given below:\n83 Readers are reminded that a smaller denominator was used for general response rate calculations, based on cases actually fielded, than for response rate calculations for weighting purposes. This is because the unfielded cases must be accommodated in the nonresponse adjustments. These unfielded cases in the response rate denominator include sample members who failed to participate in both the base year and first follow-up, freshened students who did not respond in the first follow-up, and a handful of sample members who asked to withdraw from the study.\n191\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\u2022 Spring 2002 Black 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 Hispanic 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 Asian 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 White/Other 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 Public School 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 Catholic School 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 Other Private School 10th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2002 10th-grade students who graduated by August 31, 2004; \u2022 Spring 2004 Black 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 Hispanic 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 Asian 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 White/Other 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 Public School 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 Catholic School 12th-grade students; \u2022 Spring 2004 Other Private School 12th-grade students; and \u2022 Spring 2004 12th-grade students who graduated by August 31, 2004. The response rate was below 85 percent for one domain (the racial group White/Other), so a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for this domain. Since the overall response rate was below 85 percent, nonresponse bias analyses were conducted as required under NCES standards. Cross-sectional and panel weights were used in the nonresponse bias analyses. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents. Since the sample for the second follow-up study consists of respondents from the base-year or first follow-up studies, sample member data were used in the nonresponse bias analysis, though some of the available data may have been imputed.84 The sample member data that were used include: \u2022 student race/ethnicity; \u2022 student sex; \u2022 student\u2019s native language; \u2022 family composition; \u2022 parents\u2019 highest level of education; \u2022 mother/female guardian\u2019s occupation;\n84 For example, some base-year nonrespondents were sampled for inclusion in the first follow-up study. Some of these base-year nonrespondents responded in the first follow-up and some base-year data were collected on these individuals. If these individuals did not provide these base-year data in the first follow-up questionnaires then some of their base-year data were imputed.\n192\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\u2022 father/male guardian\u2019s occupation; \u2022 total family income from all sources; and \u2022 SES. The sample member\u2019s spring 2004 enrollment status was also used and defined as follows: \u2022 in school, in grade (in grade 12); \u2022 in school, out of grade (in grade 10 or 11, ungraded, or graduated early); and \u2022 out of school (dropout or homeschooled). We also used the sample member cohort flags: \u2022 G10COHRT\u2014indicates a member of the sophomore cohort (i.e., spring 2002\n10th-grader); and \u2022 G12COHRT\u2014indicates a member of the senior cohort (i.e., spring 2004 12th-grader). There were also extensive data available for schools from the base-year school administrator questionnaire, so these data were used to help reduce potential nonresponse bias. Students were linked to the base-year school from which they were sampled. The school sampling frame constructed from the CCD and PSS also contains data for all base-year schools. School data used included the following: \u2022 school sector; \u2022 urbanicity; \u2022 region; \u2022 sophomore enrollment; \u2022 total enrollment; \u2022 number of minutes per class; \u2022 number of class periods; \u2022 number of school days; \u2022 number of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch; \u2022 number of full-time teachers; \u2022 percentage of full-time teachers certified; \u2022 number of part-time teachers; \u2022 number of different grades taught at the school; \u2022 school level; \u2022 coeducational status; \u2022 percentage of students with an Individualized Education Program;\n193\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\n\u2022 percentage of students with limited English proficiency; \u2022 percentage Hispanic or Latino sophomores; \u2022 percentage Asian sophomores; \u2022 percentage Black or African American sophomores; and \u2022 percentage all other race sophomores (includes White). The procedures used for the nonresponse bias analysis were similar to those used in the base year and first follow-up. First, sample member data known for both respondents and nonrespondents were identified. Second, since the set of data known for both respondents and nonrespondents was limited, all of these data were incorporated into nonresponse models used for the second follow-up. The nonresponse adjustments described in section 6.3 were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Variables not known for most respondents and nonrespondents could not be included in the nonresponse adjustments, and therefore nonresponse bias could not explicitly be reduced for these variables. However, many of the variables in the nonresponse models are correlated with many of the other variables. Third, after the sample member weights were computed, remaining bias for data known for most respondents and nonrespondents was estimated and statistically tested to check if there was any remaining significant nonresponse bias. Fourth, the remaining bias after student weight adjustments was divided by the standard error, that is, bias/standard error. The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents, yR , is the difference between this mean and the target parameter, % (i.e., the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of the target population was conducted). This bias can be expressed as follows:\nB ( yR ) = yr \u2212\u03c0 .\nThe estimated mean based on nonrespondents, yNR , can be computed if data for the particular variable for most of the nonrespondents are available. The estimation of \u03c0 is as follows:\n\u03c0\u02c6 = (1\u2212\u03b7 ) yR +\u03b7 yNR\nwhere \u03b7 is the weighted unit nonresponse rate. For the variables that are from the frame rather than from the sample, % can be estimated without sampling error. Therefore, the bias can be estimated as follows:\nB\u02c6 ( yR ) = yR \u2212\u03c0\u02c6\nor equivalently\nB\u02c6 ( yR ) = \u03b7 ( yR \u2212 yNR ) .\nThis formula shows that the estimate of the nonresponse bias is the difference between the mean for respondents and nonrespondents multiplied by the weighted nonresponse rate. The\n194\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nvariance of the bias was computed using Taylor series estimation in RTI\u2019s software package SUDAAN.\nTables K-1 and K-2 in appendix K show the nonresponse bias before and after weight adjustments for selected variables for sample members where F2QWT is used in table K-1 and F2F1WT is used in table K-2. The first set of columns in each table shows the estimated bias before nonresponse adjustment for the variables available for most responding and nonresponding students. Statistical tests (t tests) were used to test each level of the variables for significance of the bias at the 0.05/(c-1) significance level, where c is the number of categories (levels) within the primary variable. Below is a summary of the before-adjustment significant bias for tables K-1 and K-2:\n\u2022 At least one level of 19 of the 33 variables was biased for the cross-sectional weight and 21 of the 33 for the panel weight.\n\u2022 Thirty-seven levels of variables were found to be significantly biased for the crosssectional weight and 38 for the panel weight.\n\u2022 Significant biases were usually small.\nThe second set of columns in tables K-1 and K-2 shows the estimated bias after weight adjustments (using F2QWT for table K-1 and F2F1WT for table K-2) for the variables available for most responding and nonresponding students. The bias after weight adjustments was computed as the difference between the estimate using nonresponse-adjusted and calibrated (final) weights and the estimate using the design (base) weights prior to nonresponse and calibration adjustment. This latter estimate is an estimate of % because it is the estimate of the target population using the design weights. Similar to the testing of before-adjustment bias, t tests were performed to test the significance of the bias for each level of the variables. In both tables K-1 and K-2, the estimated bias usually decreased after weight adjustments. Therefore, the number of significantly biased levels of variables decreased from 37 before adjustment to 10 after adjustment in table K-1 and from 38 before adjustment to 16 after adjustment in table K-2. In table K-2, the amount of significant bias increased for three levels in two variables. In table K-3, the amount of significant bias increased for eight levels in five variables.\nTables K-3 and K-4 in appendix K show the nonresponse bias before and after weight adjustments for selected variables in the single domain (White/Other race category) where the response rate was less than 85 percent. F2QWT was used in table K-3 and F2F1WT was used in table K-4. As in tables K-1 and K-2, the first set of columns in each table shows the estimated bias before nonresponse adjustment for the variables available for most responding and nonresponding students. Statistical tests (t tests) were again used to test the significance of the bias at the 0.05/(c-1) significance level. Below is a summary of the before-adjustment significant bias for tables K-3 and K-4:\n\u2022 At least one level of 23 variables and a total of 45 levels were found to be significantly biased in table K-3.\n\u2022 At least one level of 13 variables and a total of 24 levels were found to be significantly biased in table K-4.\n\u2022 Significant biases were usually small.\n195\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nAs in tables K-1 and K-2, the second set of columns in tables K-3 and K-4 shows the estimated bias after weight adjustments (using F2QWT for table K-3 and F2F1WT for table K-4) for the variables available for most responding and nonresponding students. The bias after weight adjustments was computed the same way as described above for tables K-1 and K-2. Statistical tests (t tests) were performed to test the significance of the bias for each level of the variables. In both tables, the estimated bias sometimes decreased after weight adjustments and sometimes increased after weight adjustments. In tables K-3 and K-4, the amount of significant bias increased for four levels among three variables and for five levels among two variables, respectively. Note that sample members are assigned to these domains based on data known for respondents and nonrespondents, and sample members may actually be in different domains. Therefore, these bias estimates are approximate.\nThe nonresponse bias analyses in conjunction with the weighting adjustments described above do not eliminate all bias. They reduce bias for some of the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables. Significant bias after weight adjustments is minimal for the variables analyzed. Some of these variables are used to help create composite (or derived) variables. There may be bias remaining in other variables.\nFigures K-1 through K-4 in appendix K compare the estimated relative bias before nonresponse and calibration adjustment with the estimated relative bias after nonresponse and calibration adjustment. Figures K-1 and K-2 examine relative bias for the entire ELS:2002 second follow-up sample using F2QWT and F2F1WT, respectively. Figures K-3 and K-4 examine relative bias for the single domain (White/Other race category) identified as having less than an 85 percent response rate with figure K-3 using F2QWT and figure K-4 using F2F1WT. Relative bias is the bias of the estimate divided by the estimate. It provides an indication of the order of magnitude of the bias with respect to the estimate. Figures K-1 through K-4 indicate that when the relative bias was large before nonresponse adjustment, it was almost always reduced after nonresponse adjustment. When the relative bias was small before nonresponse adjustment, it stayed small after nonresponse adjustment with occasional small increases. These figures clearly show that the nonresponse adjustment reduced bias for sample members.\nNonresponse bias can have an effect on significance testing. Tables K-1 through K-4 include an estimate of the bias ratio (sample bias divided by the standard error). If this ratio is larger than 2 percent, then the probability of a Type I error is greater than 0.05. Figures K-5 through K-8 in appendix K show the sample bias ratio by the Type I error rate. Figures K-5 and K-6 examine bias ratios for the entire ELS:2002 second follow-up sample using F2QWT and F2F1WT, respectively. Figures K-7 and K-8 examine the bias ratios for the single domain (White/Other race category) identified as having a response rate less than 85 percent. F2QWT is used in figure K-7 and F2F1WT is used in figure K-8. Figure K-5 shows that for many of the sample member variables included in the nonresponse bias analysis, the Type I error rate is at or is close to 0.05, and outliers were not graphed. Figures K-6 through K-8 show that although some variables have a Type I error rate at or near 0.05, there are more variables that have a higher Type I error rate. These figures do not take the school bias ratio into account. The school bias ratio varies by school variable, as shown in the ELS:2002 base-year data file user\u2019s manual (Ingels et al. 2004). If it is assumed that the school bias ratio is zero, then there is no effect on the sample member bias ratio. However, if the school bias ratio is large, then the Type I error rates\n196\n\n\fChapter 6. Weighting, Imputation, and Design Effects\nare larger. Although the tables above show that nonresponse bias is minimal, the data user should exercise caution when conducting statistical tests.\n6.7.2 Item Nonresponse Bias Analysis Since the overall weighted unit response rate (84.5 percent) was less than 85 percent, an\nitem nonresponse bias analysis was carried out as required under NCES statistical standards. The first step in the nonresponse bias analysis was to calculate the weighted85 response rate for every questionnaire item included in the ELS:2002 second follow-up. Four items were found to have response rates lower than 85 percent:\n\u2022 Date of marriage.86 (F2D02P/F2D02R) \u2022 Which of the following are reasons why you decided not to continue your education\nright after high school? (F2B11NA) \u2022 Which of the following are reasons why you have not continued your education after\nhigh school? (F2B08NA) \u2022 How did you earn the GED or equivalency, or in other words, what program or\nschool were you enrolled in, if any? (F2A04A) These items had weighted response rates of 82.9, 61.2, 58.4, and 36.7 percent, respectively. Tables K-5 through K-8 compare item respondents and nonrespondents to these four items using six characteristics known for more respondents and nonrespondents. Weighted distributions of the values of these six characteristics were generated using both respondents and nonrespondents, using respondents only, and using nonrespondents only and these distributions are presented in tables K-5 through K-8. It should be noted that all unweighted sample counts were rounded for reporting purposes.\nThree statistically significant biases (table K-5) were identified for the item Date of Marriage. No statistically significant biases (table K-6) were identified for the item F2B11NA. Two statistically significant biases (table K-7) were identified for the item F2B08NA. One statistically significant bias (table K-8) was identified for the item F2A04A.\nSix of the 76 bias comparisons yielded a statistically significant bias. Four of the six statistically significant biases indicate overrepresentation of females or Whites/other among the respondents, as compared to the nonrespondents, and are the largest biases among all six.\n85 Weighted response rates were calculated using the F2 cross-sectional weight, F2QWT. 86 The restricted-use version of this variable gives month and year while the public-use version only gives quarter and year.\n197\n\n\f\fChapter 7 Data File Contents\nThis chapter describes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) base-year to first follow-up and base-year to second follow-up longitudinal data file contents. It addresses the following topics: the structure of the electronic codebook (ECB) system (appendix B), including the megafiles; the nature of the Data Analysis System (DAS); and the questionnaire and composite variables, including their naming conventions and an overview of composite variables (also see appendix L, ECB and DAS variable list; appendix M, list of composite variables; and appendix N, variables imported into ELS:2002 from external sources).\n7.1 Base-Year to First Follow-up ECB Data Structure\nELS:2002 base-year to first follow-up data have been made available in public- and (for licensed users) restricted-use versions87 in an ECB format on CD-ROM. The ECB is designed to be run in a Microsoft Windows environment. A version of the restricted ECB with high school transcript data added was released in November 2006. (This version is called E4T [NCES 2006351]; however, the transcript data are also included on the second follow-up [2006] restricted release.) At the same time that the transcript and course offerings data were added in, a final first follow-up test score was added as well. This was the concordance score linking the scales of the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress mathematics assessment to the 2004 ELS:2002 math score; the concordant scale score is described at length in chapter 2 of this volume.\nThe ECB system serves as an electronic version of a fully documented survey codebook. It allows the data user to browse through all ELS:2002 variables contained on the data files, search variable and value names for keywords related to particular research questions, review the wording of these items along with notes and other pertinent information related to them, examine the definitions and programs used to develop composite and classification variables, and output the data for statistical analysis. The ECB also provides an electronic display of the distribution of counts and percentages for each variable in the dataset. Analysts can use the ECB to select or tag variables of interest, print hardcopy codebooks that display the distributions of the tagged variables, and generate SAS and SPSS program code (including variable and value labels) that can be used with the analyst\u2019s own statistical software.\nThe base-year to first follow-up ECB comprises two large \u201cmegafiles,\u201d one at the student level (with other data sources supplying contextual data for analysis of the student) and one at the high school level. The megafile at the student level encompasses base-year student (student questionnaire and test, parent, and teacher questionnaires) and school (administrator, library, facilities) data in conjunction with first follow-up student (student, transfer, dropout, early graduate, and homeschool questionnaires, student tests and transcripts) and school administrator data.\nThe second megafile, at the school level, encompasses base-year data (facilities checklist, the school administrator questionnaire, the library media center questionnaire) and first follow-\n87 A license is required to access the restricted-use ECB (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp).\n199\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nup school administrator questionnaire and course offerings data. Analysts should be aware that the base-year school data may be used as a standalone, nationally representative sample of 2001\u2013 02 schools with 10th grades, but that the school data for the 2003\u201304 school year are not precisely generalizable to the nation\u2019s 2003\u201304 high schools with 12th grades.\nThe content and organization of the transcript and course offerings data (course-level file, student-level file, school-level file, and course offerings file) are further described in Bozick et al. (2006).\n7.1.1 Base-Year to Second Follow-up ECB Data Structure The base-year to second follow-up data are available in a restricted-use ECB (NCES\n2008-346) on CD-ROM. This ECB contains all of the base-year to first follow-up data (including high school transcript data) as well as the second follow-up data. The structure of the new baseyear to second follow-up ECB builds on the past ECBs but contains additional dimensions. Again, there are both student and high school-level megafiles but there is also a postsecondary institutional file and an extant data sources file that reflects ancillary data imported from external administrative records. A \u201cQuick Guide\u201d for using the ECB is included in this report as appendix B.\n7.1.2 Student Megafile The student file contains all prior-round data,88 retaining the basic structure as in the base-\nyear to first follow-up Transcript ECB (E4T: NCES 2006-351). New variables were usually added to new sections and then inserted into a logical grouping of sections (i.e., composites, sample member response data, school replicated data, etc.). The section titled \u201cID and Universe Variables\u201d is an exception in spanning rounds of data collection.\nSections of the student file (BYF2STU) are as follows: \u2022 ID and Universe Variables; \u2022 Base-year (BY) Weights and Composites; \u2022 First follow-up (F1) Weights and Composites; \u2022 F1 Transcript Composites; \u2022 Second follow-up (F2) Weights and Composites; \u2022 Second follow-up Extant Data Source Composites; \u2022 BY Student Questionnaire; \u2022 F1 Student Questionnaire; \u2022 F1 Dropout Questionnaire; \u2022 F1 Transfer Questionnaire; \u2022 F1 Early Graduate Questionnaire;\n88 While all data elements have been retained, not all base-year and first follow-up data have been carried over. Specifically, in two rare instances data have been expunged: past data for deceased sample members, and data for sample members who withdrew their participation with instructions that past data be dropped.\n200\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\n\u2022 F1 New Participant Supplement; \u2022 F2 Survey; \u2022 BY Parent Questionnaire; \u2022 BY Teacher Questionnaire (English); \u2022 BY Teacher Questionnaire (Math); \u2022 BY School Composites; \u2022 F1 School Composites; \u2022 BY Administrator Questionnaire; \u2022 F1 Administrator Questionnaire; \u2022 BY Library Questionnaire; and \u2022 BY Facilities Checklist.\n7.1.3 High School Megafile The school file reflects data for the base-year, first follow-up, and first follow-up\ntranscript data collection; the first follow-up was the final round for collection of school-level data directly from high schools. Common Core of Data and Private School Survey data were added to the restricted-use ECB as a convenience to the ECB user. The School ID is constructed such that student file records can be merged with the high school data.\n7.1.4 Postsecondary Institution File The postsecondary institution file is newly added with the second follow-up and links\nstudents to postsecondary institutions applied to and attended. The key on the file is Stu_ID, order number, and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System ID. Data for the institutions are obtained in the second follow-up interview, and collected by looping over each institution for a series of questions about application and attendance, among others. The looped iterations were normalized (one record for each unique postsecondary institution per caseid) and placed into the institution file structure. The order number enables researchers to associate information for a given institution from the student-level file with information about the given institution. An order number helps researchers determine a uniquely identifiable key and to allow users to easily link institution-based items from the student file to the institution file.\nIf the respondent reported attending one postsecondary institution, this institution is listed first for that student. If the respondent indicated attending more than one postsecondary institution, the one the respondent attended first would be listed first and so on. Institutions that respondents applied to but did not attend follow in the order they were named in the interview.\n7.1.5 Extant Data Source Files: Ancillary Data Links in the ELS:2002 Base-Year to Second Follow-up ECB\nRather than merge data from extant data sources on the student file, separate files were constructed that can be linked to the student file. Sample members will have one record on each data source file when data are available. If information is not available for that data source, then\n201\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nthe student record will be excluded from that data source file. The following data source files were utilized:\n\u2022 the Central Processing System89; \u2022 the National Student Loan Data System90; \u2022 the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT); \u2022 the ACT; and \u2022 the General Educational Development (GED). Variables representing the extant sources data imported into the second follow-up are listed in appendix N of this document. Some composite variables have been constructed to facilitate use of the SAT and ACT test score data. Further details on merged SAT/ACT data may be found later in this chapter (section 7.2.2.3 ).\n7.1.6 Reserve Codes There are a number of reasons for data to be missing for given variables. We account for\nthese situations by filling items with reserve codes. The following reserve code scheme was used:\n\u2022 -1 \u201cDon\u2019t know. \u201d This reserve code was not used in the second follow-up and is retained for prior-round data.\n\u2022 -2, \u201cRefused.\u201d This reserve code was not used in the second follow-up and is retained for prior-round data.\n\u2022 -3 \u201cItem legitimate skip/NA.\u201d Filled for questions that are not answered because prior answers route the respondent elsewhere.\n\u2022 -4 \u201cNonrespondent.\u201d Filled for all variables across the entire instrument when a sample member did not respond to the instrument.\n\u2022 -5 \u201cOut of Range.\u201d This reserve code was not used in the second follow-up and is retained for prior-round data.\n\u2022 -6 \u201cMultiple Response.\u201d This reserve code was not used in the second follow-up and is retained for prior-round data.\n\u2022 -7 \u201cPartial interview-breakoff.\u201d Filled for questions that are not answered because the respondent has broken off the interview without completing it. This also includes particular items that were not included on abbreviated versions of previous-round questionnaires.\n\u2022 -8 \u201cSurvey component legitimate skip/NA.\u201d Filled for all variables across the entire instrument when a sample member does not apply to a particular instrument or round. It is similar to -4 in that it applies to all variables across an entire instrument;\n89 The Central Processing System contains Free Application for Federal Student Aid data. 90 The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) database contains records of all federal loans, and Pell grant information, for anyone who has such a loan or grant.\n202\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nhowever, the reason is different in that the sample member never had the chance to respond.\n\u2022 -9 \u201cMissing.\u201d Filled for questions that are not answered when the routing suggests that they should have responded.\n7.1.7 Data Analysis System\nIn addition to the ECBs, for users who do not require direct access to microdata, ELS:2002 data are also available from the National Center for Education Statistics through a web-based DAS which includes data through 2006 and selected transcript variables (e.g., coursetaking summaries and categorical data for grade point average) from the high school transcript file. The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates standard errors and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. Finally, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the stratified sampling method used in the ELS:2002 surveys. The DAS can be accessed electronically at http://nces.ed.gov/DAS.\nThe DAS will give essentially, but not precisely, the same estimates and standard errors as the ECB. Because of its rounding conventions, DAS estimates will differ from ECB estimates by being slightly less precise. Because a different method is used for variance estimation, standard errors of measurement, while highly similar, will seldom be identical (the ECB estimates sampling errors through a Taylor Series linearization; the DAS estimates standard errors using the balanced repeated replication method of approximating the estimator by balanced repeated replication of the sampled population).\n7.2 Instrument and Composite Variables\n7.2.1 Naming Conventions\nData users should find naming conventions for variables, flags, and weights intuitive and quite similar to those employed in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Most variables begin with an indicator of the wave (e.g., base-year variables begin with BY, first follow-up with F1, and second follow-up with F2). Weights follow the same wave-naming convention and also contain the suffix WT (e.g., BYSTUWT is the name for the final student weight for base-year questionnaire completion, F2QWT is the equivalent second follow-up questionnaire completion weight, and BYSCHWT is the name for the base-year final school weight). Just as first follow-up variables begin with the prefix F1, second follow-up (2006) variables begin with F2.\nIn the base year and first follow-up (but not the second follow-up), variable names also distinguish (in their third character) between components and questionnaire types. F1S, for example, indicates a first follow-up student questionnaire variable, whereas F1A stands for administrator questionnaire items, and F1D refers to the \u201cout of school\u201d (dropout) questionnaire. Variables that reflect specific items in the questionnaire carry the question number in the variable\n203\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nname, immediately after the component indicator. Hence, F1S58 would be item 58 from the first follow-up student questionnaire, and F1D19 would be item 19 in the dropout instrument.\nThe round-specific constructed variables are typically not anchored in a single questionnaire item and may sometimes reflect nonquestionnaire sources of information, such as the assessments. First follow-up test scores carry the prefix F1TX. F1TXMQU, for example, indicates the quartile score for the first follow-up mathematics test. Flags are indicated by the suffix FLG or FG. Variable names also distinguish between the public (P) and restricted (R) use forms, where variables differ between them (the base-year and first follow-up public-use variables are a subset of the restricted-use superset).\nFinally, some slightly different information is included in second follow-up variable names. In base year and first follow-up, variable names contain a letter to reference a questionnaire (e.g., S = Student) in addition to the round prefix (BY or F1) and frequently reference the question number (composite and transcript variables do not link to specific questionnaire items so they contain a descriptive reference). The second follow-up instrument is an electronic questionnaire with many pathways; there is no fixed hardcopy questionnaire nor question numbers. However, a sequential number within each thematic area or module has been assigned to each item from the interview. Whenever possible, second follow-up variable names were constructed as F2{Section Letter}{Sequential Number}{sub-item letter if applicable}. The applicable section letters for the 2006 round are as follows:\n\u2022 A\u2014High school section;\n\u2022 B\u2014Postsecondary section;\n\u2022 C\u2014Employment section; and\n\u2022 D\u2014Community section.\nVariables that do not follow the sequential numbering naming convention are:\n\u2022 Postsecondary institution variables\u2014These variables were obtained at the respondent level and looped through each institution. The final file is normalized with each record representing one of the institutions the respondent identified in the interview. The variables are named with a descriptive reference.\n\u2022 Composites\u2014These variables were given names consistent with the descriptive names of prior round composites, prefixed with the 2006 round indicator (i.e., F2).\nFor the ELS:2002 second follow-up, no hardcopy codebooks were produced. For baseyear to first follow-up data, the hardcopy codebooks appear as portable document format (PDF) files for the web-published version of the data documentation manual (see http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002) and correspond to appendix G of Ingels et al. (2005b). The codebook supplies a comprehensive description of the student data file. For each variable on the student component data file, the codebook provides a summary of the related information, including the question number and wording, the variable name, and the responses to the item, along with their unweighted frequency and percent and weighted percent. It also provides missing data frequencies sorted by reserve codes. For the high school transcript data, hardcopy codebooks are also available, as an appendix to Bozick et al. (2006). Unlike the other hardcopy codebooks, however, the hardcopy transcript codebooks are only available as part of the restricted-use data.\n204\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\n7.2.2 Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nThe second follow-up data file includes many composite variables for the convenience of data users. Appendix M provides a complete list of second follow-up composite variables. Composite variables combine or reorganize data whereas instrument variables (that is, variables named with an \u201cF2A,\u201d \u201cF2B,\u201d \u201cF2C\u201d or \u201cF2D\u201d prefix) represent the data as they were collected in the interview. This section provides a descriptive overview of two types of composite variables. Composite variables that are constructed from multiple data sources will be discussed first. The month-by-month enrollment and employment history composite variables will be covered second. More detailed descriptions of the construction methods used for each of these composite variables and the associated code are provided in the ECB.\n7.2.2.1 Composite Variables Constructed From Multiple Data Sources\nFirst, we will provide an overview of the second follow-up composite variables that merge data from multiple sources. In each of these composite variables, data collected from the second follow-up interview is one input. The second follow-up data collection began at the end of January 2006 and continued through early September 2006. Respondents provided information based on their status at the time of their interview.\nMany of these composite variables use information collected from the High School section of the interview as one input. Owing to the complexity of these variables, they will be treated first in their own subsection. A discussion of composite variables that integrate data from the Postsecondary Education section of the second follow-up interview with Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data follows.\nComposite variables using high school completion data from multiple sources. Many of the second follow-up composite variables draw upon data from the High School section of the interview. The data user is cautioned that most of the variables that provide data as they were collected in the High School section of the second follow-up interview, that is, variables with an \u201cF2A\u201d prefix, are not standalone variables to be used in analyses, but rather they serve as inputs to composite variables. They are provided on the ECB to reflect the direct responses to items administered in this section of the interview and for reference or validation of composite variable construction. They are not included on the DAS.\nThe High School section data are supplemented by data from three primary sources; the first follow-up early graduate and dropout interviews, the high school transcript data as provided on the high school transcript ECB, and the high school transcript data as preloaded in the second follow-up interview. A distinction is drawn between the high school transcript data as provided on the ECB and the preloaded transcript information because these data were still undergoing quality control procedures when the second follow-up data collection began. In an effort to preload only stable transcript data, transcript information was only preloaded for cases where the following conditions were met: (1) the data indicated that a high school diploma or certificate of attendance had been awarded; (2) the high school completion date was May or June 2004, the modal dates of completion; and (3) quality control had been completed. High school completion information as reported in the first follow-up early graduate and dropout questionnaires was also preloaded. F2PHSDG indicates the credential earned as it was preloaded. The preloaded high school completion dates are found in F2PHSDT.\n205\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nInevitably, data collected from multiple sources are inconsistent for a small number of cases. Therefore, for the purpose of constructing many composite variables using data from multiple sources, decisions must be made with respect to which data sources take precedence over other data sources.91 Some of these decisions were \u201cbuilt in\u201d to the preloaded data. Specifically, if the sample member reported earning a high school credential and a completion date in his or her first follow-up early graduate or dropout questionnaire, this information was preloaded instead of any high school transcript data that may exist for that sample member. In other words, high school completion information collected in the first follow-up early graduate or dropout questionnaire was given precedence over high school transcript data. This approach was taken for two reasons. First, as previously mentioned, the high school transcript data were still undergoing quality control procedures for some cases when data collection began. In addition, since the preloaded information was presented to the second follow-up respondent in the interview by way of customized question wording, consistency with the respondents\u2019 own perception of their high school completion status was desired. In cases where the preload variables were not populated, second follow-up respondents were only asked if they had completed high school, for the credential they had earned, and when they received that credential if these data were not preloaded. Finally, if data were not available from the preloads or second follow-up responses, the high school transcript data, as provided on the high school transcript ECB, were referenced for some composite variables.\nIn summary, the precedence order of data sources for composite variables constructed from the High School section data is as follows:\n1. First follow-up respondent report in the early graduate or dropout questionnaire questionnaires (including but not limited to preloaded high school completion data);\n2. Preloaded high school transcript data (high school diploma or certificate of attendance in May or June 2004; see F2PHSDG and F2PHSDT);\n3. Second follow-up respondent report in the High School section of the interview (F2A variables; only populated if 1 and 2 are not); and,\n4. Final high school transcript data (as necessary for some composite variables).\nNot all of the high school composite variables draw on all of these data sources however. For example, composite variables that pertain only to second follow-up respondents do not integrate the fourth source, final high school transcript data (except in the rare instances of second followup item nonresponse).\nA number of these multisource composite variables reference the spring term of 2004, the reference period for the first follow-up data collection. The first of these, F2F1GRDE, updates F1GRADE for first follow-up nonrespondents. It indicates the grade level in the spring term of 2004 for sample members who were attending high school at that time. First follow-up nonrespondents were identified in the second follow-up as spring-term 2004 12th-graders by their response to a direct question about their grade level during that time (F2A12) or by logical imputation based on having received a diploma or certificate of attendance in April, May, or June 2004. In keeping with the classification rules used for first follow-up respondents, first\n91 Some composite variables constructed from multiple data sources incorporate all information from all data sources. For example, the variable F2EVERDO is set to \u201c1\u201d if any source indicates a dropout episode. However, for most composite variables, inconsistencies are reconciled based on decision rules.\n206\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nfollow-up nonrespondents who indicated that they had completed their high school credential prior to April 200492 (early graduates) were not included in the 12th-grade cohort. A closely related variable, G12COHRT, indicates which ELS:2002 sample members were in the 12th grade, the modal grade level, in the spring term of 2004.\nAnother variable that relates to this time period, F2SP04DO, indicates whether the sample member was a spring-term 2004 dropout or early alternative completer as defined by the classification rules used in the first follow-up data collection. A sample member was considered a spring-term 2004 dropout if he or she had experienced a dropout episode of at least 4 consecutive weeks during that term. The dropout episode could have begun prior to the start of the spring term. F2SP04DO identifies a sizable number of first follow-up nonrespondents who were spring-term 2004 dropouts. This variable also identifies a small number of first follow-up respondents who were high school students at the time of their first follow-up interview, but experienced a dropout episode during the spring term of 2004 subsequent to their first follow-up participation. Sample members who completed high school early by earning a GED are also accounted for in this variable. Given its comprehensive nature, this variable may be used for national estimates of dropout status during the term when most cohort members were completing high school.\nThe composite variables F2WYLV1\u2013F2WYLV14 are populated for the spring-term 2004 dropouts and early alternative completers who are identified in F2SP04DO. These variables indicate the respondents\u2019 reasons for dropping out of high school prior to or during the spring term of 2004. These composite variables combine the responses provided in the first follow-up dropout and early graduate questionnaires with the responses provided in the High School section of the second follow-up interview. These questions were never asked of the same sample member in both the first and second follow-up interviews. Therefore, inconsistent information from these two sources was not an issue.\nHigh school dropouts as of the second follow-up interview in 2006 are identified in F2HSSTAT. This variable also indicates whether these dropouts reported working toward a GED. The variable is populated for the sample universe: it includes information about both second follow-up respondents and non-respondents.\nThere are two other variables that identify high school dropouts: F2EVERDO and F2DOSTAT. Unlike F2SP04DO and F2HSSTAT which identify dropouts at a particular period of time, these variables identify individuals who had dropped out of school at any one of the data collection points. The data collection points are the first follow-up, the high school transcript, and the second follow-up data collections and the enrollment status updates between data collections. The enrollment status updates did not reference the entire period of time between data collections. In other words, the information on dropout episodes held in these variables is not comprehensive. A dropout episode which began and ended between any two data collection points would not be detected. F2EVERDO simply indicates whether a dropout episode was detected for a given sample member. F2DOSTAT indicates whether there is any evidence of a dropout episode as well as high school completion status as of the second follow-up interview.\n92 In the first follow-up, early graduates were defined as respondents who completed a high school credential on or before March 15, 2004. Since first follow-up nonrespondents were often completing the second follow-up interview 2 years after earning their high school credential, they were unlikely to remember the precise date of that event. Therefore, only month and year of high school completion were collected in the second follow-up interview. Consequently, early alternative completers identified in the second follow-up are defined as those who earned their GED prior to April 2004.\n207\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nThere are several other variables that relate to dropouts and/or GED recipients. F2HSLVDP (and F2HSLVDR on the ECB) indicates when GED recipients and 2006 dropouts last attended high school. F2GEDPRG (and F2GEDOTH on the ECB) indicates the program through which the GED was earned. F2GEDST indicates the state in which the GED was earned. Reasons for completing a GED are provided in F2WYGED1 through F2WYGED6. All of these variables combine data collected in the first follow-up early graduate and dropout questionnaires with data collected in the High School section of the second follow-up interview. Because sample members were never asked to answer these questions twice, the possibility of inconsistent responses from the first and second follow-up interview was prevented. F2GEDPRG, F2GEDOTH, F2GEDST and F2WYGED1-6 are only populated for sample members who reported in their first or second follow-up interview that they had earned a GED. On the other hand, F2EVRGED identifies sample members for whom we have evidence of GED completion from any one of the following sources: first follow-up interview, high school transcript, second follow-up interview and/or data from the American Council on Education (ACE).\nSeveral of the multisource composite variables are related to educational attainment. F2HSSTAT indicates high school completion status as of the second follow-up interview. For those who had completed high school, F2HSCPDP (and F2HSCPDR in the ECB) indicates the high school completion date. F2EDLEVL indicates educational attainment including any postsecondary attendance as reported in the Postsecondary Education section of the interview.\nF2RTYPE categorizes second follow-up respondents into one of six categories based on the timing of any postsecondary enrollment in relation to their high school completion/exit date; standard enrollee, delayer, leaver, delayer-leaver, nonenrollee and high school student. Eligibility for certain portions of the interview is dependent on the respondent\u2019s type (see section 2.5).\nComposite variables integrating second follow-up postsecondary education data with IPEDS data. Second follow-up respondents were asked to name the postsecondary institutions to which they had applied (when they first submitted applications), the institutions where they were admitted, and the institution(s) they had attended. The name and location of each institution as entered into the web interview was matched against a list of postsecondary institutions from IPEDS. The correct match was selected from a display of potential matches. When a selection was made, the institution\u2019s IPEDS unit ID was stored in the ELS:2002 database. The IPEDS data include a wealth of information on postsecondary institutions. A few key characteristics of these institutions such as state, level of offering (i.e., 4 or more years; at least 2, but less than 4 years; less than 2 years), institutional control (i.e., public, private not-for-profit, private for-profit) and sector (e.g., public, 4-year or above; private not-for-profit, 4-year or above) are included in the ELS second follow-up institution data file for convenience (see F2ISTATE, F2ILEVEL, F2ICNTRL, and F2ISECTR). The level of offering, institutional control, and sector of the first postsecondary institution attended (see F2PS1 and section 2.5) are provided on the sample member file (see F2PS1LVL, F2PS1CTR, F2PS1SEC). In a small number of cases, the data in these composite variables were provided by the respondent rather than the IPEDS data. When a match was not found in the IPEDS institution listing, respondents were asked to provide the state, level of offering, and institutional control of the institution. Project staff later attempted to select the appropriate institution from the IPEDS listing. When successful, the IPEDS information was preferred over the respondent\u2019s report of these data. However, if project staff were not able to identify an IPEDS institution for these cases, the information as reported by the\n208\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\nrespondent was provided in the composite variables. The ELS:2002 second follow-up institution file also includes the IPEDS unit ID so analysts may link to the IPEDS data to draw upon other variables of interest (see F2IIPED).\n7.2.2.2 Month-by-Month Enrollment and Employment History Composites\nIn the Postsecondary Education section of the second follow-up interview, all respondents who reported attending a postsecondary institution since high school were asked to provide the months they were enrolled. The month-by-month enrollment at each institution attended, beginning with January 2004, is provided on the postsecondary institution file (see F2I0401\u2013F2I0608). Since some respondents last attended high school prior to 2004, F2IPRE4 indicates the number of months of postsecondary enrollment since high school in 2002 and 2003. Since some respondents had attended more than one postsecondary institution, a series of composite variables was created to indicate enrollment across institutions (see F2PSPRE4, F2PS0401\u2013F2PS0608). Enrollment at any postsecondary institution in a given month is represented as attendance in these composite variables.\nThere is also a series of composite variables indicating month-by-month employment status (F2EM0206\u2013F2EM0608). These composites were built from a series of questions posed to second follow-up respondents who indicated that they had not attended a postsecondary institution and were not currently enrolled in high school. Nonenrollees provided, as applicable, the date they began their first job after high school, the date they left that job, and the date they started their current job. Employment was assumed to be continuous between the start and end date of a job. The months for which employment could not be logically imputed based on these dates were referenced in follow-up questions about employment and labor force status. If the respondent indicated employment during one of these months, the composite variable indicates employment. To determine labor force status, respondents who indicated that they were not working in a given month were asked if they were looking for work at that time. The number and percent of months unemployed since high school completion or exit (or since June 2002 if last attended prior to that date) are also provided (F2NUNEMP and F2PUNEMP).\n7.2.2.3 Composite Variables Constructed From Transcript and External Data Sources: Blended Test Scores/ACT-SAT Concordance\nSAT and ACT test scores were obtained from high school transcripts collected in the ELS:2002 first follow-up in 2005, and from the College Board, and ACT in 2007. These data sources were combined to provide maximum coverage of the subset of the second follow-up sample that had taken either or both of the exams. A concordance between ACT and SAT scores was generated also. If the data source is an ACT score and the composite score is provided in terms of an SAT score, ACT to SAT concordance rules are applied. If the source is SAT data and the composite score is provided in terms of an ACT score, SAT to ACT concordance rules were applied. Concordance rules are explained in the following document: http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/satACT_concordance.pdf.\nThe following SAT and ACT scores are available on the ECB:\n\u2022 TXEESATC\u2014Highest entrance exam composite score (in terms of SAT score); \u2022 TXEEACTC\u2014Highest entrance exam composite score (in terms of ACT score); \u2022 TXEESATM\u2014Highest entrance exam Math score (in terms of SAT score); \u2022 TXACTC\u2014Highest ACT composite score;\n209\n\n\fChapter 7. Data File Contents\n\u2022 TXACTM\u2014Highest ACT Math score; \u2022 TXACTR\u2014Highest ACT Reading score; \u2022 TXACTE\u2014Highest ACT English score; \u2022 TXACTS\u2014Highest ACT Science score; \u2022 TXSATM\u2014Highest SAT Math score; \u2022 TXSATV\u2014Highest SAT Verbal score; and \u2022 TXSATC\u2014Highest SAT composite score. AP exam score composites. AP exam scores were obtained from High School transcripts and College Board. A combination of these data sources is used to provide a score for the test score composites. Composites are available for each AP examination subject. SAT subject test score composites. SAT subject test (SAT II) scores were obtained from high school transcripts and College Board. A combination of these data sources is used to provide a score for the test score composites. Composites are available for each subject test. Obtaining ECB or DAS. Information on obtaining the restricted-use ELS:2002/06 baseyear to second follow-up ECB\u2014as well as information on obtaining the base-year to second follow-up DAS\u2014can be found by reviewing the data products for the study at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch.

Cross-Cohort Comparisons\nA.1 Cross-Cohort Comparison Crosswalks\nThe Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) second follow-up (2006) data can be used in cross-cohort (intercohort) comparisons to earlier National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) high school cohorts at a comparable point in their educational and occupational careers. Specifically, the following time series comparisons may be made:\n\u2022 High school seniors 2 years out of high school: National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72) (1974), the High School and Beyond (HS&B) senior cohort (1982), HS&B sophomore cohort (1984), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) (1994), and ELS:2002 (2006).\n\u2022 High school sophomores 4 years later: HS&B (1984), NELS:88 (1994), and ELS:2002 (2006). Such comparisons may encompass dropouts, students, or both.\n\u2022 In addition to capturing cross-sections, each at a single time point, one may compare various panels to capture longitudinal intercohort changes. Viable panels could be drawn from the data of seniors 2 years later (1972\u20131974 vs. 1980\u20131982, 1982\u20131984, 1992\u20131994, and 2004\u20132006; or the trajectories of sophomores over a 4-year period (1980\u20131984 vs. 1990\u20131994 and 2002\u20132006). Much more extended longitudinal comparisons between ELS:2002 and NELS:88 and HS&B can presumably be made in the future.1\nAlthough the four studies2 have been designed to produce comparable results, there are also differences between them that may affect the comparability as well as the precision of estimates. Analysts should be aware of and take into account the factors discussed below, as they pertain to assessment results, questionnaire content, archival records data (such as academic transcripts), and other factors (such as differences in eligibility, sample design, response rates, and so on).3\nA.1.1 Comparability of Test Scores\nWhile some cross-cohort comparison of assessment results is possible, it is limited by two factors: first, different subjects were tested at different points in time; and second, not all of\n1 For example, starting with high school 9th-grade transcripts in 1979 and 1989, proceeding through the high school years with test and questionnaire data as well as transcript information, and tapping postsecondary transcripts for a period of about 8.5 years past high school (to the fall of 1990 and 2000), the 11-year educational trajectories of the postsecondary-bound portions of the HS&B and NELS:88 cohorts over this critical transition period could be compared. The ELS:2002 cohort could be added as a third comparison point, at the end of study.\n2 A fifth NCES high school cohort longitudinal study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, is currently in its planning and development phase. While its design will differ\u2014data collection at fall of ninth grade, spring of eleventh grade, and continuing into the postsecondary years\u2014it will offer some scope for comparison of trends in expectations, values and beliefs across the transition period from high school to postsecondary education and the labor force.\n3 For a detailed discussion of cross-cohort comparability issues in the base year and first follow-up, as well as a crosswalk of comparable items, see Ingels et al. (2005), appendix H. For a broad discussion of comparability issues across all four high school cohorts, see Ingels (2004). For a detailed discussion of comparability issues in the transcript component, see Bozick et al. (2006), appendix A. Many of the content differences between similar but not identical items across the three sophomore year questionnaires are highlighted in the recent trend report by Cahalan et al. (2006). Dalton et al. (2007) illustrate use of transcript data to analyze math and science coursetaking trends from HS&B through ELS:2002, while Ingels and Dalton (2007, forthcoming) compare seniors in the period 1972\u20132004.\nA-3\n\n\fAppendix A.

(2005).\n\nTest linkages of some variety have been effected to certain external data sources such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (specifically, these linkages are concordances, in which ELS:2002 test results have been put on the NAEP or PISA scale), as well as across some points of comparison within the four longitudinal high school cohort studies (these linkages are based on anchor [common item] equating). Table A-2 shows tests for which there is a linkage. However, even when tests have not been placed on the same scale, one may still use an effect size metric to examine group differences or change in the position of one group relative to another over time. (For examples of such analysis, see Green, Dugoni, and Ingels 1995, and Hedges and Nowell 1995).\n\nTable A-2.

Cross-Cohort Comparisons\nA.1.2 Comparability of Questionnaire Content\nNo item crosswalk has been created for the second follow-up questionnaire data. Although the ELS:2002 second follow-up has collected data that are very similar to the data obtained by NELS:88 (and HS&B and NLS:72), many of the specific data elements for 2006 have been changed in various ways. Data users who would like to compare ELS:2002 second follow-up results with those of the NELS:88 third follow-up (1994) should examine the questionnaire content information provided in this manual in conjunction with the NELS:88 computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) instrument code (appendix A in Haggerty et al. 1996) or the 1994 base questionnaire (appendix Q in Ingels et al. 1994).\nA.1.3 Comparability of High School Transcripts\nComparisons may be drawn between ELS:2002, NELS:88, and HS&B high school transcript data, in terms of Carnegie units earned in academic coursetaking (English, mathematics, science, social studies, computer science, and foreign language), as well as specific courses completed in academic (and other) subjects. For an example of such analyses, covering coursetaking from 1982 to 2004, see Dalton et al. (2007). Comparisons may also be drawn to the NAEP high school transcript studies.4\nA sample design difference between HS&B on the one hand and NELS:88 and ELS:2002 on the other has implications for comparisons of the transcripts of seniors across the studies. The HS&B sophomore cohort was not freshened in 1982 to ensure a truly representative senior cohort; however, the NELS:88 and ELS:2002 cohorts were freshened to give spring-term seniors who were not sophomores or not in the country 2 years previously some chance of selection into the study. If one wants to compare a spring senior cohort, or the subset of spring seniors who in fact graduated (say with a regular or honors diploma), then HS&B provides a biased sample. However, the bias is comparatively small, and represents, from the point of view of trends in coursetaking (such as more advanced coursetaking over time) a conservative bias that understates the actual amount of positive change. This matter is discussed in depth in Dalton et al. (2007).\nAnalysts interested in comparing coursetaking patterns should examine the Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) codes available in each study. The CSSC codes are the same across studies, thus facilitating direct comparisons. However, the list has evolved and certain subject areas (for example, computer science) have changed accordingly. For some analyses, users may wish to construct measures in a variety of ways to ensure that their findings are robust with respect to different variable specifications. In addition, analysts should consider changes in subject areas over time when conducting time trend analyses and interpreting findings.\nOne obstacle to precise comparison is that some students were excluded from HS&B and from NELS:88, owing to severe disabilities or language barriers. No students were excluded\n4 NAEP is a spring-defined cohort. To ensure a spring-to-spring basis for comparing ELS:2002 transcripts to NAEP transcripts, the graduating class should be defined (using the high school exit status variable for subsetting) as those who graduated between January 1 and August 31, 2004. Apart from compatibility with NAEP grade cohort definitions, this reference period also best reflects the ELS:2002 (and, adjusted to year, NELS:88) sample designs, since sample freshening is keyed to the spring term. For example, 2003 fall term (or 1991 fall term for NELS:88) 12th-graders who were not 10th-graders in the United States 2 years before and who graduated prior to the spring term are not represented in freshening, from which they are systematically excluded.\nA-5\n\n\fAppendix A. Cross-Cohort Comparisons\n\nfrom the ELS:2004 transcript component (or from the NAEP transcript studies). However, if one restricts the analysis sample from each survey to a subset of sample members who were high school graduates with a regular or honors diploma and had a complete set of transcripts, then HS&B and NELS:88 will be roughly equivalent in sample to the NAEP and ELS:2002 transcript samples (see Hoachlander 1991 or Ingels and Taylor 1995 on the use of this filter, which defines a complete transcript as one that records 16 or more Carnegie units, with a positive, nonzero number of credits completed in English). However, even when no adjustment is made for difference in inclusion or exclusion, the impact on estimates is small and in a predictable direction (for a detailed appraisal of the magnitude and implications of sample exclusion in HS&B and NELS:88, see Ingels 1996). Table A-3 shows eligibility and exclusion for NCES high school academic transcript collections by data source.\n\nTable A-3.

(2005).\n\nA.1.4 Other Factors Affecting Comparability\nThough the studies were designed to be as comparable as possible, caution must nonetheless be exercised in comparing NLS:72, HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 data. School and student response rates differed somewhat, as did item response rates. Missing item data have been statistically imputed in ELS:2002 (for key variables only), though not in the prior studies (the impact of imputation on comparability across studies is explored in Ingels et al. 2005, NCES 2006-344, appendix C). Likewise, missing test scores have been imputed in ELS:2002. Eligibility rules were sometimes somewhat different. The earlier studies used a weighting cell approach for nonresponse adjustments in weighting; ELS:2002 used propensity modeling. (However, methodological work conducted in ELS:2002\u2014see appendix K\u2014suggests this difference would have little impact and should not be a threat to comparability.) There were differences in mode and precise timing of survey administration. The technology of data collection has also changed considerably over the years, especially for out-of-school cohorts. These data were first collected by paper-and-pencil questionnaires, which were replaced first with computerized telephone and personal interviews, and then in the ELS:2002 second followup almost completely by web self-administrations. The extent of the impact of mode effects has not been measured in field test experiments or by other devices, although every effort has been made to construct questionnaires that minimize the potential for mode differences. Sociolinguistic changes in the United States over this 32-year period may also affect comparability, and even standard classification variables, such as race classifications, have subtly changed over time.\n\nA-6\n\n\fAppendix A.

The information found in this appendix is based on the ELS:2002/06 ECB (NCES 2007-346). The third section provides general instructions on how to get started using the ELS:2002/06 data and an orientation to the software that can be used to manipulate the data. The final section contains a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that are based on past user inquiries to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the responses.\nB.1 Introduction to ELS:2002\nB.1.1 Overview\nELS:2002 represents a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they proceed through high school and into postsecondary education or their careers. The 2002 sophomore cohort (augmented by an overlapping 2004 senior cohort) is being followed, initially at 2-year intervals, to collect policyrelevant data about educational processes and outcomes, especially as such data pertain to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and high school effects on students\u2019 access to, and success in, postsecondary education and the workforce.\nIn the spring-term 2002 base year of the study, over 15,000 high school sophomores were surveyed and assessed in a national sample of 752 public and private high schools with 10th grades. Their parents, teachers, principals, and librarians were surveyed as well. In addition, cognitive tests in mathematics and reading were administered to these students.\nIn the first of the follow-ups, base-year students who remained in their base-year schools were resurveyed and tested (in mathematics) 2 years later, along with a freshening sample that makes the study representative of spring 2004 high school seniors nationwide. Students who had transferred to a different school, had switched to a homeschool environment, graduated early, or who had dropped out were administered a customized questionnaire tailored to their first followup status. School administrators at the participating schools were surveyed once again. Academic transcripts were collected in the winter of 2004\u20132005; student transcript and course catalogue/offerings data have been added to the ELS:2002 database.\nThe second follow-up data collection took place in 2006, when most sample members were 2 years out of high school, and maps the transition of the majority of cohort members out of secondary education. For the cohort as a whole, the second follow-up obtained information that will permit researchers and policymakers to better understand issues of postsecondary educational access and choice. Thus, a major focus of the second follow-up interview was the postsecondary decision-making process as reflected in applications to college and initial postsecondary enrollment histories. Additionally, it followed students who did not enroll in college in the 2-year period immediately after high school, and thus provides information on\nB-3\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nreasons students did not attend. It also provides information on the transition of non-collegebound students into the labor force.\nThe second follow-up survey used a web-enabled system to program the 2006 questionnaire for self-administration. The same electronic instrument was used for interviewer administration as well, through CATI and CAPI instruments. (The self-administered and interviewer-administered survey instruments are indistinguishable in terms of screen text and skip patterns in each of the three modes.) The advantages of a web-based instrument include real-time data capture and access, including data editing in parallel with data collection.\nB.1.2 Major Features\nThe major features of ELS:2002 include the integration of student, dropout, parent, teacher, and school data; the initial concentration on a 10th-grade student cohort with the same individuals surveyed repeatedly over time; the addition of a 12th-grade cohort 2 years later; the inclusion of supplementary components such as a course offerings and high school transcript study; and the design linkages to previous longitudinal studies (the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 [NLS:72], High School and Beyond [HS&B], and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 [NELS:88]) and other current studies such as the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).\nB.1.3 Research Issues\nApart from helping to describe the status of high school students and their schools, ELS:2002 will provide information to help address a number of key policy and research questions. Part of its aim is to inform decision makers, educational practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time and the effects of various elements of the system on the lives of the individuals who pass through it. By design, for most purposes, the basic unit of analysis is the student, with the other components providing contextual information. The second follow-up (2006) data mark, for most sample members, the transition from high school to postsecondary education or the world of work. Issues that can be addressed with ELS:2002 data include\n\u2022 students\u2019 academic growth in mathematics;\n\u2022 the process of dropping out of high school; \u2022 the association between family background and the home education support system\nand students\u2019 educational success;\n\u2022 the features of effective schools;\n\u2022 the relationship between coursetaking choices and success in the high school years (and thereafter); and\n\u2022 the distribution of educational opportunities as registered in the distinctive school experiences and performance of students from various subgroups. Such subgroups include the following:\n\u2212 students in public and private high schools; \u2212 language minority students;\nB-4\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\n\u2212 students with disabilities; \u2212 students in urban, suburban, and rural settings; \u2212 students in different regions of the country; \u2212 students from upper, middle, and lower socioeconomic status levels; \u2212 male and female high school students; and \u2212 students from different racial or ethnic groups. With completion of high school, and starting with the 2006 round, new topics can be addressed, including \u2022 the later educational and labor market activities of high school dropouts; \u2022 the transition of those who directly enter the labor market; \u2022 access to, and choice of, postsecondary educational institutions; and \u2022 adult roles, such as family formation and civic participation. Further in the future, ELS:2002 data may support analyses of further issues: \u2022 persistence in postsecondary education; \u2022 baccalaureate attainment; and \u2022 early social and economic rates of return on education. These research and policy issues can be investigated at several distinct levels of analysis. The overall scope and design of the study provide for the following four analytical levels: \u2022 cross-sectional profiles of the nation\u2019s high school sophomores (2002), seniors (2004), and post-sophomore-year dropouts (2004); \u2022 longitudinal analysis (including examination of life course changes); \u2022 intercohort comparisons with American high school students of earlier decades; and \u2022 international comparisons: U.S. 15-year-olds to 15-year-olds in other nations, including postsecondary and other longitudinal outcomes for the United States that can be related to scale scores in mathematics and reading from PISA. Since there are a number of content and design similarities between ELS:2002 and its predecessor, NELS:88, researchers are strongly encouraged to examine the NELS:88 annotated bibliography found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/Bibliography.asp. Although it has not yet grown to the dimensions of the NELS:88 literature, a bibliography is also maintained for ELS:2002 at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/Bibliography.asp. The NELS:88 and ELS:2002 bibliographies, arranged alphabetically by author by year, provide abstracts for journal articles, books, conference presentations, reports, and dissertations that have used the NELS:88 data. They were derived from computer searches of online bibliographic databases such as Dissertation Abstracts, ERIC, Psychological Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, and Major Papers, as well as the NCES website.\nB-5\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nAlthough the ELS:2002 database supports a wide range of analyses, ELS:2002 does have both substantive and methodological limitations. Because of increasing concern with burden on schools and greater restrictions on the collection of sensitive data, the base year and first followup ELS:2002 questionnaires and test battery reflect a reduced number both of items and policy areas. As with any data collection effort, there are design constraints (e.g., ELS:2002 did not sample regional or area vocational schools; the study did not test dropouts in 2004) and limitations of the data (e.g., small cell sizes for certain groups of individuals) that must be taken into consideration when planning analyses that use ELS:2002.\nB.1.4 Must-Read Publications Before a researcher attempts to use the ELS:2002 data files, it is strongly suggested that\ntime be spent reading the ELS:2002 user\u2019s documentation that references the ELS:2002 baseyear, first, and second follow-up studies. The following list of documents will provide researchers with much of the information that they will need to understand the complexities of the ELS:2002 data files. In addition, several substantive reports provide a base from which researchers can identify potential research topics from the ELS:2002 data files. These reports are also listed below.

The following waves of ELS:2002 data are included:\n2002\u2014Base Year (BY) 2004\u2014First Follow-up (F1) (including transcripts) 2006\u2014Second Follow-up (F2) Those who do not require direct access to microdata may also be interested in NCES\u2019s ELS:2002 web-based Data Analysis System (DAS).\nB.2.1 Dataset: ELS:2002 Base Year (2002) Through Second Follow-up (2006) The restricted-use student \u201cmegafile\u201d contains about 16,200 cases and includes all\nrespondents who participated in either initial wave (base year and/or first follow-up), with the exception of a handful of cases that have been removed from the longitudinal file owing to death, study withdrawal, or continuing ineligibility. The student megafile includes base-year questionnaire-incapables who became eligible respondents in the first follow-up as well as freshened 12th-grade respondents (see Ingels et al. 2005 for a description of base-year questionnaire-incapables and freshened 12th-grade students). Data for each student for 2002 (base year), 2004 (first follow-up), and 2006 (second follow-up) can be thought of as one continuous record that contains the following sections:\n1. universe and cross-round student status variables; 2. base-year composite variables, assessment scores, and weights; 3. first follow-up composite variables, assessment scores, and weights; 4. first follow-up student high school transcript variables; 5. second follow-up composite variables and weights; 6. base-year student questionnaire variables; 7. first follow-up student questionnaire variables; 8. first follow-up dropout questionnaire variables;\nB-8\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\n9. first follow-up transfer questionnaire variables; 10. first follow-up early graduate questionnaire variables; 11. first follow-up new participant supplement variables; 12. second follow-up questionnaire variables:\n12a. high school; 12b. postsecondary education; 12c. employment; 12d. community engagement; 13. base-year parent variables; 14. base-year teacher variables (both English and math); 15. base-year school composites at the student level; 16. first follow-up school composites at the student level; 17. base-year school administrator questionnaire variables at the student level; 18. base-year school library questionnaire variables at the student level; and 19. base-year school facilities checklist variables at the student level. The restricted-use school megafile includes approximately 2,000 schools identified as base-year-responding schools, first follow-up new and \u201cconvenience\u201d schools, and schools identified in the transcript component. The school file contains the following sections: 1. base-year school composites and weight at the school level; 2. first follow-up school composites at the school level; 3. base-year school administrator questionnaire variables at the school level; 4. base-year school library questionnaire variables at the school level; 5. base-year school facilities checklist variables at the school level; and 6. first follow-up course offerings variables at the school level. The restricted use ECB includes the following additional sections that are linkable to the student megafile: 1. high school transcript student course file; 2. high school transcript course offering file; 3. postsecondary institutional file; and 4. ancillary records data sources (e.g., ACT and SAT, postsecondary federal grant and loan files, GED test results). Not all sections will apply to every student. Data for each section is dependent on the sample member\u2019s historical status. For example, a second follow-up respondent who was freshened in the first follow-up will have no base-year student data. In another example, a student who is in school and in the 12th grade in 2004 will not have any data for other first follow-up instruments: dropout, early graduate, or homeschooled.\nB-9\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nB.2.2 Description of ELS:2002 Electronic Codebooks The dataset described above is integrated within NCES\u2019s Electronic Codebook (ECB)\nsystem. The ECB is a tool that allows the user to browse through the lists of ELS:2002 variables, variable descriptions, and frequencies.\nThe ECB allows the user to search a list of variables based on key words or labels; tag (i.e., select) variables for analysis; generate SAS and SPSS syntax for system files; produce printed codebooks of selected variables; import tag files; access data files for extraction; and create system files for use in statistical software packages like SPSS and SAS. See the ELS:2002 ECB guidebook on the CD-ROM for a full description of the functions of the ECB.\nB.2.3 CD-ROM The datasets, ECB, and supporting documentation for the ELS:2002/06 base-year to\nsecond follow-up data collection are located on one CD-ROM (NCES 2007-346). This data product contains\n\u2022 ELS:2002 base-year (2002), first follow-up (2004) (including transcript), and second follow-up (2006) data;\n\u2022 ECB software (discussed above); \u2022 this quick guide; \u2022 an ECB guidebook; and \u2022 electronic copies of the ELS:2002 documentation.\nB.3 Getting Started\nThis section addresses: 1. What you need to know to get started using the ELS:2002/06 data; 2. How to navigate through the data; and 3. How to generate program syntax to manipulate the data.\nB.3.1 Getting Started Using the ELS:2002/06 Data Minimum Requirements 1. Obtain a CD-ROM with the ELS:2002/06 base-year through second follow-up data. This will require a licensing agreement with NCES. 2. Have access to a computer running Microsoft Windows with 5.0 MB of storage space. 3. Develop an analytical strategy for working with data. The sheer number of variables available in ELS:2002/06 and the multilevel and longitudinal nature of the database make an analytical strategy very important.\nB-10\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nThe ELS:2002/06 CD-ROM contains three folders and two files in the Root folder that are described below:\n1. The Root folder includes the files QuickGuide.pdf, HELP.pdf, and the folders ECBW, Report, and Tag.\n2. The ECBW folder includes the data files (student, school, transcript, and ancillary student records), documentation for data files, and an installation program (setup.exe) for the ELS:2002/06 ECB.\n3. The Report folder includes an electronic copy of the ELS:2002 Base-Year to Second Follow-up Data File Documentation, the Base-Year to First Follow-up Data File Documentation, and the Base-Year Data File User\u2019s Manual.\n4. The Tag folder includes three \u201ctag\u201d files that provide the user with tags of critical variables (e.g., IDs, stratification variables, and design weights), which can be imported into an ECB session and used as the basis for producing SPSS or SAS card files. Basically, tag files are simply a subset of variables from the entire set of variables available on the ECB. Given the large number of variables on the ECB, tag files allow users to focus on those variables they select instead of having to sift through the entire ECB each time.\nLoading and Using the ECB\n1. Install the ECB:\n\u2212 Insert the ELS:2002/06 CD into the CD-ROM drive.\n\u2212 Click the Windows START menu button, and select RUN.\n\u2212 Type: D:\\ECBW\\Setup.exe (if your CD-ROM drive is not D, enter the appropriate drive letter).\n\u2212 Click on OK to run the setup program, and follow the directions on your screen.\n2. The user is ready to use the ECB once it is installed. By clicking on each \u201chot\u201d key on the tool bar found at the top of the ECB screen, the user will quickly understand the structure of the file and the power provided by the ECB to produce data files. At this point, the user should consult the \u201cElectronic Codebook Help Guide\u201d available on the CD-ROM for a specific overview of the ECB functions. (This is a file named HELP.PDF.)\n3. Examine the frequencies available for each variable on the ECB. By examining these data descriptions, the ELS:2002 user will begin to appreciate the complexity of collecting data from human subjects (legitimate values, legitimate skips, refusals, etc.). It is important to realize that some respondents:\n\u2212 did not respond to the entire instrument; \u2212 skipped individual items;\n\u2212 refused to complete selected items;\n\u2212 did not reach the end of the questionnaire; \u2212 completed abbreviated versions of the instrument;\nB-11\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\n\u2212 made illegal skips; and \u2212 responded outside predefined valid ranges.\nB.3.2 Navigating the ECB and Identifying a Model and Tagging Variables for Analysis\n1. Define the base population for analysis and whether longitudinal or cross-sectional analysis is required. That is, what group will this research try to generalize to (e.g., high school seniors, dropouts)?\n2. Develop a conceptual model. What does prior research suggest is happening with the data (e.g., characteristics of students who are likely to drop out of school)?\n3. Determine the predictor variables (e.g., disadvantaged background, low test scores), intervening processes (e.g., courses completed, teacher qualifications), and outcomes (e.g., dropping out, return to high school, completion of GED, postsecondary entry) that can be used to explain the model.\n4. Determine which components (variables) of your model can be addressed with ELS:2002/06 variables. If multiple sources of the same item are available on the data files, choose the one believed to be most reliable and valid. If the variables that the researcher needs are not available on the ELS:2002/06 files, he or she should consider merging variables from other sources to which links have been supplied (e.g., Census, Common Core of Data).\n5. Rethink the original model. If the variables contained on the ELS:2002/06 data files cannot be used to study the original model, rethink the model and either modify the model or choose another dataset.\n6. The user can select or \u201ctag\u201d the variables of interest by clicking on the \u201ctag box\u201d next to each variable.\n7. The analyst must also remember to choose the appropriate weights and flags for the population of interest. In each data file, flags can be selected to identify a particular part of the population. For example, flags are available to identify whether a student was a dropout at the first follow-up. Weights are variables placed on the dataset to compensate for the unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for nonresponse. When used with flags, weights allow the analyst to make generalizations about the national populations represented by the various ELS:2002 samples. When weights are not used and/or when a flag is used inappropriately, the estimates generated will not be representative of the population.\nB.3.3 Generating SAS or SPSS Program Code and Codebook Text\n1. After tagging the variables of interest, go to \u201cFile\u201d and then \u201cOutput.\u201d\n2. Select the program (e.g., SPSS to generate SPSS program code).\n3. Specify directory and name of program code file.\n4. Select appropriate button in \u201cConfirmation\u201d box.\n5. To view the program code, select \u201cFile\u201d and then \u201cView Output.\u201d\nB-12\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\n6. The program code can then be opened in the appropriate software (e.g., SPSS) to generate a working system file and run analyses. It may be necessary to modify the program slightly (check for \u201cexecute\u201d statements, period locations, and file names). The code should identify the ASCII data file location, which will be the CD-ROM.\nB.4 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About ELS:2002\nSince the first release of ELS:2002 data and with the experience from the NELS:88 and past longitudinal studies, NCES staff members have received many questions regarding \u201cproper techniques\u201d for working with the data. In this document, these questions (along with NCES responses) have been categorized into topical areas and presented as a guide. It is hoped that the responses will help users avoid the most commonly made mistakes in working with this important data source. This document is meant to serve as an introduction or supplement to, not a replacement for, the base-year to second follow-up data file documentation. To help the data user identify specific topics of interest, questions and responses have been grouped into the following categories:\nGeneral and Background Questions Who can I contact from the National Center for Education Statistics/Department of Education about the ELS:2002 study? What are some of the terms that I should be familiar with in dealing with ELS:2002? What are the interrelationships among the separate ELS:2002/06 files? How is ELS:2002 related to prior NCES longitudinal studies?\nSampling In simple terms, explain how the ELS:2002 school and student samples were selected. Whom do these schools and students represent? Did ELS:2002 test the same group of students through the first follow-up study? Does the ELS:2002 sample design support any state-level analyses?\nWeights What cohorts does the ELS:2002 dataset represent and how do I subset these groups? What are these flags and weights? Why do we need to use weights with the ELS:2002 data? Why would unweighted estimates not be representative? Which weights and flags should I use in my analyses? Thanks for the description of the weights, but what does this mean in practical terms?\nDesign Effects Why do I need to take account of design effects when I do my significance testing?\nB-13\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nElectronic Codebooks When I receive my ELS:2002/06 CD, what are some of the steps that I should follow to check out my CD?\nComposite (Derived) Variables What are the advantages of using composite variables in my analyses?\nModel Building How do I select variables for a working data file?

Or contact:\nJohn Wirt (202) 502-7478 John.Wirt@ed.gov Question: What are some of the terms that I should be familiar with in dealing with ELS:2002? Response: Knowledge of the following terms will help the user in reading through the following questions and responses. Additional information on these and other terms can also be found in the ELS:2002 glossary in the appendix to the Base-Year to Second Followup Data File Documentation. \u2212 Bias: respondents differ from nonrespondents; \u2212 Cohort: factor in common (year of birth or grade); \u2212 Cross-section: represent events at a single point in time; \u2212 Design effects: a measure of sample efficiency, typically related to the precision of estimates; \u2212 ECB: electronic codebook; \u2212 Freshening: adding students to original sample during later waves of data collection to create new grade-representative cohorts (Students at the base-year sample school who were enrolled in the 12th grade in spring of 2004 but were not\nB-14\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nin 10th grade in the United States during the spring of 2002 were given a chance of selection into the ELS:2002 sample. In spring term 2002, such students may have been out of the country, been enrolled in school in the United States in a grade other than 10th, had an extended illness or injury, been homeschooled, been institutionalized, or temporarily dropped out of school. These students comprised the first follow-up \u201cfreshening\u201d sample.);\n\u2212 IRT: Item Response Theory (permits vertical scaling of assessments, e.g., from grade 10 to 12, and lateral scaling as well, e.g., ELS:2002 results placed on the NELS:88 scale);\n\u2212 Longitudinal: similar measurements at multiple points in time;\n\u2212 Panel: surveying same individuals across time; and\n\u2212 Weights: used to produce population estimates based on samples, or in other words, when one respondent represents a number of others in the population.\nQuestion: What are the interrelationships among the separate ELS:2002/06 files?\nResponse: Using common IDs, the individual data files comprising ELS:2002/06 have been merged with each other to form data files containing student (questionnaire, test, transcript), parent, school, library, facilities, and teacher data. By design, the basic unit of analysis for most ELS:2002/06 analyses will be the student. Under this premise, the school administrator, course offerings, library, facilities, parent, and teacher data can be thought of as providing contextual (e.g., background, school characteristics, \u201copportunity to learn\u201d) data.\nBecause the base year of ELS:2002 involved the participation of 752 randomly selected schools from across the United States that contained 10th-graders, the 10thgrade school sample can be used (in conjunction with the 2002 school weight, BYSCHWT) as a standalone file in which the school is the basic unit of analysis. The first follow-up school file, however, is not nationally representative of high schools with 12th grades, and therefore no school weight has been generated for them. These schools were not selected by a probabilistic method but, rather, entered ELS:2002 by virtue of containing students who participated in the ELS:2002 base-year study.\nUniverse variables (e.g., F2UNIV1) have been constructed to provide researchers with a history of the involvement of each student over the base-year and first followup studies of ELS:2002. These variables show the status of each student during the two data collection periods. For example, a student respondent in 2002 may become a dropout respondent in the first follow-up 2004 data collection. Universe variables can be used to subset cases to desired populations. Universe variables effectively limit the working data file to respondents who fit selected criteria (e.g., dropouts). The universe variables can be found at the beginning of the ELS:2002 data files.\nQuestion: How is ELS:2002 related to prior NCES longitudinal studies?\nResponse: All of the student and dropout questionnaires employed in the base-year and first follow-up studies of ELS:2002 were designed to provide continuity and consistency with earlier education longitudinal studies.\nB-15\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nSpecific items in the ELS:2002 instruments replicate items appearing in NELS:88, HS&B, or NLS:72. The comparability and consistency of items across these three datasets allow for (but are not limited to) the execution of the following cross-cohort analyses:\n\u2212 ELS:2002 2002 sophomores can be compared to NELS:88 1990 sophomores and HS&B 1980 sophomores;\n\u2212 ELS:2002 2002 sophomores 2 years later (that is, in 2004) can be compared to NELS:88 1990 sophomores 2 years later (that is, in 1992) and HS&B 1980 sophomores 2 years later in 1982;\n\u2212 ELS:2002 2002 sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 2004) can be compared to NELS:88 1990 sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 1992) and HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 1982);\n\u2212 ELS:2002 2004 seniors can be compared to NELS:88 1992 seniors, HS&B 1980 seniors, and NLS:72 1972 seniors; and\n\u2212 the transition of ELS:2006 participants out of high school can be compared to the transition of earlier cohorts: seniors 2 years later can be compared using the time points 1974, 1982, 1984, and 1994. Sophomores 4 years later can also be compared, as well as sophomore cohort dropouts 4 years later.\nSampling\nQuestion: In simple terms, explain how the ELS:2002 school and student samples were selected.\nResponse: Base year: The ELS:2002 schools were selected from a universe file of approximately 25,000 public and private 10th-grade schools across the United States. For the 752 public and private schools with 10th grades that were sampled and agreed to participate in ELS:2002, complete 10th-grade rosters were produced for each school. From this roster, approximately 25 students per school, on average, were randomly selected, with Asian and Hispanic students selected at a higher rate than others.\nFirst follow-up: Prior to the first follow-up data collection period, approximately 8 percent of the students moved to another school. Because of these transitions, students had to be traced to their new schools. In addition, school dropouts, early graduates, and homeschoolers needed to be identified, contacted, and convinced to participate in the follow-up. New (freshened) students needed to be added to the sample so that the first follow-up data would be representative of high school seniors. There was neither subsampling out nor freshening in for the second follow-up sample in 2006, though there was some sample attrition owing to factors such as death or withdrawal from the study.\nQuestion: Whom do these schools and students represent?\nResponse: The 752 participating schools in the base year represent the approximately 25,000 public and private schools in the United States in 2002 that had a 10th grade. The 15,362 ELS:2002 base-year student participants represent about 3 million 10thgraders attending schools in 2002, with the exception of Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, special schools for students with disabilities, area vocational schools that do\nB-16\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nnot enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel serving overseas.\nIn the first follow-up sample, 14,989 members participated, representing approximately 3.5 million students, dropouts, homeschoolers, and early graduates. Of these, 13,420 sample members were students in the 12th grade, representing about 3 million seniors in public and private schools in 2004.\nELS:2002/06 data can be used to examine the following groups:\n\u2212 10th-grade students 4 years later (2006);\n\u2212 12th-grade students 2 years later (2006); and\n\u2212 2002 sophomore cohort dropouts (as of 2004) 2 years later (2006).\nQuestion: Did ELS:2002 follow the same group of students through the first and second followup studies?\nResponse: The same individuals are followed over multiple waves. Although the major objective of ELS:2002 was to follow a group of 10th-graders, there were modifications to the sample as it progressed between 2002 and 2004. The additions included the augmentations of the base-year sample with freshened seniors in 2004, and those base-year questionnaire-incapable respondents whose eligibility status had changed 2 years later (for example, a student whose English language proficiency was not sufficient for participation in 2002 might have improved in English language skills enough to be included in 2004).\nFreshened students: The ELS:2002 sample was freshened with additional 12thgraders in 2004. These students were added so that the sample would be nationally representative of seniors in 2004. Students who were freshened into the sample did not have the opportunity to be selected into the sample during the 10th grade (e.g., they may have been out of the country or out of grade sequence).\nBase-year questionnaire-incapable students: In addition to freshened students, baseyear questionnaire-incapable sample members were reassessed to see if they could take part in the first follow-up study. Base-year questionnaire-incapable students were individuals for whom it was determined that their lack of English language proficiency, or physical or mental disability, made it unduly difficult for them to complete self-administered questionnaires or cognitive tests, or who would not be able to produce a valid assessment of their abilities and school experiences. These students were included in the restricted-use data only as part of the expanded sample, and contextual information was collected (school administrator surveys, and when possible, parent surveys and teacher surveys). These students were reevaluated during the first follow-up study. Those whose status had changed (e.g., they had become proficient in English) such that they could participate were included as respondents.\nSecond follow-up: There was no subsampling or freshening in 2006. A few students were removed from the longitudinal file owing to factors such as death, withdrawal from the study, or continued questionnaire-incapable status. Double nonrespondents (i.e., participated in neither base year nor first follow-up) were not pursued.\nB-17\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nQuestion: I understand how ELS:2002 was designed to support a national level of analysis, and subnational analyses at the Census region or division level. However, does the ELS:2002 sample design support any state-level analyses?\nResponse: In the base year a handful of states (California, Florida, New York, and Texas) had state-representative samples of public schools (though not of private). The rule of thumb that has traditionally been used in the high school cohort studies is that a minimum of 30 schools will be required, if a state sample is to be called representative.\nFor the several states for which there are state-representative samples, it is possible to conduct independent cross-sectional analyses of base-year schools or students at the state level. Because of the relatively small size of even the largest state samples, standard errors will be accordingly higher than for the national sample, and crossclassification by various subgroups may sometimes result in comparatively small, or even unstable (from an estimation perspective), cell sizes. An additional caveat is that no poststratification or other weighting adjustment has been made to ensure that estimates inflate with full accuracy to the overall or subgroup 10th-grade enrollments at the state level. A nonresponse bias analysis has not been conducted at the state level, so some bias in state-level estimates may exist. This is especially true if any states have patterns of nonresponse different from the national patterns. It therefore would be advisable to evaluate the quality of the ELS:2002 estimates and their adequacy for the intended analytic purpose, by comparing some key ELS:2002 state estimates both overall and by subpopulation with other sources, when available, to see whether they are plausibly close to each other.\nIt is also possible to analyze the student samples 2 years later, that is, the state\u2019s spring 2002 high school sophomores in 2004. Some of the 2002 sophomores are likely to have transferred to a school in another state by 2004; these out-of-state transfers can be identified on the ELS:2002 database. Some analysts may wish to generalize at the state level about spring 2004 seniors, or actual spring/summer 2004 graduates within a state. A state-representative base-year sophomore cohort does not necessarily make for a state-representative senior cohort. The ELS:2002 sample does to some degree \u201cupdate\u201d the sophomore sample: sophomores who drop out or who are held back are identified in the dataset; the senior year freshening procedure in the base year schools at the time of the first follow-up captures a sample of students who were not in the 2002 sampling frame by virtue of being other than 10th-graders or outside the country; and while there was no state-level freshening, there is a sort of \u201cnatural freshening\u201d within the national borders in that students remain in the sample as they transfer to schools across state lines. While conceptually these factors contribute the elements of a state-level senior sample, weighting adjustments have not been made specifically at the state level, and to this extent estimates may be affected and in particular are likely to be less accurate than if a state-based adjustment had been made to the weights.\nIn sum, the four most populous states have state-representative samples in that there are sufficient public school and student sample sizes for some level of analysis. However, specific measures were not taken during freshening or weighting to ensure accurate state estimates or full state-level coverage of seniors. The study was\nB-18\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\ndesigned to be a national-level study; any level of state estimation is an extra benefit, and a benefit to be exploited with caution.\nWeights\nQuestion: What groups does the ELS:2002 dataset represent and how do I subset these groups?\nResponse: The ELS:2002 data represent many different populations (e.g., 10th-graders in 2002; seniors in 2004; 10th-graders who were still in school at 12th grade; 10th-graders who dropped out of school by 12th grade). These groups can be identified through use of flags and analysis weights. (Analysis weights are also known as nonresponseadjusted weights, and as final weights. They are to be distinguished from raw weights [or design weights], which have not been adjusted to compensate for patterns of nonresponse. Only analysis or final weights appear on the ELS:2002/06 data files.)\nQuestion: What are these flags and weights?\nResponse: Flags are variables that were put onto the ELS:2002 files to indicate status at a given point in time (e.g., dropout in the first follow-up) or indicate a permanent sample status (e.g., member of the sophomore cohort, member of the senior cohort). Universe variables can be used like flags, that is, to subset for analysis. Universe variables can be found at the beginning of the dataset. These universe variables give the status of each individual for each data collection (e.g., eligible during base year, dropout during first follow-up). Most of the flags are in the same location as composite and derived variables. Flags can be used by the researcher to select cases for analyses. For example, F1PNLFL is the base-year through first follow-up panel flag that indicates the sample member responded at both the base-year and first follow-up waves of ELS:2002 data collection (or for 651 cases, were nonrespondents in the base year, but participated in the first follow-up).\nWeights are variables that are put onto the file to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the effects of nonresponse. Using weights allows a researcher to make generalizations to the national populations represented by ELS:2002. On the ELS:2002/06 student files for the base-year through second followup studies there are 11 different analysis weights for students in addition to a school weight:\nBYSTUWT: Student final weight for base-year responding students.\nBYEXPWT: An expanded sample weight that differs from BYSTUWT in that it includes the questionnaire-incapable as well as the questionnaire-capable respondents.\nF1QWT: Final weight for first follow-up respondents, regardless of their base-year participation.\nF1EXPWT: An expanded sample weight that differs from F1QWT in that it includes the questionnaire-incapable as well as the questionnaire-eligible respondents.\nF1PNLWT: Panel weight for sample members who were respondents in both the base-year and first follow-up waves, or sample members who participated only in the first follow-up, but have selected base-year information (specifically, imputed test\nB-19\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nscores, and standard classification variables normally asked in the base year but also asked of first follow-up new participants).\nF1XPNLWT: This weight is similar to F1PNLWT except that it also includes the questionnaire-incapable sample members.\nF1TRSCWT: This weight is intended for use with the high school transcript file and was created for all sample members who participated in either the base year or first follow-up (or both) who had fully or partially completed transcript data.\nF2QWT: The cross-sectional weight for the second follow-up (2006). One must select either the sophomore or senior cohort to derive a meaningful analysis sample from the cases associated with F2QWT.\nF2QTSCWT: This weight was created for sample members who completed a questionnaire in 2006 and were transcript respondents in 2004\u20132005.\nF2F1WT: This panel weight accommodates sample members who participated in 2004 and 2006, or were questionnaire-incapable in 2004 but participated in 2006.\nF2BYWT. This panel weight accommodates sample members who participated in 2002 and 2006 (including 2002 students not part of the cross-sectional 2002 responding sample2) or were questionnaire-incapable in 2002 but participated in 2006.\nEach of these 11 weights is specific for a given population, although F1QWT, F2QWT, and their cognates do not generalize to any meaningful analysis population until subset to one of the two grade cohorts. Depending on the group to whom the data are designed to generalize, the individual weights have positive values (> 0) for respondents who are members of that particular group and zero (0) for all others. Note that the base-year school weight is BYSCHWT.\nQuestion: Why do we need to use weights with the ELS:2002 data?\nResponse: If we do not use weights, the estimates (e.g., counts, proportions, means) that we produce will not be representative of the population about which we are attempting to generalize.\nQuestion: Why would unweighted estimates not be representative?\nResponse: In the base year of ELS:2002, 15,362 sampled students participated in the survey from across the nation. These 15,362 10th-grade students represent the 3 million students who attended 10th grade in the United States in 2002. Thus, each student represents approximately 196 students (3 million/15,300 = 196). But because some policy-relevant groups (e.g., Asians, Hispanics, students in private schools) were oversampled (greater than their proportion in the population), they are overrepresented in the file. Depending on the sampling ratio, the weights for these students would be smaller than the average student. By the same token, other students\n2 In other words, base-year nonrespondents who responded in the first follow-up are included in the base-year to second followup panel. For this group, base-year test scores were imputed, and the base-year standard classification variables (race, SES, etc.) were collected in the first follow-up.\nB-20\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nmay represent more than 196 students because they were undersampled or part of a subsampled group during the study (base-year nonrespondents were subsampled, with the result that those retained had higher weights). Nonresponse adjustment (correcting for those students who were selected but did not participate in the survey) must also be taken into consideration because the weights of questionnaire nonrespondents are distributed among the respondents with similar characteristics. Thus, weights reflect both unequal probabilities of sampling and nonresponse adjustments. It is not unusual for a specific weight on a follow-up file to have a range of over 1,000 (e.g., F1QWT ranges from 1.77 to 1,427.47\u2014a single student represents 1,427 other students). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the researcher to use appropriate weighting variables.\nWARNING: The researcher should avoid breaking down the sample into such small categories that the analysis is questionable. For example, if a cross-tabulation table has a single cell with fewer than 30 cases when the data are not weighted, NCES recommends that the results not be displayed or that the cell be combined with another cell (if appropriate).\nQuestion: Thanks for the description of the weights, but what does this mean in practical terms?\nResponse: Perhaps the following examples can help clarify how the analysis weights can be used to help define your sample:\nExample: You are interested in examining the gains in math between the 10th and 12th grades, using the IRT-estimated number-right scores (either the NELS:88-scaled or ELS:2002-scaled scores can be used for this purpose). Decisions that you need to make include the following:\n1. Which ECB should I use? If you are examining the BY to F1 period, and not using F2 data, you can use either the 2004 E4P (public use) or E6R (restricted use). But let us say you want to include transcript variables\u2014then you have no recourse but to use the restricted ECB (or to employ the DAS).\n2. Should I use a cross-sectional or panel weight? A panel weight would be more appropriate because you are following a group of students over time.\n3. What do I do with the students who drop out of school? Dropouts were not tested in 2004, so they will fall out of the analysis. To select students who were high school sophomores as of the spring of 2002, you would use the 10th-grade cohort flag (G10COHRT) along with F1PNLWT.\nDesign Effects\nQuestion: Why do I need to take account of design effects when I do my significance testing?\nResponse: Because the ELS:2002 sample design involved stratification, disproportionate sampling of certain strata (e.g., oversampling of Hispanics), and clustered (e.g., students within a school) probability sampling, the resulting statistics are more variable than they would have been had they been based on data collected from a simple random sample of the same size. However, without accounting for the design, a researcher will underestimate variance estimates, most notably the standard errors (estimated percentages or counts are not affected by the design effects, only by weights) and actually produce estimates that are often much lower than an SRS design. Underestimating your standard errors will lead to inflated t values in\nB-21\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nhypothesis testing. This, in turn, increases the chance of a type I error, rejecting the null hypotheses. This is when a researcher states that two groups are different when in fact they are not. A number of statistical packages (SUDAAN and STATA are two of several possible examples) take account of complex sampling designs in the calculation of standard errors. The AM software does so as well (available for free download at am.air.org).\nElectronic Codebooks\nQuestion: When I receive my ELS:2002/06 CD, what are some of the steps that I should follow to check out my CD?\nResponse: The following steps may help you get a better understanding of the ELS:2002/06 data.\nStep 1\u2014Make sure that you have the right file\nA general rule that should be followed by all researchers when they receive data from the government or any other source is to check the file for accuracy. Does this file include what you think it does? The following questions should be answered for the ELS:2002 CD.\n1. Does the ELS:2002/06 CD contain the files listed in the documentation? Check directory and subdirectories.\n2. After running frequencies on selected variables on the data file (e.g., first variable, last variable, and five at random in between first and last), do the frequencies agree with those shown for ECB or user manuals? If not, did you receive the correct version?\n3. Do the analysis weights (final nonresponse-adjusted weights) contained on the data files allow you to replicate weighted frequencies found in the user manuals? You may want to run weighted frequencies on a single variable using each of the weights contained on the file.\nStep 2\u2014Understanding the data\nAssuming that you performed the above steps and you are confident that the files appear to contain what you hoped they would, it is now time to start learning about the files that you will be working with. Start by asking the following questions:\n1. What were the processes involved in getting data from students via questionnaires and cognitive tests to the medium (CD) that you now possess? Just because you did not collect the data does not mean that you do not need to know the procedures that were involved in collecting and processing the data. You also need to understand the quality control checks that were performed by the contractors in processing the data.\n2. It is important to realize that some respondents did not respond to entire instruments; other respondents skipped individual items. For example, (a) some refused to complete selected items, (b) some did not reach the end of the questionnaire, (c) sometimes abbreviated versions of instruments were used in data collection, (d) some respondents made illegal skips, and (e) some respondents responded outside valid ranges.\nB-22\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\n3. What can I do to further my understanding of the cases and variables that I plan to use? You can perform your own quality control procedures by answering the following questions: Are the cases that I selected representative of the population to which I wish to generalize? How do the various breakdowns of the data compare to known population numbers? Is my sample biased\u2014do nonrespondents look different from respondents?\nComposite Variables\nQuestion: What are the advantages of using composite variables in my analyses?\nResponse: Composite variables (also called derived variables, constructed variables, or created variables) were developed for NCES by RTI to help the researcher analyze the ELS:2002 data. These variables were usually created from two or more variables and are often considered to be more accurate measures of the underlying concept than the individual variables that were used to create them. For example, the base-year socioeconomic status variable (BYSES) is a composite variable made up of five separate variables from the base-year parent questionnaire representing both parents\u2019 education levels, both parents\u2019 occupations, and family income. In addition, these variables have been used by many researchers over time. This provides for a consistent measure to aid in the comparability of findings between studies/research projects. For more information on particular composite variables see the ECB and Data File User\u2019s Manual/Data File Documentation.\nModel Building\nQuestion: How do I select variables for a working data file?\nResponse: The following sequence of steps will help you to produce your own working data file.\nModel building\nAfter a researcher understands (1) how the ELS:2002/06 data were collected and processed, (2) limitations of the data, and (3) research issues that can be addressed, he or she is ready to begin selecting variables for his or her working data files.\nThe working data file will be used to test the models that are derived from previously developed conceptual models. Before a working dataset is created though, the following steps are suggested:\n1. Develop a conceptual model\u2014What does prior research suggest is happening with the data (e.g., characteristics of students who are likely to drop out of school)?\n2. Determine the predictor variables, intervening processes, and outcomes that can be used to explain the model.\n3. Determine which components (variables) of your model can be addressed with ELS:2002/06 variables\u2014If there are multiple sources of data available on the ELS:2002/06 data files, choose the ones that the researcher believes are most reliable and valid. If the variables that the researcher needs are not available on\nB-23\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nthe ELS:2002/06 files, he/she should consider merging variables from other sources (Census, Common Core of Data) through licensing agreement. 4. Rethink original model\u2014If the variables contained on the ELS:2002/06 data files cannot be used to study original model, rethink the model and either modify the model or choose another dataset. Once the above steps have been completed, it is time to subset the ELS:2002/06 data files into working data files. The following steps are suggested: 1. Determine which variables are needed from each of the ELS:2002/06 data files. For example, the model may specify that the following variables are needed from selected files. For example, base-year student data on aspirations and hours of homework per week can be used to predict first follow-up outcomes like math proficiency. 2. Determine the analysis population that you wish to work with. This will need to be known so that correct survey questions, filters, and weights can be tagged and included in the extracted files. 3. Use the ECB (E6R) to tag variables and then create a SAS or SPSS system file. 4. Check log of computer runs to determine if program is doing what you want it to do rather than the directions provided by computer program. 5. Run frequencies and/or means on all variables in working data file to serve as codebook and documentation. 6. Document all cases that are excluded from the working data files (e.g., who is being deleted from the analysis). Question: How do I subset data files? Response: It is very important for the user of ELS:2002/06 data files to learn the proper techniques for subsetting the data. If a user does not correctly subset the files, there will be extraneous cases on the working data file that can potentially complicate the analyses and result in erroneous findings. Why subset? The ELS:2002/06 data were designed to serve many different audiences. As a result, the data can be subset to represent many different populations (e.g., the 10th-grade class of 2002; the 12thgrade class of 2004; the panel of 10th-graders who participated in the study from the base year through the first follow-up). By applying the analysis weights and utilizing the appropriate flag/universe variables to subset the data, the user can specify the population that is to be examined.\nB-24\n\n\fAppendix B. Quick Guide to Using the ELS:2002/06 Data\nRestricted-Use Data Question: How do I get a restricted-use license? Response: While base-year to first follow-up ECB data are available in public use files, there is only a restricted use ECB for base year to second follow-up. Some users may not require direct access to microdata they can manipulate. For them, it may be satisfactory to use the web-based Data Analysis System (DAS).

Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nC.1 Overview of Second Follow-up Field Test\nThe purpose of the second follow-up field test of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) was to test procedures, learn what challenges to anticipate for the full-scale data collection, and develop strategies to overcome these obstacles. This report of the second follow-up field test activities will briefly describe the approaches taken, highlight difficulties encountered, and provide recommendations for the full-scale data collection. The report includes\n\u2022 a chronologically ordered overview of the study procedures, including sampling, instrument design, data collection, and data file construction;\n\u2022 a report of results, including the response rates, the effectiveness of the incentives employed, interview length, item nonresponse, item reliability, and coding accuracy; and\n\u2022 recommendations for the full-scale study.\nC.2 Procedures\nC.2.1 Description of Second Follow-up Field Test Sample The ELS:2002 second follow-up field test sample members were initially selected either\nin the base-year field test as 10th-grade students in spring 2001 or in the first follow-up field test as 12th-grade students in spring 2003. The students who were added in the first follow-up field test had not been eligible for selection 2 years earlier. Altogether, 1,073 ELS:2002 sample members were carried forward from the first follow-up field test sample to form the second follow-up field test sample.\nAs shown in figure C-1, these second follow-up field test members included \u2022 sample members who responded in both the base-year field test and the first follow-up\nfield test (856); \u2022 sample members who responded in the base-year field test but did not respond in the first\nfollow-up field test (116); \u2022 base-year field test nonrespondents who were subsampled and responded in the first\nfollow-up field test (46); \u2022 freshened students (12th-graders in spring 2003 who were not eligible for selection in\nspring 2001) who responded to the first follow-up field test questionnaire (45); and \u2022 base-year field test questionnaire-ineligible sample members (10).\nC-3\n\n\fAppendix C.

Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\nThose who were found to be out of scope in the first follow-up field test were excluded from the second follow-up field test sample. In addition, there were 49 sample members who were eligible for the first follow-up field test but were not included in the second follow-up field test sample. Most of these were questionnaire-eligible students who did not respond to the questionnaire in both the base-year field test and the first follow-up field test. The remainder were 12th-grade students selected during the freshening process in the first follow-up field test who did not respond to the questionnaire. These sample members were not carried forward, because they were missing both high school data points and therefore had no analytical value. The same approach will be used in the full-scale study.\nOf these 1,073 sample members, 31 were found to be out of scope in the second followup (26 base-year respondents/F1 respondents and 5 base-year respondents/F1 nonrespondents). Table C-1 shows the distribution of the remaining 1,000 second follow-up field test studyeligible sample members according to their response status.\n\nTable C-1.

The expectation was that the length would be further reduced for the full-scale study based on the results of the field test. Given the premium on interview minutes, items were selected with particular care.\nThe primary research objectives of ELS:2002 are longitudinal. Given that this round of data collection was preceded by two rounds and would be followed by at least one more, two types of items were of highest priority. The first were items that would be predictive of future outcomes; the second were items that would represent near-term outcomes predicted by baseyear and first follow-up data. As ELS:2002 is the most recent of the NCES high school cohort studies, a second priority was to replicate some items from these previous studies so that intercohort comparisons could be made. While the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) third follow-up interview served as a springboard for discussions, attention was given to ways to improve upon or update the survey to address current issues.\n\nC-5\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nInstrument developers worked closely with two experts in the field of education research to develop content and questions. In addition to the NELS:88 third follow-up interview, items were also drawn from NCES postsecondary studies such as Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). The second follow-up field test interview had the following seven sections: High School, Postsecondary Education, Work, Finance, Family, Life, and Locating. Dividing the instrument into sections provided a structure to the interview and allowed the instrument to be programmed on a flow basis.\nThe High School section updated the respondents\u2019 high school status since the last interview. In the full-scale interview, respondents for whom complete transcript information is available will be able to skip this part of the section. Additional questions for first follow-up field test nonrespondents ascertained whether the sample member was in the 12th grade or a dropout in the spring term of 2003 so they could be appropriately classified. Questions about dual enrollment and college entrance and other exams rounded out the section.\nThe Postsecondary Education section only briefly touched on applications to postsecondary institutions, but collected a detailed enrollment history for each institution attended. Respondents were asked about any degrees or certificates earned from their selfidentified \u201cmain\u201d institution or their intentions to do so. Sample members with nonstandard enrollment patterns were questioned about their reasons for dropping out, transferring, and/or attending multiple schools. Additional information was collected about coursetaking, extracurricular participation, and academic preparation for postsecondary education. The section concluded with questions about educational plans for the future.\nThe Work section first collected a month-by-month employment history and then focused on the job held longest in the calendar year 2004. These questions were asked only of sample members who had no postsecondary education or students who considered themselves primarily or equally an employee. The final questions pertained to annual earnings in 2004 and occupational expectations.\nIn contrast to the previous section, the Finance section primarily pertained to those who had some postsecondary education. Items referred to education financing, work experience while enrolled, and spending habits. All respondents answered several questions about debt and dependents.\nThe final three sections were administered to all sample members. The Family section included questions about marriage, children, and living arrangements. The last substantive section, Life, covered a range of topics including values, volunteering, civic participation, time use, and use of various technologies. The final section, Locating, collected contact information for future follow-ups with the sample members.\nAs the content for each section of the instrument was finalized, question ordering and logic was determined. Specifications were then entered into the Instrument Development and Documentation System (IDADS). Programmers then expanded upon the specifications downloaded from IDADS to create a fully functional instrument.\nAs will be the case in the full-scale data collection, a single web-enabled instrument was used in the ELS:2002 second follow-up field test. Given that virtually all of the ELS:2002 field test sample members would no longer be in high school at the time of the second follow-up, a\nC-6\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\npaper-and-pencil self-administered questionnaire (PAPI SAQ), the primary means of data collection in the base-year and first follow-up, was no longer a viable approach for data collection. Sample members were no longer clustered in schools, so group administration of a PAPI SAQ was neither feasible nor cost-effective. Therefore, a different approach to data collection was needed for the second follow-up. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) was the primary means of collecting data. However, the instrument was designed so it could also be self-administered on the Web or loaded onto a laptop computer for field administration. Using the same exact instrument across modes minimized the mode effects inherent in any multimodal study.\nC.2.3 Data Collection\nC.2.3.1 Overview\nFollowing is a description of the data collection procedures for the ELS:2002 second follow-up field test. First, the sample maintenance, contacting, and tracing procedures are described in sections C.2.3.2 through C.2.3.4. Data collection procedures in each mode of administration are covered in C.2.3.5. Sections on quality control procedures, incentive payments, and data file construction follow.\nC.2.3.2 Sample Maintenance\nLocating and maintaining contact with ELS:2002 sample members was a key challenge of the second follow-up data collection. Following the first follow-up data collection, the young adults in the sample transitioned from high school to college, the workforce, or the military. Given this dispersion, field test sample members were located using several methods.\nSample maintenance and locating efforts for the second follow-up field test sample began in December 2004, several months before the start of data collection in late March 2005. At this point two cost-effective batch tracing services were used: the United States Postal Service (USPS) National Change of Address (NCOA) and Telematch\u00ae. NCOA provided updated addresses for sample members, especially those who had recently moved. Telematch confirmed or updated the telephone number matched to each sample member at his or her most current known address. These services are most effective when used in this sequence.\nUsing the contact information confirmed and updated through batch tracing services, a direct mailing was sent to all field test sample members in late January. The mailing consisted of a return postcard for respondents to confirm or update their address, telephone number, and other contact information. The postcard also provided a toll-free number that sample members could call to update their contact information, although almost no sample members chose this option.\nC.2.3.3 Contact With Sample Members\nIn late March 2005, a packet was mailed to all sample members that included a cover letter, an informational brochure, instructions for completing the interview along with a unique password and user identification, and a toll-free number and e-mail address that could be used to request assistance or pose questions. The toll-free number could also be used to complete an interview with a trained telephone interviewer.\nE-mail was another channel of communication employed during data collection. A message from the project director announcing the opening of data collection was e-mailed to 746\nC-7\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nsample members for whom an e-mail address had been collected. This e-mail provided instructions for completing an interview via the NCES website and the toll-free number for telephone completion.\nOnce data collection began, additional contacts were made. About 1 week after the opening of data collection, a reminder postcard was sent to all 904 sample members with a valid address who had not yet completed an interview. The postcard reminded sample members that they would receive an additional $10 by completing an interview during an early bonus period and again provided instructions for completing an interview via the website or the toll-free number. The postcard also thanked sample members who completed the interview while the postcard was in transit.\nDuring the early bonus period, two reminder e-mails were sent to sample members for whom an e-mail address had been collected. These e-mail notices contained the same information as the postcards. The first e-mail reminder was sent in early April to 646 sample members who had yet to complete the survey. The second was sent just over a week later to 566 sample members and emphasized that the end of the $10 early bonus period was nearly over.\nAt various times during data collection, further reminders were e-mailed to sample members and their parents. Three weeks after the early bonus period had ended and outbound calling began, reminder messages were e-mailed to both sample members and their parents. Parents\u2019 e-mail addresses had been collected in earlier rounds of data collections. In mid-July, a final reminder was sent to all sample members who had not yet completed an interview to emphasize that only 2 weeks of data collection remained.\nSample members also communicated with ELS:2002 project staff via the toll-free line, or more often, through e-mail. The most frequent reason sample members sent e-mail messages was to request that their study identification number and password be sent, or to report difficulty using them. A small number of field test sample members called the toll-free number. Besides calling for assistance with self-administration of the web survey or to complete the survey by telephone, some sample members or their parents called to update contact information or to decline to participate in the study.\nC.2.3.4 Intensive Tracing Procedures\nIntensive tracing activities began a week after outbound CATI calls commenced. Tracing staff used a comprehensive and proven set of procedures to attempt to locate 235 sample members whose contact information proved inaccurate or missing. The located cases were returned to telephone or field data collection, as appropriate, with the updated addresses and telephone numbers. Cases that were not located were sent to field interviewers for field locating along with the historical data generated by intensive tracing efforts.\nC.2.3.5 Modes of Data Collection\nData collection for the second follow-up field test opened on March 30, 2005, when sample members had the option of completing an interview via the ELS:2002 website or calling a toll-free number to complete an interview with a telephone interviewer. Outbound calling for CATI began 3 weeks later. Sample members who were particularly difficult to contact or to enlist in the study were traced in the field. In all modes, the same web-enabled instrument was used by respondents and interviewers.\nC-8\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nC.2.3.5.1 Web-enabled Self-administration\nThe web-enabled survey option allowed the young adults in the second follow-up field test sample to use a data collection mode familiar to many of them\u2014the Web. It provided them access to the survey at any location where they had internet access, allowed them to complete the survey on their own time and at their own pace, and offered greater privacy through selfadministration. To avoid technical problems, the web-enabled survey system was designed to function appropriately in a wide range of computing environments, including different web browsers, different internet connections, and different computer settings.\nThe web-enabled interview was available for 3 weeks prior to the start of outbound telephone activities. The toll-free project number allowed sample members who wanted to participate via the Web (but encountered technical difficulties in doing so) to receive technical support. Help desk staff communicated with respondents over the telephone and via e-mail. They also offered to conduct a CATI interview with sample members who called in.\nC.2.3.5.2 Web-Enabled Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview\nAfter the first 3 weeks of field test data collection, telephone interviewing staff began calling sample members to either complete an interview or encourage completion via the website. Interviewers followed a set of standardized interviewing procedures that were determined prior to data collection and provided in interviewer training. This not only ensured that all CATI interviewers were following procedures consistently, but also helped to minimize mode effects between self-administration and interviewer administration. The CATI case management system (CATI-CMS) allowed interviewers to record notes for each call. These case history notes were then used by interviewers, supervisors, and other project staff to set appropriate callback days and times and otherwise develop an effective strategy for reaching individual sample members. CATI-CMS automatically scheduled callback times for some routine call results, such as a ring but no answer, busy signal, or answering machine. Interviewers also used CATI-CMS to code cases that could not be reached and interviewed via CATI, such as those who were disabled, unlocatable, or otherwise unreachable, in addition to coding those who initially refused to participate.\nC.2.3.5.3 Web-Enabled Computer-Assisted Personal Interview\nField data collection using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) started in the beginning of June. Thereafter, cases for field data collection were assigned on a flow basis each week. The two most common reasons to assign cases to the field were that the sample member could not be located by intensive tracing efforts and that the sample member had initially refused to participate. Sample members who were located at a particular address but did not have a telephone were also assigned to field interviewing staff.\nField interviewers generally began efforts to contact each sample member using the \u201cbest\u201d telephone number for the subject listed. Because many cases sent for field follow-up did not have a clear best telephone number, field interviewers were often required to visit the sample member\u2019s last known address and, if the sample member was no longer there, initiate field tracing steps. When contact was made with a parent, relative, friend, or neighbor of the sample member, field interviewers asked a recommended set of questions (as appropriate) to generate leads on sample members. Field interviewers recorded all tracing steps and results of contact to maintain a case history for each sample member they attempted to locate and contact.\nC-9\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nC.2.3.6 Quality Control\nTelephone interviews were monitored for errors in question delivery and data entry. Supervisors also monitored e-mails that Help Desk staff sent to sample members to ensure accurate and appropriate information was being communicated. Starting about 1 week after the opening of data collection, project staff held biweekly quality circle (QC) meetings with interviewers to ensure procedures were being followed correctly and data quality was being maintained. After each meeting, project staff summarized the issues discussed and provided the interview staff with resolutions to any problems in the form of QC memoranda.\nC.2.3.7 Incentive Payments\nAn important element for ensuring high participation rates across all subgroups was the respondent incentive plan for the ELS:2002 second follow-up field test. One of two base incentive amounts was set for each respondent, depending on whether or not they had ever been identified by their school or themselves as a dropout. The base incentive was $20 for sample members who had no record of a dropout episode and $40 for those who did. These base amounts were augmented by $10 when one of the two following conditions was met.\nFirst, to encourage sample members to participate prior to outbound telephone calling, an additional $10 was paid to respondents who completed the survey via the Web or telephone during the first 3 weeks of data collection, the \u201cearly bonus period.\u201d This extra incentive not only served to motivate sample members to participate early via the Web or by calling in, but it also saved the costs associated with telephone and in-person follow-up efforts.\nSecond, an extra $10 incentive was offered to those sample members who proved extremely difficult to contact or enlist in the study. Sample members were designated as \u201cdifficult\u201d cases based on previous attempts to contact and locate them. Difficult cases were those that met one or more of the following criteria:\n\u2022 More than 20 calls had been made to contact the sample member without completing an interview.\n\u2022 The sample member refused to participate in an initial contact. \u2022 The sample member could not be located through any of the telephone numbers\npreviously provided, so the case had to be sent for intensive tracing. \u2022 The case was sent to a field interviewer for field data collection.\nC.2.4 Data File Construction\nFrequent reviews of data began during data collection to spot any potential problems with the functioning of the instrument. Because a single instrument was used for all three modes of data collection, all response data was stored in the same database. In addition, because all skip logic was the same across modes, only one set of editing rules was required. The majority of editing cleaned out data that were entered into dependent fields where a respondent backed up and changed the response to a gate question. The same process will be implemented in the fullscale study.\nAll respondent records in the final dataset were verified with the Survey Control System (SCS) to spot inconsistencies. For example, it is possible that data were collected for a respondent that later was set to an ineligible status. The SCS served as a safeguard to ensure that\nC-10\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\nsuch data was not delivered. Furthermore, the data files served as a check against the SCS to ensure that all respondent information was included in production reports.\n\nC.3 Results\n\nC.3.1 Data Collection Results\n\nC.3.1.1 Response Rates Overall\nTable C-2 provides the overall response rate for the second follow-up field test data collection. Overall, 75 percent of eligible field test sample members completed an interview.\n\nTable C-2. ELS:2002 second follow-up field test overall response rate (unweighted): 2005\n\nTotal sample\n\nEligible sample 1,000\n\nPercent of total eligible 100.0\n\nRespondents Nonrespondents\n\n790\n\n75.3\n\n260\n\n24.7\n\nNOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up Field Test.\u201d\n\nTable C-3 summarizes the final dispositions of the 260 second follow-up field test nonrespondents. Almost 11 percent of the sample members could not be located through tracing efforts during the data collection period. Nearly 5 percent of the sample members refused to participate in the field test. Another person such as a parent refused on behalf of 3 percent of sample members. Data collection staff was not able to complete an interview with the remaining 6 percent of field test nonrespondents for other reasons. The most common issue among this last set of nonrespondents was that these sample members were rarely at home and parents were not able to help us contact them.\n\nTable C-3. Final dispositions of nonrespondents in the ELS:2002 field test (unweighted): 2005\n\nTotal\n\nNonrespondents 260\n\nPercent of total eligible\n24.7\n\nPercent of nonrespondents\n100.0\n\nUnable to locate Refusal by sample member Refusal by other Time/effort exhausted\n\n110\n\n10.9\n\n44.0\n\n50\n\n4.7\n\n18.7\n\n30\n\n3.0\n\n12.1\n\n60\n\n6.1\n\n24.9\n\nNOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up Field Test.\u201d\n\nIn the full-scale study, it will be necessary to achieve an overall response rate of 92 percent. A direct comparison of the response rate achieved in the field test with the needed response rate in the full-scale study is a bit misleading for a number of reasons. First, the fullscale data collection period will be 7 months in duration as compared to 4 months in the field test. Additional time to locate sample members and convert refusals will increase the response rate. In addition, the field test sample has a greater proportion of first follow-up nonrespondents\n\nC-11\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\nthan the full-scale sample. As will be illustrated later in this report, first follow-up nonrespondents were particularly challenging to locate. Nonetheless, additional effort will be needed to locate enough sample members to achieve the necessary response rate.\n\nC.3.1.2 Response Rates by Dropout Status\nAn important subgroup in the ELS:2002 field test data collection was sample members for whom the study had recorded a high school dropout episode. These sample members had been identified as high school dropouts by their high school or in a previous interview. This subgroup is important for three reasons: first, the policy relevance of high school dropouts is particularly high; second, the response propensities of high school dropouts have historically been substantially lower than their peers; and third, extra incentives were allocated to encourage a higher participation rate for this group.\nTable C-4 presents the response rates for those who had ever been identified as dropouts compared to those who had never been identified as dropouts. Offering sample members who had been identified as a dropout a higher base incentive ($40 instead of $20) appears to have been beneficial. Table C-4 shows that the response rate for dropouts was only about 8 percent lower than the response rate for nondropouts (68 percent versus 76 percent). Given the greater burden typically associated with locating dropouts and encouraging them to participate, the higher incentive amount appears to have been generally effective. Although the field test sample was somewhat limited in size, these results indicate that appropriate procedures in the second follow-up data collection may produce a response rate among dropouts nearly as high as among nondropouts.\n\nTable C-4.

First follow-up nonrespondents were offered the same $20 base incentive as first follow-up respondents. Table C-5 shows the second follow-up field test response rates by first follow-up response status. There is a large difference in response rates for first follow-up respondents versus nonrespondents.\n\nC-12\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\nTable C-5.

F1 = first follow-up field test.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up Field Test.\u201d\n\nWhile about 80 percent of first follow-up field test participants completed a second follow-up interview, less than 40 percent of first follow-up field test nonrespondents participated in the second follow-up. Locating issues were significant with first follow-up nonrespondents, because for many of them, the available contact information was 4 years old. It is possible that increased incentives for this group would aid in locating them, given that higher incentives may encourage contacted family members or friends to provide information about the respondent\u2019s whereabouts. Also, many first follow-up nonrespondents were likely to not be as committed to the study as first follow-up respondents, so they required additional encouragement to participate in the survey.\n\nC.3.1.3 Evaluation of Incentive Plan\nAs noted above, second follow-up field test sample members were offered differential incentive payments that varied based on completion during an early period, their dropout status, and the level of effort required to find the sample member and/or gain his/her cooperation. Altogether, field test sample members were offered one of four different incentive amounts, ranging from $20 to $50.\nTable C-6 shows the number and percentage of respondents and nonrespondents overall and by dropout and first follow-up responses status. Respondents are classified by the incentive they received: the early bonus incentive, the base incentive only, or the difficult case incentive. Almost three quarters (74 percent) of all respondents completed the interview in the early bonus period, which demonstrates the viability of self-administration as the first mode of a multimodal design. However, the early bonus payment was not equally as effective for those who were ever identified as dropouts as compared with those who were not. Only 7 percent of second follow-up participants who had ever dropped out took part during the first 3 weeks of data collection. The early bonus incentive was even less effective for first follow-up nonrespondents (3 percent). This is likely due to the fact that many dropouts and first follow-up nonrespondents were not reached during the early bonus period due to outdated contact information.\n\nC-13\n\n\fAppendix C.

By the end of data collection, all remaining nonparticipants were eligible for the difficult case bonus. Therefore, all final nonrespondents were classified as difficult cases.\n\nTable C-6 shows that almost half of all sample members met at least one of the criteria for the difficult bonus offer (48 percent; 23 percent difficult case bonus respondents plus 25 percent nonrespondents). Of the sample members with some indication of a dropout episode, 51 percent eventually qualified for the difficult case bonus (19 percent of difficult case bonus respondents plus 32 percent nonrespondents). In contrast, 83 percent of first follow-up field test nonrespondents became eligible for this bonus (19 percent of difficult case bonus respondents plus 64 percent nonrespondents). Recall that first follow-up field test nonrespondents were not offered a higher base incentive as dropouts were.\n\nAs displayed in Table C-7, almost half (47 percent) of those who were offered the difficult case bonus eventually completed the interview. These results varied by dropout and first follow-up response status. Thirty-eight percent of dropouts and 23 percent of first follow-up nonrespondents completed the interview once the difficult case bonus was offered.\n\nTable C-7.

This length allowed RTI to field test a sufficient number of items without significantly compromising interview response rates. Interview timing was analyzed overall, by mode of administration, and by respondents\u2019 status as student or employee.\nTable C-9 shows the average length of the interview overall and by each interview section. Overall, the interview took 33 minutes to complete, about 3 minutes longer than planned. The sections covering postsecondary education and work were the longest, as intended. Two sections ran longer than expected. The Life section, which covered a range of topics including values, community involvement, and use of technology, approached the length of the Postsecondary and Work sections. The final section of the interview, in which contact information is collected for future follow-up, was over a minute longer than the typical 5 minutes allotted to it.\n\nC-15\n\n\fAppendix C.

One likely reason for this is that web respondents are more likely to complete part of the survey and resume at a later time.\n\nNOTE: Average time in minutes.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), \u201cSecond Follow-up Field Test.\u201d\n\nGiven that first follow-up nonrespondents and dropouts are generally more reluctant to participate, and perhaps less tolerant of a long interview, timing analyses were also conducted for these subgroups. On average, the interview took 34 minutes to complete for both first follow-up nonrespondents and dropouts as compared to 33 minutes for all respondents.\n\nTable C-10 shows the average length of the interview overall and by mode of administration for all respondents. While the average length of the interview across modes was 3 minutes longer than intended, the length of the interview was on target for web selfadministration at an average of 30 minutes per complete. The CATI and CAPI interviews ran long by 4 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively. The added minutes for the CATI and CAPI interviews were largely attributable to the Work, Life, and Locating sections.\n\nTable C-10.

In an effort to reduce the average length of the interview, the instrument was designed to selectively administer questions based on the respondents\u2019 status as a student or employee. If a respondent had attended a postsecondary institution and had also worked, the respondent was asked if he or she considered him- or herself to be primarily a student, primarily an employee, or equally a student and an employee. Based on their responses, participants with dual roles were asked a full battery of questions about their primary role and a smaller set of questions about\n\nC-16\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\ntheir secondary role. Those who identified themselves as equally a student and an employee were administered the full set of items for both roles.\nTable C-11 displays the average length of the interview by identification as a student, employee, or both. Respondents who were only or primarily postsecondary students completed the interview in 31 minutes on average. Those who were not students or who identified themselves primarily as employees took over 33 minutes. Not surprisingly, the average interview time was greatest for those who identified equally with their role as a student and as an employee. On average, these respondents spent 37 minutes answering questions.\n\nTable C-11.

Respondents who were postsecondary students only or primarily so, like those who identified equally as students and employees, completed the Postsecondary Education section in about 10 minutes. However, the ones who considered themselves equally employees had the added burden of the full set of employment questions. The student group completed the Work section in about 3 minutes, whereas the equally employee group took almost 10 minutes.\n\nThe longer-than-anticipated average interview length for some subgroups did not have a deleterious effect on interview completions once the respondent had begun the survey. Only five respondents did not complete their interview after they had finished the High School and Postsecondary Education sections.\n\nC.3.2 Data Quality Analyses\n\nC.3.2.1 Item Nonresponse\nThe quality of the data was assessed to guide selection of items for the full-scale survey. Item nonresponse rates were one measure of data quality that was evaluated. Item nonresponse rates were very low overall. Only two items were skipped by more than 5 percent of respondents.\n\nC-17\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nThe first of these items asked respondents what they expected their total annual income to be at 30 years of age. While about 111 respondents skipped the question (14 percent), 69 of these had previously reported that they did not know what occupation they expected to have at that age. It is reasonable to assume that most of these respondents would have chosen a \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option had it been provided.\nThe only other item with a nonresponse rate greater than 5 percent was the question about total annual earnings in 2004. This is not surprising given that open-ended questions about earnings are well-known to be sensitive items that tend to have relatively high nonresponse rates. In anticipation of this issue, a follow-up question was asked of those who did not provide their 2004 earnings. These respondents were asked to choose the range which included their earnings level. Ranges allow respondents to provide information without indicating their precise income. In addition, respondents who are not sure of their precise earnings may feel more comfortable providing an estimate if ranges are provided. While 97 respondents (12 percent) did not report their earnings in the open-ended question, only 25 (3 percent) did not choose an earnings category.\nC.3.2.2 Reliability\nA subsample of 64 CATI respondents was selected at random to complete a reinterview designed to assess the temporal stability of selected interview items. Information and gate questions from the initial interview were preloaded in the reinterview to ensure that questions were asked in the same way and with the same wording across the two interviews. Reinterviews were conducted in CATI about 3 weeks following the completion of the first interview. By the end of data collection, 49 respondents had completed a telephone reinterview.\nThe reinterview consisted of questions newly written for the second follow-up field test that were of critical importance, either for their substance or for their impact on routing, or questions that had previously had their reliability called into question. Items were not selected if it was anticipated that the correct response may in fact change within a period of several weeks or not enough respondents would be administered the item to yield sufficient data for analysis. Sixty-three items were selected, but six of these were administered to fewer than 30 respondents and were eliminated from the analysis. The remaining 57 items are displayed in table C-12. Percent agreement was based on cases where a response was provided in both interviews. Percent agreement ranged from 43 percent to 100 percent, with two thirds of the items having matched responses in at least 75 percent of the cases.\nTen of the items with less than 75 percent agreement were subitems to two questions in the postsecondary education section. The first of these questions asked respondents to indicate whether various reasons explained why they had chosen to attend their postsecondary institution. Percent agreement ranged from 64 percent to 83 percent across these reasons for attending with three reasons matching less than 75 percent of the time. Location, affordability, and ability to work while in school were matched in 72 percent, 64 percent, and 72 percent of the cases respectively.\nThe second question asked postsecondary attendees how well their high school courses in various subject areas had prepared them for postsecondary institutions: not at all, somewhat, or a great deal. The percent agreement for these ratings ranged from 49 percent to 72 percent. The ratings of preparation in core high school subjects such as mathematics, English, and history/social studies had higher percent agreement (72 percent, 67 percent, and 69 percent) than\nC-18\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\nforeign languages, vocational-technical, and visual art courses (all 49 percent). The overall reliability is likely to be improved by asking respondents about their preparation for a specific institution they had attended instead of postsecondary institutions in general.\nThe remaining items with low reliability were subitems in two questions in the Life section of the interview. One of these questions asked all respondents how frequently they used their public library for various purposes; never, rarely, sometimes, or often. All but one of the subitems had matched responses in fewer than 75 percent of the cases, ranging from 59 percent to 71 percent. The time frame was not specified in the questions, so the respondents\u2019 reference period may have differed from the first administration to the second. The other question asked respondents how many hours per day they spent watching television on weekdays and weekend days. Categorical response options were provided. Percent agreement was 50 percent for weekdays and 43 percent for weekend days. Both library usage and television viewership is likely to differ during the school year and summer break. Because some reinterviews were administered during the summer months, temporal stability may have been compromised for these cases.\nC-19\n\n\fAppendix C.

For occupation, sample members were asked about the job they held the longest in 2004 or the job they expect to have at the age of 30, or both. Occupations were coded into one of 52 categories. For field of study, sample members were asked about the degree they intended to complete.1 The code frame for field of study included 192 categories.\nCoders first entered text to describe the occupation or the field of study. Occupation coding was done with a set of three sequential dropdown menus, each with choices increasing in their level of specificity. The first dropdown menu contained a general list of occupations. The options presented in the second dropdown were dependent on the code selected in the first. Some selections from the second dropdown required coders to make a selection from a third, more detailed dropdown menu. The field-of-study coder operated differently. While the occupation coder was independent of the textual response, the field-of-study coder was influenced by it. Coders were presented with a customized list of fields of study based on the text string they entered. Coders had the option of selecting one of the fields of study listed or choosing the \u201cnone\n\n1 Respondents who had already completed a degree were asked to code the field of study in which it was earned. However, too few sample members had earned a degree to allow for a meaningful analysis of coding quality.\n\nC-21\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\n\nof these\u201d option. Selecting \u201cnone of these\u201d brought the coder to a two-tiered dropdown menu that operated like the triple dropdown menu of occupations. For both the occupation and field of study coders, interviewers were provided coding guides and trained to use probing techniques to assist in the online coding process. Self-administered web respondents were provided limited supporting text on screen.\nCoding experts evaluated coding quality overall and by mode of administration. A 30 percent sample of the pairs of verbatim strings and codes was selected for analysis. Expert coders who were unaware of the codes selected during the interview evaluated the verbatim strings and assigned codes. Cases were not coded when the verbatim string lacked sufficient clarity or specificity.\nTable C-13 shows the results of the recode analysis overall and for each coding system. Overall, 64 percent of the codes selected during the interview were determined to be correct. Coding accuracy ranged from 60 percent for occupation expected at age 30 to 70 percent for intended field of study. Taken together, about 6 percent of the text strings were too vague to evaluate. However, all of the text strings associated with the occupation held in 2004 had sufficient specificity to be coded. In contrast, 8 percent of the text strings for occupation expected at age 30 and 11 percent of the text strings for the intended field of study were too vague to code.\n\nTable C-13.

Overall, the correct code was selected for 64 percent of the selected cases in both modes of administration: interviewer administered via CATI/CAPI and self-administration via the Web.

Nonetheless, several modifications have been recommended and implemented for the full-scale study. With respect to data collection, it was learned that parents continue to act as gatekeepers for the sample members even though the sample members are no longer minors. A concerted effort must be made in the full-scale study to convince parents of the value of the study so they cooperate and share information with their children. The full-scale study procedures include dual mailings to both the sample members and their parents. These procedures will ensure at both the sample maintenance and data collection stages that parents are aware of the procedures for the second follow-up. Direct mail and e-mail contacts with parents will also allow parents to provide updated contact information for their young adults. Also, because the majority of phone numbers available for sample members are numbers for their parents\u2019 homes, CATI procedures will be in place to guide interviewers on how to appropriately ask for and record new contact information for sample members from parents. Successful contacts with parents will be an important part of interviewer training for the full-scale study.\nThe use of a larger incentive for sample members classified as dropouts proved to be very successful. The response rate for dropouts approached the rate for the rest of the sample. This was highlighted in comparison with the low response rate for first follow-up field test nonrespondents. Like dropouts, previous-round nonparticipants typically have lower rates of cooperation than their participating counterparts. However, while dropouts received a higher amount, the first follow-up field test nonrespondents were offered the standard incentive amount. The response rate for first follow-up field test nonrespondents was about half that of the rate for first follow-up field test respondents. Based on this evidence, it is strongly recommended that the greater incentive amount be offered to both dropouts and first follow-up field test nonrespondents.\nThe survey instrument proved to take more time to complete on average than had been anticipated. Analysis of the timing data by respondent types demonstrated that the interview was considerably longer for sample members who equally identified with their student and employee roles. About one-third of the respondents reported that they considered themselves equally students and employees, and as such, were asked to complete a long battery of questions about\n\nC-23\n\n\fAppendix C. Synopsis of the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up Field Test Report\neach role. For the full-scale study, the project staff recommends constructing two mutually exclusive paths through the postsecondary and employment sections of the interview to reduce the average minutes per complete.\nAnother aspect of the instrument that warrants review is the occupation and field-of-study coding applications. Post-hoc codes of verbatim strings by expert coders matched the codes selected during the interview in 60 to 70 percent of the cases, depending on the question. The project staff recommends using an assisted coder for occupation coding as well as field-of-study coding. In addition, a thorough review of the keywords used to match verbatim strings to response offerings is recommended to increase the proportion of correct codes selected during the interview by CATI/CAPI interviewers and web respondents.\nC-24\n\n\fAppendix D Data File Documentation Errata\nD-1\n\n\f\fAppendix D. Data File Documentation Errata\nThe following errata appear in the Base-Year to First Follow-Up Data File Documentation at page 36 (table 5), where the variable names for IRT-estimated number-right scores in mathematics are misstated. The variable name BYTXMIR2 should be F1TXMBIR. The variable name F1TXMIR2 should be F1TXM1IR. The appropriate variable name for the rescaled base-year IRT-estimated number-right score (F1TXMBIR) appears correctly in chapter 2 of this report. The appropriate variable name for the first follow-up IRT-estimated number-right score (F1TXM1IR) also appears correctly in chapter 2 of this report.\nIn the Base Year Data File User\u2019s Manual and in the Base-Year to First Follow-Up Data File Documentation the following misstatement occurs: \u201cw is the estimated population and y is a 0/1 variable indicating whether or not a certain characteristic is present for the sample member.\u201d The corrected statement is: \u201cw is the sample weight and y is a 0/1 variable indicating whether a certain characteristic is present for the sample member.\u201d The misstatement may be found on page 100 (footnote 38) of the base-year report, and on page 90 (footnote 25) of the base-year to first follow-up report.\nD-3\n\n\fAppendix E Flow Chart and Facsimile for the Second\nFollow-up Questionnaire\nE-1\n\n\f\fAppendix E.

Occupational Coding Crosswalk\nOccupational Crosswalk: O*NET and ELS:2002 Classifications\nF.1 Overview\nThe coding system within the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) second follow-up survey instrument used O*NET. O*NET OnLine was developed for the U.S. Department of Labor by the National Center for O*NET Development. For more information about the O*NET project, please visit the O*NET Resource Center at http://www.onetcenter.org/. The classification structure of O*NET provides three levels: general, midlevel, and specific. Twenty-three categories make up the general level, which expand to 96 midlevel categories, which expand to 821 specific-level categories. Specific-level categories subsequently roll up to mid- and general-level categories.\nGiven that occupation was coded differently in the present interview than in the base-year and first follow-up rounds of ELS:2002, an occupational crosswalk was constructed to map the new coding scheme to the original taxonomy. The provided crosswalk maps all 821 specificlevel O*NET categories to the 16 occupational categories used in the base year and first followup. Such a crosswalk enables users to examine either set of coded data, depending on their analysis needs. Details regarding the general O*NET level, the ELS:2002 scheme, and how to use the occupational crosswalk are provided.\nF.1.1 General O*NET Level\nThe general level of coding provides the foundation for further, more detailed classification within the O*NET structure. Given the more manageable number of occupational categories, it may also be a preferred analysis level. The 23 general-level O*NET classifications are provided below, in numerical order. For each category, the coded value is given first, followed by the category name, which is followed by select occupational examples as classified by O*NET.\n11 \u2013 Management (such as sales manager, education administrator, legislator) 13 \u2013 Business and Financial Operations (such as accountant, financial analyst, loan\nofficer) 15 \u2013 Computer and Mathematical (such as computer programmer, computer support\nspecialist, statistician) 17 \u2013 Architecture and Engineering (such as architect, engineer other than software,\nsurveying technician, drafter) 19 \u2013 Life, Physical, and Social Science (such as biologist, psychologist, survey\nresearcher, research assistant) 21 \u2013 Community and Social Services (such as social worker, marriage counselor, clergy) 23 \u2013 Legal (such as lawyer, judge, law clerk) 25 \u2013 Education, Training, and Library (such as college professor, elementary school\nteacher, librarian, teacher assistant) 27 \u2013 Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (such as artist, interior designer,\nactor, athlete, photographer, writer) 29 \u2013 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical (such as physician, surgeon, registered\nnurse, pharmacy technician) 31 \u2013 Healthcare Support (such as nursing aide, medical assistant)\nF-3\n\n\fAppendix F.

For each category, the coded value is given first, followed by the category name, which is followed by occupational examples as they originally appeared on the questionnaires. Two categories are not shown below due to being unranked: these are homemaker (4) and military (7).\n5 \u2013 Laborer (such as construction worker, car washer, sanitary worker, farm laborer) 8 \u2013 Operative (such as meat cutter, assembly worker, machine operator, welder,\ntaxicab, bus or truck driver) 15 \u2013 Service (such as barber, beautician, practical nurse, private household worker,\njanitor, waiter) 2 \u2013 Craftsperson (such as baker, automobile mechanic, machinist, painter, plumber,\ntelephone installer, carpenter) 3 \u2013 Farmer (such as farmer, farm manager) 12 \u2013 Protective Services (such as detective, police officer or guard, sheriff, fire fighter) 11 \u2013 Proprietor, Owner (such as owner of small business, contractor, restaurant owner) 12 \u2013 Sales (such as salesperson, advertising or insurance agent, real estate broker) 1 \u2013 Clerical (such as bank teller, bookkeeper, secretary, typist, mail carrier, ticket\nagent) 6 \u2013 Manager, Administrator (such as sales manager, office manager, school\nadministrator, buyer, restaurant manager, government official) 16 \u2013 Technical (such as draftsman, medical or dental technician, computer programmer) 14 \u2013 School Teacher (such as elementary or high school teacher) 9 \u2013 Professional 1 (such as accountant, artist, registered nurse, engineer, librarian,\nwriter, social worker, actor, actress, athlete, politician, but not including school teacher) (note that Professional 1 does not require an advanced degree)\nF-4\n\n\fAppendix F. Occupational Coding Crosswalk\n10 \u2013 Professional 2 (such as clergyman, dentist, physician, lawyer, scientist, college professor) (note that Professional 2 requires an advanced degree)\nF.1.3 Using the Occupational Crosswalk O*NET codes constitute a total of six digits at the specific level, and were recorded as\nsuch in the ELS:2002 Second Follow-up instrument. The first two digits represent the nested general level code, while the first three digits represent the nested midlevel code. As mentioned, specific level codes can roll up to the broader categorizations by simply dropping the last three digits (if midlevel desired) or last four digits (if general level desired).\nThe O*NET to ELS:2002 occupational crosswalk maps every level of O*NET classification to its appropriate ELS:2002 counterpart. Each row represents a single mapped occupation, giving a total of 821 possible mappings. All O*NET category names, or occupational descriptors, come directly from O*NET. The crosswalk contains eight columns, which provide the following information:\n\u2022 General O*NET Code, which gives the 2-digit O*NET code; \u2022 General O*NET Category, which gives the general-level O*NET category name; \u2022 Midlevel O*NET Code, which gives the 3-digit O*NET code; \u2022 Midlevel O*NET Category, which gives the midlevel O*NET category name; \u2022 Specific O*NET Code, which gives the 6-digit O*NET code (instrument-recorded); \u2022 Specific O*NET Category, which gives the specific-level O*NET category name; \u2022 ELS Code, which gives the mapped ELS:2002 code (1 through 16); and \u2022 ELS Category, which gives the mapped ELS:2002 category name. Some O*NET categories, in particular those that encapsulate \u201cAll Other,\u201d correspond to more than one ELS:2002 category. In these instances, the most applicable code is presented first in the ELS Code column, followed by other possible codes in parentheses. The ELS Category column, however, reflects the most applicable category name only.\nF-5\n\n\fAppendix F. Occupational Coding Crosswalk F-6\n\nTable F-1.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\nExecutive Summary\nStatistical adjustment of nonresponse is a deep and pervasive issue for National Center for Education Studies (NCES) sample surveys. One example of nonresponse is in the base year of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). Approximately 61 percent of schools cooperated and about 87 percent of students responded by completing the questionnaire. The final two-stage response rate is the product of the school and student levels, or just over 53 percent. Adjusting for this magnitude of nonrandom unit nonresponse is an enormous challenge, given that most survey estimates and some of the population parameters are available only through the survey itself and not through objective benchmarks in other sources. To compare approaches to nonresponse adjustment, ELS:2002 data was used to examine the weight adjustment approaches. The adjustments are limited to student adjustments for students in public schools.\nSection 1 defines the weighting methods typically used for adjusting sample weights. The nonresponse adjustments produce almost identical weights when one or two variables are used, except when using the logistic regression method. When additional variables are used, similar weights after nonresponse adjustment are produced by collapsing variables identically for each method and by using the same interaction terms. Section 2 describes and presents results for nonresponse adjustment using each of the four methods and using one, two, four, six, and eight variables.\nSection 3 discusses and presents results for weight trimming using the interquartile range to determine extreme weights. Sometimes sampling weights or the weights after nonresponse or poststratification are extremely small or large; that is, the weights are outliers or extreme values. These outlier weights can be trimmed and smoothed (i.e., re-allocated) to an extent to not significantly increase the unequal weighting effect (UWE). Deciding when to trim and smooth weights is a subjective decision made during the weighting process. RTI\u2019s Generalized Exponential Model (GEM) can incorporate this trimming and smoothing. For other methods, the trimming and smoothing can be done separately before or after the weight adjustments. The four weighting methods produced results that were similar.\nSection 4 discusses and presents results for poststratification using each of the four methods. Poststratification to control totals is done in some surveys to adjust the weights to match known population totals. The ELS:2002 student data were not poststratified because there were no known population totals. For the sake of comparing the four methods, control totals were formed using the ELS:2002 final weights applied to the selected sample of students in public schools. These final weights differ from the weights generated by GEM in these examples because ELS:2002 used two nonresponse models and more variables in the nonresponse models. The four weighting methods produced similar results to each other.\nSection 5 discusses and presents results for the nonresponse bias analysis using each of the four methods. Unit nonresponse causes bias in survey estimates when the outcomes of respondents and nonrespondents are different. For ELS:2002, student response is defined as the student completing at least a specified portion of the student questionnaire. The student response rate was above 85 percent overall. In addition to comparing the weights and the UWEs across the four methods, the reduction in nonresponse bias was analyzed. The weighting class method had the least amount of significant bias among the methods.\nH-5\n\n\fAppendix H.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n1. Introduction\n1.1 Background and Purpose of the Research\nStatistical adjustment of nonresponse is a deep and pervasive issue for National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) sample surveys. One example of nonresponse can be seen in the base year of the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). Approximately 61 percent of schools cooperated and about 87 percent of students responded by completing the questionnaire. The final two-stage response rate is the product of the school and student levels, or just over 53 percent. Adjusting for this magnitude of non-random unit nonresponse is an enormous challenge, especially in light of the fact that most survey estimates and some of the population parameters are available only through the survey itself, and not through objective benchmarks in other sources.\nContemporary statistical methods offer researchers three broad approaches to nonresponse adjustment. The first is using a traditional weighting cell approach. A second and more recent development is response propensity modeling, typically using logistic regression. A third common approach to weight adjustment is raking. A fourth, RTI\u2019s Generalized Exponential Model (GEM) is a generalization of weight adjustments, and in addition to nonresponse adjustment can optionally include features such as poststratification and weight trimming (Folsom and Singh, 2000).\nA literature review discovered two comparative studies of the weighting class approach versus alternative methods completed in 1994 using panel data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). SIPP was using a weighting class approach for nonresponse adjustment, and Folsom and Witt (1994) compared it to inverse response propensity weighting via generalized raking. They had mixed results and were not able to show any superiority for the response propensity approach over the weighting class approach. Rizzo et al. (1994) compared SIPP\u2019s weighting class approach with six alternative weighting schemes and concluded that the different methods produced similar estimates, the weights from the different methods were highly correlated with each other, and the variability of the weights was similar for all the weighting schemes.\nMore recently, Kalton and Flores-Cervantes (2003) compared eight weighting techniques: cell weighting, raking, linear weighting, GREG weighting, logistic regression weighting, a mixture of cell weighting and another method, logit weighting, and truncated linear weighting. They briefly described each adjustment method and illustrated its application with a simple example. They compared results across methods.\nIn comparing approaches to nonresponse adjustment, ELS:2002 data was used to examine the weight adjustment approaches. Appendix A presents an overview of ELS:2002. The adjustments are limited to student adjustments for students in public schools. Four weight adjustment methods are defined below.\nH-11\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n1.2 Description of Methods Studied\nFour weight adjustment approaches were examined:\n1. Weighting class adjustments, which are made by partitioning the sample into groups called weighting classes and adjusting the sample weights so that the sum of the weights of respondents equals the sum of the weights of respondents and nonrespondents for each cell.\n2. Raking, which is an iterative proportional fitting procedure where the respondent row totals are first forced to equal the sum of the weights of respondents and nonrespondents for the row. Then the respondent adjusted column totals are forced to equal the sum of the weights of respondents and nonrespondents for the column. These adjustments are repeated until convergence is reached. Raking controls at the margins and can also be done for more than two dimensions.\n3. Logistic regression, which uses auxiliary data to predict the response propensity of each sample member. The inverse of the respondent\u2019s predicted response propensity is the weight adjustment. The logistic approach is not a calibration method. Therefore, it does not force the weight sums to the marginal totals, but the weight sums are usually close to the marginal totals.\n4. GEM, which is a unified approach to nonresponse adjustment, poststratification, and extreme weight reduction. GEM is a general version of weight adjustments, and is based on a generalization of Deville and S\u00e4rndal\u2019s logit model (Deville and S\u00e4rndal 1992). The GEM approach controls at the margins, and adjustment factors can be constrained individually.\nWeighting class, raking, and GEM methods can be applied to poststratification as well as nonresponse adjustment. In poststratification, control totals are obtained from external sources believed to be the truth or at least much more precise than those based on the survey sample. Control totals for nonresponse adjustment are generated from the selected sample. The logistic regression modeling approach analyzes the selected sample and uses response as the dependent variable; this approach implicitly generates its own control totals based on the selected sample. Logistic regression does not naturally extend to poststratification.\nWeighting class methods are the simplest to implement and to explain (Chapman 1976). Adjustments are either based on a single dimension or performed at the cell level (fully interacted model basis) for multiway table controls. When alternative methods are applied at the fully interacted model level, they reduce to a weighting class approach, as shown in the following sections.\nRaking or iterative proportional fitting applies a weighting class approach in one dimension and then applies it to the adjusted weights in one or more other dimensions. The process controls marginal distributions only and continues until the cell-level adjustment stabilizes (Oh and Scheuren 1983). If applied in a single dimension (or at the cell level), it reduces to the weighting class method.\nLogistic regression or response propensity methods fit a logistic regression model to the selected sample to predict the probability of responding. Variables used as predictors in the logistic regression must be known for all members of the selected sample (both respondents and\nH-12\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\nnonrespondents). Although the predictor variables can be continuous or categorical, this report compares only categorical predictors with other methods. As mentioned above, logistic regression is not a calibration method.\n\nThe GEM method developed by Folsom and Singh (2000) is a generalization of a calibration model presented by Deville and S\u00e4rndal (1992) that allows bounds to be set on the adjustment factors. The form of the weight adjustment factors is\n\nak (\u03bb)\n\n=\n\nl(u \u2212 1) + u(1 \u2212 l)e Ax\u2032k\u03bb (u \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 l)e Axk\u2032 \u03bb\n\n,\n\nwhere l < 1 < u and A = (u \u2212 l) /[(u \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 l)] . The parameters, u and l, are user-specified bounds on the adjustment factors. The column vector, \u03bb , represents the model parameters corresponding to the covariate vector, x. The model parameters are obtained for poststratification by requiring that\n\n\u00a6 xk dk ak (\u03bb) = Tx\n\nrespondents\n\n,\n\nwhere Tx is a vector of poststratification totals.\n\nTwo special cases are used in this report. The first was identified in the DevilleS\u00e4rndal paper as l \u2192 0 and u \u2192 \u221e , ak (\u03bb) \u2192 e xk\u2032 \u03bb . This solution corresponds to the exponential\nmodel and in the limit yields the same results as the raking method.\n\nFolsom and Singh\u2019s GEM generalized the Deville-S\u00e4rndal calibration method by allowing unit-specific bounds on the adjustment factors and by adding a centering factor, ck .\n\nak\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n=\n\nlk\n\n(u k (u k\n\n\u2212 ck ) + uk (ck \u2212 lk )e Ak x\u2032k\u03bb \u2212 ck ) + (ck \u2212 lk )e Ak xk\u2032 \u03bb\n\nwith Ak = (uk \u2212 lk ) /[(uk \u2212 ck )(ck \u2212 lk )]. This model can be applied to either poststratification or\n\nnonresponse adjustment. For nonresponse adjustment, model parameters are obtained by solving\n\n\u00a6 xk\n\nd\n\nk\n\nak\n\n(\u03bb)\n\n=\n\n~ Tx\n\nrespondents\n\n,\n\nwhere T~x is a vector of sums based on the selected sample (using the design weights before\n\nadjustment). The second special case presented in this report is based on GEM. When allowing lk = 1, ck = 2 , and uk \u2192 \u221e , then ak (\u03bb) \u2192 1 + e xk\u03bb ; that is, the GEM solution approaches the\n\nsolution obtained by fitting the logistic regression model.\n\nResults from both special cases of GEM are presented below and compared with results from other nonresponse adjustment approaches.\n\nH-13\n\n\f\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\n2. Nonresponse Adjustment\nThe four nonresponse weight adjustment methods were compared using ELS:2002 data for students in public schools. No trimming of extreme weights is done in the initial comparisons of the methods. Section 3 describes the effect of weight trimming. Five different sets of variables were used to compare the four methods. Each of these five sets is described in the subsections below. For each of these four methods, the mean, minimum, median, and maximum adjustment factor and weight after adjustment were examined, as well as the unequal weighting effect (UWE). The relative root mean squared differences (RRMSD) between methods were also computed by squaring the difference of the weight for each observation from two methods, taking the average of this squared difference across all observations, and taking the square root of the average. This square root was then divided by the mean weight, which is approximately the same, regardless of adjustment method. The formula is\n\n\u00a6 ( X i \u2212 Yi )2\n\nn\n\nn\n\nRRMSD =\n\nX\n\n,\n\nwhere:\nXi = nonresponse adjusted weight for student i using one adjustment method;\nYi = nonresponse adjusted weight for student i using a second adjustment method;\nX = mean weight using any adjustment method; and\nn = number of responding students on the file.\n2.1 One Variable\nWhen the nonresponse adjustment uses one variable, the four adjustment methodologies produced identical results, within rounding error, except for the logistic regression method. The variable sex (male and female) was used for the adjustment using one variable. Table 1 shows the mean, minimum, median, and maximum adjustment factor and weight after adjustment and the UWE for each of the four methods. Table 2 displays the RRMSD between methods.\n2.2 Two Variables\nWhen the nonresponse adjustment uses two variables, the four adjustment methodologies can produce identical results, within rounding error, except for the logistic regression method. The variables sex (male and female) and race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Asian, Black, and White/other) were used for the adjustment using two variables. Tables 3 and 4 display the results of each method. As mentioned in section 1, GEM can be run to either be similar to the logistic approach or to raking. Typically, GEM is run to be similar to the logistic approach. To run GEM in a raking mode is similar to poststratification in GEM with control totals being set for sample totals. To produce results identical to weighting class, the GEM model needs to include the two-\n\nH-15\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\nway interaction term. The logistic method is slightly different from the weighting class method even when the interaction term is included. When the interaction term is excluded from the model the results are slightly different. The GEM, logistic, and weighting class methods are slightly different from each other. Without the interaction terms, the ranges of the adjustment factor and weight are a little narrower than for the model including the interaction term. When GEM is run to be similar to raking, the results between the two methods are the same, within rounding. These results are not identical to weighting class because interaction terms are excluded. For raking to be identical to weighting class, the raking is done within cells and not at the margins. The UWEs are nearly identical for all methods with and without interaction terms. The RRMSDs are about 0 when comparing all of the methods.\nH-16\n\n\fAppendix H.

In theory, if the four variables are fully interacted, the results are identical. In practice, however, the models have singularities when all the interactions are included, so the models cannot be fully interacted. The analytically important variables sex (male and female), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Asian, Black, and White/Other), region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), and metropolitan status (urban, suburban, and rural) were used for the adjustment using four variables. Tables 5 and 6 display the results of each method. For the weighting class method, cells need to be collapsed due to small sample sizes. For the variable metropolitan status, the categories suburban and rural were collapsed, and for the variable region, the categories Northeast and Midwest were collapsed. The other methods do not need to be collapsed. However, if variables are collapsed and interaction terms included, then GEM produces the same results as the weighting class. The logistic method has more narrow bounds on the adjustment factors and a slightly higher UWE than do the GEM and weighting class approaches. When the interaction terms are excluded from the models, the GEM, logistic, and raking methods produce results that are slightly different from each other and from the weighting class method. Without the interaction terms, the ranges of the adjustment factor and weight are a little narrower than for the model including the interaction term.\nWhen collapsing variables, the marginal totals of the collapsed variables do not equal the same values of the variables if not collapsed. Table 7 shows that weighting class and GEM with interactions and collapsing produce the same marginal totals. However, when compared with GEM without interactions and collapsing, the marginal totals differ, with relative differences ranging from 1 to 4 percent.\nThe RRMSDs are about 0.06 when comparing the weighting class approach with all three other methods without collapsing and without the interaction. The differences are closer to 0 when comparing the other approaches. Collapsing variables but still excluding the interaction term slightly reduces the differences. However, the addition of the interaction term causes the differences between GEM-logistic and weighting class to be about zero. The differences between the other approaches are between 0.04 and 0.05.\n\nH-18\n\n\fAppendix H.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n2.4 Six Variables\nNext, larger models were explored to show how the various methods handle more complex weight adjustments. To choose a larger number of variables, all 23 variables known for both the respondents and nonrespondents were included in GEM. Then the six significant variables were kept in the model, and the remaining non-significant variables were dropped from the model. These six variables are\n\u2022 sex (male and female)\n\u2022 region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West);\n\u2022 number of part-time teachers (0-1; 2-3; 4-6; > 6);\n\u2022 percentage of students with an IEP (< 6; 6-10; 11-15; > 15);\n\u2022 school level (K-12, PreK-10, 1-12; PreK/1-9/12, PreK-12; middle grades but no elementary; only high school); and\n\u2022 10th-grade enrollment (0-99; 100-249; 250-499, > 499).\nWhen the nonresponse adjustment uses six variables, the four adjustment methodologies can produce identical results, except for the logistic regression method. As with the four-variable model, singularity in the models prevents the results from being identical because the models cannot be fully interacted. For the weighting class method, cells need to be collapsed due to small sample sizes. Given six variables, the cell sizes are smaller; thus more collapsing is needed than in the four-variable model. The other methods do not need to be collapsed. Tables 8 and 9 display the results of each method. When all methods include collapsed variables, the mean adjustment factors are close. The UWEs are also close. The addition of the six-variable interaction term caused the GEM and logistic models to have larger mean and maximum adjustment factors and smaller UWEs than prior to adding the interaction. The adjustment factor ranges are narrower for the weighting class approach than for the other approaches. For all models, except the logistic models, the mean weights are equal within rounding.\nThe RRMSDs are between 0.07 and 0.08 when comparing the weighting class approach with all three other methods without collapsing and without the interaction term. The differences are about 0.02 when comparing raking with GEM-logistic and logistic and about 0.00 when comparing GEM-logistic and logistic. Collapsing variables but still excluding the interaction term decreases all of the differences. However, the addition of the interaction term causes some of the differences to increase. The difference between GEM-logistic and logistic is still about zero.\n2.5 Eight Variables\nAs an alternative method for choosing a larger number of variables for a more complex nonresponse adjustment, all 23 variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents were included in a Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), which is a tree analysis. With response as the dependent model variable, eight significant variables were identified and included in each nonresponse adjustment method. These eight variables are\n\u2022 metropolitan status (urban, suburban, and rural);\n\u2022 region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West);\nH-20\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\u2022 number of full-time teachers (1-40; 41-70; 71-100; > 100);\n\u2022 percentage of full-time teachers certified (0-90; 91-99; 100);\n\u2022 number of part-time teachers (0-1; 2-3; 4-6; > 6);\n\u2022 percentage of students with an IEP (< 6; 6-10; 11-15; > 15);\n\u2022 total enrollment (< 601; 601-1,200; 1,201-1,800; > 1,800); and\n\u2022 number of class periods (1-4; 5-6; 7; 8-9).\nWhen the nonresponse adjustment uses eight variables, the four adjustment methodologies can produce identical results, except for the logistic regression method. As with the four- and six-variable models, singularity in the models prevents the results from being identical because the models cannot be fully interacted. For the weighting class method, cells need to be collapsed due to small sample sizes. The other methods do not need to be collapsed. Tables 10 and 11 display the results of each method. When all methods include collapsed variables, the mean adjustment factors are close. The UWEs are also close. The adjustment factor range is wider for the weighting class approach than for the other approaches, but the weight range is narrower. The addition of the eight-variable interaction term causes the GEM and logistic models to have the mean adjustment factor and weight range decrease but the maximum adjustment factor and UWE increase. For all models, except the logistic models, the mean weights are equal within rounding.\nWhen collapsing variables, the marginal totals of the collapsed variables do not equal the same values of the variables if not collapsed. Many variables were collapsed. The marginal totals were examined for the metropolitan status categories of suburban and rural being collapsed together and the region categories of Northeast collapsed with Midwest, and South collapsed with West. Table 12 shows that weighting class and GEM with interactions and collapsing produce different marginal totals. Also, when compared with GEM without interactions and collapsing, the marginal totals differ, with relative differences ranging from 0.01 percent to 6 percent.\nA benefit of both the logistic and GEM approaches is that adjustment factors can be constrained to not be too high. They can also be constrained to not be too low, although nonresponse adjustment factors typically have a lower bound of one. Without the constraints, the adjustment factors are not considered too high in this example. However, for illustration, upper bound constraints were added. As seen in table 10, the constraints have minimal effect on the bounds, weights, and UWEs.\nThe RRMSDs are about 0.14 when comparing the weighting class approach with all three other methods without collapsing and without the interaction term. The differences are about 0.02 when comparing raking with GEM-logistic and logistic, and about 0.00 when comparing GEM-logistic with logistic. Collapsing variables but still excluding the interaction term decreases the differences with weighting class but increases the differences between raking and both GEM-logistic and logistic. The addition of the interaction term increases the differences between raking and both GEM-logistic and logistic. The differences between the other methods do not change or do not change much.\nH-21\n\n\fAppendix H.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\n2.6 Summary\nThe four adjustment methods produce similar results. For the logistic and GEM methods to be close to the raking and weighting class methods, the n-way interaction term needs to be included, where n is the number of variables in the adjustment. GEM can be run to be similar to either the logistic or raking methods. As the number of variables included in the nonresponse adjustment grows, the weighting class method needs to collapse variables due to small cell sizes, where the other methods do not necessarily need collapsing. It can take a long time to determine the appropriate cells for collapsing and then to program the collapsing. Collapsing causes the marginal totals to differ from the sample totals. Different variable selection methods can produce different numbers of variables to include in the nonresponse adjustment and can affect how similar the methods are. Given a dataset with over 12,000 records, the mean, minimum, median, and maximum adjustment factors generally do not vary considerably between methods. The weight ranges and UWEs generally do not vary much either, but there are times when the range is larger for GEM and logistic than for raking and weighting class. The RRMSDs between the methods do increase as more variables are included in the adjustment. GEM-logistic and logistic usually produce similar, but not identical, results. Some additional differences between these methods arise during weight trimming, as described in section 3.\nIf the model is expanded to include all variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents, then the GEM and logistic methods without any interaction terms or collapsing produce results that are close to each other. Table 13 displays the results for the GEM and logistic full models. However, weighting class adjustment becomes too complex due to the large amount of collapsing necessary.\n\nTable 13.\u0003 Summary statistics for weight adjustments with all variables included: 2005\n\nAdjustment factor\n\nType of weight adjustment Mean Maximum Minimum Median\n\nGEM\u2014logistic full model 1.1509\n\n2.0415 1.0175 1.1314\n\nLogistic full model\n\n1.1505\n\n1.8477 1.0192 1.1320\n\nNOTE: GEM = Generalized Exponential Model; UWE = unequal weighting effect.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n3. Weight Trimming\nExtreme weights often occur in survey data due to small probabilities of sample selection or due to weight adjustments. These extreme weights (either very small or very large) can significantly increase the variance of estimates. One way to account for this and decrease the variance is to trim and smooth extreme weights within prespecified domains. Note that trimming weights has the potential to increase bias. However, the increase in bias is often offset by the decrease in variance due to weight trimming. As a result, this reduces the mean square error (MSE) of an estimate, defined as variance plus bias squared.\n3.1 Determined by GEM\nThere are different techniques to identify extreme weights (outliers), including using the UWE, MSE, or interquartile range (IQR). GEM uses the median +/- X * IQR, where X is any number, typically between 2 and 3. There are also different points in the weight adjustment process where weight trimming can occur. GEM has options to make adjustments for extreme weights as part of the nonresponse and as part of the poststratification. For GEM, a variable or set of variables is selected to be used to identify extreme weights within each level of the variable(s).\nThe variable race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Asian, Black, and White/other) was chosen for GEM to use to identify outliers. Prior to running GEM, the unweighted and weighted percentages of extreme weights were examined for all four levels of race using various values to multiply by the IQR (2.0, 2.1, 2.2,\u2026,4.0). The median +/- 2.5 multiplied by the IQR was used to identify 3.11 percent unweighted and 9.79 percent weighted of the students having extreme weights. Within each race category, the unweighted percentages ranged from 1.06 to 3.91, and the weighted percentages ranged from 3.07 to 12.00.\n3.2 Determined by Interquartile Range (IQR)\nFor the weighting class, logistic, and raking methods, the median +/- 2.5 multiplied by the IQR was also used to identify extreme weights to be consistent with and allow comparisons to the GEM method. However, these methods could not adjust for the extreme weights while simultaneously adjusting for nonresponse. Instead, the adjustment for extreme weights was done prior to nonresponse adjustment.\n3.3 Results\nTo compare the results among the four methods, the eight-variable model with collapsed cells and the eight-variable interaction term included was used. As shown with the nonresponse models, all four adjustment methodologies do not produce identical results. Tables 14 and 15 display the results of each method. The mean adjustment factors are close for all methods except the GEM method, which was larger. However, the ranges of the adjustment factors and weights vary, with the weighting class method having the widest weight range. GEM has a much lower minimum adjustment factor than the other methods, due to the trimming adjustment being part of the nonresponse adjustment. The GEM and logistic methods have the largest maximum adjustment factor. The mean weight is identical within rounding for all of the methods, except\nH-25\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\nfor the logistic method. The UWEs are also close for all four of the methods. The RRMSDs are between 0.08 and 0.11 when comparing weighting class to the other methods.\nA benefit of both the logistic and GEM approaches is that extreme weight and nonresponse adjustment factors can be constrained to not be too high or too low. Nonextreme nonresponse adjustment factors typically have a lower bound of one. Without the constraints, the adjustment factors are not considered too low or too high in this example. However, for illustration, constraints were added. As seen in table 14, the constraints have minimal effect on the bounds, weights, and UWEs.\n\nTable 14.\u0003 Summary statistics for weight adjustments with weight trimming: 2005\n\nAdjustment factor\n\nType of weight adjustment\n\nMean\n\nMaximum\n\nMini- Median mum\n\nGEM\u2014logistic\n\n1.1774 2.0000 0.0850 1.1859\n\nLogistic\n\n1.1469 2.0000 1.0003 1.1630\n\nWeighting class\n\n1.1478 1.6547 1.0000 1.1248\n\nRaking\n\n1.1466 1.2855 1.0395 1.1457\n\nGEM\u2014logistic with tighter bounds\n\n1.1774 2.0000 0.0848 1.1859\n\nNOTE: GEM = Generalized Exponential Model; UWE = unequal weighting effect.

Poststratification\n\n4.1 Control Totals\nPoststratification to control totals is done in some surveys to adjust the weights to match known population totals. The ELS:2002 student data was not poststratified, because there were no known population totals. Logistic models cannot be used for poststratification, so an exponential model was used instead. For the sake of comparing the four methods, control totals were formed using the ELS:2002 final weights. These final weights differ from the weights generated by GEM in these examples because ELS:2002 used two nonresponse models and more variables in the nonresponse models. Appendix A and the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File Users Manual provide more details. Two sets of control totals were used to compare the methods. One set of control totals was for the separate variables sex and race/ethnicity. The second set was for the cross of sex and race/ethnicity (i.e., race*sex). Weighting class and raking used the interaction race*sex, whereas GEM and exponential control at the margins and could use either of the two sets.\n\n4.2 Results\nTo compare the results among the four methods, the eight-variable model with collapsed cells and the eight-variable interaction term included was used. As shown with the nonresponse models, all four adjustment methodologies do not produce identical results. Tables 16 and 17 display the results for each method. The mean adjustment factors are close, with the raking method having the smallest mean. The UWEs range from 1.59 for weighting class to 1.73 for raking. The ranges of the adjustment factors and weights are largest for raking. The weighting class method has the smallest maximum weight. The mean weight is identical for all four methods. The RRMSDs are about 0.10 when comparing weighting class to GEM-exponential. When comparing raking to the other three methods, the RRMSDs are between 0.34 and 0.35.\nFor all models, the mean weights were equal. For the various collapsed and uncollapsed models with and without interactions, GEM-exponential and exponential produced similar adjustment factors and an RRMSD of about zero.\n\nTable 16.\u0003 Summary statistics for weight adjustments with postratification: 2005\n\nAdjustment factor\n\nType of weight adjustment\n\nMean\n\nMinimum\n\nMaxi- Median mum\n\nGEM\u2014exponential with sex and race\n\n1.0037 0.9817\n\n1.0489 1.0022\n\nExponential with sex and race 1.0037 0.9818\n\n1.0491 1.0022\n\nRaking\n\n1.0009 0.2939\n\n1.1693 1.1331\n\nGEM\u2014exponential with sex*race\n\n1.0038 0.9847\n\n1.0543 0.9992\n\nExponential with sex*race\n\n1.0038 0.9847\n\n1.0543 0.9992\n\nWeighting class\n\n1.0043 0.9829\n\n1.0543 0.9961\n\nNOTE: GEM = Generalized Exponential Model; UWE = unequal weighting effect.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n5. Nonresponse Bias Analysis\n5.1 Overview\nUnit nonresponse causes bias in survey estimates when the outcomes of respondents and nonrespondents are different. For ELS:2002, student response is defined as the student completing at least a specified portion of the student questionnaire. The overall student response rate was above 85 percent overall. In addition to comparing the weight adjustment factors, weights, and UWEs across the four methods, the reduction in nonresponse bias was also analyzed. The nonresponse bias was estimated for 22 variables that were known for both respondents and nonrespondents (including the 8 variables used in the model) because one purpose of the nonresponse adjustments was to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the adjustments. Variables not known for most respondents and nonrespondents could not be included in the nonresponse adjustments, and therefore nonresponse bias could not explicitly be reduced for these variables.\nFirst, for the 22 variables, the nonresponse bias was estimated prior to weight adjustments and tested to determine if the bias was significant at the 5 percent level. After the weights were computed, remaining bias for the 22 variables was estimated and statistically tested to check if there was any remaining significant nonresponse bias.\nThe bias in an estimated mean based on respondents, yR , is the difference between this mean and the target parameter, \u03c0; that is, the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of the target population was conducted. This bias can be expressed as follows:\nB ( yR ) = yr \u2212\u03c0 .\nThe estimated mean based on nonrespondents, yNR , can be computed if data for the particular variable for most of the nonrespondents is available. The estimation of \u03c0 is as follows:\n\u03c0\u02c6 = (1\u2212\u03b7 ) yR +\u03b7 yNR ,\nwhere \u03b7 is the weighted unit nonresponse rate. For the variables that are from the frame rather than from the sample, \u03c0 can be estimated without sampling error. Therefore, the bias before weight adjustments can be estimated as follows:\nB\u02c6 ( yR ) = yR \u2212\u03c0\u02c6\nor equivalently\nB\u02c6 ( yR ) = \u03b7 ( yR \u2212 yNR ) .\nThis formula shows that the estimate of the nonresponse bias is the difference between the mean for respondents and nonrespondents multiplied by the weighted nonresponse rate. The variance of the bias was computed using Taylor Series estimation in RTI\u2019s software package SUDAAN.\nThe bias after weight adjustments was computed as the difference between the estimate using nonresponse-adjusted (final) weights and the estimate using the design (base) weights prior\nH-29\n\n\fAppendix H. Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n\nto nonresponse adjustment. This latter estimate is an estimate of \u03c0 because it is the estimate of the target population using the design weights.\n\n5.2 Results\nTable 18 summarizes the nonresponse bias before and after weight adjustments for each method. The mean and median relative bias, as well as the percent significant, are shown across all 22 variables. Statistical tests (t tests) were used to test each level of the variables for significance of the bias at the 0.05/(c \u2013 1) significance level, where c is the number of categories (levels) within the primary variable. The weight before weight adjustments did not depend on the adjustment method, so the before-weight adjustment numbers are identical across all four methods. The after-weight adjustment numbers are similar across all four methods with the GEM and logistic results almost identical. The weighting class percent significant bias is the lowest among the four methods, and the raking percent significant bias is the highest among the four methods.\n\nTable 18.\u0003 Summary of nonresponse bias analysis by weight adjustment method: 2005\n\nNonresponse bias statistics Before weight adjustments Mean estimated relative bias Median estimated relative bias Percent significant bias\n\nGEM\u2014logistic\n-0.0006 -0.0003\n35.5\n\nLogistic\n-0.0006 -0.0003\n35.5\n\nWeighting class\n-0.0006 -0.0003\n35.5\n\nAfter weight adjustments\nMean estimated relative bias Median estimated relative bias Percent significant bias NOTE: GEM = Generalized Exponential Model.

Propensity Models Versus Weighting Cell Approaches to Nonresponse Adjustment: A Methodological Comparison\n6. Summary\n6.1 Advantages/Disadvantages of Each Method\nAs described in the sections above, all four of the weight adjustment methods generally produce similar results, with more differences in weights appearing as more variables are included in the adjustments. The weighting class and raking methods get more complex as more variables are added. Generally, depending on the sample size, the weighting class approach needs collapsing as cell sizes get small. The process of collapsing cells can be tedious and time consuming. The weighting class approach allows only the interaction term that includes all variables. The raking and GEM approaches control at the margins as opposed to controlling at the cell level. The logistic method does not force the weight sums to the marginal totals, but the weight sums are usually close to the marginal totals. Many variables, including main effects and any important interaction terms (two-way, three-way, etc.) can be included in the GEM and logistic approaches. These two models can be easily reduced if the model does not converge or if non-significant variables are not desired. The output from the programs shows the variables that are causing the convergence problems and variables that are not significant.\nAs the survey becomes more complex, (i.e. larger sample size and more candidate variables for nonresponse adjustment) then a modeling approach may be preferred. However, if the sample size is small or if only a small number of variables are known for both respondents and nonrespondents, then a weighting class or raking approach may be preferred to the more complex modeling methods.\nThe GEM approach incorporates specific lower and upper bounds separately for extreme and nonextreme weights. An important application of this feature is to identify at each adjustment step an initial set of cases with extreme weights and to use specific bounds to exercise control over the final adjusted weights. Thus, there is built-in control for extreme weights.\n6.2 Suggestions for Future Work\nThe work presented in this report shows the similarities and difference among four weight adjustment methods. Additional models can be run with variations, including different numbers of variables, different bounds on adjustment factors, different control totals, and different techniques for variable selection and extreme weight identification. Additionally there may be other analyses for the results to compare the methods, including looking at the mean squared error (MSE) and a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.\nH-31\n\n\f\fAppendix H.

Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nA number of composite variables (also called derived, constructed, or created variables) were generated in the ELS:2002 second follow-up to facilitate analysis. The second follow-up composite variables are listed in this appendix. In a few cases, the variable appears only on the restricted-use electronic codebook (ECB), not on the Data Analysis System (DAS). Appendix L provides information about the status (included versus excluded) of each second follow-up variable in relation to the DAS. In addition to composite variables, second follow-up weights and flags are included.\nG12COHRT This variable indicates whether the sample member is a Senior Cohort member (i.e., a\nspring 2004 12th-grader). F1-identified senior cohort members include F1 respondents and baseyear schools, as well as those who transferred, if they indicated they were 12th-graders. Spring 2004 grade was imputed where missing for F1 respondents (see also F1GRADE/F2F1GRDE). G12COHRT has also been updated since the first follow-up version to identify F1 nonrespondents whose second follow-up or transcript information indicates they were in fact spring 2004 12th-graders. Values of 2 also include freshened cases who were F1 questionnaire ineligible.\nUse G12COHRT in concert with F1, transcript, or F2 weights to get an appropriately weighted sample that generalizes to the 2004 spring-term senior class. For example, G12COHRT used with F1QWT generates estimates for a nationally representative, cross-sectional population of the 2004 spring-term senior class. G12COHRT>0 used with F2F1WT generates estimates for a nationally representative panel of the spring-term senior class, including F1 nonrespondents.\nTXACTC Most recent ACT composite test score as provided by ACT or the sample member\u2019s high\nschool transcript.\nTXACTM Most recent ACT math component test score as provided by ACT or the sample\nmember\u2019s high school transcript.\nTXACTR Most recent ACT reading component test score as provided by ACT or the sample\nmember\u2019s high school transcript.\nTXACTE Most recent ACT English component test score as provided by ACT or the sample\nmember\u2019s high school transcript.\nTXACTS Most recent ACT science component test score as provided by ACT or the sample\nmember\u2019s high school transcript.\nM-3\n\n\fAppendix M.

F2NRSTAT\nReason for nonresponse to second follow-up survey, if applicable, as indicated in Survey Control System. Available only on restricted-use file.\nM-10\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2QSTAT Indicates whether the sample member completed entire interview, partial interview, or no\ninterview.\nF2QMODE The second follow-up survey employed a single web-based survey instrument used\nacross three modes: self-administration, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and field interviewing.\nF2RTYPE This variable classifies respondents on the basis of their postsecondary participation and\nthe timing of their postsecondary enrollment. Categories include: 1. Standard enrollee: indicates a respondent with \u201cimmediate\u201d postsecondary enrollment, who has continued their enrollment into 2006. Respondents are considered to have \u201cimmediate\u201d enrollment if their postsecondary attendance began by October of their high school completion/exit year (if their high school completion/ exit date was between January and July), or by the following February (if their high school completion/exit date was after July). 2. Delayer: indicates a respondent with delayed postsecondary enrollment. Respondents are considered to have delayed enrollment when they did not begin their postsecondary attendance by October of their high school completion/exit year (if their high school completion/exit date was between January and July), or by the following February (if their high school completion/exit date was after July). The Delayer designation (as opposed to Delayer-Leaver; see below) also indicates the respondent\u2019s postsecondary enrollment continued into 2006. 3. Leaver: indicates a respondent with \u201cimmediate\u201d postsecondary enrollment (as with Standard enrollee), but has no 2006 enrollment. 4. Delayer-Leaver: indicates a respondent with delayed postsecondary enrollment (as with Delayer), and has no 2006 enrollment. 5. Nonenrollee: indicates a respondent who has not enrolled in a postsecondary institution since leaving high school. 6. High school student: indicates a respondent still enrolled in high school. Note: F2HSCPDR is used as the high school completion/exit date for respondents who\nhave received a high school credential; F2HSLVDR is used as the high school completion/exit date for respondents who have not received a high school credential.\nF2SEX Updates F1SEX with information from second follow-up interviewers and/or respondents\nwho reported that F1SEX was incorrect (F1SEX was used as a survey instrument input for customized question wording).\nM-11\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2EVERDO\nIndicates whether the sample member has dropped out at some point in time. Cases identified by F1EVERDO as \u201cever dropouts\u201d remain as such in F2EVERDO; these cases include student-reported dropouts (as reported via F1 participation; note, however, that F1 student, transfer, and homeschool questionnaire respondents were not asked whether they had had a dropout episode), and school-reported dropouts(as reported at any of the three enrollment status updates). F1EVERDO is then updated with second follow-up and transcript information as follows: first follow-up nonrespondents who reported in the second follow-up that they were not in school during the spring term of 2004 (F2A12=5) or that they were out for 4 or more weeks during that term (F2A13=1) are classified as \u201cever dropouts.\u201d Also classified as \u201cever dropouts\u201d are second follow-up respondents who reported that they had completed a GED since they were last interviewed (F2A02=3), or they had not received a high school credential and were not in a high school completion program (F2A07=3 or 4). Finally, cases where the sample member\u2019s transcript indicates that the sample member dropped out, received a GED, was dismissed, or incarcerated (F1RTROUT=8, 12, 14,or 15, respectively) are coded as \u201cever dropouts\u201d in F2EVERDO.\nF2DOSTAT\nDropout status as of the second follow-up interview. Based on F2HSSTAT and F2EVERDO.\nF2SP04DO\nThis variable categorizes spring-term 2004 dropouts and early alternative completers as identified in the first follow-up, or identified retrospectively via the second follow-up interview or transcript data. F1 dropout questionnaire completers are coded as \u201cF1 identified spring-term 2004 dropouts\u201d (see also F1DOQFLG). F1early graduate questionnaire completers who had earned a GED are coded as \u201cF1 identified early GED recipients\u201d (see also F1EGQFLG).\nF1 student and transfer questionnaire completers who reported in F2 having dropped out in spring 2004 subsequent to F1 participation are coded as \u201cF2 identified spring-term 2004 dropouts.\u201d F1 nonrespondents are also classified as \u201cF2 identified spring-term 2004 dropouts\u201d when reporting in F2 either: (1) they dropped out of school prior to May 2004 (and had not received a GED before April 2004) (F2A11), (2) they were not in school during the spring term of 2004 (F2A12), or (3) they were out of school for 4 or more consecutive weeks during the spring term of 2004 for reasons other than illness or injury (F2A13). Finally, F1 nonrespondents are classified as \u201cF2 identified early GED recipients\u201d if they reported in the second follow-up interview that they had earned a GED prior to April 2004 (F2A02 and F2A03). When missing relevant F2 data (as a result of item or unit nonresponse), first follow-up nonrespondents are classified as early alternative completers if their transcript indicates receipt of a GED prior to April 2004.\nNote: F2SP04DO updates F1DOSTAT.\nF2F1GRDE\nHigh school grade level in the spring term of 2004. For first follow-up respondents who were in school in the spring term of 2004 (i.e., F1 student and transfer questionnaire completers),\nM-12\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2F1GRDE is set to F1GRADE; first follow-up respondents who were not in school in the spring term of 2004 (i.e., F1 early graduate, dropout, and home school questionnaire completers) are assigned a F2F1GRDE value of -3. F2F1GRDE updates F1GRADE for first follow-up nonrespondents as follows: first follow-up nonrespondents who completed high school with a diploma or certificate of attendance in April, May, or June 2004 as reported in the second followup interview (F2A02 and F2A03) or on their high school transcript (F1RTROUT and F1RDTLFT) were logically imputed as 12th-graders. All other first follow-up nonrespondents who reported in F2 being in school during the spring term of 2004 were directly asked for their grade level at that time (F2A12). Finally, first follow-up nonrespondents who were found to be early graduates or spring-term 2004 dropouts (see F2SP04DO) were assigned a value of -3.\nF2HSSTAT\nFirst follow-up, transcript, and second follow-up data are all used as inputs for F2HSSTAT. First follow-up data are used in cases where respondents indicated during the first follow-up that they had already received a high school credential; transcript data (as preloaded for the F2 instrument) are used in cases where respondents\u2019 transcripts indicated they received a May or June 2004 diploma or certificate of attendance (see also F2PHSDG and F2PHSDT). For second follow-up respondents for whom neither of these conditions apply, F2HSSTAT is determined by the following variables: type of high school credential received (F2A02); high school credential date (F2A03); or, for respondents who had not yet received a high school credential, whether they are currently pursuing any such credential (F2A07). For second followup nonrespondents, F2HSSTAT is determined by transcript or first follow-up data (if they indicate a final high school completion status).\nNote: There are a small set of cases where F2HSSTAT is set to 1, 2, or 3 as a result of a re-examination of transcript information during F2 data editing activities. This small set of cases is made up of F2 nonrespondents who did not indicate receipt of a high school credential during F1 participation (or were F1 nonrespondents), and where F1RTROUT=8 (dropped out) or 9 (transferred).\nF2EDLEVL\nThis variables indicates the highest level of education attempted by the sample member, as of the second follow-up. For respondents who have attended a postsecondary institution (F2B07=1), F2EDLEVL is determined by the highest level among the respondent\u2019s attended institution(s) (F2ILEVEL). For respondents who have not attended a postsecondary institution, F2EDLEVL is determined by their 2006 high school completion status (F2HSSTAT).\nNote: Not completing high school does not preclude postsecondary enrollment; therefore, a non-high school completer may have an F2EDLEVL value of 4, 5, or 6.\nF2HIGRDE\nThe most advanced high school grade level attempted as of the second follow-up interview. For respondents in high school at the time of the second follow-up interview (F2A07=1 or 2), this is their current grade level in 2006. For second follow-up respondents who have not received a high school credential and are not in a high school completion program (F2A07=3 or 4), this is the grade they were in when they last attended high school. It is drawn\nM-13\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\ndirectly from F2A08. If F2A08 indicates a grade which is less than F2F1GRDE (the respondent\u2019s spring 2004 grade level), then F2HIGRDE is set to F2F1GRDE.\nNote: This variable differs from other F2 high school composite variables in that it is not applicable to F2 nonrespondents.\nF2HSCPDR\nYear and month the respondent completed high school with a diploma, certificate of attendance, or GED (YYYYMM format). Available only on the restricted-use file; public-use version of this variable is F2HSCPDP. First follow-up, transcript, and second follow-up data are all used as inputs for F2HSCPDR. First follow-up data are used in cases where the respondent indicated during the first follow-up he or she had already received a high school credential; otherwise, preloaded transcript data (see also F2PHSDT) are used for cases where respondents\u2019 transcripts indicated they received a May or June 2004 diploma or certificate of attendance. For second follow-up respondents for whom neither of these conditions apply, F2HSCPDR is determined by the high school credential date as reported in the second follow-up (F2A03). For second follow-up nonrespondents, F2HSCPDR is determined by transcript data (if they indicate a final high school completion status).\nF2HSCPDP\nYear and quarter the respondent completed high school with a diploma, certificate of attendance, or GED (YYYYQ format). First follow-up, transcript, and second follow-up data are all used as inputs for F2HSCPDP. First follow-up data are used in cases where the respondent indicated during the first follow-up he or she had already received a high school credential; otherwise, transcript data are used for cases where the respondent\u2019s preloaded transcript data (see also F2PHSDT) indicated he or she received a May or June 2004 diploma or certificate of attendance. For second follow-up respondents for whom neither of these conditions apply, F2HSCPDP is determined by the high school credential date as reported in the second follow-up (F2A03). For second follow-up nonrespondents, F2HSCPDP is determined by transcript data (if they indicate a final high school completion status).\nF2HSLVDR\nYear and month last attended high school (YYYYMM format) for sample members who have not completed high school, or sample members who dropped out of high school and subsequently earned a GED. Leave dates are taken from the first follow-up interview for early GED recipients (i.e., those who received a GED prior to March 16, 2004) (F1E20 or F1D19), and from the second follow-up interview for respondents who had earned a GED since their last interview and current dropouts (F2A11). Available only on the restricted-use file; public-use version of this variable is F2HSLVDP.\nF2HSLVDP\nYear and quarter last attended high school (YYYYQ format) for sample members who have not completed high school, or sample members who dropped out of high school and subsequently earned a GED.

The \u201cinclusive,\u201d \u201cmoderately selective,\u201d and \u201chighly selective\u201d categories correspond to 25th percentile ACT-equivalent scores of less than 18, 18\u201321, and greater than 21, respectively. Based on the IPEDS variable CCUGPROF (Carnegie Classification 2005: Undergraduate Profile).\nM-19\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2EVRATT\nThis variable indicates whether the respondent has ever attended a postsecondary institution since high school completion/exit; taken directly from the second follow-up interview (F2B07) if available, and imputed for second follow-up respondents if missing.\nF2PS1\nThis variable stores the location on the institution file (see also F2IORDER) of the first \u201creal\u201d postsecondary institution attended by the respondent. This institution is referenced in questions corresponding to variables F2B13A\u2013F, F2B14, F2B15, F2B16A\u2013C, F2B17A\u2013D, and F2B18A\u2013G. In most cases, the first \u201creal\u201d institution is the institution with the earliest start date (and will therefore appear first on the ELS institution file, i.e. F2IORDER=1). An exception is made, however, if (1) the first chronological institution (as opposed to the first \u201creal\u201d institution) is a summer school (defined as an institution with a start date of May, June, or July, and a sameyear end date of May, June, July, or August); (2) the summer school was attended in the same year as high school completion/exit; and (3) a second postsecondary institution (with longer total enrollment) was also started in August, September, or October of that same year. If all the above conditions are met, the post-summer school institution is identified in F2PS1. If the earliest start date is shared by more than one institution, the one with the longest enrollment period is identified in F2PS1.\nNote: The institution identified in F2PS1 was selected by the F2 survey instrument based on enrollment information provided by the respondent; this institution was selected during the F2 interview and determined which institution was referenced in questions associated with variables F2B13A\u2013F, F2B14, F2B15, F2B16A\u2013C, F2B17A\u2013D, and F2B18A\u2013G.\nF2PS1LVL\nLevel of the first postsecondary institution attended (F2PS1), as indicated by IPEDS; for institutions with no IPEDS code, institutional level (if available) was provided by the respondent.\nF2PS1CTR\nControl of the first postsecondary institution attended (F2PS1) as indicated by IPEDS. For institutions with no IPEDS code, institutional control (if available) was provided by the respondent.\nF2PS1SEC\nSector of the first postsecondary institution attended (F2PS1) as indicated by IPEDS. For institutions with no IPEDS code, institutional sector (if available) was provided by the respondent.\nF2PS1SLC\nMeasure of the admissions selectivity (based on 2005 Carnegie classifications) of the first attended institution (F2PS1).\nInstitutions identified as 4-year schools via IPEDS data are further classified as highly selective, moderately selective, or inclusive according to the Carnegie selectivity measure; institutions identified as 4-year schools via IPEDS data with unknown Carnegie selectivity (or\nM-20\n\n\fAppendix M.

The \u201cinclusive,\u201d \u201cmoderately selective,\u201d and \u201chighly selective\u201d categories correspond to 25th percentile ACT-equivalent scores of less than 18, 18\u201321, and greater than 21, respectively. Based on the IPEDS variable CCUGPROF (Carnegie Classification 2005: Undergraduate Profile).\nF2PS1GRT Indicates whether the respondent was offered a first-year scholarship or grant by his or\nher first-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1).\nF2PS1LN Indicates whether the respondent was offered a first-year student loan or grant by his or\nher first-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1).\nF2PS1WKS Indicates whether the respondent was offered a first-year work study or grant by his or\nher first-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1).\nF2PS1WVR Indicates whether the respondent was offered a first-year tuition or grant by his or her\nfirst-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1).\nF2PS1AID Indicates whether the respondent was offered financial aid for his or her first year by his\nor her first \u201creal\u201d postsecondary institution attended (see also F2PS1). \u201cFinancial aid\u201d here refers to the particular forms of aid detailed in F2PS1GRT, F2PS1LN, F2PS1WKS, and F2PS1WVR; that is, scholarship/grant, loan, work study, and tuition waiver/discount (respectively). Respondents who were not offered any of these forms of aid will be coded in F2PS1AID as \u201cno aid offered,\u201d although it is possible they were offered some other form of financial aid not specifically referred to in the F2 instrument.\nNote: Implicit in categories 1\u20134 is that the respondent did in fact apply for admission to his or her first \u201creal\u201d postsecondary institution attended. Application is based on student report (F2IAPPLY). Some students will perceive registration at an open admissions institution as an instance of application (these cases can be identified through F2IOPNAP, which indicates which institutions have open admissions policies).\nF2PS1FTP Enrollment intensity at the first-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1).\nM-21\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2PS1OUT Indicates whether the state of the first-attended postsecondary institution (F2PS1) differs\nfrom the state associated with the respondent\u2019s first follow-up residential zip code; for cases where the F1 residential zip code is not available, the base-year residential zip code is substituted.\nF2PSSTRT First period of attendance at the respondent\u2019s first attended postsecondary institution (see\nalso F2PS1). Note: Second follow-up data collection spanned from January through August 2006;\ninformation on the respondent\u2019s 2006 postsecondary enrollment is therefore dependent on the date of his or her F2 participation. As a result, \u201c2006\u201d has been constructed as a single time period rather than using the cut-points employed for 2004 and 2005.\nF2HS2PS1 Number of months between high school completion/exit and the respondent\u2019s first\nenrollment at his or her first attended postsecondary institution (see also F2PS1). F2HSCPDR is used as the high school completion/exit date for respondents who have earned a high school credential; F2HSLVDR is used for respondents who have not earned a high school credential.\nNote: Sample members who reported enrolling in postsecondary education while in high school but left prior to high school completion/exit, and did not subsequently enroll in any postsecondary education, are recorded as missing (-9).\nF2PSYR1 Number of months with attendance at any postsecondary institution during the first 12\nmonths after high school completion/exit. F2HSCPDR is used as the high school completion/exit date for respondents who have received a high school credential; F2HSLVDR is used as the high school completion/exit date for respondents who have not received a high school credential. For respondents with postsecondary enrollment during the month of their high school completion/ exit, F2PSYR1 is calculated beginning with that month. For respondents who were not enrolled in a postsecondary institution during the month of their high school completion/exit, F2PSYR1 is calculated beginning with the month following their high school completion/exit.\nF2PSEND Last period of attendance at any postsecondary institution. Note: Second follow-up data collection spanned from January through August 2006;\ninformation on the respondent\u2019s 2006 postsecondary enrollment is therefore dependent on the date of his or her F2 participation. As a result, \u201c2006\u201d has been constructed as a single time period rather than using the cut-points employed for 2004 and2005.\nF2PSMO45 Number of months with attendance at any postsecondary institution during the 2004\u201305\nschool year (from July 2004 [F2PS0407] through June 2005 [F2PS0506]). Values are calculated\nM-22\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nfor all second follow-up respondents with postsecondary enrollment, regardless of their high school completion status and/or high school exit date.\nF2ENRGAP This variable indicates a gap in postsecondary enrollment across institutions; a gap is\ndefined as a period of nonenrollment lasting 4 or more consecutive months (excluding June and July), with episodes of postsecondary attendance both before and after the gap. Sample members with a gap in enrollment (F2ENRGAP=1) who had not switched schools (F2SWITCH=1) are the group of respondents who were asked their reasons for taking a break from postsecondary school (F2B19A\u2013F2B19K).\nNote: F2ENRGAP was computed by the F2 survey instrument based on enrollment information provided by the respondent; this calculation occurred during the F2 interview and determined whether the respondent was routed to or around questions associated with variables F2B19A\u2013F2B19K.\nF2PSPRE4 This variable indicates the total number of months the respondent was enrolled at any\npostsecondary institution during the 2002 and 2003 calendar years.\nF2PS0401 January 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0402 February 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0403 March 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0404 April 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0405 May 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0406 June 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0407 July 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nF2PS0408 August 2004 enrollment status across postsecondary institutions.\nM-23\n\n\fAppendix M.

A transfer/switch is not indicated, however, when the respondent has any 2006 enrollment at the first \u201creal\u201d institution attended, regardless of whether another institution has a later end date. F2SWITCH can also be used to identify those respondents who were asked their reasons for transferring (F2B21A\u2013F2B21L).\nNote: F2SWITCH was computed by the F2 survey instrument based on enrollment information provided by the respondent; this calculation occurred during the F2 interview and determined whether the respondent was routed to or around questions associated with variables F2B21A\u2013F2B21L.\nM-25\n\n\fAppendix M. Second Follow-up Composite Variables\nF2PS2006\nThis variable stores the location on the institution file (see also F2IORDER) of the postsecondary institution the respondent attended in 2006, if applicable (since the second followup data collection concluded in early September 2006, no enrollment information is known for fall/winter 2006). The 2006 institution is referenced in questions corresponding to variables F2B22, F2B23A\u2013C, F2MAJOR2, F2MAJOR4, F2D07, and F2D08A\u2013I. If the respondent attended more than one postsecondary institution in 2006, the 2006 institution was chosen as follows: if the first \u201creal\u201d postsecondary institution attended (see also F2PS1) is one of the institutions attended in 2006, then it is the institution identified in F2PS2006. Otherwise, the institution with the latest 2006 enrollment date is selected as the 2006 institution.\nNote: The institution identified in F2PS2006 was selected by the F2 survey instrument based on enrollment information provided by the respondent; this institution was selected during the F2 interview and determined which institution was referenced in questions associated with variables F2B22, F2B23A\u2013C, F2MAJOR2, F2MAJOR4, F2D07, and F2D08A\u2013I.\nF2MAJOR4\nRespondent\u2019s 2006 field-of-study code, based on the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code frame. Available only on the restricted-use file; public-use version of this variable is F2MAJOR2.\nF2MAJOR4 is a four-digit code, with the first two digits (equivalent to F2MAJOR2) indicating a general category, and the last two digits indicating a specific category. Field-ofstudy codes were assigned primarily by the survey instrument assisted coder, and secondarily by upcoding activities.

Available only on the restricted-use file; public-use version of this variable is F2ONET12. F2ONET16 is a six-digit code, with the first two digits (equivalent to F2ONET12) indicating a general category, the third digit a mid-level category, and the last three digits a specific category. Occupation codes were assigned primarily by the survey instrument assisted coder, and secondarily by upcoding activities. See section 4.3.2.4 of the ELS:2002 Base-Year to Second Follow-up Data File Documentation for more information regarding occupation coding.\nF2ONET12 Respondent\u2019s first occupation after high school, coded with a two-digit general category\nbased on the O*NET coding scheme.

Despite being prompted in the F2 interview to only report employment subsequent to F2HSCPDR (or, where applicable, F2HSLVDR), employment which preceded high school completion/exit was sometimes reported. F2OCC1Q values of 1 imply that, according to the dates provided by the respondent, the associated job is not a post-high school occupation.\nF2CUROCC Respondent\u2019s current occupation, mapped from the O*NET coding scheme to the\nELS:2002 base-year/first follow-up occupation coding scheme.

Months out of the labor force are not counted as months unemployed. The high school exit date is the date the respondent received a high school diploma, certificate of attendance, GED, or equivalent (F2HSCPDR). If the respondent is not credentialed, the high school exit date is the last date of high school attendance (F2HSLVDR).\nNote: F2NUNEMP is set to -9 (missing) for any case having a value of 4 (not working, unknown if in labor force) or -9 for at least 1 month-by-month employment variable (F2EMyymm series). F2NUNEMP is set to -3 (not applicable) for any nonenrollee where all of their month-by-month employment variables are set to either 3 (out of the labor force), 8 (prehigh school exit), or 9 (post-F2 interview).\nF2PUNEMP This variable indicates the percent of months the nonenrollee reported being unemployed\nsince high school exit. Months out of the labor force are not counted as months unemployed. The high school exit date is the date the respondent received a high school diploma, certificate of attendance, GED, or equivalent (F2HSCPDR); or, if the respondent is not credentialed, the high school exit date is the last date of high school attendance (F2HSLVDR). The numerator is the number of months unemployed since high school exit (F2NUNEMP). The denominator is the number of months employed since high school exit plus the number of months unemployed since high school exit (months out of the labor force are excluded from both the numerator and denominator).\nM-28\n\n\fAppendix M.

Data Imported Into ELS:2002 From External Sources\nN.1 ECB-based Linked Data From External Sources\nAncillary data from various extant sources has, in a number of instances, been imported into the ELS:2002 database and integrated into the electronic codebook (ECB). For each external data source, separate files were constructed that can be linked to the student file. Sample members have one or more records on each data source file when data are available. If information is not available for that data source, then the student record was excluded from that data source file. The following data source files may be accessed:\n\u2022 the Central Processing System (CPS), \u2022 the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), \u2022 the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), \u2022 the ACT, and \u2022 the General Educational Development Test (GED). Some composite variables have been constructed from data obtained from the various extant data sources and included on the student file. In some instances, such as the ACT and SAT, the available data represent the merging of sources: test scores obtained from schools in the high school transcript component of ELS:2002, and data obtained from records matching with the College Board (SAT) or ACT. Each of the ancillary data sources are briefly described in this appendix.\nN.1.1 CPS (Central Processing System\u2014FAFSA) This database contains all information from the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal\nStudent Aid) for all students who applied for aid in any given academic year and has been matched to academic years 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, and 2006\u201307. Information includes Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as well as responses to FAFSA questions.\nN.1.2 NSLDS (National Student Loan Data System) The NSLDS database contains records of all federal loan and Pell grant information for\nanyone who has such a loan or grant. Information includes dates and amounts for loans, name of loan program (e.g., Stafford, Perkins), and dates and amounts for Pell grants.\nN.1.3 SAT SAT scores were collected in the ELS:2002 high school transcript study and have been\naugmented through records matching with the College Board, based on the year 2004 and earlier. Verbal and math scores are included as well as AP scores. Additionally, school-level mean scores have been included for individual sample members. An SAT-ACT concordance was created, so that both sets of scores would be on a common scale.\nN.1.4 ACT ACT scores were collected in the ELS:2002 transcript study and have been augmented\nthrough records matching. Scores include the ACT composite score and scores in English, math, reading, and science. In addition, school-level mean ACT composite scores have been linked to\nN-3\n\n\fAppendix N. Data Imported Into ELS:2002 from External Sources\nindividual ELS:2002 sample members. An SAT-ACT concordance was created, so that both sets of scores would be on a common scale.\nN.1.5 GED Test and Survey Data\nThe General Educational Development Test (GED) provides the basis for high school equivalency certification. Where records could be matched for ELS:2002 sample members who took the GED, this information has been incorporated into the ELS:2002 database. Specific information includes state in which tested, whether passed or failed, and responses to certain GED survey items.\nAccessing the data. All of the ancillary data files contain a Stu_ID field which corresponds to the Stu_ID field contained in the student file. The student file can be linked to any of the extant data files using that field. The following ancillary data files all have up to one record per applicable sample member: CPS 2004-2005, CPS 2005-2006, CPS 2006-2007, NSLDS: Pell, and GED. The only extant data file that has multiple records per sample member is the NSLDS Loan file.\nWhen merging the NSLDS Loan file with the student file, the resulting dataset will contain at least one row for cases common to both files and multiple rows for cases where multiple rows exist in the NSLDS Loan file. The values of student file variables included in the resulting dataset will be replicated on each row for any case that has multiple rows in the resulting dataset.\nIf information for a given external data source was not available for any given sample member, that particular data file will not contain a record for that case. When merged with the student file, only cases common to both the student file and the target extant data file will be included in the resulting dataset.\nN.2 Non-ECB Restricted Files: Augmented Geocode Data From 2000 Decennial Census\nIn addition to restricted-use data that have been integrated into the ECB, student-level geocode data are available as a separate file, linkable to the ECB data. The base-year geocode file can be obtained from NCES only through a separate licensing agreement.\nA layout file, a SAS program, and an SPSS program have been provided for use of the geocode data. Student ID is provided to facilitate merges to the ECB data.\nIn constructing the geocode file, the best available source of residential address information was geographically matched to zip code, FIPS state and county code, and Census tract and block code. Claritas Prizm NE codes were utilized as a source of additional geodemographic and neighborhood lifestyle data. More information about Prizm NE codes can be obtained from http://www.claritas.com.\nN.3 Listing of Variables Associated With the Ancillary Data; Explication of Composite Variables Based on These Sources\nPlease refer to appendixes L and M for further information. Specifically, appendix L contains a listing of all base-year through second follow-up ECB variables. Variables from the\nN-4\n\n\fAppendix N.

Glossary of Terms\nAccommodations (testing): In the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002), certain accommodations were offered to students with barriers to participation, such as students with disabilities or English-language learners with limited English proficiency. An accommodation is a change in how a test is presented, in how a test is administered, or in how the test taker is allowed to respond. This term generally refers to changes that do not substantially alter what the test measures. The proper use of accommodations does not substantially change academic level or performance criteria. Appropriate accommodations are made to provide equal opportunity to demonstrate knowledge. Examples of test accommodations include allowing extra time, use of a large-print version of a test, or conveying instructions in sign language. Cases in which accommodations were implemented in ELS:2002 are specially flagged (the indicators are BYTXACC and F1TXACC).\nAdaptive testing: Beyond being \u201cgrade-level\u201d adaptive, procedures were followed in ELS:2002 to make the assessments further adaptive by matching test items to student ability. In the ELS:2002 base year, multiple test forms of varying levels of difficulty were assigned based on the examinee\u2019s score on a routing test. Thus, the specific sequence of questions that each student answered was tailored to that student\u2019s ability level. An advantage of adaptive tests is that reliability per unit of testing time is greater than in a nonadaptive test. Adaptive procedures help to minimize floor and ceiling effects (see Ceiling effect and Floor effect). ELS:2002 adaptive testing relies on Item Response Theory (see IRT) assumptions to place students who have taken different test forms on the same vertical score scale. In the first follow-up, each student\u2019s test form was assigned on the basis of base-year test performance.\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: An American Indian or Alaska Native is a person who has origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.\nAsian: An Asian is a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nBase weights: See Design weights.\nBias: Bias is the difference between the reported value and the true value. Thus, the bias of an estimate is the difference between the expected value of a sample estimate and the corresponding true value for the population. Response bias is the difference between respondent reports and their behavior or characteristics. Nonresponse bias is the difference that occurs when respondents differ as a group from nonrespondents on a characteristic being studied. Sample bias is the unequal selection or the omission of members of the population, without appropriate weighting. Relatedly, undercoverage bias arises because some portion of the potential sampling frame is missed or excluded, or there are duplicate units. For example, if the school list from which a school sample is drawn is incomplete or inaccurate (owing, for example, to the birth of new schools subsequent to the time the list was drawn up), school undercoverage may occur. (See also Nonresponse bias and Bias analysis.)\nBias analysis: Nonresponse bias analysis compares the characteristics of respondents and nonrespondents. Both unit nonresponse (school, student) and item nonresponse on questionnaires were subject to bias analyses in ELS:2002. For example, certain key data items were obtained for both responding and nonresponding schools, so that a school nonresponse analysis could be conducted and bias in school-level estimates quantified.\nO-3\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nBlack or African American: A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.\nBurden: Formally, burden is the aggregate hours realistically required for data providers to participate in a data collection. Burden also has a subjective or psychological dimension: the degree to which providing information is regarded as onerous may depend on the salience to the respondent of the questions that are being posed and on other factors, such as competing time demands.\nCarnegie unit: A factor used to standardize credits in secondary education. This standard measurement represents the completion of a course that meets one period per day (45 to 60 minutes) for 1 academic year.\nCAPI: Computer-assisted personal interviewing, in which the questionnaire is loaded into a field interviewer\u2019s laptop computer.\nCATI: Computer-assisted telephone interviewing.\nCCD: Common Core of Data. Data annually collected from all public schools in the United States by NCES. Data from the CCD supplied the public school sampling frame for the ELS:2002 base year.\nCD-ROM: Compact Disc Read-Only Memory. ELS:2002 data are distributed primarily in an optical laser disc medium, specifically, CD-ROM. A CD-ROM is a computer storage disc in the same physical form as an audio CD; it can store approximately 650 megabytes of digital data.\nCeiling effect: The result of a test having insufficient numbers of the more difficult items. In a longitudinal study, ceiling effects in the follow-up can cause change scores to be artificially constrained for high-ability examinees. The measurement problems related to floor and ceiling effects in combination with regression effects found at the extreme score ranges seriously hamper the accuracy of change measures in longitudinal studies. More information (i.e., smaller error of measurement) is obtained with respect to ability level if high-ability individuals receive relatively harder items (and if low-ability individuals receive proportionately easier items). The matching of item difficulty to a person\u2019s ability level yields increased reliability at the extremes of the score distribution, where it is most needed for studies of longitudinal change. A strategy employed in ELS:2002 to minimize ceiling (and floor) effects is to employ test forms that are \u201cadaptive\u201d to the ability level of the examinee. Multilevel tests\u2014with second stage test assignment that is based on the first stage (routing test) performance work\u2014minimize the possibility that ceiling effects might bias the estimates of the score gains. (See also Adaptive testing and Floor effect.)\nClassical test theory: Classical test theory postulates that a test score can be decomposed into two parts\u2014a true score and an error component; that the error component is random with a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with true scores; and that true scores, observed scores, and error components are linearly related.\nClosed-ended: A type of question in which the data provider\u2019s responses are limited to given alternatives (as opposed to an open-ended question). (See also Open-ended.)\nClustering: A sample selection method in which small geographical areas such as schools (as is the case in ELS:2002), school districts, counties, or residential blocks are selected as an initial stage, with individuals selected in a subsequent step. (See also Primary sampling unit.)\nO-4\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nCluster size: The number of ELS:2002 sample members attending a particular high school.\nCodebook: Documentation of each variable being measured, including variable name, columns occupied by each variable in the data matrix, values used to define each variable, unweighted frequencies, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents. (See ECB.)\nCoefficient of variation: The ratio of the standard deviation of an estimate to the value of the estimate.\nCognitive test battery: One of the two parts of the student survey (the second part being the student questionnaire). Two achievement areas (mathematics and reading) were measured in the base year. Mathematics achievement was measured again in the first follow-up.\nCohort: A group of individuals who have a statistical factor in common\u2014for example, year of birth, grade in school, or year of high school graduation. ELS:2002 is a sophomore-grade cohort based on the spring term of the 2001\u201302 school year. It also contains, however, a nationally representative sample of high school seniors in the spring term of the 2003\u201304 school year (see Freshening). In contrast, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an age cohort, based on students who were 15.25 years of age in April of 2000 or 2003.\nComposite variable: A composite variable is one that is either constructed through the combination of two or more variables (socioeconomic status, for example, combines mother\u2019s education, father\u2019s education, mother\u2019s occupation, father\u2019s occupation, and family income) or calculated through the application of a mathematical function or transformation to a variable (e.g., conversion of raw test scores to percentile ranks). Also called a derived variable, created variable, or constructed variable.\nConcordance: Concordance is a weaker form of test linkage than equating in that the link is based on population distributions rather than the equivalence of interchangeable scores. Implementation in ELS:2002 of PISA scale scores in reading and math and of NAEP math scores was through a concordance using (primarily) an equipercentile transformation or linkage. (See also Equating and Equated test score.)\nConfidence interval: A sample-based estimate expressed as an interval or range of values within which the true population value is expected to be located (with a specified degree of confidence).\nConfidentiality protections: NCES is required by law to protect individually identifiable data from unauthorized disclosure. To this end, the ELS:2002 data have been subject to a disclosure risk analysis to determine which records require masking to produce the public-use data file from the restricted-use data file. Disclosure coarsening techniques (such as recoding of continuous variables into categorical, top and bottom coding, and so on) and data perturbation techniques (e.g., data swapping) have been used to provide disclosure protection to the ELS:2002 data. (See also Data swapping and Disclosure risk analysis.)\nConsent, active (explicit): One variety of informed consent is called active or explicit consent. Typically, in active consent, a signed agreement to participate in a study must be obtained. In ELS:2002, permission of parents was required before students could be surveyed. Some schools required active parental consent (i.e., that a signed permission form be obtained).\nConsent, passive (implied): Another variety of informed consent is called passive or implied consent. In passive consent, a permission form is sent to the relevant party (in ELS:2002,\nO-5\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nnormally the parent or guardian of the sampled student), who has the opportunity to return the form to indicate denial of permission. If the form is not returned, it is assumed that the individual has no objection to survey participation. In ELS:2002, most schools allowed passive parental consent for their child\u2019s participation in the study.\nConstructed response item: In the ELS:2002 assessment battery in the base year, a nonmultiple-choice item that required some type of written response.\nContextual data: In ELS:2002, the primary unit of analysis is the student, and information from the other study components, referred to as contextual data, should be viewed as extensions of the student data. For example, observations made in school administrator, teacher, librarian, and parent reports on the student\u2019s school learning environment or home situation would be considered contextual data.\nCourse offerings file: An ELS:2002 restricted-use data file providing a comprehensive list of the courses offered by schools participating in the base year of the study. A CSSC (Classification of Secondary School Courses) code is associated with each course title.\nCoverage rate: In ELS:2002 base-year contextual samples, the proportion of the responding student sample with a report from a given contextual source (e.g., the parent survey, the teacher survey, or the school administrator survey). For the teacher survey, the student coverage rate can be calculated as either the percentage of participating students with two teacher reports or the percentage with at least one teacher report. The teacher and parent surveys in ELS:2002 are purely contextual. The base-year school-level surveys (school administrator, library media center, facilities checklist) can be used contextually (with the student as the unit of analysis) or in standalone fashion (with the school as the unit of analysis). (See Response rate.) Finally, test completions (reading assessments, mathematics assessments) are also calculated on a base of the student questionnaire completers (in the first follow-up, for the in-school student sample only), rather than on the entire sample, and thus express a coverage rate. \u201cCoverage\u201d can also refer to the issue of missed target population units on the sampling frame (undercoverage), or duplicated or erroneously enumerated units (overcoverage) (see Bias for discussion of undercoverage bias).\nCriterion-referenced: A criterion-referenced test allows its user to measure how well a student or groups of students have learned a specific body of knowledge and skills\u2014it tests what they can do and what they know, and at least in theory, all examinees could obtain a perfect score. The ELS:2002 IRT-estimated number-right scores are examples of criterion-referenced measures of status at a point in time. The criterion is the knowledge and set of skills defined by the assessment framework and represented by the assessment item pool. In contrast, the purpose of norm-referenced tests is to rank or compare students. (See Norm-referenced.)\nCross-cohort (or intercohort) analysis: The ELS:2002 base-year and first follow-up surveys contained many data elements that were comparable to items from prior studies. (Comparatively few items, however, are comparable across ELS:2002/2006, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 [NELS:88/94], and similar time points for the High School and Beyond [HS&B] cohorts and National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 [NLS:72]). Repeated items supply a basis for comparison with earlier sophomore cohorts (such as 1980 sophomores in the HS&B longitudinal study and 1990 sophomores in NELS:88). With a freshened senior sample, the ELS:2002 first follow-up supports comparisons to 1972 (NLS:72), 1980 (HS&B), and 1992 (NELS:88). The first follow-up academic transcript component will offer a further opportunity for cross-cohort comparisons with the high school transcript studies of HS&B,\nO-6\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nNELS:88, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). With three or more timepoints, trend analyses are possible. With ELS:2002, this condition has now been met for both the sophomore and senior cohorts. Essentially, three kinds of intercohort comparison are possible. First, cohorts can be compared on an intergenerational or cross-cohort time-lag basis. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal time-lag comparisons may be made. An example of a cross-sectional time-lag comparison would be looking at the status of HS&B (1980), NELS:88 (1990), and ELS:2002 (2002) sophomores to see how the situation of sophomores has changed over time. An example of longitudinal time-lag comparison would be an examination of the magnitude and correlates of achievement gain of HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 sophomores over the last 2 years of high school. Second, fixed-time comparisons are also possible, in which groups within each study are compared at different ages but the same point in time (e.g., NLS:72, HS&B senior, and HS&B sophomore cohorts all could be looked at in 1986, some 14, 6, and 4 years after each respective cohort graduated from high school). Such a perspective would permit one to compare, for example, employment rates for 22-, 24-, and 32-year-old high school graduates. Finally, longitudinal comparative analysis of the cohorts can be performed by modeling the history of the grade cohorts.\nCross-sectional analysis: A cross-sectional design represents events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional survey may measure the cumulative educational attainment (achievements, attitudes, statuses) of students at a particular stage of schooling, such as 10th or 12th grade. In contrast, a longitudinal survey (or repeated measurement of the same sample units) measures the change or growth in educational attainment that occurs over a particular period of schooling. The longitudinal design of ELS:2002 generates two representative cross sections (high school sophomores in 2002 and, through sample freshening, seniors in 2004). It also permits analysis of individual-level change over time through longitudinal analysis and of group-level and intercohort change through the cross-sectional comparisons to past studies of similarly defined grade cohorts. (See also Cross-cohort analysis and Longitudinal or panel survey.)\nCSSC: Classification of Secondary School Courses. A coding system, used since HS&B and updated many times, employed for the purpose of standardizing transcripts. The CSSC is a modification of the Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) used for classifying college courses. Each CSSC course code contains six digits. The fist two digits identify the main program area; the second two digits represent a subcategory of courses within the main program area; and the final two digits define the specific course. For example, for CSSC code 400522, the first two digits (40) define physical sciences, the middle two digits (05) define the chemistry subcategory, and the final two digits (22) define the course Advanced Chemistry.\nDAS: Data analysis system. The DAS is an NCES web-based software application that allows analysts to conduct basic analyses. Each DAS runs in two modes\u2014Tables and Correlations\u2014and a regression capability has been added to the latest version. ELS:2002 data are available on the DAS as well as in ECB (electronic codebook) format.\nData element: The most basic unit of information. In data processing, it is the fundamental data structure. It is defined by its size (in characters) and data type (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric only, true/false, date) and may include a specific set of values or range of values.\nData swapping: Data swapping is defined in the NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2003) as a perturbation disclosure limitation technique that results in a confidentiality edit. An example of\nO-7\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\ndata swapping would be to assume a data file has two potential individual identifying variables, for example, sex and age. If a sample case needs disclosure protection, it is paired with another sampled case so that each element of the pair has the same age, but different sexes. The data on these two records are then swapped. After the swapping, anyone thinking they have identified either one of the paired cases gets the data of the other case, so they have not made an accurate match and the data have been protected. (See also Confidentiality protections.)\nDelayers: In the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006), delayers were enrollees who started their postsecondary education after the first enrollment window following their high school completion or exit date and had some postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. (See also Leavers, Nonenrollees, and Standard enrollees.)\nDesign effect: A measure of sample efficiency. The design effect (DEFF) is the variance of an estimate divided by the variance of the estimate that would have occurred if a sample of the same size had been selected using simple random sampling. Sometimes it is more useful to work with standard errors than with variances. The root design effect (DEFT) expresses the relation between the actual standard error of an estimate and the standard error of the corresponding estimates from a simple random sample. (See also Effective sample size.)\nDesign weights: Design weights compensate for unequal probabilities of selection. More specifically, the design weight is the inverse of the probability of selection. Design weights are also called raw weights, base weights, unadjusted weights, or sampling weights. Design weights may be contrasted to adjusted weights (adjusted to compensate for nonresponse, and also called final weights or analysis weights). Roughly, the design weight is calculated as the inverse of the probability of selection, taking into account all stages of the sample selection process. More precisely, design weights are the inverses of the expected frequencies with which population units appear in conceptually repeated samples selected using the sampling design developed for the study. Unlike the final weights, design weights are generated for all sample members, respondents and nonrespondents alike. Design weights do not appear on the ELS:2002 publicuse files. (See also Final weights and Sampling weights.)\nDIF: Differential Item Functioning. DIF exists when examinees of equal ability differ on an item solely because of their membership in a particular group (e.g., if an item favors males over females, or one racial or ethnic group over another, and cannot be explained by relevant factors such as differential coursetaking). DIF for ELS:2002 items was examined in the base-year and first follow-up field tests. Items with DIF problems were revised or deleted.\nDisability: A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities (Title 42 U.S.C. Section 12102).\nDisclosure risk analysis: Investigation of study data to evaluate and minimize the risk of identification of individual sample units to preserve the confidentiality of the data. ELS:2002 data have been subjected to a disclosure risk analysis to protect confidential information about individual respondents (see Public-use data file). For a more detailed account of disclosure risk analysis, and of means of altering data (including masking, data perturbation, and data swapping) to prevent disclosure, see the NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2003).\nDomain: In assessment a domain refers to a defined universe of knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes, interests, or other human characteristics, or the full array of manifestations of the particular subject matter being measured. A domain in the context of sample design refers to an\nO-8\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nanalysis group within the target population, such as (in ELS:2002) sophomore cohort dropouts, graduating seniors, males, females, Asians, and so on, for which certain precision requirements must be met to support analysis.\nDropouts: A dropout was defined as a sophomore cohort member who, during spring term 2004, had not been in school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and was not absent due to accident or illness. Also surveyed as a dropout were students who, at the time of their school\u2019s survey day, had been back in school less than 2 weeks after a period in which the student had missed school for 4 or more consecutive weeks not due to accident or illness. (See also NCSQ.)\nECB: Electronic codebook. While hardcopy codebooks with item stems, response categories, associated response frequency distributions, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents are contained within the ELS:2002 base-year user\u2019s manual, ELS:2002 data are also available on CD-ROM in an electronic codebook (ECB) format. Electronic codebooks are menu-driven systems that allow users to perform functions such as the following: (a) search a list of database variables based on key words or variable names/labels, (b) display unweighted percentages for each variable in the database, (c) display question text for each variable in the database, (d) select or tag variables for subsequent analysis, (e) generate SAS-PC or SPSS-PC+ program code/ command statements for subsequently constructing a system file of the selected variables, and (f) generate a codebook of the selected variables.\nEffective sample size: Effective sample size may be defined as the ratio of the raw sample size divided by the design effect. (For example, the sampling variance of a mean standard score is equal to the reciprocal of the effective sample size, not the reciprocal of the raw sample size.) In essence, then, effective sample size is the sample size under a simple random sample design that is equivalent to the actual sample under the complex sample design, wherein the actual sample size is determined by multiplying the effective sample size by the anticipated design effect. (See also Design effect.)\nEGQ: Early graduate questionnaire. This first follow-up questionnaire was administered to individuals who had graduated or received high school equivalency certification (e.g., the GED) prior to March 15, 2004.\nEquated test score: Test equating takes place in two distinct contexts in ELS:2002. One context is vertical equating of forms for use in successive grades, such that the achievement growth of individual ELS:2002 sample members over time can be accurately measured. Another context is cross-sectional equating and linking, as to other tests (e.g., placing ELS:2002 sophomores and HS&B or NELS:88 sophomores on an equivalent scale).\nEquating: Equating of two tests is established when examinees of every ability level and from every population group can be indifferent about which of two tests they take. Not only should they have the same expected mean score on each test, but they should also have the same errors of measurement. In contrast, test linkage results from placing two or more tests on the same scale, so that scores can be used interchangeably. In ELS:2002, there is both vertical equating (the scale spans grades 10 and 12) and lateral equating to the tests of NELS:88 (and in sophomore math, HS&B). This equating was achieved through IRT methods such as anchor (common item) equating. (See also Concordance and Equated test score.)\nETS: Educational Testing Service. RTI\u2019s subcontractor for ELS:2002 cognitive test development, scoring, and scaling.\nO-9\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nExpanded sample: Although no sophomores were excluded from ELS:2002, those who could not validly be assessed or could not validly complete the student questionnaire (e.g., students with a severe disability or limitation in their knowledge of the English language) were not eligible for these components. Contextual data (parent, teacher, school administrator) reports were collected for this group. In 2004\u201305, their transcripts were collected. The base-year expanded sample comprises all ELS:2002 sophomores, that is, both those who were eligible to complete the student questionnaire and test and those who were not. The first follow-up expanded sample also includes freshened cases. Some students who were eligible for questionnaire completion in 2002 suffered an impairment that led to their reclassification as ineligible in 2004. With greater frequency, some 2002 sophomores who were not capable of questionnaire completion became eligible in 2004, as their status changed. The expanded sample comprises all sample members regardless of eligibility for questionnaire completion. (See also Questionnaire-incapable students.)\nFacilities checklist: Completed by the RTI survey administrator in the base year of the study, the facilities checklist is designed to extend the information available about the school by providing data on the school buildings and grounds that will help researchers understand the adequacy and appearance of the school\u2019s physical plant, its safety and security features, and its role as a constituent of the school\u2019s general environment.\nFAFSA: Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Generally students interested in financial aid for postsecondary education must complete this form, data from which has been included on the ELS:2002 second follow-up restricted-use ECB.\nFile: Refers to a data file containing a set of related computerized records.\nFinal weights: Final weights are sometimes called nonresponse-adjusted weights, adjusted weights, or analysis weights. Building on the design (raw) weight, they compensate for nonresponse. (See Design weights.)\nFloor effect: The result of a cognitive test being too difficult for a large number of the examinees, causing the low-ability examinees to receive chance scores on the first testing, and on subsequent testings if the test remains too difficult. Floor effects result in an inability to discriminate among low-ability individuals at time one or time two and, thus, no reliable discrimination among examinees with respect to amounts of change. A possible solution, used in ELS:2002, is to develop test forms that are \u201cadaptive\u201d to the ability level of the examinee, which tends to minimize the possibility of floor effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. (See also Adaptive testing and Ceiling effect.)\nFrame: A list of all the sampling units that represent the population. The Common Core of Data (CCD) and Private School Survey (PSS) were drawn upon for the ELS:2002 school frame. For an implicit list of the nation\u2019s high school sophomores as of spring term 2002, school rosters from participating schools listing their sophomore class were relied on.\nFrame population: The set of elements (e.g., schools) that can be enumerated prior to the selection of a survey sample.\nO-10\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nFreshening: A freshened sample includes cases from the longitudinal sample of a dataset, plus new cases added to produce cross-sectional estimates of the population at the time of a subsequent wave of a longitudinal data collection. In the ELS:2002 first follow-up, freshening was the means by which high school seniors were added who had not been in the 10th grade in the United States 2 years before. A similar freshening procedure was implemented in NELS:88. (See also Half-open interval.)\nGED recipient: A person who has obtained certification of high school equivalency by meeting state requirements and passing an approved exam, which is intended to provide an appraisal of the person\u2019s achievement or performance in the broad subject matter areas usually required for high school graduation. (See also GED test.)\nGED test: General Educational Development test. A test administered by the American Council on Education as the basis for awarding a high school equivalent certification.\nHalf-open interval: A technique used to increase coverage. It is usually applied to a new list that includes cases that were covered in a previous frame, as well as new in-scope units not included in the previous frame. In this technique, new in-scope units between unit A on the previous frame up to, but not including, unit B (the next unit on the previous frame) are associated with unit A. These new units have the same selection probability as do unit As. This process is repeated for every unit on the previous frame. The new units associated with the actual sample cases are now included in the sample with their respective selection probabilities (freshening). Student sample freshening in the NELS:88 first and second follow-ups, and the freshening conducted in the ELS:2002 first follow-up, relied on such a procedure. The half-open interval procedure was also used for ELS:2002 base-year sample updating prior to survey day. (See also Freshening and Sample updating or refreshing.)\nHispanic or Latino: A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term \u201cSpanish origin\u201d can be used in addition to \u201cHispanic or Latino.\u201d\nHS&B: High School and Beyond. The second in the series of longitudinal high school cohort studies sponsored by NCES. The HS&B base-year study surveyed sophomore and senior students in 1980. The sophomore cohort was last interviewed in 1992 and their postsecondary transcripts collected in 1993. The senior cohort was last interviewed in 1986.\nHSQ: Homeschool student questionnaire. In the first follow-up, this questionnaire was administered to sophomore cohort members who were in a homeschool situation as of the spring term of the 2003\u201304 school year.\nIEP: Individualized Education Program. A written statement or plan for each individual with a disability that is developed, reviewed, and revised in accordance with Title 42 U.S.C. Section 1414(d).\nImputation: Imputation involves substituting values for missing or inconsistent data in a dataset. Prediction of a missing value is typically based on a procedure that uses a mathematical model in combination with available information. Imputation is used to reduce nonresponse bias in survey estimates, simplify analyses, and improve the consistency of results across analyses. Imputations should also preserve multivariate distributions. Missing data for key items in ELS:2002 have been imputed.\nO-11\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nIndividually identifiable data: Data from any record, response form, completed survey, or aggregation about an individual or individuals from which information about particular individuals may be revealed.\nInstrument: An evaluative device that includes tests, scales, and inventories to measure a domain using standardized procedures.\nIRT: Item Response Theory. A method of estimating achievement level by considering the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses on all items administered to an individual student. IRT postulates that the probability of correct responses to a set of test questions is a function of true proficiency and of one or more parameters specific to each test question. Rather than merely counting right and wrong responses, the IRT procedure also considers characteristics of each of the test items, such as their difficulty and the likelihood that they could be guessed correctly by low-ability individuals. IRT scores are less likely than simple number-right or formula scores to be distorted by correct guesses on difficult items if a student\u2019s response vector also contains incorrect answers to easier questions. Another attribute of IRT that makes it useful for ELS:2002 is the calibration of item parameters for all items administered to all students. This makes it possible to obtain scores on the same scale for students who took harder or easier forms of the test. IRT also was used to vertically scale across ELS:2002 rounds, that is, between the two grade levels (10th grade in 2002, 12th grade in 2004). (See, in contrast, Classical test theory.)\nItem nonresponse: The amount of missing information when a valid response to an item or variable was expected. (See also Bias analysis and Unit nonresponse.)\nLeavers: In the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006), leavers were enrollees who began their postsecondary education \u201con time,\u201d but had no postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. Leavers had either dropped out of their postsecondary program, or obtained a subbaccalaureate credential of some kind. (See also Delayers, Nonenrollees, and Standard enrollees.)\nLEP: Limited English proficient. A concept developed to assist in identifying those languageminority students (individuals from non-English-language backgrounds) who need language assistance services, in their own language or in English, in the schools. (See also NEP and LM.) An LEP student is one who meets one or more of the following conditions:\na. the student was born outside of the United States or the student\u2019s native language is not English;\nb. the student comes from an environment in which a language other than English is dominant; or\nc. the student is an American Indian or Alaska Native and comes from an environment in which a language other than English has had a significant impact on his or her level of English language proficiency,\nand who has such difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language as to deny him or her the opportunity to learn successfully in English-only classrooms. The related term \u201cEnglish language learners\u201d is also extensively in use.\nLibrary media center questionnaire: This base-year instrument supplies information about library/media center organization and staffing, technology resources, extent of library and media\nO-12\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nholdings, student access to and use of the library/media center, and its role in supporting the school\u2019s curriculum.\nLM: Language Minority. A non-, limited-, or fully English-proficient student in whose home a non-English language is typically spoken.\nLongitudinal or panel survey: In a longitudinal design, similar measurements\u2014of the same sample of individuals, institutions, households, or of some other defined unit\u2014are taken at multiple time points. ELS:2002 employs a longitudinal design that follows the same individuals over time and permits the analysis of individual-level change. (See also Cross-sectional analysis.)\nMachine editing: Also called forced data cleaning or logical editing. Uses computerized instructions (including logical or deductive imputation) in the data cleaning program that ensure common sense consistency within and across the responses from a data provider.\nMicrodata (microrecords): Observations of individual sample members, such as those contained on the ELS:2002 data files.\nMode effects: Mode of administration effects can sometimes be a problem for surveys. ELS:2002 second follow-up, for example, was administered in three modes: self-administration via the web, interviewer administration by telephone, and in-person interviewer administration. The concern is that sometimes (and in particular when social desirability of questionnaire responses is a salient consideration) respondents may respond differently to the different stimuli provided by differing administration modes. Every effort was made in ELS:2002 to adapt questions so that differences between modes would be minimized; nor were there highly sensitive questions of the sort most likely to be affected by mode.\nNAEP: The National Assessment of Educational Progress. NAEP is a cross-sectional assessment program that measures achievement at the group level for students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades and provides a time series for measuring trends in academic progress of 9-, 13-, and 17-yearolds. ELS:2002 tests differ from but complement those of NAEP by providing a basis for measuring individual-level achievement growth between 10th and 12th grades in mathematics and relating cognitive gains in this subject to the individual, school, and family factors and processes that are measured in the various ELS:2002 questionnaires and school records (transcript) studies. The ELS:2002 scale score (IRT-estimated number right) for mathematics in 2004 has been put on the NAEP scale (based on the 2005 12th-grade NAEP mathematics assessment); this concordant score has now been added to the database.\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: Any person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.\nNCES: The National Center for Education Statistics, Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. This governmental agency is the sponsor of ELS:2002 and is also the sponsoring agency for (among other studies) the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the U.S. component of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), the High School and Beyond (HS&B) longitudinal study, and the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72).\nNCSQ: Not currently in school questionnaire. This first follow-up questionnaire was administered to sophomore cohort dropouts. It includes questions both on present circumstances\nO-13\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nand retrospective items on schooling experience and school disengagement behaviors. (See also Dropouts.)\nNELS:88: The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Third in the series of longitudinal high school cohort studies sponsored by NCES. The study represents three cohorts: the eighth-grade class of 1988, the sophomore class of 1990, and the senior class of 1992. The study collected questionnaire and test data in 1988, 1990, and 1992 on students\u2019 school experiences, as well as background information from school administrators, teachers, parents (in the base year and second follow-up only), and school records. Data on postsecondary and out-ofschool experiences were collected in interviews conducted in 1994 and 2000 and through a postsecondary education transcripts study in 2000\u201301.\nNEP: No English proficiency. A student who does not speak English. (See also LEP.)\nNew participant supplement (NPS): Base-year nonrespondents who responded in the first follow-up but were not enrolled in the base-year schools (e.g., transfers, dropouts, early graduates) completed this supplement in addition to an appropriate questionnaire. The supplement consists wholly of items from the base year, so that the standard classification variables could be captured for all sample members.\nNLS:72: The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. This project was the first in the series of longitudinal high school cohort studies sponsored by NCES. The final round of data collection took place in 1986.\nNoncoverage: Units of the target population that are missing from the frame population. Includes the problems of incomplete frames and missing units.\nNonenrollees: In the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006), nonenrollees had no postsecondary enrollment following high school. A small number were still enrolled in high school. (See also postsecondary Delayers, Leavers, and Standard enrollees.)\nNonresponse: See Bias analysis, Item nonresponse, Nonresponse bias, and Unit nonresponse.\nNonresponse bias: Nonresponse bias may occur as a result of not obtaining 100 percent response from the selected cases. More specifically, nonresponse bias occurs when the expected observed value deviates from the population parameter. The potential magnitude of nonresponse bias is estimated as the product of the nonresponse rate and the difference in values of a characteristic between respondents and nonrespondents. (See also Bias and Bias analysis.)\nNonsampling error: An error in sample estimates that cannot be attributed to sampling fluctuations. Such errors may arise from many sources, including imperfect implementation of sampling procedures, differential unit or item nonresponse across subgroups, bias in estimation, or errors in observation and recording.\nNorm-referenced: A norm-referenced test is used to rank or compare students or groups of students relative to each other. It is interpreted based on comparison of an examinee\u2019s performance relative to the performance of others in a specified reference population, or by a comparison of a group to other groups. ELS:2002 provides both norm-referenced (normative) and criterion-referenced scores. (See also Criterion-referenced.)\nNPSQ: New participant student questionnaire. This first follow-up questionnaire was administered to students in the base-year schools 2 years later. The NPSQ elicited responses from two distinct groups: sophomore cohort members who had been base-year nonparticipants,\nO-14\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nand students brought in through sample freshening. (A small number of students whose eligibility status had changed between rounds completed an NPSQ.) The questionnaire comprised both base-year items (the standard classification variables) and first follow-up items pertaining to students\u2019 current school experience.\nNSLDS: The National Student Loan Data System. Data from the NSLDS have been included on the ELS:2002 second follow-up restricted use ECB.\nOMB: The Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Executive Branch. OMB is a federal agency with the responsibility for reviewing all studies funded by executive branch agencies. OMB reviewed, commented on, and approved the ELS:2002 questionnaires, as indicated by their approval number and its expiration date in the top right corner of the questionnaire covers.\nO*NET: Occupational Information Network. One of the industry and occupation coding schemes used on ELS:2002. The O*NET database was developed for the U.S. Department of Labor and represents an extensive set of worker attributes and job characteristics. O*NET provides a nested coding scheme; 23 general-level categories expand to 96 midlevel categories, which expand to 821 specific-level categories.\nOpen-ended: A type of question in which the data provider\u2019s responses are not limited to given alternatives.\nOptical disc: A disc that is read optically (e.g., by laser technology), rather than magnetically. (See also CD-ROM.)\nOptical scanning: A system of recording responses that transfers responses into machinereadable data through optical mark reading. Data from base-year and first follow-up in-school survey sessions (and indeed all non-CATI operations across components) were optically scanned.\nOut-of-scope: Permanently out-of-scope individuals are no longer associated with the target population. Permanently out-of-scope cases include a sample member determined to be a sampling error (not truly eligible, e.g., not a spring 2002 sophomore or not a freshening-eligible spring 2004 senior), a sample member who has died, or sample members who have been subsampled out of the study by probabilistic methods and their weights redistributed. However, some cases are only temporarily out of scope: these individuals continue to be associated with the target population, but were excluded for a given round. If a sample member was unavailable for the field period (for example, incarcerated, or on a military assignment outside the country and unreachable, or hospitalized), that individual would be classified as out of scope for the current round only; the sample member\u2019s status would be investigated again in the next round and an interview pursued at that time if at all possible. Cases that are temporarily or permanently out of scope do not count against the ELS:2002 response rate.\nOversampling: Deliberately sampling a portion of the population at a higher rate than the remainder of the population. For example, in ELS:2002, private schools have been oversampled. Within schools, Asians have been oversampled.\nParent/guardian questionnaire: The ELS:2002 base-year parent component sought to collect information from parents of all base-year student sample members. The parent or guardian who knew most about his or her child\u2019s educational experience was asked to complete the questionnaire.\nO-15\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nPISA: The Program for International Student Assessment. PISA assesses 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics, and science. In 2000, the primary focus of the assessment was reading. The United States and 31 other nations participated, under the aegis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2003, the primary focus was mathematics, and in 2006, the primary focus was science. A crosswalk (or concordance) has been developed between the ELS:2002 reading test and the PISA reading test, so that the PISA scale can be implemented in ELS:2002. A similar scale linkage (again a concordance) was effected between the ELS:2002 mathematics test (2002) and the PISA math test (2003).\nPopulation: All individuals in the group to which conclusions from a data collection activity are to be applied. Weighted results of ELS:2002 data provide estimates for populations and subgroups.\nPopulation variance: A measure of dispersion defined as the average of the squared deviations between the observed values of the elements of a population or sample and the population mean of those values.\nPostsecondary education: The provision of formal instructional programs with a curriculum designed primarily for students who have completed the requirements for a high school diploma or equivalent. This includes programs of an academic, vocational, and continuing professional education purpose and excludes vocational and adult basic education programs.\nPoststratification adjustment: A weight adjustment that forces survey estimates to match independent population totals within selected poststrata (adjustment cells). More specifically, poststratification is an estimation method that adjusts the sampling weights after the sample has been selected so that certain sample totals (for example, the proportion of Asians) match counterpart population totals.\nPrecision: The difference between a sample-based estimate and its expected value. Precision is measured in terms of the sampling error (or standard error) of an estimate.\nProbability sample: A sample selected by a method such that each unit has a fixed and determined probability of selection\u2014that is, each population unit has a known, nonzero chance of being included.\nProficiency score: Proficiency scores (or criterion-referenced mastery scores) are based on clusters of items within each test that are of similar content and difficulty. The probability of proficiency is a continuous score that can be reported as a mean or a population percentage.\nPSS: Private School Survey. An NCES universe survey encompassing the nation\u2019s private schools. PSS was the private school sampling frame for the ELS:2002 base year.\nPSU: Primary sampling unit. Unit chosen at the first stage of a multistage (cluster) sample. In ELS:2002, the PSU is the school; in other studies, geographical units such as a county or metropolitan statistical area (MSA) may serve as the PSU.\nPublic-use data file: A public-use file that includes a subset of data that have been coded, aggregated, or otherwise altered to mask individually identifiable information; it thus is available to all external users. Unique identifiers, geographic detail, and other variables that cannot be suitably altered are not included in public-use data files. Public-use edits are based on an assumption that external users have access to both individual respondent records and secondary data sources that include data that could be used to identify respondents. For this reason, the\nO-16\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nediting process is relatively extensive. When determining an appropriate masking process, the public-use edit takes into account and guards against matches on common variables from all known files that could be matched to the public-use file. The analysis used to determine which records require masking is called a disclosure risk analysis.\nQuestionnaire-incapable students: It was determined that some ELS:2002 students could not be validly assessed or surveyed, owing to severe physical or mental disabilities or to language barriers. These students were classified as \u201cquestionnaire-incapable\u201d but they were not deemed ineligible for the study. They were included in the study; their status was reviewed in the subsequent round or rounds (at which time a few classifications changed); and while assessment and questionnaire data could not be collected from them, school, teacher and parent contextual data were gathered for this group, and high school transcripts collected for them as well. In some ELS:2002 documentation, this group is called \u201cquestionnaire ineligible.\u201d (See also Expanded Sample.)\nRange check: A determination of whether responses fall within a predetermined set of acceptable values.\nRecord format: The layout of the information contained in a data record (includes the name, type, and size of each field in the record).\nRecords: A logical grouping of data elements within a file upon which a computer program acts.\nRefreshed student: See Sample updating or refreshing.\nRelative bias: Relative bias is the bias of the estimate divided by the estimate. It provides an indication of the order of magnitude of the bias with respect to the estimate.\nReliability: The consistency in results of a test or measurement including the tendency of the test or measurement to produce the same results when applied twice to some entity or attribute believed not to have changed in the interval between measurements.\nReserve code (or reserved code): Certain codes have been reserved to represent various situations in which missing data occur in response frequencies. In ELS:2002, the reserve code conventions are as follows: -1 = \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d; -2 = \u201cRefuse\u201d; -3 = \u201cLegitimate skip/NA\u201d; -4 = \u201cNonrespondent\u201d; -5 = \u201cOut of range\u201d; -6 = \u201cMultiple response\u201d; -7 = \u201cPartial interview\u2014 breakoff\u201d; -8 = \u201cItem not applicable to sample member\u201d; and -9 = \u201cMissing.\u201d\nResponse rate: unconditional unit response rates are calculated as the ratio of the weighted number of completed instruments to the weighted number of eligible cases, using the sample base weight (the inverse of the probability of selection). In multistage samples, such as the base year of ELS:2002, overall response is the product of both stages (though for many purposes, the stages [school and student] are reported separately, especially, as in ELS:2002, if the first-stage analysis reveals little bias). The second follow-up response rate that is reported in this document is a conditional response rate, that is, it is conditioned on the case having been fielded. The response rate is weighted, using the base weight. A conditional response rate is appropriate for methodological reporting in that the fielded cases supply the best basis for evaluating survey effort and success. Thus response rates for the second follow-up do not include unfielded eligible (n = 370) or unfielded ineligible (n = 460) cases in the denominator of the rate. The unfielded eligible cases include the following: a handful of sample members who asked to be removed from the study; about 330 double (base-year and first follow-up) nonrespondents, and about 40 first follow-up freshened nonrespondents (who also lack data for both prior rounds).\nO-17\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nAlso excluded are round-ineligible cases that were not fielded, specifically, some 460 permanently or temporarily out-of-scope cases. The permanent out-of-scope cases include deceased sample members (n = 40) and a handful of corrected sampling errors. Temporarily outof-scope cases include sample members who were unavailable for the second follow-up (n = 80), sample members who were out of the country (n = 210), sample members who were incarcerated or otherwise institutionalized (n = 50), and sample members who were incapacitated or otherwise incapable of completing the questionnaire (n = 80). Item response rates are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained to the number of respondents who are asked to answer a given item. Calculation of unit and item response rates can be a complex matter, and additional considerations arise in reporting in follow-up waves of longitudinal studies, for composite (constructed) variables, and for other cases. More detailed information can be found by consulting NCES Standard 1-3 in the NCES 2002 Statistical Standards document (available at http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/2002/stdtoc.asp). Bias analyses conducted when response rates are below targets help to assess any possible limitations to the generalizability of survey estimates. (See Bias analysis. See also Coverage rate, and Out of scope.)\nRestricted-use data file: A restricted-use file includes individually identifiable information that is confidential and protected by law. The restricted file is a superset of all variables: The file contains all public-use variables as well as additional data (for example, it may include a categorical version of a variable from the public file, as well as a continuous version of the variable that is not found on the public file). The restricted file also includes (as the public file does not) what have been called in ELS:2002 documentation either questionnaire-incapable or questionnaire-ineligible (along with questionnaire-capable/eligible) sample members (in other words, the full or \u201cexpanded\u201d sample including even those sample members unable to complete survey instruments). Use of the restricted data requires the researcher to obtain a special license from NCES. For the second follow-up of ELS:2002, there is no public-use ECB, only a restricted-use ECB, and a public DAS.\nRTI International (RTI): A nonprofit university-affiliated research organization with headquarters at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, that conducted the base year and first follow-up of ELS:2002 and is currently conducting the second follow-up of the study on behalf of NCES. RTI International is a trade name of Research Triangle Institute.\nSample: Subgroup selected, by a probability method, from the entire population, in order to represent it.\nSample updating or refreshing: Because students can transfer into or out of a school after sampling, the base-year student sample in ELS:2002 (as in HS&B and NELS:88) was updated to remove students who had transferred out and to give sophomores who had transferred in since sampling a chance of selection. The half-open interval procedure was employed for sample updating prior to survey day, using the school 10th-grade enrollment lists.\nSampling error: The part of the difference between a value for an entire population and an estimate of that value derived from a probability sample that results from observing only a sample of values.\nSampling frame: See Frame or Frame population.\nO-18\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nSampling variance: A measure of dispersion of values of a statistic that would occur if the survey were repeated a large number of times using the same sample design, instrument, and data collection methodology. The square root of the sampling variance is the standard error.\nSampling weight: A multiplicative factor equal to the reciprocal of the probability of a respondent being selected for the study, with adjustment for nonresponse. The sum of the weights provides an estimate of the number of persons in the population represented by a respondent in the sample.\nSAT: The Scholastic Achievement Test (formerly called the Scholastic Aptitude Test), an examination administered by Educational Testing Service for the College Board and used to predict the facility with which an individual will progress in learning college-level academic subjects. ELS:2002 collected student SAT scores whenever possible.\nScaling: Scaling refers to the process of assigning a scale score based on the pattern of responses. (See also Equated test score and IRT.)\nSchool administrator questionnaire: This questionnaire was administered in both the base year and, with changes, the first follow-up. The questionnaires sought basic information about school policies, curriculum and program offerings, and student and teacher characteristics.\nSchool climate: The social system and ethos or culture of the school, including the organizational structure of the school and values and expectations within it.\nSchool coordinator: A person designated in each school to act as a contact person between the school and RTI. This person assisted with establishing a survey day in the school and preparing for the survey.\nSelection probability: The chance that a particular sampling unit has of being selected in the sample.\nSRS: Simple random sampling. SRS uses equal probability sampling with no strata or clusters. The ELS:2002 sample is stratified and clustered. Most statistical analysis software assumes SRS and independently distributed errors. For studies such as ELS:2002, special variance estimation software (such as SUDAAN, WesVar, AM, or Stata) is required to compute the standard error of estimates.\nStandard deviation: The most widely used measure of dispersion of a frequency distribution. It is equal to the positive square root of the population variance.\nStandard enrollees: In the ELS:2002 second follow-up (2006), a standard enrollee was a respondent who enrolled in a postsecondary institution \u201con time,\u201d that is, within the first enrollment window following their high school completion or exit date and had some postsecondary enrollment in 2006 prior to the date of their interview. (See also Delayers, Leavers, and Nonenrollees.)\nStandard error: The positive square root of the sampling variance. It is a measure of the dispersion of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Standard errors are used to establish confidence intervals for the statistics being analyzed.\nStatistical significance: The finding (based on a derived probability, rather than a certitude) that two or more estimates are truly different from one another and not a merely apparent difference reflecting chance variation.\nO-19\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nStratification: The division of a population into parts, or strata. In a stratified sample, the total population is divided into strata or subgroups. Strata are created by partitioning the frame and are generally defined to include relatively homogeneous units within strata. Stratification is used to reduce sampling error. In ELS:2002, the sampling frame was sorted to create strata or subgroups of schools, and schools were selected independently within each stratum. Schools were stratified by superstrata (combinations of school type or sector and geographic region) and substrata (urban, suburban, rural). Further, in the ELS:2002 ECBs, to properly reflect the original design for variance estimation based on Taylor Series linearization, the sampling strata were used as the basis for analysis strata. The base year sampling design employed 96 sampling strata and 752 primary sampling units; 361 analysis strata (normally containing two PSUs per stratum) were formed by grouping together the 752 sampling PSUs. The responding schools (PSUs) were sorted within sampling strata in the same order as was originally used for sampling, and then adjacent analysis PSUs were paired to form analysis strata.\nStudent questionnaire: One of the two parts of the ELS:2002 base-year and first follow-up student survey (the other part being the assessment). In both rounds, this instrument contained a locator section for tracing sample members for future waves of ELS:2002 and a series of questions about school and home environments, time use, attitudes, values, and aspirations. In the first follow-up, this questionnaire was administered only to participating base-year students who remained in the same school 2 years later. In some instances, an abbreviated version of the student questionnaire was administered (usually in CATI, but sometimes in a hardcopy version).\nSurvey administrator: A member of RTI\u2019s field staff in charge of conducting in-school data collection sessions (see Survey day). The individual in this role was called a team leader in NELS:88 and a survey representative in HS&B.\nSurvey day: A day chosen by the school during the data collection period when an RTI survey administrator and assistant administered the survey to the school\u2019s sample of students. The survey day session lasted about 2 hours in the base year and 90 minutes in the first follow-up. Two make-up days were normally offered for students who missed the survey day.\nTarget population: The finite set of observable or measurable elements that will be studied, or the conceptual population of analytic units for which data are collected and estimates are made. In the ELS:2002 base year, the target population was spring-term 2002 sophomores in all regular public and private schools with 10th grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nTeacher questionnaire: In the base year, mathematics and English teachers of ELS:2002 sophomore participants were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire, which collected data on school and teacher characteristics (including teacher qualifications and experience) and evaluations of student performance.\nTeacher sample: In the ELS:2002 base year, two teacher reports were sought for each student: one from the student\u2019s mathematics teacher and one from the student\u2019s English teacher.\nTranscript: A student\u2019s high school or postsecondary school record. For high school transcripts, such archival data as courses taken, grades, and graduation status are part of the transcript record, as well as assessment results such as PSAT, SAT, and ACT scores.\nTransfer student questionnaire (TSQ): This first follow-up questionnaire was administered to students who moved from their base-year school to a new school between spring 2002 and spring\nO-20\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\n2004. It collected data both on students\u2019 school experience and their reason for transferring to a new school.\nTrimming: A process by which extreme weights are reduced (trimmed) to diminish the effect of extreme values on estimates and estimated variances.\nTRP: Technical Review Panel. A TRP is a specially appointed, independent group of substantive, methodological, and technical experts who offer advice to the study\u2019s contractor on issues of study design and content. TRP members are nominated by the contractor and approved by NCES. Typically, TRPs are convened at least once a year within the life of a contract.\nUnit nonresponse: Failure of a survey unit (e.g., at the institutional level, a school, or at the individual level, a respondent, such as a student or a teacher) to cooperate or complete a survey instrument. Overall unit nonresponse reflects a combination of unit nonresponse across two or more levels of data collection, where participation at the second stage of data collection is conditional upon participation in the first stage of data collection. In ELS:2002, overall nonresponse is the product of school-level nonresponse times student nonresponse. Total nonresponse reflects a combination of the overall unit nonresponse and item nonresponse. (See also Item nonresponse and Nonresponse bias.)\nUrbanicity (or metropolitan status): The ELS:2002 school sample was stratified by metropolitan status or urbanicity, in accordance with the following three locale codes: (1) Urban: the school is in a large or mid-size central city; (2) Suburban: the school is in a large or small town or is on the urban fringe of a large or mid-size city; and (3) Rural: the school is in a rural area. Locale indicators were taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD) for public schools and the Private School Survey (PSS) for private schools. More recently (2006) NCES changed its locale code system. The new codes draw on a four-part classification: city, suburban, town, and rural. Cities and suburbs are further divided into small, mid-size and large, and towns and rural areas can be related (via measures of proximity) to urbanized areas (urban fringe, distant, remote). While the older tripartite classification was used in ELS:2002 sampling, analysts who wants to employ the new locale codes with the ELS:2002 base-year and transfer schools can use the ELS:2002 linkages to the CCD and PSS databases to do so.\nValidity: The capacity of an item or instrument to measure what it was designed to measure, stated most often in terms of the correlation between scores in the instrument and measures of performance on some external criterion. It is the extent to which a test or set of operations measures what it is supposed to measure. Reliability, on the other hand, refers to consistency of measurement over time. (See Reliability.)\nVariance: The average of the squared deviations of a random variable from the expected value of the variable. The variance of an estimate is the squared standard error of the estimate. (See also Population variance and Sampling variance.)\nVocational course: A school course that provides students with the academic and technical knowledge and skills needed for further education and/or careers requiring less than a bachelor\u2019s degree. At the high school level, vocational courses include courses in consumer and homemaking education, general labor market preparation, and specific labor market preparation.\nWave: A wave is a round of data collection in a longitudinal survey (e.g., the base year and each successive follow-up are waves of data collection).\nO-21\n\n\fAppendix O. Glossary of Terms\nWeighted estimates: Weighted estimates (as in the ELS:2002 codebook) are survey estimates in which the sample data are statistically weighted (multiplied) by factors reflecting the sample design. The general purpose of weighting is to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection into the sample and to adjust for the fact that not all schools or individuals selected into the sample actually participated. The design weights (also known as base weights, and typically equal to the reciprocals of the overall selection probabilities) are multiplied by a nonresponse or poststratification adjustment for a final weight. For example, in ELS:2002, the 752 participating schools in the base year represent a national population of 24,795 schools. Individual schools may \u201crepresent\u201d anywhere from a minimum of 1 school to a maximum of 96 schools. To take an ELS:2002 base-year student-level example, 7,613 base-year questionnaire respondents reported themselves to be male, and 7,688 reported themselves to be female. When these cases are multiplied by the nonresponse-adjusted student weights to yield a weighted percentage that reflects the national population of high school sophomores, the estimate for males is 50.5 percent of the 2002 10th-grade cohort, while females are estimated to comprise 49.5 percent of the nation\u2019s 2002 10th-graders. Weighted response rates: Unit response rates are calculated as the ratio of the weighted number of completed interviews to the weighted number of in-scope sample cases. Unit response rates are calculated using the sample base weights (inverse of the probability of selection). White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\nAppendix O Reference\nSeastrom, M. (2003). NCES Statistical Standards (NCES 2003-601).
