[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-Since 1970, the fraction of mixed-race black-white births has increased nearly ninefold. This paper describes basic facts about the behaviors and outcomes of black-white mixed-race individuals. Unsurprisingly, on a host of background and achievement characteristics, as well as adult outcomes, mixed-race individuals fall in between whites and blacks. When it comes to engaging in risky and antisocial adolescent behavior, however, mixed-race adolescents are stark outliers compared to both blacks and whites.

Introduction", "text": "T HROUGHOUT history, racial mixing has been taboo, though not completely absent.\n1 Fear of interracial mixing was a driving force behind the jim crow system in the U.S. South and the black codes in the U.S. North (Romano, 2003) . Mulattoes in the antebellum South occupied a distinct position between blacks and whites (Bodenhorn & Ruebeck, 2003 ), yet Romano (2003) reports that children of mixed racial heritage were thought to be morally and physically inferior to ''pure'' blacks and more prone to diseases such as tuberculosis.\n2 Indeed, in Perez v. Sharp (1948) the State of California argued before the California Supreme Court that antimiscegenation laws protected the larger social good because the children of racially mixed couples were biologically inferior.\n3 Even supporters of the civil rights movement drew sharp distinctions between political and social equality (Moran, 2003) . 4 Figure 1 plots the share of interracial marriages, by gender and race of spouse, from 1880 to 2000. Interracial marriage between blacks and whites increased greatly over the second half of the twentieth century. In 1920, marriages to whites comprised roughly 0.3% of black marriages (Fryer, 2007a) . By 2000, 5.9% of married black men chose a white bride, and 2.7% of black women chose a white husband (Fryer, 2007a) . 5 Accompanying the changes in interracial marriage were increases in the number of black-white mixed-race births.

Between 1913 and 1948, 30 of 48 states banned interracial marriage. In 1948 California was the first state since 1887 to repeal its antimiscegenation law. This was done in response to Perez v. Sharp. On June 12, 1967, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Loving v. Virginia ruled unanimously that preventing marriages between individuals solely on the basis of racial classification violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling struck down antimiscegenation laws in 16 remaining states. See Moran (2003) for a thoughtful review. 2 Interestingly, light-skinned blacks were much more likely to operate farms and accumulated more wealth than their dark-skinned counterparts (Bodenhorn, 2003; Bodenhorn & Ruebeck, 2007) .\n3 Some whites even went as far as to claim that mixed-race children would be sterile like mules (Romano, 2003) . Hoffman (1896) argues that miscegenation is responsible for the increasing black mortality rate, as well as blacks' ''consequent inferior social efficiency and diminishing power as a force in American national life. '' 4 Cohn (1944) argued that blacks should be given justice in the courts, protection of their property, a fair distribution of tax money, and equal wages. But, he insisted, white southerners would not forgo the segregation that kept blacks and whites separate for fear that any breach in the walls of social segregation would lead to racial mixture. 5 We are well aware that black-white individuals comprise only a fraction of all people of mixed race in the United States today. However, given the historical opposition to the mixing of blacks and whites and blacks' special position in American society, it seems warranted to focus our attention in this group of mixed-race individuals. 6 The solid line has been computed using age-specific responses given on the 2000 Census, which allowed individuals to check multiple race categories for the first time. It is possible that individuals in earlier cohorts were more reluctant to identify themselves as mixed race, exaggerating the growth in this category over time. Also, to the extent that survival rates differ by racial group, our estimates will be biased.\nThe dashed line is based on NCHS Natality data, which contain information on the race of parents. Unfortunately, information on the race of the father is often missing. Mothers of mixed-race babies might be more reluctant to provide information on the father of their child, and this reluctance might have decreased over time. Therefore, these estimates might be biased too. Despite the fact that we can not rule out that both time series overstate the increase in mixed-race births, it seems implausible to attribute all or even most of the sharp increase to bias. ble share of total births to blacks and whites, but by the 1980s, they accounted for one in 200 births, and by the year 2000, one birth out of 70 was mixed race. Despite this recent increase, empirical evidence on the experiences of these children and adults is scarce. This is particularly surprising given the nexus of opposition to interracial mixing has been the negative implications for the children of such marriages (Romano, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "Using a variety of data sources, including the 2000 U.S. Census, NCHS Vital Statistics, and the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), our empirical analysis of the life outcomes of black-white biracial individuals (whom we call ''mixed race'' in this paper, recognizing that there are other forms of biracialism not included in our analysis) unearths a rich set of new facts. Figure 3 presents a highlevel summary of these findings. Using the wide range of variables available in these data sets, we construct index measures of birth outcomes (for example, birth weight, duration of pregnancy), home environment (for example, household income, father in household, mother's education), physical characteristics (for example, height, body mass index, physical attractiveness), scholastic achievement (for example, GPA, test scores), risky and antisocial behaviors (for example, trouble with teacher, smoking, lying to parents, violent acts), psychological well-being (for example, feel loved, not depressed, chances of living to age 35), and adult outcomes (for example, married, employed, household income).

For all composite measures higher values are better."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "According to figure 3, at birth, mixed-race children fall in between their black and white counterparts but are closer to whites. They are reared in home environments that overall are more similar to those of black children. On the physical dimension, mixed-race adolescents score higher than both monoracial groups. School achievement results are between blacks and whites but closer to blacks. Their adult outcomes are closer to blacks too. Strikingly, however, mixed-race adolescents engage in substantially more risky and antisocial behavior than either blacks or whites, especially outside school. Of the 21 asocial behavior variables that we analyze, mixed-race adolescents are worse than both blacks and whites on 14 of them; they fall in between blacks and whites on the remaining seven measures. Mixed-race children also fare somewhat worse on measures of psychological well-being.\nWe argue that the pattern in mixed-race adolescents' behavior is largely consistent with a two-sector Roy model (Roy, 1951) , in which all adolescents face pressure to con- 50% 1880 1900 1910 1920 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 1880 1900 1910 1920 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Romano (2003) reports that whites considering interracial marriage are nearly always asked, ''What about the children?'' 8 In constructing our index measures, we have regressed each variable belonging to a particular outcome category on a set of covariates including gender, several age categories, place of birth, region, home environment variables, multiple birth weight intervals, and school fixed effects. For each category, we then averaged the standardized residuals from these regressions for each individual and normalized the resulting individuallevel means on each variable to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Mixed-race children have a choice: they can associate with black children and adopt their norms, befriend white children and adopt their norms, or both. It is this outside option that gives mixed-race adolescents a higher cost of group acceptance, resulting in their choosing riskier behaviors to gain such acceptance. While the Roy model we develop yields many predictions that are similar to a conformity model (Bernheim, 1994) , these two models diverge in one important dimension. The conformity model predicts that mixed-race children who mostly interact with whites will adopt white behaviors, and mixed-race children whose peer groups are mostly black will act black. In contrast, in the Roy model, when there are few blacks around, mixed-race children can have a comparative advantage in black behaviors, inducing them to act particularly ''black,'' and vice versa. Empirically, the evidence on this point tips the balance in favor of the Roy model.\nOur analysis builds on a relatively small prior literature on individuals of mixed race, especially Harris and Thomas (2002) and Ruebeck, Averett, and Bodenhorn (2009) , both of which also use Add Health data. 10 Harris and Thomas (2002) focus on educational outcomes such as GPA, grade repetition, and test scores, generally finding that mixed-race black-white children have outcomes between blacks and whites, but in some cases closer to and not statistically distinguishable from whites. Ruebeck et al. (2009) is the paper most similar to ours. 11 In independent research, they analyze many of the same outcomes that we consider through the lens of a Bernheim-type conformity model. They find that mixed-race children adopt behaviors that are characterized as both ''white'' and ''black,'' leading to a greater variance in mixed-race behavior than is observed for whites or blacks. They conclude that mixed-race identities are not as strongly codified as those for monoracials.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the data used in the analysis and the process of identifying mixed-race individuals. Section III describes the empirical evidence on the behaviors and outcomes of mixed-race individuals from birth to adulthood. Section IV interprets the empirical findings of section III through the lens of economic theory (with the formal treatment of the theory presented in the appendix). Section V concludes."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "II. Data Description and Identification of Mixed-Race Individuals", "text": "The absence of systematic empirical research on how mixed-race children fare relative to their monoracial peers is due in part to data limitations. Few data sets record racial information in a way that mixed-race children can be identified. Data sets that include a mixed-race classification are either too small to be useful or contain little information on childhood or adolescent experiences. The notable exception to this data shortcoming is the restricted-use version of the Coefficients and associated standard errors from regressing our composite outcome measures on indicator variables for race. Black-white mixed-race individuals are the omitted category. The construction of our composite measures is outlined in the text; the Web appendix provides additional detail and the source and precise definition of every variable used in construction.\n9 As we noted in an earlier version of this paper , the two-sector Roy model can be interpreted as formalizing some of the ideas in the ''marginal man'' hypothesis (Park, 1928 (Park, , 1931 Stonequist, 1935 Stonequist, , 1937 , a highly influential yet rarely tested description of the experiences of mixed-race individuals. The ''marginal man'' is depicted as someone who lives in a bicultural environment and is caught between the two conflicting cultures. The concept has been criticized by various authors, largely based on counterexamples and subtle theoretical grounds (Goldberg, 1941; Golovensky, 1952; Green, 1947; Antonovsky, 1956) . Most important, these authors have argued that living in a bicultural environment does not automatically result in inner conflict. In his qualitative analysis, Antonovsky (1956) , for instance, finds multiple coping strategies among American Jews. Inner conflict is not a critical component of the Roy model. 10 Less closely related is a recent literature that relates skin tone to economic outcomes (Keith & Herring, 1991; Hill, 2000) . 11 We did not become aware of Ruebeck et al.'s (2009) parallel research agenda until shortly before the completion of .\n12 A Web appendix with the precise definitions and sources of all variables used in the analysis is available on our Web sites."}, {"section_title": "THE PLIGHT OF MIXED-RACE ADOLESCENTS", "text": "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the primary data set used in this paper.\nA reasonable assumption is that a mixed-race student puts more weight on the black peer group as the fraction of blacks in the student's school rises. Under this assumption, the conformity model would predict mixed-race adolescents who attend schools with more blacks to ''act more black'' and those who attend schools with more whites to ''act more white.'' This pattern, however, is not observed in the data. As table 7 demonstrates, mixed-race children exhibit less typical black behavior as the fraction of blacks at their school increases. We characterize typical black behaviors as those behaviors of which blacks do significantly more than whites. 37 Our index of typical black behaviors reported in table 7 is constructed from factor-analyzing the residuals from regressing typical black behaviors on our set of covariates and school fixed effects."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Add Health began as a stratified random sample of all high schools in the United States, resulting in a nationally representative sample of 90,118 students entering grades 7 through 12 in the 1994-1995 school year. A subsample (of the original in-school survey) of 20,745 students was given a series of in-home interviews.\n14 The original data collection took place in 1995, with wave II done in 1996 and wave III carried out in 2001. 15 In addition, wave I included a parent questionnaire conducted at home, in which 17,700 out of roughly 20,000 of the children's parents participated. As in all other longitudinal data, some respondents could not be located or contacted after repeated attempts, refused to participate, or were unable to do so. Sample weights supplied with each wave attempt to correct for observed patterns of nonresponse.\nA wide range of data is gathered on the adolescents in the study. 16 We use an array of data on demographics, family background, psychological well-being, behavior, and academic achievement. In all our analysis, we use missing value indicators and sample weights.\nIn order to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the economic and social outcomes of mixed-race people, we supplement Add Health with the 2000 U.S. Census and NCHS Natality data. The U.S. Census allows us to expand the set of outcomes to include adult outcomes such as income, completed education, home ownership, marital status, and so on, while the NCHS Natality data allow us to analyze how mixed-race individuals fare relative to their monoracial counterparts at birth. 17 The Web appendix describes these two supplementary data sources in detail."}, {"section_title": "A. Classifying Individuals as Mixed Race", "text": "Identifying individuals of mixed race in survey data can be tricky, and there is little consensus about the best way to do so (Robbin, 2000) . 18 We conceptualize the trade-offs in constructing such a measure using a 2 \u00c2 2 matrix. The first relevant dimension is whether one bases the classification on the race of the parents or the response of the individual himself. The second relevant dimension for classifying mixed-race children is how ''strict'' or ''inclusive'' one is in defining who is mixed race. Our preferred definition is one that is individual based and strict. We use an individualbased definition because data on fathers in Add Health are often missing, and even if a male guardian is present, it is impossible in our data to determine whether he is the biological father.\n19 By ''strict,'' we mean an individual is considered race A if and only if he consistently says he is race A whenever he is observed in the data. If there are any inconsistencies across waves, we code the race as missing."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Using this definition we obtain 304 black-white mixed children in Add Health, which is likely to understate the true number of mixed-race adolescents in the data. 21 Nonetheless, 13 We use the restricted-use data set that contains the full sample and more detailed information. The number of observations in restrictive-use version of Add Health is 90,118, while only roughly 6,500 observations are available in the public use version. Furthermore, the restricted-use version contains more detailed information related to friend and sibling identification, respondents' romantic relationships, and spatial distances.\n14 This sample was selected in part to be representative of the full sample (a core of 12,105), as well as selection on several criteria for oversamples: disabled, blacks from well-educated families, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and adolescents with siblings. The response rate on the first wave of the home interview was 78.9%. 15 The response rates on the second and third waves of the survey were 88.2% and 77.4%, respectively.\n16 For a detailed description, see the Add Health Web site http:// www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth. 17 We also have some very limited data on outcomes of young adults from the third wave of Add Health. Unfortunately, the sample sizes for mixed-race children on these adult outcomes are extremely small and most likely subject to selective attrition, leading to estimates that are quite imprecise and sometimes deviate from our estimates using the 2000 Census. Therefore, we rely on the Census in our analysis of adult outcomes, though it is important to note that mixed-race adolescents are weakly above blacks in nearly all outcomes in both data sets. 18 There is a small literature in sociology and population studies on racial identification (Goldstein & Morning, 2000; Lee, 1993; Aspinall, 1997 Aspinall, , 2003 Harris, 2002; Harris & Sim, 2002; Anderson & Fienberg, 1999; Davis, 1991;  and for the United Kingdom, Wilson, 1984) . Kao (1999) , using the National Education Longitudinal Study, defines an adolescent as mixed race if his or her race differs from the race of his or her guardian who completes the parent survey. Harris and Thomas (2002) identify adolescents as mixed race if they self-identify as mixed race or provide inconsistent monoracial categories on different waves of the survey. Brunsma (2005) looks at children who select into the ''more than one race'' category on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. Xie and Goyette (1997) use the 1990 Public Use 5% Micro Sample of the U.S. Census and classify children as multiracial if they are living with two parents who check different single-race categories. A few empirical studies allow an observer or interviewer to identify who is mixed race (Harris & Sim, 2002; Hahn, Truman, & Barker 1996; Telles & Lim, 1998 for the case of Brazil). 19 Ruebeck, Averett, and Bodenhorn (2009) make use of the racial classification of an adolescent's parents in Add Health and code an individual as mixed race if one of his or her parents is mixed or black and the other one is white or mixed. To increase their sample size and lessen the degree of selection associated with children living in intact families, they also employ a definition based on children's self-selection into black and white on the home survey.\n20 Because our definition is based on self-reporting, we cannot rule out that endogeneity in who declares themselves to be race A biases our results. We have explored the sensitivity of our findings to a variety of different categorizations of race. While results for particular variables do, of course, vary across these definitions, the same basic patterns are present under each of these definitions. Full results for other definitions are reported in the Web appendix available on our Web sites. 21 As a robustness check, we looked at the consistency of racial identification for whites and blacks in the Add Health and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS). In the Add Health, 16.3% of blacks would be dropped from the data for inconsistent racial identification and 10.7% of whites. In ECLS, these numbers are 1.1% for blacks and 0.2% for whites. We have also explored a more ''inclusive'' child-level definition, under which there are three additional ways in which a student can be classified as mixed race. In the first the child is consistently non-Hispanic and marked both black and white, and no other race, in all waves in which he or she participated. This corresponds to our strict definition. Second, a student is coded as mixed if he or she qualified as mixed under the above definition on any single survey, even if he or she failed to do so in other instances. Third, a student is coded as mixed if he or she marks a combination of black and white and no other race across surveys. For example, a student who marks only black at school and only white at home is coded as mixed. This is the same procedure used in Harris and Thomas (2002) and is done in order to obtain as many potentially mixed-race students as possible."}, {"section_title": "624", "text": "THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS the resulting frequency of mixed-race children is consistent with that observed in the 2000 Census among children of the appropriate age. In the 2000 Census, children who check ''black and white'' as race constitute approximately 0.38% of the population between the ages of 12 and 18-the age range of the overwhelming majority of children in Add Health. The percentage of mixed-race children in Add Health, employing our strict, child-based definition, is 0.34%. All of the results we report in the paper for adolescent and adult outcomes correspond to this definition of mixed race.\nWe cannot use our preferred child-based definition with the NCHS Natality data. In this data set we rely on parents' race in classifying babies as mixed race. That is, an infant is coded as mixed race if one of his or her parents is listed as white on the birth certificate and the other is listed as black. Unfortunately, information on the race of the father is missing for 14.4% of observations. We omit these observations from our analysis, which likely leads us to understate the number of mixed-race babies."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "B. Variables Used in the Analysis", "text": "The variables contained in Add Health are at the heart of our analysis. We broadly classify them into five categories: home environment, physical characteristics, school achievement, risky and antisocial behavior, and psychological well-being. (For further details on these variables and their construction, see the Web appendix on our Web sites.)\nOur demographic variables are age, gender, whether born in the United States, and region of residence. Our set of home environment variables consists of ten variables. These include household income, receipt of public assistance such as welfare, father in the household, the marital status of the parent filling out the questionnaire, mother's age, whether their mother is a college graduate or has ever been married, and years in current residence.\nOur measures of physical attributes include birth weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and interviewer-rated attractiveness.\n23 Achievement is proxied by score on the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT), grade point average (GPA), whether a student has repeated a grade, and whether the student has a learning disability. 24 The AHPVT is an abridged and computerized version of the well-known Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, conducted as part of the wave I home interview for 19,713 children. GPA is based on student self-reports; grade repetition and learning disabilities are drawn from the parent questionnaire. 25 We analyze eight variables corresponding to a child's (broadly defined) psychological well-being: the child's responses to questions such as the degree to which his mother or father cares about him, how close he feels to other people, whether he feels accepted or loved, is depressed, likes himself, and expects to live to age 35.\nOur final category of variables from Add Health is designed to capture a student's risky and antisocial behavior in and out of school. The in-school behavior variables include trouble with teachers, trouble paying attention, trouble with homework, trouble with students, effort on schoolwork, skipping school, and never suspended or expelled. The variables designed to measure behavior out of school include watch TV, drink, smoke, dare, lie to parents, fight, property damage, steal, violent acts, sell drugs, encounter violence, ever had sex, ever had a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and ever illegal drugs.\nIn the survey, many of these questions take the form, ''Since school started this year, how often have you had trouble . . . ?'' Answers to these questions range from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates ''never'' and 4 indicates ''every day.'' For all such questions with answers that are ordinal but do not have clear cardinality, we normalize responses to be mean 0 with standard deviation equal to 1 in our weighted sample. While this procedure complicates comparisons of results across variables, as the distance between points is unlikely to be constant, the advantage is that by reducing the dimensionality of the outcome, within-variable comparisons between racial groups become easier. We have also estimated ordered logistic regressions that do not impose cardinality but yield the same qualitative results. We focus on the normalized regressions for ease of interpretation of the main coefficients.\nIn addition to the variables contained in Add Health, we use natality data from the NCHS Vital Statistics to judge how well mixed-race individuals fare at birth. Our set of birth outcomes includes birth weight, duration of pregnancy, indicators for anemia, diabetes, fetal distress, and whether the mother smoked or consumed alcohol during the pregnancy.\nTo complete the picture, we obtain information on adult outcomes from the 2000 U.S. Census. Our set of adult outcomes includes being married, having children, having at least a bachelor's degree, an employment indicator, the number of weeks worked in the previous year, occupational prestige score, household income, an indicator for being 22 We have tried to bound the results by assigning different races to observations with missing information. While the actual values of individual point estimates do of course change, the results remain qualitatively unchanged and are even quantitatively surprisingly robust to different assumptions. 23 At the end of the in-home interview in wave 1, the interviewer was asked to rate the physical attractiveness of the respondent on a scale from 1 to 5, where 0 indicates ''very unattractive'' and 5 indicates ''very attractive.'' Whenever we use this variable in our analysis, we include interviewer fixed effects to account for interviewer-specific tastes.\n24 Harris and Thomas (2002) analyze three of these outcomes: grade point average, grade retention, and AHPVT. 25 To get a sense of how much exaggerating there might be in the data among different racial groups, we compared the survey data with data collected from official transcripts for the first year of high school of 12,115 wave 3 respondents who signed a transcript release form. Blacks reported that their GPAs were 10.9% higher than the actual GPA compared to 4.5% for whites and 8.7% for mixed-race students. Due to a lack of objective measures, we are forced to rely on self-reports for other outcomes we report. Of course, differential self-reporting is a possible source of bias in our analysis. 625 THE PLIGHT OF MIXED-RACE ADOLESCENTS poor, not migrated within the last five years, owning one's own home, the value of the house, live outside city center, and indicators for being disabled and being institutionalized. We view the last as a proxy variable for involvement in criminal activity. As information in the Census on the institutionalized population is often based on administrative records, our results with respect to this outcome should be taken with a grain of salt."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "III. Empirical Evidence on Mixed-Race Adolescents", "text": "In this section, we describe basic facts about the situation of mixed-race individuals on the myriad dimensions we consider: birth outcomes, demographics, home environment, physical characteristics, academic achievement, psychological well-being, adult outcomes, and behaviors inside and outside school. Summary statistics for the variables we use in our analysis are displayed in tables 1 to 6. The left panels in these tables present means with standard deviations in parentheses for whites, blacks, and mixed blackwhite students under our strict individual-centered definition if possible. Individuals of all other races have been omitted from the analysis. As noted earlier, except where there are natural units for a variable (such as household income or weight), we have normalized the responses to be mean 0 with a standard deviation of 1 in our sample.\nAlso of interest is the degree to which there are differences across groups after controlling for background characteristics. For instance, in the raw data, it is unclear whether the outcomes of mixed-race children differ from those of whites because those of mixed race are less likely to come from two-parent households. Thus, in the right panel of tables 1 to 6, we report the estimated racial gaps for each outcome measure after controlling for a range of background characteristics using the following linear model:\nwhere y i,s represents an outcome for individual i in geographic unit s, white i,s and black i,s are a mutually exclusive set of racial identifiers with mixed race as the omitted category, and l s denotes a school fixed effect for variables from Add Health and a state fixed effect for those from the Census and Vital Statistics. The vector X i,s consists of controls for gender, several age categories, place of birth, region, the full set of home environment variables, and multiple birth weight intervals. 27 Although it is in general not obvious what the ''right'' set of control variable is, we believe that it is desirable to control for as many confounding factors as possible (such as the home environment and birth weight), especially when considering behavioral and psychological outcomes.\n28 Naturally the point estimates should be interpreted as the residual difference between mixed-race individuals and their monoracial counterparts, as opposed to the raw difference reported in the left panel.\nIn each of the tables, we report all results relative to mixed-race children. That is, we report our estimates for b w and b b . For all outcome variables contained in Add Health, we also estimate models without school fixed effects and display the results in the Web appendix. The results change very little when we include school fixed effects.\n29 Table 1 displays birth outcomes for mixed-race babies relative to those of blacks and whites. On five of seven dimensions, mixed-race infants fall in between their monoracial counterparts but are often closer to whites. 30 The exception to this pattern is whether the mother smoked or consumed alcohol during the pregnancy. The mothers of mixedrace children are much more likely to do so-or at least to admit to doing so-than the mothers of monoracial babies.\nRacial differences in home environment variables are shown in the upper panel of table 2A. Mixed-race adolescents have family incomes more similar to those of black children. The likelihood of having a father in the home is virtually identical for these two groups. The parents of mixedrace children are less likely to have been married than those of other races (although rates of ever married are higher for these mothers than for blacks). The mothers of mixed-race children are younger on average but slightly more likely to be college graduates. Mixed-race children are much more mobile than their single-race counterparts."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "In tables 2 to 4 and 6, we rely on the relatively small sample of mixed-race children available in Add Health. For the home environment variables shown in table 2A, unlike the other variables we use in the paper (antisocial behaviors, academic achievement, and psychological wellbeing, for example), it is possible to verify the patterns in Add Health using the 2000 Census. Census results for a set of home environment variables similar to those in Add Health are reported in table 2B. The results are generally quite similar, but with some differences. Mixed-race children fare slightly better with respect to household income, having a father in the home, and having married parents in the Census, but still lag far behind whites. The mothers of 26 Jonas (2003) shows that only 19.7% of individuals in correctional institutions filled out the Census form themselves or were interviewed by a Census enumerator, while 56.3% of answers are based on administrative data and 24.0% result in nonresponse. 27 When considering physical attributes, we do not control for birth weight. Similarly, the results for our set of home environment variables have not been adjusted for the effect of the other variables in this category. 28 In an earlier working paper version, we report results without controlling for birth weight and home environment variables. The results are qualitatively robust to varying the set of controls. 29 Under the assumption that reference points vary on the school level, we can therefore dismiss the hypothesis that differences in self-reported outcomes are due to different reference points.\n30 Given the small sample means, the racial differences in birth outcomes portrayed in table 2 are not only statistically significant but are often substantial in a real-world sense. 31 One possible explanation for the greater mobility of mixed-race children might be that their parents are more likely to be members of the military. Yet we are able to dismiss this explanation as the same pattern emerges in the 2000 Census after we exclude all children whose parents currently or formerly served in the armed forces."}, {"section_title": "THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS", "text": "mixed-race children are not as young in the Census as they are in Add Health. The lower panel in table 2A shows our set of physical variables. Mixed-race birth weights look more like those of whites than blacks. Differences in adolescent height and BMI are relatively small. Mixed-race adolescents are rated as .41 standard deviations more attractive than white children and .44 standard deviations more attractive than blacks. Table 3 presents academic outcomes. Mixed-race adolescents are less likely than blacks or whites to have a learning disability. Their AHPVT scores are between those of blacks and whites, but closer to those of whites. While blacks fare .71 standard deviations worse than whites, mixed-race children lag .24 standard deviations behind. On our other two achievement variables (GPA and whether a student repeated a grade), mixed-race adolescents are either between blacks and whites, but more similar to blacks, or essentially tied with blacks.\nThe next set of variables we consider is related to psychological well-being. Table 4 displays the results. Although not always statistically significantly different, mixed-race children fare worst on four of seven psychological dimensions explored. The greatest observed difference is with respect to whether the child perceives his or her father as caring, which mixed race-children do significantly less often. In all other dimensions, mixed-race adolescents fall roughly between their monoracial peers but often report outcomes closer to the worse group. Interestingly, blacks tend to be more content on most dimensions relative to whites and mixed-race children. The exception to this finding is when asked about their chances of surviving to age 35. 32 It is important to note that our analysis cannot answer questions of causality. We simply uncover racial differences in the data that cannot be explained by differences in observable characteristics. Table 5 shows results for our set of adult outcomes. Because there might be differences related to cohorts who self-identify as mixed race in the 2000 Census, we also report separate sets of results for four broadly defined age groups in the Web appendix. With the exception of having children and having not migrated within the past five years, mixed-race individuals have outcomes in between blacks and whites on every dimension we consider. While mixedrace adults are closer to whites with regard to having children, they are more similar to blacks in terms of being married and almost exactly in the middle between blacks and whites for household income, having obtained at least a bachelor's degree, and weeks worked in the previous year. In the Web appendix, we show that mixed-race people in all age groups roughly fall in between blacks and whites on most outcomes. A clear exception is that mixed-race adults in our oldest age group (61 and over) are much more mobile. Surprisingly, they are almost equally as likely as whites to have a bachelor's degree, have similar occupational scores, and, conditional on owning a home, their houses are almost as valuable as those of whites. However, with respect to owning a home in the first place and being married, mixed-race individuals of these cohorts are much more similar to blacks.\nWith the caveat regarding the reliability of Census data on the institutionalized population in mind, table 5 shows that mixed-race adults are considerably less likely to be institutionalized than blacks. This is especially true for mixed-race individuals below the age of 40. Mixed-race people's rates of institutionalization in our older two age groups are closer to blacks than to whites (see the Web appendix).

However, if mixed-race children got picked on a lot, we would expect them to say that they do not feel accepted. Yet on that measure, they are very close to whites (see table 4 ). 629 THE PLIGHT OF MIXED-RACE ADOLESCENTS more human capital investment on their part. If one interprets asocial behavior as interfering with human capital investment, which seems sensible, traditional discrimination models cannot explain our findings that mixed race adolescents behave worse than blacks. Arcidiacono, Bayer, and Hizmo (2010) and Lang and Manove (2011) present models in which discrimination can actually increase educational investment. In these models, discrimination decreases with educational attainment. Thus, it can be beneficial to ''overinvest'' in education to face lower levels of discrimination. These models predict that, at least for certain parts of the ability distribution, blacks invest more in education than mixed-race individuals do, and mixed-race adolescents invest more than whites. However, neither model is consistent with mixed-race children investing less than both blacks and whites."}, {"section_title": "B. Models of Conformity", "text": "In the classic conformity model (Bernheim, 1994) , each individual has preferences over behaviors but also cares about popularity and social esteem in school. Social esteem is determined by the peer group's perceptions of a student's type. Types are unobservable, but others can infer an individual's type from the person's behavior. This may include patterns of speech, style of clothing, time engaged in certain activities, music on their iPod, and so on. Absent popularity considerations, a student would choose behaviors solely based on his or her preferences. Given that his or her utility also depends on social esteem, this person will adopt behaviors leading to favorable perceptions of him or her by others if he or she values popularity sufficiently much.\nIn our context, it is logical to think of peer groups as being determined by race, with white students automatically assigned to the white peer group and blacks put into the black peer group. If black and white peer groups draw different inferences about a student's type from the same observed behaviors, ceteris paribus, this will lead to ''typically black'' and ''typically white'' behaviors. For instance, it has been argued that strong academic achievement, wearing clothes from GAP, or whistling Vivaldi might have a positive impact on how white peers perceive a person but a negative impact among black peers. Table 6 documents the existence of such patterns in our data. Differences between blacks and whites are statistically significant at the 5% level for 18 of the 21 behaviors we consider.\nMixed-race adolescents in this model may differ from blacks and whites in that they do not have a predetermined peer group. They may care about popularity among both blacks and whites, possibly putting more weight on the assessment of one particular peer group. The ability of mixed-race children to conform to either racial peer group can impose a cost on them in this model.

When it is easy to leave the group after receiving the public good, groups do better by holding their members to tougher standards. Because mixed-race adolescents have an outside option, they must go to greater lengths to demonstrate their affiliation with the group. One way of demonstrating solidarity is to go to extremes in carrying out group-sanctioned misbehavior (see Austen-Smith & Fryer, 2005 , or Fryer, 2007b , for a micromodel of group dynamics that justifies this assumption). Peer groups holding mixed-race adolescents to tougher standards can therefore rationalize why the inference function would be flatter than for monoracials. If the weight on group acceptance is large enough and the typeinference functions for mixed-race adolescents are flatter than those for the monoracial groups, then the conformity model can explain why mixed-race adolescents overinvest in asocial behaviors.

(2009) ."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C. A Two-Sector Roy Model", "text": "As in the conformity model, in our conceptualization of the Roy model, each individual has preferences over behaviors and cares about popularity. The latter depends solely on whether an individual is an accepted member of the peer group. Blacks and whites seek acceptance by the members of their own race; that is, they have a predetermined peer group. Mixed-race adolescents, however, are able to choose whether to identify with whites or blacks-the two sectors in this model. 39 There are fixed costs associated with choosing each peer group, and the probability of being accepted by the group depends on observed behaviors. 40 Mixed-race individuals choose the group yielding the highest expected utility.\nThe two-sector Roy model is consistent with the facts described in the empirical section. As in the conformity model, the fact that mixed-race adolescents engage in more risky behavior than any of their single-race peers can be rationalized through their being held to tougher standards by both peer groups. That is they need to engage more in risky and antisocial behaviors to gain acceptance.\nUnlike the standard conformity model, however, the twosector Roy model can also be made consistent with the observation that when there are very few blacks in a school, mixed-race adolescents ''act more black.'' It is important to note that when few blacks are present, the costs of choosing blacks as a peer group, that is, of ''acting black,'' may be lower. For example, fighting is one aspect of behavior more associated with blacks than whites. If blacks are more experienced fighters than whites, then it is less costly for a mixed-race child to prove he can fight when the only opponents are whites. 41 This force works in the opposite direction of conformity.\nIn many Roy models, the individuals with the most choice have higher utility. In our model, there is trade-off between having the benefit of more choice and incurring the cost of not having a predetermined peer group, so we are unable to sign the change in utility.\nThe Roy model is not the only one that can explain the data. For instance, the payoff to acting black may also depend on the racial composition in one's school, thereby increasing or decreasing conformist tendencies. 42 It is important to note, however, that two of the most prominent theories, discrimination and a simple Bernheim-type conformity model, are incompatible with the data."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "The number of mixed-race children has increased dramatically. While sociologists have theorized about the challenges facing these individuals since early in the twentieth century, little systematic empirical research has explored their outcomes. Using a variety of data sources, we show that mixed-race individuals fall roughly in between their monoracial counterparts on most outcome categories: birth Entries are means and standard errors for our index measure of typical black behaviors by racial composition of school. The construction of the index is described in the text; the Web appendix provides additional detail and the source and precise definition of every variable used in construction.\n37 These are getting into trouble with one's teacher, trouble paying attention, trouble with homework, trouble getting along with other students, watching TV, fighting, committing violent acts, having sex, and contracting an STD. 38 More specifically, we regress all behavior variables from the school survey, which contains more observations than the home survey, for which blacks scored significantly higher in tables 6A and 6B on a vector of controls for gender, several age categories, place of birth, region, home environment variables, and multiple birth weight intervals, as well as school fixed effects. We then factor-analyze the residuals from these regressions. The first factor, which explains approximately 36% of the variance of the residuals, corresponds to our index of black behavior. Alternative ways of constructing on index, such as averaging the residuals (also including variables from the home survey), yield very similar results.\n39 Patterns in extracurricular sports roughly follow the distribution one might expect in the Roy model. Whites tend to participate more in baseball, field hockey, ice hockey, soccer, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling, whereas blacks are more likely to do track or play football and basketball. Mixed-race adolescents do more of all sports than blacks and only slightly fewer of the typically white sports than whites. 40 The assumption that blacks and whites have a predetermined peer group is equivalent to a prohibitively high cost of switching sectors. 41 Anecdotally, this phenomenon has been observed among some programs for gifted minority youth held at MIT each summer. These programs attract a subset of black and mixed-race children who are among the ''whitest'' acting in their schools. At MIT, however, they have a comparative advantage in acting ''black'' and engage in a wide range of behaviors to signal how ''black'' they are (Suskind, 1999) . Similarly, Canada (1995) speculates that even the most violent youth in Boston ''would not have lasted more than a couple of weeks in the South Bronx' ' (p. 25) .\n42 See Cicala, Fryer, and Spenkuch (2011) for a model of social interactions in which the payoff to group membership depends on group composition and individuals endogenously sort into peer groups."}, {"section_title": "632", "text": "THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS outcomes, demographics, home environments, scholastic achievement, and adult outcomes.

Interestingly, however, mixed-race individuals do not have particularly bad adult outcomes, despite the negative behaviors observed in adolescence. This raises an important question as to how detrimental negative adolescent behaviors are to long-term human capital formation."}]
