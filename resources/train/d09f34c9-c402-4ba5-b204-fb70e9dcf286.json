In response, myriad documents have been written describing the rationale and methods for coastal municipalities to begin planning for the inevitable submergence of vulnerable areas within their borders (c.f.

However, at the time of this investigation no local government along the east-central Florida coast (Volusia, Brevard, and Indian River Counties) had begun to seriously address either climate change or sea level rise. This was in part due to perceptions regarding scientific uncertainty and that climate Despite these obstacles, the City of Satellite Beach (City; Figs. 2 and 3) authorized a project designed to assess municipal vulnerability to rising sea level and facilitate discussion of potential adaptation strategies. The City's commitment to the project was secured by the availability of outside funds and a commitment to objectivity. Funds to conduct the assessment were provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Ready Estuaries (CRE) Program made available through the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program. The goal of this program is to \"enhance local efforts to develop a climate change adaptation plan that may not occur or otherwise be limited by inadequate financial resources.\" Objectivity was promoted by designing a transparent scope of work based upon sound scientific principles and the best available scientific information. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the methods used to assess municipal vulnerability to sea level rise, principle findings of the assessment, and initial municipal actions proposed to reduce potential impacts. Given the limited funding (US$25,000) and project duration (1 year), it was conceived as a pilot project with possible application to other Atlantic coast municipalities of peninsular Florida. The project was authorized in the September:2009; in July 2010 (i.e., less than 1 year later) an initial adaptation strategy was presented to the City Council.

It consists of 8.8 km 2 of Holocene barrier island with east and west boundaries delineated by the Atlantic Ocean and Banana River shorelines, respectively. The island consists principally of an unconsolidated mixture of quartz and shell sand, locally capped by a thin layer of wetland peat or upland soil profile. The maximum width of the island within City limits is 2.5 km. The current population of 10,848 corresponds to a density of 1,233 residents per square kilometer. This population density exceeds 85% of Florida's other municipalities due to a lack of extensive industrial or commercial development. Ninety-eight percent of the City's landscape is built; only 2% is undeveloped. The City's highest elevations are associated with the Atlantic Ocean coastal dune system and average about +15 ft (4.6 m) above sea level. Elevation and local relief decrease westward and away from the coastal dune system, with approximately onehalf of the City's landscape at elevations of +6 ft (8.1 m) or less."}, {"section_title": "Existing hazards", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Coastal erosion", "text": "All 36.5 miles (58.7 km) of Brevard County's beaches south of Cape Canaveral, including the entire shoreline of City, are designated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (Clark 2008) as critically eroded. A critically eroding shoreline is defined as imminently threatening upland development, recreational interests, wildlife habitat, or important cultural resources. Because sea level rise forecast to accompany global climate change will further disrupt the coastal \"equilibrium profile\" (Brunn 1962), both the rate and extent of erosion along the entire Brevard County coastline are expected to increase."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge", "text": "Although the City has not been subject to landfall of a hurricane in excess of a Category 2 storm since at least the mid nineteenth century, the potential devastating effects caused by flooding alone are enormous (Table 1). The magnitude of tropical  Bailey (2000) storms and hurricanes originating in the equatorial waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean is predicted to increase in association with climate change and concomitant rising temperature (Williams et al. 2009;Bender et al. 2010). This will elevate the risk and damage associated with storm surge, waves, wind, and rainfall. Furthermore, rising sea level will expand the extent and depth of inland flooding associated with the surge of these more powerful storms."}, {"section_title": "Sea level rise", "text": "Numerous factors can influence the relative direction and rate of sea level change. These include global phenomena such as an increase in the volume of sea water caused by the melting of continental glaciers, regional influences such as continental crust uplift (aka isostatic adjustments) triggered by the retreat of massive ice sheets, and local factors such as sediment compaction induced by extraction of groundwater and hydrocarbons (oil). The most significant factor influencing sea level change along the shorelines of central-and south-peninsular Florida is global eustatic change: a rise or fall in sea level elevation induced by an increase or decrease in seawater volume (respectively). The other factors are either absent (i.e., sediment compaction) or exert no significant influence (i.e., isostatic adjustments). This greatly simplifies any study attempting to quantify the causes or consequences of sea level change. The geologic record (i.e., sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology) of central-and south-Florida indicates the post-glacial marine transgression can be subdivided into three intervals, each characterized by a distinct rate of global eustatic sea level rise (hereafter sea level rise) and unique shoreline response (Table 2). Long-term tide-gauge data indicate the rate of sea level rise averaged 1.7 mm/year during the twentieth century, with an increase in the rate of rise over this period. This rate is faster than the preceding 3,000 year interval and is attributed principally to rising atmospheric temperatures and concomitant thermal expansion of the ocean's  (Williams et al. 2009). More recently (1993 to 2006), high precision satellite altimeters indicate sea level has been rising at 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm (0.13 + 0.02 in.) per year (Rahmstorf 2007). This most recent interval of acceleration is a direct consequence of the increasing influx of glacial meltwater from Antarctica and Greenland (Vinther et al. 2007). Given the strong relationship between the rate of sea level rise and Florida coastal response (Table 2), this recent acceleration has likely exacerbated historical trends in coastal erosion, flooding, and related deleterious effects such as salt water intrusion into local aquifers."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Public education and outreach", "text": "To undertake an assessment of municipal vulnerability that ultimately triggers planning and policy actions by the City Council, it was deemed crucial to maintain a public education and outreach campaign during the entire duration of the project.

The SCCCI was one of many local partners used to leverage EPA-provided resources and enhance project success. Each event was promoted for more than one month using a mixture of press releases, radio Public Service Announcements, event descriptions posted on SCCCI and City websites, and newsletters and websites of local environmental and civic organizations.

Model elements included recent, geo-rectified orthophotography and shape-files representing roads, boundaries, water bodies, and other resources ( Fig. 3). To emulate three dimensions, landscape elevation was added to the base map using LiDAR and associated orthophotography acquired by the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM). FDEM is responsible for developing and maintaining regional evacuation studies to assist disaster response personnel in preparing for all major hazards. The agency was directed by the Florida Legislature in 2006 to update coastal storm surge models using advanced high resolution technologies and computer-modeling. After a rigorous QA/QC review, these data were made available to Brevard County in 2009 (Fig. 4). The LiDAR elevation data is referenced to NAVD88. Extensive review of NOAA tide gauge stations located proximal to the City along the Atlantic Ocean and Banana River (c.f. No. 8721608 Canaveral Harbor Entrance, No. 8721843 Melbourne Causeway, No. 8721647 Merritt Causeway East, No. 8721789 Carters Cut, and No. 8722004 Sebastian Inlet), together with recommendations from other Florida counties grappling with this topic (i.e., Hal Wanless, Miami-Dade Climate Change Advisory Task Force; Nancy Gassman, Broward County) yielded a determination that the vertical datum should be changed to reflect Banana River mean water level (MWL; Fig. 3). The rationale for choosing a vertical datum linked to Banana River water level elevations was in large part the recognition that surging waters, which overtop the City, have historically originated from this water body. Submergence of the City by an Atlantic Ocean surge has generally been impeded by the presence of the contiguous coastal dune system with a minimal elevation of +14 ft (4.3 m). The data collected at Carters Cut (NOAA tide gauge station No. 8721789; Fig. 2) was ultimately used to establish the project's vertical datum. The mean water level (MWL) at Carters Cut between 1996 and 2001 is reported as \u22120.214 m (\u22120.702 ft) NAVD88 (T. Cera, St. Johns River Water Management District, unpublished 2010). This MWL elevation was increased by 0.025 m (0.08 ft) to account for sea level rise over the subsequent decade (i.e., 2001 to 2010) using a rate of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) per year (Lyles et al. 1988;Bindoff et al. 2007;Maul 2008). The adjusted vertical datum or MWL 2010 is therefore \u22120.189 m (\u22120.62 ft NAVD88). This water level correction is less than the vertical resolution of current LiDAR technology (\u223c6 in or 15.3 cm). However, it was applied to ensure future projects that may use this study as a template consider the complete suite of phenomena affecting local water level elevation before establishing a vertical datum of their own. The resulting topographic model for the City (Fig. 4) depicts a geomorphology that is typical of Holocene barrier islands along Florida's eastern coast including: \u2022 Highest elevations of 20+ ft (6.1 m) associated with the modern Atlantic coastal dune system \u2022 An undulatory or ridge and swale topography within the central portion of the island. These features can be traced northward into Cape Canaveral and Merritt Island, an extensive relict beach-ridge system. \u2022 Lowlands of +6 ft (1.8 m) or less throughout the western half of the island \u2022 Dredged canals, open water, and fresh-to brackish-water wetlands adjacent to the Banana River. The LiDAR data were also used to construct a hypsographic curve for the City (Fig. 5). This curve illustrates the cumulative percent of land area as a function of elevation and can be used to estimate the extent of municipal submergence associated with a particular rise in sea level. For example, a sea level rise of +2 ft (0.61 m) will inundate approximately 5% of the City's landscape."}, {"section_title": "Critical assets", "text": "The project team established a list of critical assets based upon a working definition: Buildings and facilities essential to a municipality's economy and the quality of life of its residents The asset list (Fig. 6, Table 3) was compiled by the project team using data provided by the City, East Central Florida Regional Planning Council, and other source agencies. The corresponding asset data and associated attributes (i.e., x and y coordinates, asset name or ID, source description) were then added to the GIS platform."}, {"section_title": "Municipal submergence", "text": "As an initial step in modeling municipal submergence, the project team conducted a literature review of current sea level rise projections. Projections of sea level rise have evolved rapidly over the past 20 years, in large part a consequence of the maturation of general circulation models. The initial forecast considered for use  Colored dots indicate impact elevation or when sea level is equal to or greater than asset elevation. Labels correspond to asset ID numbers in Table 3 during this investigation was that published in the 4th Assessment of the IPCC (Bindoff et al. 2007). However, forecasts of sea level rise well in excess of the IPCC assessment emerged shortly after its publication as the observed volume of meltwater from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets was shown to be much larger than initially predicted. The project team eventually settled on the work of Rahmstorf and colleagues (Rahmstorf 2007;Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009;Fig. 6) as representative of the currently accepted 'best guess,' i.e., a sea level rise of at least one meter by the year 2100. At the time of this investigation vulnerability assessments were being described with reference to: (1) a specific year (i.e., 2060 or 2100, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water 2009), (2) an emissions and corresponding sea level rise scenario (i.e., IPCC B1 or A1B; Burg 2010) and (3) a specific sea level elevation (i.e. +30 or +60 cm; Frazier et al. 2009). Given the ongoing debate regarding the precise nature of future greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric change, melting ice sheets, and resulting sea level rise, the project team decided the most defensible approach was to evaluate the vulnerability of the City as a function of sea level elevation. Therefore, the assessment would proceed by performing a time-series analysis of rising sea level at 1 ft (0.3 m) intervals with an upper boundary of +6 ft (1.8 m) as representative of the current maximum elevation likely reached by the year 2100 ( Fig. 1). Location is shown in Fig. 6 by reference to asset ID number (#). Impact elevation is height of rising sea level when asset centroid is submerged CSB City of Satellite Beach, ECFRPC East Central Florida Regional Planning Council, Alt data not readily available and ultimately acquired using alternate sources In all cases, City assets were impacted when the elevation of rising sea level (i.e., +1 ft above MWL) was equal to or greater than the elevation of the asset as indicated on the LiDAR-based topographic layer. The asset is initially flooded by seasonal high water in association with astronomic tides (aka the fall rise) and storm surge (details below). Permanent submergence follows as a function of long-term sea level rise. The application of this impact rule is obvious for assets represented by a point. For those assets mapped as a line (i.e., roads), the geoprocessing function CLIP was performed to isolate individual sections of the line data submerged by each one foot rise in sea level. In the case of features mapped as polygons, the elevation of the asset's centroid was used to quantify vulnerability.\nThe extent of municipal submergence forecast during a sea level rise of between +1 and +6 ft (0.3 and 1.8 m) is illustrated in Fig. 8. The impact to the urban landscape and critical assets is summarized in Table 4 and as follows. During the initial +2 ft (0.6 m) rise in sea level about 5% of the City's landscape will be submerged including: (1) the wetland fringe and canal margins of Lansing and Tortoise Islands, and (2) the banks of finger canals located east of the Grand Canal. Perhaps the most significant impact is to Samsons Island, wherein roughly one-half of the island is submerged. The relatively low elevation of Samsons Island is a direct result of two decades of management as conservation land, during which time there was no incentive to place additional fill on the island. Furthermore, segments of the  Table 3 for infrastructure and asset information SPD South Patrick Drive island's shoreline and interior have been lowered by removal of fill in conjunction with wetland mitigation. The subsequent +2 ft (0.6 m) rise in sea level is of much greater consequence as an additional 20% of the City is submerged. Rising waters will further inundate the City's three islands and the municipal landscape along South Patrick Drive. By the time sea level reaches +4 ft (1.2 m) above MWL 2010 , the entire South Patrick Drive transportation corridor is submerged, as are neighborhoods in the southwest region of the City. Several major roads (i.e., Roosevelt Ave, DeSoto Pkwy) extend the limit of submerged land eastward to within one half mile of Highway A1A. By the time sea level elevation reaches +6 ft (1.8 m) above MWL 2010 , 52% of the City will be underwater. This includes the entire western half of the City proximal to South Patrick Drive, most of the Pelican Coast neighborhood to the north, and about a third of the City's residential area located along its western border between Cassia Blvd and Satellite Avenue. Flooding along major roads extend the limit of flooding and submergence eastward to within one quarter mile of Highway A1A. In addition to expanded flooding and submergence, each stage in sea level rise compromises the function of critical assets, emergency evacuation routes, and the gravity driven storm-water system."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of assessment", "text": "This impact assessment is based upon the flooding of static terrain; i.e., the topography does not change as rising seas inundate the landscape. This type of vulnerability assessment has been described as a 'bathtub model' given similarity to the flooding in a bathtub as the level of water rises with increasing volume. The use of a bathtub model for this investigation was not considered a serious weakness, in part because the project was designed as a pilot study to provide both stakeholders and decision makers with an objective baseline from which an initial discussion regarding the magnitude and consequences of sea level rise could begin. The magnitude of geomorphic change (i.e., erosion) induced by water-waves and currents during a relatively rapid rise in sea level will probably not be significant. This suggestion is based upon geologic studies conducted on Florida's continental shelf, where paleo-coastlines of early Holocene age were overstepped and bypassed by shoreline erosion when subject to rates of sea level rise comparable to those now being forecast to accompany climate change (Table 2). Based upon these studies, erosion along segments of the City's shoreline and associated coastal dunes is expected to accelerate in the forthcoming years. However as sea level elevation and rate of rise continue to increase, much of the remaining low-lying landscape will likely be overstepped without significant topographic change; i.e. after exceeding local topographic elevations, the shoreline will advance landward to the next emergent landscape feature until it too is overtopped. For the purposes of this study, dredge and fill operations (aka beach nourishment) were assumed to delay shoreline change and therefore contribute to a static shoreline as was modeled in this pilot study. Finally, the use of a static landscape model is also justified by the presence of extensive coastal armoring along municipal shorelines; roughly one-third of the City's Atlantic shoreline and two-thirds of the canal shorelines are armored (J. Fergus, personal communication, June 2010). These engineered structures will limit shoreline retreat until they are overtopped by rising water."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Controls on landscape submergence", "text": "Two factors control spatial and temporal trends in landscape submergence associated with sea level rise: local relief and astronomic tides. The ability to predict how a coastal landscape may respond to rising sea level is therefore enhanced when these two factors are well understood."}, {"section_title": "Local relief", "text": "The progression of municipal landscape submergence during sea level rise over the balance of this century will be dictated primarily by the local relief encountered as rising waters of the Banana River advance eastward and into the City. The City's local relief is not haphazard or random, but instead has evolved over time in response to: (1) geological processes, (2) historical dredge and fill projects, and (3) urban construction activities. In general, the surface of a barrier island is highest along the seaward shoreline and slopes landward as a consequence of diminishing wave energy. Hence the lowest elevations are located along the western margin of the City and adjacent to the Banana River. The Grand Canal (Figs. 2 and 3) was excavated through this low-lying western terrain during the late 1950s and the spoil material generated during the dredging process placed directly on top of Banana River wetlands, which lay to the west. This spoil would ultimately become known as Tortoise, Samsons, and Lansing Islands. Additional spoil was generated during the construction of the finger canals to the east of the Grand Canal. This material was placed between each of the newly constructed navigable waterways to increase the elevation of upland areas where new homes would be built. Anthropogenic alteration of the island's geomorphology ultimately created a municipal landscape with minimum elevations coinciding with South Patrick Drive (Figs. 4 and 7). Terrain elevations increase both east and west of this roadway; however, western elevations are higher due to the presence of spoil material generated during construction of the City's canals. By contrast, terrain elevations to the east of Fig. 7 West to east topographic profile illustrating elevation of terrain along Roosevelt Ave (Figs. 3  and 4). As is typical of Atlantic Coast barrier islands, landscape elevation increases towards highenergy coastline (eastward). The elevated interval between South Patrick Drive and the Grand Canal reflects the presence of fill material acquired during dredging of the finger canals South Patrick Drive have not been subjected to extensive alteration and therefore are relatively low. Local relief of the barrier island south of Cassis Blvd, where the City lacks a western shoreline (Figs. 3 and 4), has not been altered by extensive dredge and fill. Thus, the lowest elevations of the City in this area are located along the City's western boundary. Trends in local relief and municipal landscape elevation were modified at a much smaller scale during construction of residential developments. To reduce the risk of flooding, planned home sites were elevated above natural grade using fill material gathered during the grading (lowering) of roadways and excavation of companion drainage ditches. As a result, the residential landscape hosts a grid of narrow, linear depressions."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal f looding", "text": "Each fall, water levels in the Banana River rise approximately one foot as a consequence of astronomic tidal forcing (the 'fall rise'). As a consequence, neighborhoods proximal to the Banana River generally flood several times a year. The magnitude and extent of flooding can be compounded by concomitant heavy rain or tidal surge associated with landfall of tropical storms and hurricanes. In the short term, this standing water renders streets impassable and disrupts the continuity of evacuation routes. The periodic saturation of sub-surface layers beneath the City's network of roads has been shown to reduce structural integrity and design life. This, in turn, leads to rising costs for road maintenance. Seasonal flooding events can also disrupt the function of the City's gravity-driven storm-water system. Water level records collected at the Carters Cut tide gauge station (Fig. 3) include four fall rise events during the interval 1996 to 2000. In 1999, Tropical Storm Irene made landfall, compounding flooding problems as the Banana River rose nearly a meter above mean water level. The project team chose to emulate the fall rise by inspecting the submergence data associated with the next one foot rise in sea level. To limit confusion, the term 'flooding' is used when referring to areas seasonally inundated. The term 'submerged' is used to describe areas inundated as a consequence of rising sea level."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary of findings", "text": "This project utilized a bathtub model to assess municipal vulnerability to a sea level rise of as much as +6 ft (1.8 m). The model's numerous simplifying assumptions (i.e., static Atlantic shoreline and groundwater table) yield a conservative estimate of submergence through the year 2100. Supplemental work to refine the model will likely forecast inundation at an even larger scale. Regardless, the findings of this pilot project are sufficiently robust to warrant action by City decision makers. The City is expected to lose 5% of its landscape during the initial +2 ft (0.6 m) of sea level rise, however much of this restricted to fringing wetlands and canals. The subsequent +2 ft (0.6 m) rise is forecast to submerge an additional 20% including residential neighborhoods, important transportation corridors, and numerous critical assets. These results suggest the tipping point between relatively benign impacts of rising sea level and impacts that disrupt important elements of the municipal landscape is +2 ft MWL 2010 . This point is clearly visible on the City's hypsographic curve as a distinct reduction in slope (Fig. 5). Seasonal flooding to an elevation of +2 ft is forecast to begin about 2050 and thus the City has about 40 years to formulate and implement a successful adaptation plan."}, {"section_title": "Managing sea level rise", "text": "There are three basic options in responding to sea level rise: (1) protect, (2) retreat, or (3) accommodate (Deyle et al. 2007). According to Titus (1991), choosing among these will be based upon an evaluation of the value of the threatened land (natural, built) and the cost of protection. More recently, Titus et al. (2009) reported that most of the Atlantic coast is developed to the extent that the likely response to sea level rise will be construction of shore protection projects (i.e., beach and dune nourishment, seawalls, dikes) to limit the effects of erosion and inundation. Managing sea level rise along the barrier islands of east-central Florida will prove challenging, however, as even the basic response options listed above are not viable. First, the City is built upon a segment of barrier island consisting primarily of highly porous and permeable sand. Under conditions of rising sea level, an increase in hydrostatic pressure will induce the flow of water through the sands, either beneath or behind the structures constructed to prevent flooding. If unimpeded, this landward flow will continue until hydrostatic equilibrium is reached. Thus, the engineered solutions (i.e., dikes, levees, and seawalls) employed or proposed to protect other Atlantic Coast cities from rising water will simply not work. Secondly, the retreat option is not a realistic local response, as it is predicated on the availability of land at higher elevations into which new construction or re-development can be directed. This option may be viable on a larger geographic scale, but not within the City limits where only 2% of the landscape is undeveloped."}, {"section_title": "Municipal adaptation", "text": "Commensurate with the ongoing assessment of municipal vulnerability to sea level rise, members of the Sea Level Rise Subcommittee were tasked with reviewing technical papers or other publications on climate change, sea level rise, and municipal adaptation strategies. These documents were provided by the project team and other local partners to help prepare Subcommittee members for the task ahead: formulating an initial municipal response to the risks made apparent by the vulnerability assessment. The Subcommittee ultimately decided upon a series of updates and revisions to the City's Comprehensive Plan as the most practical means by which to initiate an adaptation strategy. Their recommendations focused on four elements (future land use, housing, infrastructure, and coastal management/conservation) of the Plan and included: (1) 16 amendments to existing objectives and policies and (2) a new goal of the coastal management/conservation element, to provide \"adaptive protection of private and public interests from adverse impacts due to long-term changes in sea level.\" These recommendations were then debated by the full CPAB committee. A final version of proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan was then submitted to the City Council for their consideration. If approved by the City Council and Florida's Department of Community Affairs, these amendments will provide a legal basis for implementing specific actions designed to reduce the City's vulnerability to sea level rise as forecast to the year 2100. Under the current time line, the City Council will debate the CPAB recommendations in fall 2010. Thereafter, a series of workshops could be conducted to establish: (1) a City vision of adaptation (2011) and, thereafter, (2) an Adaptive Management Plan (2012). Elements key to the success of this project include external funding, inclusion of municipal staff on the project team, establishing an ad hoc Sea Level Rise Subcommittee that reported directly to the Comprehensive Planning Advisory Board, effective public education and outreach, and stakeholder confidence in the objectivity of the investigation and its recommendations. This ultimately allowed for the project to be successfully completed in less than 1 year."}]
