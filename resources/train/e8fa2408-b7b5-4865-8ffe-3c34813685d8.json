[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the last two decades, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has garnered increased attention, with a shift from a largely nosocomial etiology, affecting individuals with preexisting health conditions to that of community origin, affecting populations with limited healthcare exposures (Grundmann et al., 2006; Levy, 2010; Mediavilla et al., 2012) . The first cases of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) were documented in the 1990s (Herold et al., 1998) and have since increased dramatically (Dukic et al., 2013) . Because asymptomatic MRSA colonization is a risk factor for MRSA infection (Davis et al., 2004) , active surveillance for MRSA carriers is a potential preventive practice in hospital settings (Diekema and Edmond, 2007) . Likely due to improvements in hospital surveillance and biosecurity, hospital acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) cases have decreased, leading to a higher relative proportion of CA-MRSA overall (Dantes et al., 2013; Lowy, 2013; David et al., 2014) . This change in incidence and disease dynamics highlight the need to identify and characterize communitylevel risk factors for MRSA infection.\nSwine production facilities have been identified as environmental reservoirs of MRSA (Silbergeld et al., 2008b; Gilchrist et al., 2007) . The first livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA strain, ST398, was traced to swine farms and contact with livestock in Europe (Voss et al., 2005; van Loo et al., 2007; Feingold et al., 2012) . More recently, other LA-MRSA strains have been identified (Monecke et al., 2011; Molla et al., 2012; Frana et al., 2013) , and those found in the US appear to differ regionally (Casey et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013) . Using whole genome sequencing data, Price et al. (2012) first demonstrated jump of LA-MRSA from humans to swine and back, and multiple studies have shown an elevated prevalence of MRSA colonization in swine farmers and swine veterinarians (Smith et al., 2009 van Cleef et al., 2011 van Cleef et al., , 2014 Frana et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014; Nadimpalli et al., 2015; Rinsky et al., 2013) . The spread of antibiotic resistance has been a major concern since the introduction of non-therapeutic antibiotics for growth promotion into conventional livestock production systems (Starr and Reynolds, 1951; Levy et al., 1976) . Exposing microorganisms to consistent nontherapeutic levels of antibiotics may accelerate the formation of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (Akwar et al., 2007; Silbergeld et al., 2008a) . These bacteria can colonize and infect swine, contaminate their containment facilities and be excreted in waste. Further selective pressure by excreted and dispersed residual antibiotics (Hamscher et al., 2003; Dolliver and Gupta, 2008; Manzetti and Ghisi, 2014) and horizontal transfer of antimicrobial-resistant genes (Witte, 2000; Gilchrist et al., 2007; Marshall and Levy, 2011) can result in additional proliferation of both exogenous and endogenous antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in swine waste and the environment.\nThe shift of swine production to larger confinement operations has increased the volume of waste and may amplify the selection of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and antimicrobial-resistant genes (Silbergeld et al., 2008b) . Swine facility-level fate and transport studies have shown MRSA colonization of buildings and immediate surroundings (Leedom Larson et al., 2011) and the environmental dispersion of MRSA and their genetic markers via aerosolization and deposition (Chapin et al., 2005; Gibbs et al., 2006; Schulz et al., 2012) , spills and discharges from waste storage, direct land application for fertilizing crops (Chee-Sanford et al., 2009; Heuer et al., 2011) , runoff into surface waters (Pruden et al., 2012) , and groundwater leaching (Chee-Sanford et al., 2001) . Previous research shows that even indirect exposure may increase MRSA colonization risk among neighboring communities (Bisdorff et al., 2011; van Rijen et al., 2014; Feingold et al., 2012; Carrel et al., 2014) and shows the increase in livestock-associated strains in humans in areas devoid of livestock . However, the relative importance of different environmental media and specific exposure pathways is not completely understood (Appendix A, Fig. A.2 ). To our knowledge, only one other published study has investigated the relationship of non-occupational swine exposure to non-LA-MRSAspecific MRSA infection in the United States (Casey et al., 2013) .\nTo better understand how swine production may contribute to MRSA infection, we analyzed routinely-collected administrative hospitalization data and national swine inventory data to evaluate the association between community-level swine exposure and individual MRSA infection among skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) inpatients from 2008 to 2011 in Illinois. Illinois offers a unique study opportunity as it was the fourth highest swine producing state in the country throughout the study period, had sufficient variability in the concentration of production across the state, and by comparison is a low producer of other livestock that might confound study results (USDA, 2007 (USDA, , 2012 (USDA, , 2014 . We hypothesized that there would be increased risk of MRSA infections and colonization for individuals living in ZIP codes with increasing numbers of swine/km 2 and increasing numbers of large-scale facilities housing greater than 1000 swine. Additionally, we hypothesized that swine exposure would be more strongly associated with community-onset (CO-) MRSA compared to hospital-onset (HO-) MRSA."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Case ascertainment and outcome definitions", "text": "We utilized the Illinois Hospital Association's (IHA) Hospital Discharge Database (IHD) to identify MRSA infection among all statewide SSTI inpatient hospitalizations from January 2008 through July 2011. The IHA membership includes 97% of Illinois hospitals; the remaining nonmember hospitals treat 7% of all hospitalizations in Cook County, a primarily urban area encompassing the city of Chicago, IL (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2015) . Records stored in this database include all diagnoses identified and procedures reported using the 9th revision of the International Classification for Diseases coding (ICD-9) for up to 24 diagnostic positions. Although residential address is not available, the database included several relevant individual-level covariates, including ZIP code and county of residence, admission date, age, sex, type of health insurance and other comorbid risk factors (Appendix A, Table A .2).\nStudy inclusion criteria required records to contain ICD-9 codes 680\u2212686, indicating an SSTI, and to have a residential ZIP code and Federal Information Processing Standard County code within Illinois. Presence of MRSA was determined primarily using specified codes for MRSA infection, 041.12, 038.12, or 482.42, which were introduced to ICD-9 in the 2008 update (CDC/NCHS, 2013). To account for any outdated coding, we also included records with the code assignment for MRSA infection used prior to 2008, which requires both one code for Staphylococcus aureus infection (038.11, 482.41 or 041.11) along with the supplementary V09.0 code indicating resistance to penicillins (CDC/NCHS, 2013) .\nIn addition to the main analysis, we also evaluated the association of ZIP-based swine exposure and MRSA colonization, the results of which are included in Tables 1, 3 , as well as expanded results in the Appendix. The primary supplementary code used to identify MRSA colonization was V02.54. This specified colonization code was added to ICD-9 in 2008; thus, we also included the pre-2008 unspecified colonization code V02.59. For the MRSA infection analysis, MRSA-positive SSTI inpatients were compared to those without MRSA coding. For the MRSA-colonization analysis, MRSA-positive SSTI with MRSA colonization coding were compared to those without colonization coding (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "HO-and CO-MRSA coding designation", "text": "To assess the difference in risk from swine exposure for hospitalacquired and community-acquired MRSA, we assigned all MRSA infections as either HO-or CO-based on a modified version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) definitions for hospital-acquired and community-acquired MRSA. The CDC's definitions characterize these categories based on epidemiological criteria, rather than molecular specification. CDC case definition defines a community-acquired (CA) MRSA to be lacking the elements of a classical hospital acquired (HA) infection that includes at least one of the following: the appearance of MRSA more than 48 h after hospital admission; a history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term care facility within 1 year of the MRSA infection; the presence of an indwelling catheter or a percutaneous device; or previous MRSA infection (Fridkin et al., 2005) . Because we did not have the ability to account for full patient history we could not identify the specific time windows for diagnosis and clinical events, these components of the definition were not included in our analysis (Fridkin et al., 2005; Fig. A.1) . Inpatients were considered to have previous healthcare exposure if they were transferred or referred from another health care facility, or if they had a Schwartz et al. (2011) , the value reflects the sum of standardized z-scores of each component. G.A. Beresin et al.

In our infection-specific analysis among MRSA cases, HO-MRSA cases were included along with CO-MRSA cases."}, {"section_title": "Exposure assessment", "text": "Our primary analyses focused on ZIP code-level swine exposure, the finest residential resolution available for inpatients. Swine exposure was calculated as both a ZIP code area density (swine/km 2 ), and as the number of facilities in a ZIP code housing > 1000 swine (i.e., large farms). To derive the ZIP code-level swine density estimate, we utilized the web-based, publicly-available Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) (Burdett et al., 2015) that disaggregates county and state-level U.S. Department of Agriculture Census of Agriculture data and simulates the locations and inventories of individual swine farms, using a probability surface that predicts the number and size of swine farms. In addition to inspection of aerial photography for livestock farms, predictor variables for the FLAPS geographical distribution included environmental features like land-cover categories, topography, climate, and anthropogenic features such as roads and urban markets. We ran 100 FLAPS simulations for years 2007 and 2012, the most recent years for which Census of Agriculture data were available. Using ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, 2014) and the corresponding year's U.S. Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing ZIP code shapefile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014), we aggregated the total farms, total inventory, and number of large farms in each ZIP code. Each of the 100 simulation ZIP code aggregate values were averaged to obtain a single value for each ZIP code. Data were imputed across years between 2007 and 2012 using a smooth linear join interpolation, via the SAS Expand procedure, which fits a continuous curve to the data by connecting successive straight line segments (SAS/ ETS\u00ae 13.2 User's Guide, 2013). The final density estimate was calculated using the imputed values divided by the ZIP code area in km 2 . ZIP code swine estimates were aggregated to the county level and compared to Census of Agriculture estimates for evaluation of the method. County exposures were developed and analyzed separately and then compared to risks calculated for ZIP code exposures (Appendix A, Table A .2)."}, {"section_title": "Community-level demographic and land use data", "text": "Covariate data at the ZIP code-level was compiled from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates for 2007-2011 through the American FactFinder data repository (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). To assess potential confounding by socioeconomic status, we used the socioeconomic deprivation index developed by Schwartz et al. (2011) , which includes the following ZIP code-level covariates: percent of the population with less than high school education; percent of the civilian population not in the labor force; percent of the population below the federal poverty level; percent of the population receiving public assistance; percent of the civilian population who are unemployed; and percent of households with no vehicle access. Standardized Z-scores were calculated for each variable, which were summed to arrive at the deprivation index value. Positive numbers indicate increased deprivation and negative numbers indicate areas with high relative affluence. We also assessed additional covariates outside this index, including housing occupancy, median household income and individuals living in group quarters.\nRural/urban status was determined at the county level using USDA's Economic Research Service's 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) designations (USDA/ERS, 2013) . RUCC values range between 1 and 9 and are based on county population characteristics and adjacency to a metropolitan area. RUCC codes were combined into four categories. A value of 1 indicates \"metropolitan urbanized\" (RUCC 1, 2, 3), 2 indicates \"nonmetropolitan urbanized\" (RUCC 4, 5), 3 indicates \"less urbanized\" (RUCC 6, 7) and 4 indicates \"thinly populated\" (RUCC 8, 9) (Messer et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "All data management and statistical analyses were completed using Adjusted for race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation index; Farms > 1000: Adjusted for race, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation index, asthma, and COPD. e Density: Adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation index, COPD, public insurance recipient status and tobacco dependence; Farms > 1000: Adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation index, COPD, and public insurance recipient status.

We used logistic regression to evaluate whether an increase in 100 swine/km 2 within the residential ZIP code of an SSTI inpatient would increase their likelihood for having a MRSA positive infection, or be colonized by MRSA, and assessed if there was a difference in these associations comparing CO-MRSA to HO-MRSA. We examined whether an increase in one additional large swine farm per ZIP code increased the likelihood for the same outcomes. We also evaluated these outcomes in relation to ZIP code density and large farm operations that were binned into five exposure categories. The referent group for these categories included all individuals with no residential ZIP code-level swine exposure, while the other categories were created by evenly dividing the remaining study population into four exposure quartiles. In a separate analysis, the highest non-zero quartile was further divided into 50 swine/square km groupings up to > 150 swine/ square km for a focused analysis of the highest exposures (Table B. 3). A conceptual diagram (Fig. A. 2) was developed to identify potential confounding variables and effect measure modifiers (e.g., socio-demographic variables) based on risk factors identified from the literature. Health outcomes that are considered risk factors for MRSA infection that also may be potentially associated with swine exposure also were tested as confounding variables. Individual-level covariates examined as confounders included year and month of admission, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, age (< 1, \u22651 and < 5, \u22655 and < 10, \u226510 and < 25, \u226525 and < 50, \u226550 and < 75, \u226575), sex, race (Black, White, Other), ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), public insurance recipient status, and tobacco use (either presence of \"tobacco use disorder,\" ICD-9 code 305.1; or \"history of tobacco use,\" ICD-9 code V15.82 indicated tobacco use). Community-level covariates included median household income and socioeconomic deprivation index (Schwartz et al., 2011) . These variables were added individually to univariate logistic regression models as part of a change-in-estimate confounding analysis. Variables that changed the unadjusted beta coefficient associated with swine exposure by greater than 10% were considered confounders. Confounders empirically identified for at least one of the final regression models included sex, age, race, ethnicity, public insurance recipient status, asthma, COPD, tobacco use, and the socioeconomic deprivation index.\nWe undertook additional analyses to assess differences in effect estimates across stratification by in RUCC and Charlson Index scores. Results were stratified by the four Charlson comorbidity index scores (Charlson et al., 1987) ranging from \"not-ill\" to \"moribund\". A MRSAspecific comorbidity index scoring system was also used to assess the accuracy of our CO-HO-designations and to examine the influence of comorbidity status on our study results (Appendices A.2, B.1 and B.4). We also stratified our analysis by RUCC to assess the potential for urbanicity and population density to modify the odds ratio for MRSA and hog exposure through population-driven transmission dynamics or land-use-related factors. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of a different spatial scale of the continuous ZIP code exposure metric by analyzing county-level swine density (Appendix B.2), derived from published Agricultural Census data and National Agricultural Statistics Service survey data available through the Quickstats 2.0 data repository (USDA/NASS, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics for exposures and outcomes", "text": "The 2008\u22122011 hospitalization database included 219,200 records for SSTI inpatients in Illinois, of which 3982 (1.8%) were excluded due to missing ZIP codes.

CO-MRSA accounted for 80% of all MRSA infections (n=20,445). After interpolation of FLAPS model ZIP code-level averages between the Census of Agriculture years 2007 and 2012, 303 (21.9%) of the 1384 ZIP codes had no swine production, accounting for 46% of the study population.

In contrast, the age distribution of HO-MRSA inpatients appeared similar to non-MRSA SSTI inpatients, with more inpatients in the two oldest age categories. HO-MRSA inpatients were similar to the MRSA-colonization group in every aspect described, except race and asthma (Appendix B.1). A smaller proportion of the MRSA infections lived in metropolitan urbanized (RUCC 1) areas, while more lived in non-metropolitan urbanized and less urbanized areas (RUCC 2 and 3) compared to the non-MRSA group (Table 2) . While all MRSA infections and CO-MRSA inpatients were generally healthier (37% and 43% \"not ill\" Charlson Score) compared to the non-MRSA group (29% not ill), MRSA-colonized and HO-MRSA inpatients were less healthy (21% and 11%) (Appendix B.2)."}, {"section_title": "Swine exposure and MRSA infection and colonization among SSTI inpatients", "text": "Compared to the non-MRSA SSTI inpatients, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) for all MRSA SSTI were similar to adjusted ORs (aORs) irrespective of exposure metric.

Similar aORs were detected for MRSA infection when stratifying by Charlson Score for both exposure metrics, although a slightly larger aOR was found for the unhealthiest Charlson group. CO-MRSA compared to HO-MRSA showed larger aORs for healthiest and unhealthiest groups for both indices (Appendix B, Table B .4)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We detected a consistent, statistically significant association between ZIP code-level swine exposure and both MRSA infections and MRSA-colonization SSTI inpatient hospitalizations in Illinois from 2008 to 2011. Though limitations of the dataset make definitive conclusions difficult, these findings suggest that indirect environmental exposure to swine production, through either increasing number of large farms or density of swine at the ZIP code level, may increase the risk of developing MRSA. We saw similar effect estimates for ZIP code-level and county-level swine density estimates (Appendix B.5). Unlike the increased ORs detected for large farms based on the ZIP code-level metric, we saw no associations at the county level. This may be due to the fact that the distribution of swine is not homogenous within a given county with variations in the number of swine at different locations, creating pockets of high and low exposures. Since conceptually, large farms could act as a potential point-sources, the county scale may be less likely to capture their impact compared to the ZIP code.\nThe only other study on swine exposure and non-type-specific MRSA infection in the United States (Casey et al., 2013) provides insight regarding potential environmental pathways. They report aORs for both the highest versus lowest quartile of residential distance to manure application site (aOR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.13-1.69) and the inverse weighted distance to swine facilities (aOR=1.25, 95% CI: 0.99-1.58). Most of the swine operations in their study applied manure off site. The range of distance to application sites in their study was 2.6-7.5 km. In addition to the potential for the facilities to be sources of MRSA, this suggests the potential importance of ambient, non-point source exposures and supports considering a density metric as we have included in this analysis. We observe that, despite using coarser, publicly-available data at the ZIP code-level, the magnitudes of our categorical exposure estimates are comparable to the estimates of Casey et al. (2013) .\nAlthough our study suggests that the association between MRSA colonization and continuous swine exposure is similar to that of MRSA infections (Appendix B.3), we are unable to draw definitive conclusions about the colonization group, due to the low number of cases identified using this administrative database, and likely selectivity of individuals tested for colonization across hospitals. While the continuous swine exposure demonstrated similar associations for both MRSA infection and MRSA-colonization, differences were noted between the two outcomes based on the categorical analysis (Table 3 , Appendix B.3)\nThough the exposure-response differences observed between infection and colonization could be due to chance or exposure misclassification, they may also result from inconsistent testing for colonization among hospitals. Colonization ICD-9 coding is available in the discharge data, but the timing and reason for testing is not available for the study population examined from 2008 to 2011. Beginning in 2007, Illinois passed legislation requiring hospital control plans for MRSA, including mandatory screening for ICU inpatients and other at-risk individuals admitted. \"At-risk\" is not defined in the legislation, but this would likely include some vulnerable populations, including, for example, those who live in nursing homes. In our data set, colonized inpatients appear to be older, less healthy individuals compared to all other SSTI inpatients. Given that colonization is almost certainly underreported and because it may be differential based on the hospital, the direction of any potential bias is not known.\nAlthough it is an important risk factor for MRSA infection, a positive test for MRSA colonization does not always precede onset of MRSA infection (Davis et al., 2004) . The swine-MRSA infection association may be due to an increase in ambient antibiotic residues and specific genes that increase the potential for the transfer of antibiotic resistance to a pathologically relevant organism in a person's immediate environment, rather than as a direct exposure to or colonization by MRSA organisms living on swine farms. Unfortunately, the hospitalization discharge database did not include occupational information, which would help distinguish if an inpatient may have had occupational swine exposure. Future research on swine exposure and MRSA colonization should consider the impact of differences in colonization testing across hospitals, document the particular MRSA strain(s), and ideally control for occupation to account for alternative sources of MRSA exposure.\nAlthough the broad exposure ranges within the ZIP code swine density categories reduces the influence of exposure misclassification that may occur due to the error expected from the use of ZIP code-based exposure estimates, we would expect larger potential impact of this Environmental Research 159 (2017) [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] misclassification in categories with small cell sizes. Related to this, the study does not take into account the swine density metrics of surrounding residential ZIP codes, so if a person lives in a low density ZIP code that borders a very high density ZIP code, the assigned estimate may not adequately represent their true exposure. Finally, we do not control for repeated observations for each ZIP code, which would help account for any within-ZIP code clustering. While controlling for repeated ZIP codes would unlikely impact the direction and magnitude of effect estimates, it is an important limitation because this may create artificially small confidence intervals. We found that, in general, different swine exposure metrics did not increase the likelihood that a given MRSA hospitalization would have the CO-MRSA designation versus the HO-MRSA designation. Among both inpatient and outpatient MRSA cases, Casey et al. (2013) also found similar associations between swine exposure and CA-(aOR=1.38, 1.13-1.69) and HA-MRSA (aOR=1.30, 1.05-1.61) compared to non-SSTI controls. However we did note an increased likelihood for CO-MRSA in the lowest swine density exposure category compared to the referent. This is consistent with the increased association with CO-MRSA compared to HO-MRSA in non-metropolitan urban areas. However, data limitations inhibit our ability to draw definitive conclusions about whether swine exposure may be more associated with CO-vs HO-MRSA, and could also explain some of our inconsistent categorical results. There may be misclassification of the CO-MRSA outcome based on the \"Present on Admission\" data in our study, in addition to our inability to account for the timing of onset beyond this hospital admission indicator. Our study estimated a CO-MRSA prevalence of 80% in 2008 compared to 62% community-acquired cases for the same year in a Chicago Medical Center study using molecular characterization techniques (David et al., 2014) . However, while exposure to healthcare settings help designate a suspected community-acquired or hospital-acquired case, they are may not always be predictive of molecular characterization associated with healthcare settings . Misclassification of HO-vs CO-MRSA may also result from incomplete patient history, since the available records did not account for all previous visits to healthcare facilities, nor whether the inpatients normally reside in nursing homes. Overall, even if we had perfect sensitivity and specificity in our classifications, HOand CO-MRSA designations may be less etiologically relevant, as colonization by MRSA may occur prior to the development of the infection within the hospital."}, {"section_title": "G.A. Beresin et al.", "text": "Illinois proved to be a good study location to assess the potential role of swine exposures for MRSA infection, because there are areas within the state which represent combinations of both relatively low and high swine production with and without large human populations (Fig. 1) . This variability allows for assessment of the impact of swine production, given different urban and rural land uses, which have been previously associated with MRSA (Naimi et al., 2003; Casey et al., 2013; Dantes et al., 2013) . Additionally, we derived exposure estimates that had higher spatial resolution than county swine inventory, which is generally the lowest geographic resolution for reporting livestock inventory nationally (Appendix B, Table B.5). Although RUCC may not adequately capture the complex transmission dynamics across communities with different degrees of urbanicity, our analyses suggest that swine production may be a more important MRSA risk factor in more urbanized areas. It is important to note, however, that these findings are not consistent across categories and outcomes. We found an inverse relationship for nonmetropolitan urban areas for MRSA infections compared to non-MRSA SSTIs. This may mean that the likely stark separation between swine-dense areas and residential areas plays a more important role in non-metropolitan urbanized zones compared to the same separation in fully urbanized areas because there are fewer individuals and less connectivity between those individuals, potentially decreasing the likelihood of secondary transmission., It appears that for the same RUCC groupings, CO-MRSA is has a stronger association with increased swine exposure compared to HO-MRSA. This could potentially indicate that the association may be preserved for CO-MRSA cases only and could result from fundamental differences in transmission dynamics within this type of region. When considering MRSA colonization and eventual transmission of infection via a person-to-person pathway, denser populations may expand the community reservoir for MRSA and increase the potential for persistent colonization of MRSA on fomites in the home environment (Desai et al., 2011; Davis et al., 2012) . Future research could include a more refined urban-rural classification continuum and integration of interaction terms to better understand the effect measure modification potential of population dynamics. Additionally, employing a hierarchical model to capture the impact of characteristics of nested geographies should be considered for future research.\nAn additional study strength is that our records included both old and new MRSA ICD-9 coding, avoiding loss of cases attributable to administrative coding changes. This was especially important for 2008 where the majority (98%) of MRSA hospitalizations were identified using the older code assignment. The primary purpose of most administrative hospitalization databases is claims reimbursement and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reporting only requires nine diagnostic fields, and processing claims for reimbursement often causes truncation of records. This is concerning for characterizing MRSA cases, which requires a supplemental ICD-9 code (Schaefer et al., 2010; Jhung and Banerjee, 2009 ). Fortunately, IHA records are not truncated to the minimum Medicare and Medicaid claims requirements for the years included in our study, so the use of supplemental codes for G.A. Beresin et al. Environmental Research 159 (2017) 46-60 resistant infection and comorbidity should increase case ascertainment compared to other less robust administrative databases. Lastly, our outcome data are relatively comprehensive since they comprise reported SSTI hospitalizations for 97% of the state of Illinois. Also related to MRSA case ascertainment, there is some uncertainty in the literature as to the validity and completeness of administrative databases due to the possibility of detection differences from variable bacterial culture protocol, reporting, and coding variability across hospitals (Leal and Laupland, 2010; Schaefer et al., 2010; Casey et al., 2014) . We are less confident, for example, that all secondary diagnoses and supplementary codes, indicating complications and comorbidities, are included consistently across hospitals. While administrative coders must undergo extensive certificate training, differences in ICD-9 administrative records at discharge could be influenced by clinician thoroughness, hospital throughput, and available resources, among other factors (Leal and Laupland, 2010) .\nWe acknowledge that hospital records alone may not be ideal for assessing environmental influences on MRSA infections, as some MRSA cases in our study base could be diagnosed and treated in outpatient settings. According to a review of the literature during the same time period as our study, about 70-75% of SSTI's are treated in outpatient settings (Ki and Rotstein, 2008) . Outpatients may also represent less acute or complex cases that would require hospital stay. Therefore, our study results may only be generalizable to hospitalized SSTI patients. In addition to case severity differences, there may be other fundamental differences between this population and those utilizing outpatient treatment, such as those using an emergency room in place of available primary care, or differential hospital accessibility based on urbanicity or residential proximity. This hospitalization database was also unable to account for recurrent cases or MRSA because there was no unique client identifier. This is a limitation because reoccurrence of MRSA has been well established in the literature; thus, the magnitude of the effect estimates may be over-estimated if a lot of recurrent cases are included. In contrast, the use of SSTI hospitalizations as our study population may underestimate the underlying relationship between MRSA and swine exposures, as some research suggests that exposure may independently increase the risk of SSTIs (Casey et al., 2013; van Rijen et al., 2013) . Though it would be preferable to compare our MRSA to a non-MRSA group that did not exhibit this condition, SSTI's are an appropriate type of MRSA infection to explore as they tend to have a higher proportion of CO-MRSA infection and may be more relevant for the exposure metrics examined here, compared to other syndromes like septicemia or respiratory MRSA infection.\nThe FLAPS model relies on the county and state reported number of farms identified in the 2007 and 2012 Censuses of Agriculture (Burdett et al., 2015) to allocate over 99% of the USDA census-reported swine population across the United States. Given uncertainties in the swine census data, the USDA/NASS (2012a, 2012b) has adjusted the estimated Illinois swine inventory total for errors due to nonresponse (15.7%), misclassification (1.4%), and coverage (0.8%). Because much of the uncertainty in swine inventory could result from nonresponse, there is potential for over or underestimating exposure if owners' and operators' propensity to respond is systematically related to farm size. Additional uncertainty introduced through our aggregation of farm locations predicted by FLAPS model to ZIP code is difficult to quantify, but use of 100 simulations for each census year provides a central tendency estimate of the modeled outcomes (Burdett, personal communication) . Our exposure assessment at the ZIP code-level may be subject to the modifiable area unit problem (Openshaw, 1984) . Because the farm locations predicted by FLAPS are based on a presence/absence probabilistic predicative model across a continuous grid, each simulation will have slightly different farm locations that can land indiscriminately inside or outside ZIP code boundaries. As a result, the final density measure variability tends to increase with ZIP codes of smaller areas that lie within counties of high swine production. In our data set, ZIP codes with the highest human population were within those with small areas. Though there was concern that smaller ZIP codes with higher human population would be assigned higher swine density due to MAUP and potentially bias results, evaluation of the FLAPS data showed no consistent relationship between ZIP code area and swine density estimates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and recommendations", "text": "Given the growing public health concern over antibiotic resistance, coupled with the predominance of large operations regularly administering non-therapeutic doses of antibiotics, additional studies are needed to increase the understanding of how swine production may contribute to environmental transmission of MRSA. Although we detect a consistent association for different ecological exposure metrics, routinely-collected national health and exposure data may not be sufficient for characterizing potential risk from specific exposure pathways. Therefore, more research is needed to delineate the contribution of person-to-person transmission from other environmental pathways of exposure via various media. In addition to assessing address-level information, a spatial analysis with integration of waste-movement modeling that incorporates additional sources of environmental exposures such as hospitals, slaughterhouses (van Cleef et al., 2011) , and wastewater treatment plants (Pruden et al., 2012) and the inclusion of additional environmental covariates (e.g., soil type, slope, proximity to waterways, etc.) could improve delineation of the potential risk due to swine facilities. Finally, the addition of molecular characterization data for reported infections would not only improve case ascertainment, but would provide insight into strains related to swine production. This information, along with characterized strains from nearby facilities and within environmental media, would give further insight into the movement of resistance through the environment, important genetic mechanisms, and identification of strains with higher zoonotic potential.\nAppendix A.
