Little is known about the association between urbanicity and depression or about the interaction of urbanicity, race/ethnicity, and sex on depression and mood disorder prevalence.\nOBJECTIVE To examine the interaction of urbanicity and race/ethnicity on lifetime and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) and mood disorder prevalence for African American women and non-Hispanic white women. However, the interaction of urbanicity and race/ethnicity suggested that rural non-Hispanic white women had a significantly higher odds of meeting criteria for lifetime (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.22-6.24) and 9.48; 95% CI,) MDD and for lifetime (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.06-4.87) and 12-month (OR, 5.99; 95% CI, 3.01-11.94) mood disorder than rural African American women. Adjusted prevalence analyses revealed significantly lower rates of lifetime (4.2%) and 12-month (1.5%) MDD among rural African American women than their urban counterparts (10.4% vs 5.3%; P \u0545 .01). The same pattern was found for mood disorder, with rural African American women experiencing significantly lower rates of lifetime (6.7%) and 12-month (3.3%) mood disorder when compared to urban African American women (13.9% vs 7.6%; P \u0545 .01) Conversely, rural non-Hispanic white women had significantly higher rates of 12-month MDD (10.3%) and mood disorder (10.3%) than their urban counterparts (3.7% vs 3.8%; P \u0545 .01).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rural residence differentially influences MDD and mood disorder prevalence among African American women and non-Hispanic white women. These findings offer a first step toward understanding the cumulative effect of rural residence and race/ethnicity on women's depression prevalence, suggesting the need for further research in this area."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "the United States, depression prevalence among both African Americans and rural residents is understudied. [4] [5] [6] [7] The mental health of African Americans living in rural communities has been largely ignored, 8 which is of concern because African Americans and rural residents are more likely than their non-Hispanic white and urban counterparts to experience circumstances and conditions that may increase risk for depression, including living in poverty, having lower levels of educational attainment, and reporting fair or poor health. [9] [10] [11] [12] Despite greater likelihood of risk factors for depression, epidemiological surveys consistently indicate that African Americans have lower lifetime rates of MDD and equivalent or lower rates of 12-month MDD compared with non-Hispanic whites.\n1,2,13-16 However, when African Americans experience depression, it is often more persistent and manifests with greater severity."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "National surveys examining urbanicity differences in depression prevalence indicate that rural Americans experience MDD at similar or greater rates than their urban counterparts. 1, 2, 17, 18 In addition, suicide rates in rural America are higher than those in urban and suburban areas of the country, 19 suggesting that depression may be more severe in rural communities. It is unclear whether rural Americans' depression is associated with rural residence itself 17 or with health and resource disparities common in rural areas."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "African Americans, one of the largest minority groups in rural America, comprise approximately 8% of the rural population. 9, 12 However, only 2 known studies 18,20 used national data to examine depression among rural African Americans. The results of this research are inconsistent. One study 18 found that while rural adults experienced a significantly higher depression prevalence compared with urban adults, rural residents' depression prevalence did not vary significantly by race/ ethnicity. The other study 20 identified rural residence as protective against suicide among African Americans. The lack of attention to African Americans' and rural residents' depression is of particular concern among women. [4] [5] [6] [21] [22] [23] Despite the literature indicating that women's depression prevalence is 1.5 to 3 times higher than men's, 1, 2, 24 epidemiological research seldom reports within-group differences in depression prevalence among African American or rural respondents by sex. suggests that African American women in the rural South share unique strengths and coping strategies that positively affect well-being. 30 However, the interaction of urbanicity and race/ ethnicity on MDD prevalence among women has not been examined, to our knowledge. Another important factor related to depression in the United States, especially among African Americans, is the region of residence. Research suggests significant differences in depression prevalence by region, with lower prevalence among southern residents. 1, 15, 31 Because almost 60% of African Americans and 90% of rural African Americans reside in the southern United States, 32 the association between region and depression among this population should be considered. Epidemiological research conducted in the South found a significantly lower MDD prevalence among rural residents compared with urban residents, with no variation by race/ethnicity. 33 Other literature identified southern residence as protective against African Americans' suicide risk 34, 36 but did not assess urbanicity differences. Given the seasonal effect on depression, research suggests that a southern climate, particularly exposure to sunlight, may relate to lower depression prevalence. However, the results of studies 30, 34, 37 suggest that for African Americans the protective nature of southern residence may be due to a higher population density of African Americans in the region, ties to extended family and kinship networks, and the African American church. The present study investigated the interaction of urbanicity and race/ethnicity on lifetime and 12-month MDD and mood disorder prevalence among female respondents from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). The NSAL sample includes a substantial proportion of rural and suburban respondents, all of whom were recruited from the southern United States. Regional concentration of rural and suburban respondents is important to account for given the geographic distribution of the African American population 12, 32 and the identification of southern residence as protective against for depression. 1,15 Therefore, the analytic sample of this study was restricted to female NSAL respondents from the South."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The Respondents self-identifying as black with no ancestral ties to the Caribbean are described as African American.

This study's analytic sample was restricted to 1462 African American women and 341 non-Hispanic white women recruited from the South because all suburban and rural NSAL respondents resided in this region. Because of the lack of variability in urbanicity among Caribbean black respondents (ie, all urban residents), they were not included in these analyses.

Findings suggest a significant interaction of urbanicity and race/ ethnicity on lifetime and 12-month MDD and mood disorder among women in this sample. While African American women living in rural areas overall have lower odds of meeting criteria for MDD and mood disorder compared with urban African American women, rural non-Hispanic white women have a significantly higher odds of meeting criteria than rural African American women. Adjusted prediction analyses suggest that rural African American women have significantly lower prevalences of depression and mood disorder than their urban counterparts, while rural nonHispanic white women experience higher 12-month MDD and 12-month mood disorder prevalence compared with their urban peers. Given the substantial barriers to mental health treatment in rural America (eg, the limited availability of health care professionals, as well as cost, transportation, and acceptability issues related to stigma and a lack of anonymity), these results shed light on important subgroup differences and may help inform mental health interventions and strategies to increase access to care. The significantly higher odds of meeting criteria for MDD and mood disorder found among rural non-Hispanic white women (as well as their significantly higher adjusted 12-month MDD and mood disorder prevalence compared with their urban peers) is consistent with community samples demonstrating high rates of depressive symptoms among rural women. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Although this study does not assess which aspects of rural life may increase non-Hispanic white women's risk for depression, other research points to factors present in the rural context such as high poverty rates, social isolation, and limited access to resources and services. 5, 27 Substantial change in economic opportunity and family structure within rural communities may also influence women's emotional wellbeing. Furthermore, evidence suggests that rural cultural values emphasizing independence and self-reliance and deeply entrenched traditional sex roles may relate to rural women's depression."}, {"section_title": "5,27", "text": "Rural women face increased pressure to enter the labor force and have done so at a faster rate than urban women. 48 This is influenced by financial pressure that is exacerbated by declines in traditionally male-dominated industries, including farming, fishing, forestry, and mining. Consequently, rural women may experience stress due to role overload resulting from multiple roles and responsibilities. 49 As is true for women across the country, rural women have primary responsibility for housework and child care. The literature suggests that many rural women also experience a third shift because they are responsible for farmwork in addition to employment outside the home (first shift) and household and child care responsibilities (second shift), leaving little time to address their own needs or seek social support. 50 Furthermore, because traditional sex roles and conservative values are more commonly held by rural residents than by urban dwellers, 51, 52 conventional views of motherhood are prevalent among rural women, who may struggle to reconcile the ideal of the stay-at-home mom with the financial need to enter the labor market. 52 It is likely that the stress of juggling multiple roles and responsibilities contributes to depressive symptoms among rural women. Despite the literature asserting that aspects of the rural context may leave women at risk for depression, 5,27,48-52 our results suggest that rural residence is associated with lower odds of meeting criteria for MDD and mood disorder for African American women. Most research on rural life does not consider experiences of women of color. Therefore, investigations of the relationship between rural residence and women's depression likely do not generalize to the African American experience. African American women's strengths have not been adequately considered. 53 Of particular relevance, the literature suggests that African American women in the rural South share a history and context that structures their experiences, including unique strengths that affect quality of life and well-being. 30, 54 Evidence suggests that African American women have developed resources and coping strategies to deal with stressful circumstances and subjugation, including supportive social ties, high levels of religious participation, group identity and consciousness, and perceptions of mastery or control and self-esteem. 53 Many of these coping resources are deeply entrenched within African American culture in the rural South and may inform why rural residence is associated with lower rates of depression and mood disorders among African American women.\nFor instance, black adults report higher levels of religiosity, which can serve as a buffer against mental health problems. 55 Higher levels of religious participation among African Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites are well documented. 37, 56 Research indicates that religious participation is protective against MDD among African Americans 57 and is positively associated with psychological well-being among African American women. 58 Furthermore, research among older adults suggests that religious participation may have stronger protective effects for African Americans than for non-Hispanic whites. 59, 60 However, it remains unclear whether higher rates of religious participation differentially protect rural African American women against MDD. This requires further research. Furthermore, although rural environments often lack formal sources of social support, African Americans in the South demonstrate greater flexibility with respect to familial caretaking responsibilities and reliance on co-caregivers, usually grandmothers. 54, 61, 62 This may result in higher levels of informal social support and the presence of natural helpers in rural African American communities, which act as a buffer against emotional distress, including depression. 63 This may in part account for the low rates of depression among rural African American women in this study. This study has limitations that must be addressed. First, while the NSAL included one of the best rural samples available (with 20.1% of female respondents recruited from rural areas), the number of rural cases was still somewhat small, and the results are based on few respondents who met criteria for MDD and mood disorders. In an attempt to increase the number of non-Hispanic white respondents in this study, we also considered using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. However, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication contained a limited number of rural cases, precluding our ability to meaningfully assess urbanicity differences in MDD using a larger non-Hispanic white sample. Future research investigating depression among African Americans and rural residents with national and regional samples is needed.\nSecond, trained interviewers used structured diagnostic questionnaires. However, we do not know whether factors related to African American or rural culture may have affected respondents' willingness to admit or recall the presence of symptoms.\nThird, while the NSAL non-Hispanic white sample is nationally representative in the strictest sense, it is not optimal for descriptive analysis of the non-Hispanic white population in the United States. Instead, the stratified, disproportionate sampling of non-Hispanic whites was selected to offer the most meaningful comparison with black Americans.\nFourth, the analytic sample was restricted to female NSAL respondents residing in the South. As such, the demonstrated interaction of urbanicity and race/ethnicity on depression prevalence cannot be generalized to other regions of the country.\nFifth, the NSAL is the largest study of African Americans' mental health conducted to date in the United States and represents the only data on African Americans' mental health based on a national probability sample. However, the timeliness of the data (collected between 2001 and 2003) is a limitation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "These limitations notwithstanding, our findings indicate important urbanicity and race/ethnicity differences in MDD and mood disorder among women in this sample.
