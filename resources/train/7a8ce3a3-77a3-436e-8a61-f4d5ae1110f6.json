[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The top three highest selling drugs for neurological disorders in the US benefit only around 7%-20% of the patients who are treated with them (Schork, 2015) . Despite such high failure rates, these drugs are still systematically prescribed by most physicians. Based on the principles of generalized medicine, a plausible justification is the belief that, within a pool of patients sharing a common clinical diagnosis, at least some of them will respond satisfactorily to the standard treatment. In contrast, personalized medicine (PM) is based on the optimization of treatment plans for individual patients through consideration of particular characteristics, including molecular (e.g. genetic), macroscopic (e.g. imaging, physiology) and medical information (Davis et al., 2009; Whitcomb, 2012; Schork, 2015; Carrasco-Ramiro et al., 2017) . However, although the principles of PM were proposed decades ago, this approach has not yet become widely established in medical practice. In the neurological context, this delay is linked to critical methodological limitations, notable examples being: i) the common misuse of association analyses (e.g. correlation/regression tests) for identifying pathologic causal events and their effects, ii) the incorrect extrapolation of group-based statistical inferences for identifying potential disease biomarkers at the individual level, and, remarkably, iii) the paradoxical confidence in broad clinical/cognitive categories for validating new patient subtypes, often introducing circularity issues in the analyses.\nFrom the molecular to the macroscopic scales, the brain constitutes a complex dynamic system (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Sporns, 2011) , modulated by intrinsic multifactorial causal interactions and external influences (Iturria-Medina and Evans, 2015; Muldoon et al., 2016; Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . During the last few decades, we have seen considerable advances in brain modeling using network-based approaches (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Iturria-Medina, 2013; Sporns, 2013) . Most studies have focused on the spreading of normal and pathologic functional signals (Sotero et al., 2007; Valdes-sosa et al., 2011; Cabral et al., 2012; Sanz Leon et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2014; Iturria--Medina et al., 2014; Sanz-Leon et al., 2015; Stam et al., 2016) and, more recently, on the local interactions among different biological factors (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . Dynamic network modeling has contributed significantly to our understanding of dissimilar brain mechanisms, such as the intricate spatiotemporal propagation of neuronal activity (Sotero et al., 2007; Valdes-sosa et al., 2011; Cabral et al., 2012; Sanz Leon et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2014; Sanz-Leon et al., 2015; Stam et al., 2016) or the toxicity of misfolded proteins (Seeley et al., 2009; Iturria--Medina et al., 2014) . Moreover, pioneering work has extended previous formulations, relying on the mathematical elegance and validity of the control theory (Kalman, 1963; Klickstein et al., 2016) , for predicting the functional and cognitive responses of the brain under the influence of external experimental interventions (Betzel et al., 2016; Muldoon et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Tang and Bassett, 2017) . Robust experimental evidence supports the validity of the control principles that characterize and control living dynamic neuronal systems (Tang and Bassett, 2017; Yan et al., 2017) . Recently, seeking to incorporate multiple relevant biological factors, rather than only functional neuronal signals (e.g. brain metabolism, vasculature, toxic proteins, and tissue structure), an integrative multifactorial causal model of brain organization and control was proposed (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . For each patient, this approach allows accurate characterization of the intra-brain factor-factor causal interactions, the spreading of multifactorial pathologic signals through different brain networks (e.g. axonal and vascular connectomes), and assessment of the effectiveness of either single-target or combinatorial therapeutic interventions (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) .\nPrompted by the urgent demand for identifying effective individualized treatments, here, we introduce and validate the concept of the personalized Therapeutic Intervention Fingerprint (pTIF). Based on the MCM framework and the control theory, the pTIF values are a set of multivariate metrics constructed according to the needed energy required to either stop the patient's pathologic progression or revert its condition to a healthy state. Thus, the pTIF provides a quantitative reflection of the pattern of biological factor-specific deformations required to control the disease evolution in individual patients. It is inferred from individual multimodal longitudinal imaging data (e.g. PET, MRI), characterizing each patient's multifactorial causal interactions and dynamic brain changes in response to potential external (therapeutic) inputs. When applied to an aging and neurodegenerative population (total N \u00bc 331), the pTIF patterns significantly predict the individual variability in plasma gene expression (GE) profiles and represent a significantly more accurate GE predictor than the traditional clinical/ cognitive categories. The pTIF allowed a reliable identification of subgroups of patients with distinctive molecular and macroscopic alterations, allowing to characterize the molecular dysregulations associated to differences in therapeutic needs in a given population. The existence of differential expression in functional molecular pathways among these pTIF-based subgroups indicates the potential of this approach for the detection and characterization of dissimilar disease variants and/or pathologic stages. We further discuss practical implications for the treatment of neurodegeneration. As a multimodal imaging-based approach to PM, the pTIF framework presented here may represent a turning point in the data-driven identification of personalized intervention needs, optimal therapeutic strategies and selective enrollment of patients in clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, US 21CFR Part 50 -Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56 -Institutional Review Boards, and pursuant to state and federal HIPAA regulations (adni.loni.usc.edu).

This study used in total 1006 individual data, with multimodal brain imaging (N \u00bc 944) and/or blood GE expression data (N \u00bc 744), from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (adni.loni.usc.edu). The pTIF were estimated and analyzed for 331 participants, with at least four different imaging modalities and four longitudinal data acquisitions, surviving the quality control. A subset of 256 participants with pTIF estimations presented GE from blood samples, and were employed in the differential GE analysis. We also used GE data from 74 additional patients without symptoms of cognitive/clinical deterioration, taken as a reference group for the differential analysis. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nSee Fig. S1 for a detailed flowchart of the participant's selection and analysis, and Table S1 for the corresponding demographic characteristics.\nCognitive and clinical evaluations. The participants were characterized cognitively using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a composite score of executive function (EF), a composite score of memory integrity (MEM) (Gibbons et al., 2012) , and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscales 11 and 13 (ADAS-11 and ADAS-13, respectively). Also, they were clinically diagnosed at baseline as healthy control (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) or probable Alzheimer's disease patient (LOAD).\nBlood RNA acquisition/preprocessing. The Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array (www.affymetrix.com) was used for gene expression profiling from blood samples. Peripheral blood samples were collected using PAXgene tubes for RNA analysis. Total RNA with miRNA retention was extracted using the Qiagen PAXgene Blood RNA MDx Kit (www.qiagen.com) on BioRobot Universal System, with the modifications of manufacturer protocol followed by in-solution Dnase treatment and modified clean up step using Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit. See (Saykin et al., 2015) for further preprocessing details. The quality-controlled GE data includes activity levels for 49,293 transcripts. Each gene's activity was adjusted for RNA Integrity Number and Plate Number using a robust linear model (Street et al., 1988 (Klein and Tourville, 2012) . The diffusion weighted MRI data was employed for whole brain region-region structural connectivity (connectome) mapping.\nStructural MRI. Brain structural T1-weighted 3D images were acquired for all subjects (N \u00bc 944). For a detailed description of acquisition details, see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mriprotocols/. All images underwent non-uniformity correction using the N3 algorithm (Sled et al., 1998) . Next, they were segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) probabilistic maps, using SPM12 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Grey matter segmentations were standardized to MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) using the DARTEL tool (Ashburner, 2007) . Each map was modulated in order to preserve the total amount of signal/tissue. Mean grey matter density and determinant of the Jacobian (DJ) (Ashburner, 2007) values were calculated for 78 regions covering all the brain's grey matter (Klein and Tourville, 2012) . All the results/figures presented in this study correspond to the grey matter density.\nFluorodeoxyglucose PET. A 185 MBq (5 \u00fe 0.5 mCi) of [18F]-FDG was administered to each participant and brain PET imaging data were acquired approximately 20 min post-injection (N \u00bc 821). All images were corrected using measured attenuation. Also, images were preprocessed according to four main steps (Jagust et al., 2010) : 1) dynamic co-registration (separate frames were co-registered to one another lessening the effects of patient motion), 2) across time averaging, 3) re-sampling and reorientation from native space to a standard voxel image grid space (\"AC-PC\" space), and 4) spatial filtering to produce images of a uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm FWHM. Next, using the registration parameters obtained for the structural T1 image with nearest acquisition date, all FDG-PET images were spatially normalized to the MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) . Regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values for the 78 regions considered (Klein and Tourville, 2012) were calculated using the cerebellum as reference region.\nResting fMRI. Resting-state functional images were obtained using an echo-planar imaging sequence on a 3.0-T Philips MRI scanner (N \u00bc 186). Acquisition parameters were: 140 time points, repetition time (TR) \u00bc 3000 ms, echo time (TE) \u00bc 30 ms, flip angle \u00bc 80 , number of slices \u00bc 48, slice thickness \u00bc 3.3 mm, spatial resolution \u00bc 3 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 3 mm 3 and in plane matrix \u00bc 64 \u00c2 64. Preprocessing steps included: 1) motion correction, 2) slice timing correction, 3) spatial normalization to MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) using the registration parameters obtained for the structural T1 image with the nearest acquisition date, and 4) signal filtering to keep only low frequency fluctuations (0.01-0.08 Hz) (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010) . In order to have regional quantitative indicators of the brain's functional integrity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) (Zou et al., 2008) , regional homogeneity (ReHo) (Zang et al., 2004) , and functional connectivity degree (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010) measures were calculated for each considered brain region. Among these three measurements, fALFF showed the highest sensibility to disease progression (Iturria-Medina et al., 2016) . Consequently, all the analyses and results presented in this study correspond to this measure. ASL. Resting Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) data were acquired using the Siemens product PICORE sequence (N \u00bc 337). Acquisition parameters were: TR/TE \u00bc 3400/12 ms, TI1/TI2 \u00bc 700/1900 ms, FOV \u00bc 256 mm, 24 sequential 4 mm thick slices with a 25% gap between the adjacent slices, partial Fourier factor \u00bc 6/8, bandwidth \u00bc 2368 Hz/ pix, and imaging matrix \u00bc 64 \u00c2 64. For preprocessing details see \"UCSF ASL Perfusion Processing Methods\" in www.adni.loni.usc.edu. In summary, main preprocessing steps included: 1) motion correction, 2) perfusion-weighted images (PWI) computation, 3) intensity scaling, 4) CBF images calculation, 5) spatial normalization to MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) using the registration parameters obtained for the structural T1 image with the nearest acquisition date, and 6) mean CBF calculation for each considered brain region.\nAmyloid-\u00df (A\u00df) PET. A 370 MBq bolus injection of AV-45 was administered to each participant, and 20 min continuous brain PET imaging scans were acquired approximately 50 min post-injection (N \u00bc 912). The images were reconstructed immediately after the 20 min scan, and when motion artifact was detected, another 20 min continuous scan was acquired. For each individual PET acquisition, images were preprocessed according to four main steps (Jagust et al., 2010) : 1) dynamic co-registration (separate frames were co-registered to one another lessening the effects of patient motion), 2) across time averaging, 3) re-sampling and reorientation from native space to a standard voxel image grid space (\"AC-PC\" space), and 4) spatial filtering to produce images of a uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm FWHM. Next, using the registration parameters obtained for the structural T1 image with the nearest acquisition date, all A\u03b2 images were spatially normalized to the MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) . Considering the Cerebellum as an A\u03b2 non-specific binding reference, SUVR values for the 78 grey matter regions considered were calculated.\nTau PET. A 370 MBq/kg bolus injection of tau specific ligand 18 F-AV-1451 ([F-18] T807) was administered to each participant, and 30 min (6 \u00c2 5 min frames) brain PET imaging scans were acquired starting at 75 min post-injection (N \u00bc 200). Images were preprocessed according to four main steps (Jagust et al., 2010) : 1) dynamic co-registration (separate frames were co-registered to one another lessening the effects of patient motion), 2) across time averaging, 3) re-sampling and reorientation from native space to a standard voxel image grid space (\"AC-PC\" space), and 4) spatial filtering to produce images of a uniform isotropic resolution of 8 mm FWHM. Next, using the registration parameters obtained for the structural T1 image with the nearest acquisition date, all tau images were spatially normalized to the MNI space (Evans et al., 1994) . Considering the Cerebellum as a non-specific binding reference, SUVR values for the 78 grey matter regions considered were calculated.\nDiffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) acquisition. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data was acquired (N \u00bc 128). For each diffusion scan, 46 separate images were acquired, with 5 b 0 images (no diffusion sensitization) and 41 diffusion-weighted images (b \u00bc 1000 s/ mm 2 ). Other acquisition parameters were: 256 \u00c2 256 matrix, voxel size: 2.7 \u00c2 2.7 \u00c2 2.7 mm 3 , TR \u00bc 9000 ms, 52 contiguous axial slices, and scan time 9 min. ADNI aligned all raw volumes to the average b0 image, corrected head motion and eddy current distortions.

Direct region-region vascular connectivity measurements, in the range C vasc j\u2192i 2 \u00bd0; 1, were obtained using tree-based ensemble Random Forests (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010) and the preprocessed/regional CBF data of 83 healthy subjects from ADNI (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . This algorithm, known as GENIE3, decomposes the prediction of a direct network between N nodes (e.g. brain regions) into N different hierarchical regression problems, and reduces the number of possible interactions (possible predictors of each node) based on an automatic feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods. It is a generic algorithm, adaptable to different types of associative data and linear/nonlinear interactions (Huynh-Thu et al., 2010) .\nAnatomical Networks. Probabilistic axonal connectivity values between each brain voxel and the surface of each considered grey matter region (voxel-region connectivity) were estimated using a fully automated fiber tractography algorithm and the intravoxel fiber distributions (ODFs) of 128 healthy subjects from ADNI (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . ODF reconstructions were based on Spherical Deconvolution (Tournier et al., 2008) . A maximum of 500 mm trace length and a curvature threshold of AE90 0 were imposed as tracking parameters. Based on the resulting voxel-region connectivity maps, the individual region-region anatomical connection density matrices were calculated. For any subject and pair of regions i and j, the ACD i,j measure (0 ACD i;j 1, ACD ij ACD ji ) reflects the fraction of the region's surface involved in the axonal connection with respect to the total surface of both regions. Modeling brain multifactorial causal interactions, pathologic spreading effects, and response to external inputs.\nThe MCM approach (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) considers the brain as a dynamic multifactorial causal system, where: i) each system node (or variable) models a relevant biological factor at a given brain region, and ii) alterations in each biological factor are caused by direct factor-factor interactions and/or external inputs. For example, in the context of our aging and neurodegeneration study, we consider N factors \u00bc 6 different biological factors (i.e. vascular flow, A\u03b2 deposition, tau deposition, glucose metabolism, functional activity at rest, and grey matter density), each measured at N rois \u00bc 78 different brain regions of interest (Klein and Tourville, 2012) covering all the brain's grey matter (see Fig. 1 ). Each node, corresponding to a given biological factor m and region i, is characterized by its alteration/disequilibrium level, S m i 2 \u211d, reflecting the dissimilarity/distance to an initial state (S . Also, to model the direct coupling between all factors and brain regions, the system's dynamic is characterized by a dynamic multifactorial direct interaction network (A), where each directed edge corresponds to a factor-factor or a region-region interaction. In summary, at each time point the described brain system is defined by the [N factors N- The dynamic behavior of the proposed brain system will depend on (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a): (i) the local direct interactions among all the biological factors, constrained within each brain region, (ii) the potential propagation of factors-specific alterations through \"physical\" networks (i.e. anatomical and/or vascular networks), and (iii) the influence of external inputs. These processes can be described by the differential equation model:\nwhere A\u00f0t\u00de, the dynamic multifactorial direct interaction network, is a [N factors N rois xN factors N rois ] asymmetric matrix characterizing all the multifactorial interactions at time t. It depends on model parameters that are estimated during model fitting, and on the brain's connection properties, estimated a priori. B is an [N factors N rois xM] input matrix (M N factors N rois ) that identifies M nodes (brain regions of any specific biological factor or factors) controlled by an outside controller (Kalman, 1963; Liu et al., 2011) . u\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u00bdu 1 \u00f0t\u00de\u2026 u M \u00f0t\u00de is the associated time-dependent input signal. Cog is a cognitive variable of interest modeled by additive linear relationships, considering the brain's multifactorial alterations as modulators (with weights defined by the vector \u03b2, estimated a priori at the population level). For a full control intervention (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a), the optimum input signal can be estimated as (Klickstein et al., 2016) :\nwhere W is the controllability gramian matrix (Kailah, 1980 \nIndividual MCM evaluation and pTIF estimation Data preprocessing for MCM. All subjects with at least four imaging modalities (N \u00bc 944) were included in the initial analysis. First, for each imaging modality, a multivariate outlier identification was performed based on the Mahalanobis distance, with a significative squared distance (P < 0.05) meaning an outlier (see Iturria-Medina et al., 2016) . Next, for each remaining subject (N \u00bc 744), missing imaging modalities at each time point with actual individual data (i.e. at least one imaging modality surviving the outlier detection) were automatically imputed using the trimmed scores regression with internal PCA algorithm (Folch-Fortuny et al., 2016) , implemented in the Missing Data Imputation Toolbox for MATLAB (Folch-Fortuny et al., 2016) . The accuracy of the imputation was validated using a leave-one-out cross-validation (we observed, for instance, that tau imaging data can be significantly recuperated for each subject with actual data, P < 10"}, {"section_title": "\u00c06", "text": "). Then, in order to characterize/capture dynamic changes at the individual level, only subjects with at least 4 original imaging time points (N \u00bc 368) were kept for the subsequent analysis. In average, the selected subjects have 4.23 longitudinal time points, covering 4.13 years. See Fig. S1 for a detailed flowchart, and Table S1 for demographic characteristics.\nModel evaluation. First, we used each participant's multimodal and longitudinal data to identify the MCM's fundamental equation (1), in the absence of external signals (i.e. u\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0). For each participant, we used the following optimization function:\nwhere N t is the number of available longitudinal time points for the participant, S m i \u00f0t k \u00de is the observed alteration level for factor m and brain region i, at the time point t k , and b S m i \u00f0t k ; \u2205\u00de is the corresponding estimated value for the set of model parameters \u2205. For further evaluation/optimization details, see (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) and Code availability subsection. The MCM optimization converged successfully for 331 subjects (89.9%).\nEvaluating possible therapeutic impacts. Next, in order to evaluate at the individual level the effectiveness of all possible one-target or combinatorial therapies, for each biological factor or combination of factors, we used expressions (2-4) to estimate the optimum input signal and associated cost-energy for stopping each patient its brain deterioration (i.e. keeping the patient's brain properties at a stationary state) and also for conducing each patient from its current state to a typically healthy state (i.e. the mean pattern observed for HC subjects). For a single-target intervention (i.e. based on a unique driving biological factor) the input matrix B (Equation (1)) was constructed with one for all the nodes/regions corresponding to this factor, and zero for all the other nodes/regions. Similarly, for a combinatorial-target intervention, the matrix B contains one for all the nodes/regions associated with the selected driving factors and zero for the rest (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) .\npTIF definition. For each participant, we defined the individual pTIF as the vector of all estimated factors-specific cost-energy values (i.e. with a unique energy/deformation value for each hypothetical single-target or Fig. 1 . Multifactorial Therapeutic Intervention Fingerprint approach. A) Images are acquired using multiple imaging modalities at different time-points. In this study, at least four different imaging modalities and four longitudinal evaluations were considered. B) For each patient, the MCM approach allows characterization of the intra-brain direct factor-factor biological interactions and the multifactorial spreading mechanisms through vascular/anatomical networks. Next, inverting the model's fundamental equation allows estimation of the input signals, and associated cost-energy/deformation values required to produce a desired (e.g. healthy) state in the system through targeting individual biological factors or relevant combinations. Thus, the pTIF is defined as the set of cost-energy/deformation values obtained for each patient, which are inversely proportional to the effectiveness of each intervention. C) Dissimilar pTIF patterns for three different participants in the same population. Note that Patient 1 requires lower cost-energy values for vascular and metabolic interventions, and Patient 2 requires lower cost-energy values for anti-A\u00df and anti-tau interventions, suggesting the identity of specific single-target therapies that may benefit the patient (e.g. physical exercise and aducanumab, respectively). However, Patient 3 requires high cost-energy for all the single-target interventions considered, suggesting that combinatorial (and not single-target) treatments will be most beneficial in this case (see Discussion for further interpretation). combinatorial intervention). Mathematically, the pTIF corresponds to a numeric multivariate vector with dimensionality determined by all possible tested interventions. Notice that, for N factors \u00bc 6, the number of all possible single-target or combinatorial interventions (up to a maximum of 6 factors) is 63. Because we estimated the optimum input signal for both stopping each patient's brain deterioration and, alternatively, for conducing it from its current state to a typically healthy state, we obtained a total of 126 (i.e. 2 times 63) cost-energy values, which finally defined the individual pTIF vector."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "In order to deal with the high-dimensionality of the GE data (i.e. 49,293 transcripts), we applied two different nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e. Kernel PCA and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) ) before the subsequent analysis. The reduced GE spaces consisted of 69 orthonormal components capturing the most relevant/consistent properties across all the genes. Then, we tested the level of association between the pTIF patterns and the GE components (or between cognitive/clinical measurements and GE), by means of a partial canonical correlation analysis (Mori et al., 2017) Next, the patients were classified according to their most optimum single-target intervention for stopping the neurodegenerative progression (i.e. for each patient, finding the factor-specific intervention with less cost-energy/deformation level). This resulted in six different singletarget intervention-specific subgroups (i.e. one subgroup for each imaging-based biological factor considered). Finally, for each of these subgroups, we performed a gene differential analysis (comparing with an external \"pathology-free\" population, N \u00bc 74). For this purpose, we tested each gene's activity via a t-test and, finally, controlled for multiple comparisons across all the subgroups and genes via FDR (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001 ).

The GE data contains information for 49,293 transcripts (Materials and Methods, Blood RNA acquisition/preprocessing). The six biological factors in the brain were mapped in vivo using state-ofthe-art neuroimaging techniques ( Fig. 1A ; Materials and Methods, Multimodal Imaging biomarkers). See Table S1 for demographic characteristics, and Fig. S1 for a detailed flowchart of the selection and analysis of the participants.\nWe proceeded to characterize the multifactorial brain dynamics of each participant with quality-controlled multimodal longitudinal imaging data ( Fig. 1B ; Materials and Methods). Specifically, we aimed to characterize the individual direct factor-factor interactions and concurrent spreading of abnormal/pathological effects through anatomical and vascular networks (Fig. 1B) , for all participants with data for at least four different imaging modalities and four longitudinal imaging evaluations (N \u00bc 368, Fig. S1 ). For this, we used the previously validated multifactorial causal model (MCM) (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a), which offers an integrative quantitative analysis of the brain's multifactorial interactions, region-region spreading effects, and potential changes in response to external inputs (see 1B; Materials and Methods). The optimization algorithm converged satisfactorily for 331 patients (89.9% of the sample; Table S1 ). Consequently, for each of these participants, we obtained a six-by-six direct factor-factor interaction network, and identified quantitative indexes characterizing the intra-brain factors spreading (e.g. reflecting the individual tendencies of A\u03b2 and functional dysregulation to propagate). Next, we interrogated the MCM approach (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) to identify the optimum therapeutic intervention signals required to restore a clinically stable state or a clinically normal state in each brain (Materials and Methods). It should be noted that, in pathophysiologic terms, these states are equivalent to halting or reversing of the neurodegeneration progression, respectively. With the aim of reproducing a realistic therapeutic scenario, we considered both single-target and combinatorial interventions, equivalent to targeting only one biological factor or multiple biological factors simultaneously (up to a maximum of six), respectively. Each resulting hypothetical intervention signal was then characterized according to its biological cost-energy, reflecting the factor-specific amount of deformation associated with the intervention. In practical terms, the amount of deformation required for a given therapeutic intervention is directly proportional to the difficulty associated with its implementation. Indeed, high levels of deformation would need the input of therapeutic signals with substantial biological impacts, which will be difficult to achieve and imply a high risk of undesired secondary effects. Fig. 1C shows the factor-specific cost-energy/deformation levels obtained for three participants, considering only single-target interventions for visualization clarity. Note that the vectors of factor-specific deformations reflect diverse individual therapeutic requirements, which depend on each patient's levels of multifactorial biological alterations and intra-brain causal and spreading mechanisms. The first patient would benefit more from either a vascular or a metabolic based intervention (e.g. using physical exercise or ketogenic-diet therapies). In contrast, for the second patient, reduction in the intra-brain A\u03b2 levels would be more effective (e.g. using aducanumab (Sevigny et al., 2016) ). The third patient, however, presented high deformation levels for all the biological factors analyzed, suggesting the need for combinatorial rather than single-factor interventions. Due to its relevance in identifying effective personalized interventions, we defined this vector of factor-specific cost-energies/deformations as the pTIF (see Materials and Methods, Individual MCM evaluation and pTIF estimation subsubsection)."}, {"section_title": "pTIF Vastly Outperforms Cognitive and Clinical Evaluations on Predicting Individual Molecular Profiles", "text": "A crucial obstacle towards therapeutic advancement has been the challenge of understanding the key molecular mechanisms associated to brain deterioration (Brichta et al., 2015) .

Here, we aimed to explore the identified pTIF's practical applicability, under the assumption that, if the predicted therapeutic needs are accurately reflective of individual pathological conditions, then the individual molecular properties should be significantly explained by the obtained pTIF patterns. With this aim, we proceeded to explore the association between the individual plasma GE properties and the predicted therapeutic needs. To deal with the high-dimensionality of the GE data we applied two different nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (Materials and Methods section, Statistical Analysis), obtaining 69 orthonormal components capturing the most relevant/consistent properties across all the genes. This not only simplified the handling of numerous variables but also improved the performance of the downstream statistical analysis (Wang and van der Laan, 2011) . Importantly, we verified that the results of the subsequent analysis were robust in Y. Iturria-Medina et al. NeuroImage 179 (2018) 40-50 terms of the choice of different dimensionality reduction techniques. Next, we focused on the subsample of 256 subjects with both GE data and pTIF estimations ( Fig. S1 and Table S1 ). We performed a partial canonical correlation analysis (Mori et al., 2017) between the pTIF values and the obtained GE components, controlling by age, gender, educational level as well as for the clinical and cognitive evaluations (i.e. clinical diagnosis, EF, MEM, ADAS-11, and ADAS-13). Additionally, to evaluate how informative are the estimated pTIF in comparison with the clinical and cognitive evaluations, we repeated the partial canonical correlation but now with the clinical and cognitive variables as predictors of the GE components, and controlling by the demographic variables (age, gender, educational level) and the pTIF values. The results ( Fig. 2A) , show a clear outperformance of the pTIF patterns over the clinical/cognitive evaluations on the prediction of the GE data. Notice, for example, that while in average the pTIF can explain around a 30% of all the GE data's variance ( Fig. 2A and B) , in average the clinical/cognitive evaluations can only account for around a 0.44%. This result strongly suggests that the resulting pTIF estimations are significantly more informative than the traditional clinical/cognitive categories for the detection of pathologic molecular states. Finally, we calculated the cross-correlation between the pTIF patterns and the GE components. We observed (Fig. 2C ) that a small set of pTIF elements does not dominate the predicted power of the pTIF. By the contrary, most of the evaluated interventions present a clear correlation with multiple GE components."}, {"section_title": "Uncovering the Molecular Basis Underlying Differences in therapeutic needs", "text": "After confirming that the pTIF patterns are significantly associated with the individual GE levels, we aimed to identify the specific genes and molecular pathways responsible for the differences in therapeutic needs in the studied population. First, we stratified the patients according to their most optimum single-target intervention for stopping the neurodegenerative progression (i.e. finding the factor-specific intervention with less cost-energy/deformation level). Because we are analyzing six different imaging-based biological factors, we obtained an equal number of subgroups (Fig. 3A) . We then proceeded to perform a differential gene expression analysis, comparing each intervention-specific subgroup with an external reference group (N \u00bc 74) defined as clinically normal participants without symptoms of clinical/cognitive deterioration and obtained from the ADNI database (see Materials and Methods, Statistical Analyses, and Table S1 ). Based on the obtained gene-specific differential T values for each subgroup, we identified significantly differentially expressed genes (q < 0.01, FDR corrected) and performed a large-scale gene functional analysis with the Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) classification system (Mi et al., 2013) .\nWe found (see Table S2 ) that approximately 30% of all the patients would gain primary benefit from promoting increased grey matter density (e.g. increasing neurogenesis), followed by glucose metabolism (22%), anti-A\u00df (22%), anti-tau (11%), functional (9%) and vascular (6%) focused treatments (for further interpretation, see Discussion, pTIF for assisting medical interventions and clinical trials). Interestingly, these groups were not distinctive in demographic or clinical/cognitive properties (see Table S2 for details). We attribute this result to the fact that patients with similar cognitive/clinical manifestations could have different therapeutic needs. This result supports the imprecision of the generalized medicine practice, where patient treatments are often selected according to individual clinical and cognitive evaluations.\nAcross all the intervention-specific subgroups, we found 1101 significantly differentially expressed genes associated with 103 functional pathways (Fig. 3, Table S3 ). Each subgroup was characterized by a distinctive set of altered genes and functional pathways, which consequently suggested the underlying influence of distinctive molecular causal mechanisms and the cross-population presence of dissimilar neurodegenerative variants and/or pathological stages. Interestingly, we observed that a subset (approximately 31%) of the identified molecular pathways was highly prevalent (!50%) across all the interventionspecific subgroups. These pathways were highly sensitive for the detection of pathological processes that are commonly associated with aging and cognitive deterioration mechanisms, such as inflammation, blood vessels formation, regulation of growth and survival of different cell types, signal transduction pathways, programmed cell death, and adaptative immune response (corresponding to identified molecular pathways: inflammation by chemokine and cytokine, angiogenesis, PDGF signaling, Wnt signaling, apoptosis, and B cell activation, respectively; see Fig. 3 and Table S3 ). Otherwise, we found that most molecular pathways (around 41%) were affected only in intervention-specific subgroups ( Fig. 3 and Table S3 ).\nInterestingly, notice that patients needing a grey matter density intervention as the primary target have a high number of altered molecular pathways, while patients primarily needing vascular or anti-A\u00df focused interventions have a small number of altered pathways. This finding may be reflective of the characteristic ordering on Fig. 3 . Altered molecular pathways underlying distinctive single-target therapeutic needs. The pathways were sorted according to their prevalence levels across all the single-target specific subgroups, starting at 12 o'clock and following a counter-clockwise direction (see Table S3 ). Each link between a given pair of pathways corresponds to the percentage of subgroups for which both molecular pathways were found to be affected. Note that altered pathways with high prevalence levels, and high concurrent pathway-pathway prevalence (i.e. the most interconnected pathways), are those more sensitive to common pathological processes in the population. In contrast, pathways with low prevalence levels, and low concurrent pathway-pathway prevalence, are more specific to the distinctive therapeutic requirements, thus being more informative regarding the potential molecular mechanisms that should be targeted in specific individual cases. pathophysiological events associated to neurodegenerative progression. Vascular dysregulation and high A\u03b2 presence are thought to be early pathologic factors (Iturria-Medina et al., 2016; Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a; , when the patient's molecular integrity damage is still at an early stage. By the contrary, structural atrophy is considered to be the result of prolonged disease processes, and, consequently, when a vast number of molecular functions are affected. Our results suggest that the more the neurodegenerative progression advance, the more the treatments should focus on restoring the brain's neuronal/glial structure. In other words, at early disease stages, vascular and anti-A\u00df interventions may be sufficient to control the brain's deterioration, however, at advanced disease states, these interventions may be inefficient, being a structural brain restoration the most needed alternative. See also Discussion, pTIF for assisting medical interventions and clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Here, we present a data-driven strategy for identifying personalized therapeutic requirements in heterogeneous populations. The results obtained in an aging and neurodegenerative population demonstrate that the pTIF concept introduced here is a valid tool for patient stratification and identification of molecular and cognitive profiles that are statistically associated with the patient's predicted therapeutic needs. Our study also highlights the inaccuracy of the traditional clinical diagnosis for understanding individual molecular alterations and corresponding therapeutic requirements. The pTIF tool has broad implications for both the future identification of effective individualized treatments and the selective enrollment of patients in clinical trials (i.e. including patients with a known capacity for responding to the specific therapy under study/ evaluation). Both potential applications may lead to (i) more effective medical care (assisted by individual multimodal/multiscale data and sophisticated models), (ii) decreased undesired secondary effects, and (iii) substantial reduction of pharmaceutical/clinical costs, accelerating the creation-evaluation cycle of new therapeutic agents."}, {"section_title": "A novel in silico technique for evaluating different therapeutic strategies", "text": "Historically, the lack of understanding about how our brain works from an integrative multifactorial/multilevel perspective has limited our capacity to predict how it will react to different therapeutic scenarios. This absence of multifactorial in silico models hinders the evaluation of potential disease-modifying agents considerably. Despite intense efforts, the pharmaceutical industry and its academic collaborators can only focus on an insufficient number of clinical trials, which is far from sufficient to cover the vast multiplicity of potential therapeutic interventions that could lead to effective individualized treatments. The principles of the control theory (Kalman, 1963; Klickstein et al., 2016) , robustly employed in multiple engineering applications, allow prediction of the dynamic response of the brain in vivo under the influence of potential external interventions (Betzel et al., 2016; Muldoon et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Tang and Bassett, 2017; Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) . Recent experimental evidence supports the validity of the control approach for predicting the causal effects of input signals on living neuronal systems (Yan et al., 2017) . In 2017, Yan et al. accurately predicted the control involvement of each Caenorhabditis elegans neuron in locomotor behavior. Their results not only showed a high correlation between laser ablation interventions and the theoretically predicted effects but also supported the applicability of the analytical control framework to larger and less well-characterized connectomes. Using network control theory to offer a robust mechanistic explanation of how the brain moves between cognitive states on the basis of white matter microstructure, Gu and colleagues (Gu et al., 2015) showed that structural network differences between cognitive circuits dictate their distinct roles in controlling trajectories of brain network function. Recently, this group also reviewed (Tang and Bassett, 2017 ) the large body of evidence supporting the use of control theory for understanding general neurophysiological processes (e.g. brain development and cognitive function), as well as for modulation of altered neurophysiological processes in medical contexts (e.g. anesthesia administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease). Besides, we demonstrated that it is possible to predict past, intermediary and future individual brain states using longitudinal data and a multifactorial dynamic causal framework (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) ."}, {"section_title": "pTIF for assisting medical interventions and clinical trials: practical considerations", "text": "In the present study, we extended those frameworks for predicting the effectiveness of multiple factors-specific interventions in each patient, and organized this information to define, for the first time to our knowledge, individual therapeutic \"fingerprints\". The pTIF predicts the responses of patients to external interventions (e.g. therapeutic drugs, physical exercise, and environmental influence). When used for patient stratification in an aging and neurodegenerative population, we confirmed that the pTIF contains intrinsically valuable molecular information, which supports its validity for discovering distinctive disease variants and/or stages in heterogeneous populations. The control costenergy used in the pTIF definition, is a theoretical measure of biological deformation, reflecting how much the system must be altered to reach a desired final state (see Materials and Methods). The more a biological distortion requires a therapeutic intervention to stop the system's deterioration or to restore the normal state, the less efficient this intervention will be (Muldoon et al., 2016; Tang and Bassett, 2017; Iturria--Medina et al., 2017a) .\nIn practical terms, targeting biological factors, brain regions/connections and/or molecular pathways other than those suggested by the pTIF, may result in undesired secondary effects, larger clinical care needs, and consequently increased economic costs. However, consideration of the information contained in the pTIF in combination with the practical clinical feasibility associated with each possible treatment is of critical importance. For instance, when we analyzed the effects of singletarget interventions in the studied population, our results suggest that approximately 30% of all the patients would gain primary benefit from promoting increased grey matter density. Nevertheless, despite the evidence suggesting that some drugs, diets and lifestyle conditions may help to promote neurogenesis (Malberg et al., 2000; Taupin, 2008; Stangl and Thuret, 2009; Richetin et al., 2015) , there is not yet an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling brain neurogenesis across the whole brain. This implies that the second most effective interventions detected for these patients should form the focus in determining the patient treatment plan. Thus, when selecting an intervention for a given patient, the pTIF, and other recently proposed control-based models (Muldoon et al., 2016; Tang and Bassett, 2017) , should not be employed to dictate which treatment/signal to apply. Instead, it should be used to reach a trade-off among data-driven predictions and clinically relevant aspects (Iturria--Medina et al., 2017a) .\nBesides, and importantly, notice that the number/percent of patients needing specific primary targets in a given population should not be used to make causal interpretations about the pathologic causes of a given disorder. This is a common misconception in the clinical and pharmacologic practices. For example, although according to our predictions (Table S2 ) a 22% of the study population would gain primary benefit from promoting glucose metabolism or decreasing brain A\u03b2 levels, it should not be assumed that a metabolic dysregulation or an increased A\u03b2 presence are more probable disease triggering events than a functional or a vascular dysregulation. During a patient's large evolution towards neurodegeneration, which can take decades, the primary therapeutic target can change, accordingly with the disease stage and the corresponding integrity of the different intra-brain systems. A result supporting this premise is that patients needing a vascular or an anti-A\u00df intervention had a considerably smaller number of altered molecular pathways than those primarily needing grey matter or metabolic focused interventions (Fig. 3) . This suggests that the former patients could be at an early disease stage, while the latter (with a high number of altered molecular pathways) could be at more advanced neurodegenerative stages. In line with this, for a patient at early pathological stages, vascular and anti-A\u00df interventions may be sufficient to control its brain deterioration, however, if the patient is at advance neurodegenerative stages, these interventions may be inefficient, being a metabolic and/or a structural brain restoration the most promising alternatives.\nThe pTIF can represent a turning point in the current way that patients are involved in clinical trials, allowing a selective enrollment. Usually, subpopulations included in clinical trials can be highly heterogeneous regarding disease variants and stages, genetic and phenotypic characteristics. This implies that even if a treatment under study works well for a fraction of the patients, crucial positive effects can pass unnoticed because the final averaging across the whole subpopulation. Before a clinical trial, the pTIF can be employed for identifying those patients with a known capacity for responding to the specific treatment under study/evaluation. For those clinical trials already concluded, it also can be employed retrospectively. In such case, the pTIF can be a useful tool for understanding the trial's final results, decomposing the average results previously observed and helping to identify precisely which patients had an initial predisposition to respond to the treatment. Thus, allowing to explain the treatment's observed effects concerning subpopulation characteristics, and consequently avoiding the traditional \"black or white\" conclusions. New clinical trials/interventions can use then this information for refining their previous results."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future work", "text": "Several challenges to the use of the pTIF in PM remain. Here, we used six different imaging modalities and multiple longitudinal acquisitions for characterizing each patient's brain from a comprehensive (multifactorial) dynamic perspective. The inclusion of other possible sources of information (e.g. electrophysiological signal properties, peripheral protein concentrations, extra-brain space integrity, neuroinflammation, and cognitive evaluations) would contribute considerably to obtaining a more detailed characterization of the underlying pathologic mechanisms and, consequently, a more accurate interpretation of the pTIF (covering as many biological descriptors as possible). The additional information can be inserted directly into the flexible formulation of the MCM (Iturria-Medina et al., 2017a) to generate a more detailed spatiotemporal representation and understanding of the brain's complex multifactorial nature. The ultimate validity of the pTIF concept can only be sufficiently demonstrated after applying it to diseased populations under different potential treatments. Our future work will focus on this. In parallel to the pTIF definition, in this article we aimed to construct the fundamental rationale for motivating the future application of the pTIF concept on therapeutic studies. Besides, the pTIF concept introduced here represents a \"top-down\" approach to PM (i.e. using macroscopic multimodal imaging data to identify distinctive pathologic molecular stages). However, our future work will also focus on combining multiscale levels of individual information, using bottom-up (microscopic to macroscopic) as well as top-down models to pursue the precise identification of individual therapeutic requirements from multiple standpoints."}, {"section_title": "Code availability", "text": "We anticipate that the MCM and pTIF codes will be released soon as part of an open-access software (for more information, please contact the corresponding author)."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "All data used in this study is available at the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu)."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "ADNI acquired the data.
