Several recent studies highlight the significance of contextual [4] [5] [6] and social 7, 8 influences on weight-related behaviors. For example, children who attend schools of higher socioeconomic status (SES) have greater access to healthier lunches [9] [10] [11] [12] , more extensive physical education programs 13 , and limited access to energy-dense foods and sugar-sweetened beverages 14 . And, administrators in higher SES schools generally adhere to healthier school food practices such as providing nutrition education and limiting the availability of competitive snacks and beverages 15 .\nRelative to children who attend less affluent schools, children in advantaged institutions are also likely to be positively, rather than negatively, influenced by school sociodemographic composition (eg, body size social norms 8, [16] [17] [18] and health-related behaviors transmitted through social ties 7, 19, 20 ) . Similar patterns are observed in predominantly African American, compared to predominantly non-Latino white, schools 3 . And, concentrated school poverty is linked to overweight in adolescents. For example, Martin and colleagues (2012) found that as school poverty increases, the protective effect of parental education on adolescents' risk of being overweight is significantly reduced 6 . Moreover, solid theoretical evidence links the social environment to several child outcomes [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .\nDespite the known association between the school environment and obesity in children, existing studies generally use school-level proxy measures such as number of lunches eaten at school or school poverty concentration as indicators of the obesogenic environment within a particular school, without considering the school-level body mass index (BMI) context itself as a relevant factor that influences weight-related outcomes. The current study substantially adds to the literature by uncovering whether the school BMI context is another identifiable risk factor associated with child obesity. To do this, I isolate the impact of the BMI context on children's weight trajectories net of relevant child-, family-, and school-level factors to determine whether schools mean BMI affects a child's weight as they age from Kindergarten to 5th grade. I also investigate whether sociodemographic differences in diverse school BMI environments influence children's weight trajectories."}, {"section_title": "Influences on Child Weight", "text": "Social scientists have long described the connection between social conditions and child health outcomes [26] [27] [28] . More recently, we are beginning to better understand the links between specific social contexts and school-aged children's weight status 2, 3, 6, 29 . For example, it has been shown that children who attend schools characterized by disadvantage are subject to underresourced school meal 30 and activity 2 programs, which increases their risk of overweight and obesity. Moreover, children who attend schools in low income areas are more likely to develop negative weight-related norms and behaviors transmitted through social ties 7, 19, 20 .\nThese (and other) data imply that child sociodemographic characteristics underlie several factors that influence overweight and obesity. For example, a lack of nutritious food and sufficient play space may strengthen the effect of other school-related risks, such as underfunded physical education programs. And given that children in disadvantaged contexts are disproportionately racial/ ethnic minorities, it is not surprising that relative to their non-Latino white counterparts, children of color are at greater risk of obesity [31] [32] [33] [34] . The implication of this is that children's social environmental conditions affect overweight and obesity through mechanisms rooted within structural processes of racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic stratification (eg, culturally specific feeding practices and availability of nutritious, affordable food). Two complementary mechanisms have been identified to understand the ways through which this occurs: (1) differential access to resources; and (2) proximal influences within ones social context.\nTo demonstrate the first point, it has been shown that differences in economic resources among children can lead to a concentration of racially, culturally, and economically homogenous groups of students within schools, which may explain, in part, why differences in obesity exist by school type 2,3,6 . For example, children attending schools in disadvantaged areas are more likely to endure greater lifetime chronic stress exposure, which increases the risk of overweight and obesity 35 . One chronic stressor is characterized by the concept of concentrated disadvantage, which encompasses community-level deprivation including high rates of poverty, substandard schooling, and high crime rates, to name a few. Concentrated disadvantage also reduces feelings of collective efficacy or social cohesion, which is known to have a protective effect on overweight and obesity through the promotion of health-related behaviors 36 . Area deprivation is also highly segregated. This segregation tends to create concentrated areas of impoverished racial/ ethnic minority children in under-resourced schools, which impacts access to appropriate preventative measures 36 such as nutrition and physical education among children who are already at higher risk of overweight and obesity.\nRegarding the second point on social context, because children within a school tend to share specific social characteristics such as parent income-level and educational attainment 25 this in turn may influence overweight and obesity through the production of spatial disparities in obesity prevalence. The internalization of norms and attitudes present within the school context might then serve to inhibit or increase obesity risk. For example, the concentration of children within a school who are overweight or obese may lead to an overarching normative acceptance of increased weight as collective attitudes toward obesity are focused more on living with it than on preventing it. In other contexts, obesity prevalence may serve to increase awareness and encourage preventative measures.\nIt is likely that a symbiotic relationship between these distal and proximal factors interdependently influence obesity outcomes. Certainly, children's daily exposure to multiple activity spaces (eg, home, extracurricular activities, and after-school programs) coupled with interaction with a culturally diverse set of classmates may uniquely contribute to obesity risk [37] [38] [39] .\nHowever, in the present analysis I focus only on the child-and school-level effects. Nonetheless, addressing how the school BMI environment influences children's weight status over time uncovers a critical omission in the literature and provides a substantial jumping off point for future researchers interested in other contexts, such as neighborhood-level investigations."}, {"section_title": "School Environmental Influences on Child Weight", "text": "Children's weight trajectories encompass not only family involvement and relevant biological constraints such as genetic predisposition, but also causally distal influences within one's social context including school poverty concentration or school cultural norms. Accordingly, behaviors are driven, in part, by broad contextual factors typically outside of children's immediate control (eg, school-level racial/ ethnic composition) that inform children's health-related behaviors including dietary practices, and ultimately, contribute to the consequences of those behaviors (eg, obesity [40] [41] [42] ). The internalization of these context-specific social norms motivates certain modes of thinking and behaving 43 that in turn may influence weight-related behaviors such as negative weight evaluations from classmates that may lead to distorted weight perceptions, and may thus motivate changes in dietary practices. Given this, I aim to separate school effects from family effects and quantify the extent to which an observed difference in obesity is a consequence of the school BMI environment (ie, do children weigh more (or less) because of the school they attend).\nThe current study is the first to investigate the aggregated school BMI context as a potential contributor to child obesity risk. The concept of the aggregated school BMI context represents the overall school-level BMI environment that is a consequence of weight-related attitudes and behaviors for children in that particular school (ie, lower versus higher overall BMI). A better understanding of shared environmental factors that influence weight-related outcomes in children is important in order to implement more effective intervention programs that combat child obesity."}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Child Obesity", "text": "I control for a variety of factors known to be associated with child obesity.

For example, Long et al.\n(2011) found that advancing age is the single largest predictor of obesity in children 48 .\nFurthermore, girls (compared to boys) are at increased obesity risk [49] [50] [51] , with the highest occurrence among African American girls 52 . And, race/ ethnicity is a highly influential factor in child and adolescent obesity, with Hispanic boys at the highest risk 53 ."}, {"section_title": "Family-level Factors", "text": "During infancy and early childhood, the family and home environment heavily inform health-related behaviors and shape weight-related outcomes [54] [55] [56] .

It is well documented that children who live in lower socioeconomic conditions have higher rates of obesity (see 52, for review), and Rundle and colleagues (2012) show that the school sociodemographic composition is significantly associated with obesity risk 65 . For example, concentrated school poverty is associated with overweight in adolescents, and, as school poverty increases, the protective effect of parents' education on overweight risk is reduced 6 . Children who participate in food assistance programs at their school 66 and those who consume more meals at school 2 are also at a higher risk of obesity. A wealth of data further indicate that school racial composition influences child obesity risk 3 . Specifically, children who attend schools with a higher concentration of non-white students are at the highest risk 67 .

The models estimate how BMI trajectories for children in diverse school BMI environments change as a function of sex, race, parental education and income, and family structure. With these models, it is possible to determine if there is increased/ decreased disparity in boy-girl, White-African American-Hispanic-Asian-Other race, higher-lower parental education and income levels, and one-two parent family structures resulting from the school-level BMI environment. The estimated coefficients for child and family characteristics in these models reveal the change in BMI z-scores for children who attend schools of varying BMI environments. All models were estimated using sampling weights provided by ECLS-K to adjust for the unequal probabilities of selection for children in the sample. In the following models, time points are nested within children, and children are nested within schools.

Using 5 waves of the ECLS-K data, I employed a series of multilevel growth models with random effects at the time-, child-, and school-level to examine whether attending a school with higher overall BMI influences children's weight status over time. Results show that, net of child, family, and school characteristics, children who attend schools with higher rates of obesity have greater weight compared to children in schools with lower rates of obesity, and this effect increases annually. Results indicate that the spatial clustering of obesity in schools may, in part, be a derivative of area deprivation that concentrates children of disadvantage into particular school catchment areas.\nNotably, I also show that if a child attends a school of higher overall BMI, s/he gains weight at a faster rate compared to a child who attends a school of lower overall BMI.\nJencks and Mayer's seminal review (1990) outline several mechanisms through which this might occur 25 . One underlying mechanism is the social modeling of non-parental role models within children's environment. As it relates to the school context, older classmates or school personnel might set and maintain the standards of \"normal weight\", and act as gatekeepers to \"police\" overweight and obesity. Consequently, children often do not judge their weight by only comparing themselves to their friends or peers. Rather, they compare their body to that of their most admired schoolmates and/ or teachers. If a child's role model is of average weight status, the child may then hold a more positive opinion toward being \"normal weight\". However, children who do not share a similar weight with their classmates may either engage in (eg, engender a desire to participate in more physical activity) or reject (eg, incite increased sedentary behaviors and over consumption) similar dietary and physical activity behaviors. In the latter case, attending a school with higher obesity will not only increase their weight, but may also reduce their effort to lose weight. The relative frequency of \"engage\" and \"reject\" responses is contingent on a number of not-well-understood factors [76] [77] [78] , but is associated with socioeconomic and cultural differences 79, 80 .\nFindings provide evidence that children's weight trajectories are influenced by contextual factors given the faster rate of weight gain when children attend a school of higher overall BMI.\nHowever, only 4% of the observed variance lies between schools. This is likely due to the fact that students within a school are relatively heterogeneous, and that children are likely to align themselves with others of similar interests, sociodemographic background, and weight status regardless of the school they attend. That is, schools with the highest rates of obesity also have students who are in the \"normal weight\" range. Similarly, schools with the lowest obesity rates have overweight and obese students. Consequently, the school BMI composition is only one of the many risk factors that combine with other markers to influence children's obesity risk. Given that the school BMI environment does influence children's weight trajectories between kindergarten and 5 th grade, however, the magnitude of this effect is likely to increase in adolescence when peers begin to assume an increasingly important role in influencing weightrelated behaviors and attitudes 81 . The implication of this trend is significant because it is known that obese children tend to become obese adults [82] [83] [84] . Further, the obesogenic environment within a school may have harmful implications for the community at large, given that obesity has been shown to \"spread\" through social networks 7 . It is also likely, however, that the influence is multidirectional and induction flows from the neighborhood context to the school environment.\nTo the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to use the school BMI Further, children who changed schools were excluded from the analysis in order for the sample to be as homogenous as possible, given that children who transfer schools may differ in key factors related to weight status (eg, children who experience divorce), compared to children who remain in the same school. This methodological limitation may attenuate the findings and reduce generalizability to a portion of elementary school children in the 1998-1999 school years.\nAlso, because an individual child is simultaneously contributing to the school BMI context and is potentially being affected by it, aggregation of school BMI with the inclusion of individual children's BMI in the overall measure may further induce correlation. However, I excluded schools with less than 5 children to minimize potential bias. Indeed, the effect in one direction would need to be much stronger than in the other to cause a problem. As a robustness check, I estimated a single-level interaction regression model that ignored nesting, and I excluded childlevel BMI for each child from the overall school average BMI, to provide evidence that the inclusion of school-level BMI in a multilevel model that predicts children's BMI z-scores induces correlation but does not have a meaningful influence on findings. Finally, models are based on school BMI environment at later time points, kindergarten -5 th grade, which potentially affects children's BMI at earlier time points. As a final robustness check, I classified schools into tertiles based on BMI environment at baseline to examine whether results changed in a meaningful way, either statistically or substantively. Findings were similar when I used either baseline BMI environment or all-waves-combined BMI environment."}, {"section_title": "IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH", "text": "Here, I show that changes in children's weight trajectories differ between schools and over time due, in part, to the BMI environment of schools. In light of these findings, schoolbased obesity interventions such as the BMI surveillance programs (see 85 for review) that broadly target an overall student population may prove crucial to decreasing child obesity, given the significant influence of the BMI environment itself on children's weight trajectories. These findings tell us that other school initiatives such as the BMI screening programs intended to reduce obesity at the individual level may not be as effective in curbing child obesity since they generally target individual children. Instead, school-level health interventions should focus efforts on the entire population of children in an individual school."}, {"section_title": "HUMAN SUBJECTS APPROVAL STATEMENT", "text": "Approval is not required because this study is based on secondary data analyses from the publicly accessible data set of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class 1998-1999.
