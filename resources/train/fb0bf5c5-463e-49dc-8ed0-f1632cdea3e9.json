For this purpose, document analysis method was used. The study is limited to 240 mathematics questions included in TEOG exam and TEOG make-up exam applied to 8 th -grade students between 2013 -2016 and 212 items included in TIMSS-2015 8 th grade Math achievement test. The research data were obtained by the researchers and 3 experts based on the TIMSS-2015 cognitive domain coding scheme. The findings of experts are evaluated by taking codes' percentages and frequencies. At the result of the study process; it is illustrated that 42.5% of TEOG and TEOG make-up exam Math questions belongs to \"Knowing\", 45.5% of it belongs to \"Practice\" and 12% of it belongs to \"Reasoning\" cognitive domain steps. Findings shows that 31% of the items in TIMSS 2015 8 th grade Mathematics achievement test are related to Knowing, 45% of it related to Practice and 24% of it related to \"Reasoning\" cognitive domain levels. In the TEOG exams, questions that measure high-level thinking skills are less than in the TIMSS exam. The majority of the TEOG questions (88%) measure low-level skills. Moreover, as a result of testing with chi-square distribution that the cognitive percentages of the TIMSS-2015 Mathematics questions and the TEOG exam Mathematics questions are significantly different. In other words, they do not match with each other cognitively. On the other hand, Mathematics questions in TEOG and TEOG make-up exam matches with each other cognitively."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "International benchmarking efforts based on student evaluations such as TIMMS, PISA, and PIRLS are studies that do not carry the characteristics of a race among countries. They enable the participating countries to evaluate their educational systems and follow the development of their students in the fields of science, mathematics and reading throughout years (MNE, 2005) . In many countries, the academic performance of students is evaluated in terms of the comparison of international competence (\u0130ncikab\u0131, 2012) . One of these international exams is the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).\nTIMMS is a study conducted by IEA -the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement -every four years. In this article, students' knowledge and skills in the fields of mathematics and science are evaluated at the 4th and 8th-grade levels. TIMSS is an exam that first started in 1995, followed by a four-year period -administered in 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2011 and 2015 (Mullis et al., 2009 . It was designed to measure mathematics and science achievement in the international arena of primary school students studying in different countries. Another aim of the TIMSS studies is to collect information about the educational systems of countries and to improve mathematics and science education. To this end, various data are collected from countries and interpreted (EARGED, 2011) .\nTIMSS consists of surveys that collect information about achievement tests in science and mathematics, and educational and social environments that have an impact on student achievement. In TIMSS applications, 14 different booklets are used at each class level. These booklets are issued on behalf of the students and delivered to the schools where the tests will be administered (EARGED, 2011) . As it was stated before, the main aim of TIMMS is to improve Mathematics and Science Education in various countries.\nProfits of the countries participating in the TIMSS studies include having the opportunity to compare their educational systems with other countries and to be able to observe how they have progressed in terms of education over the years (MNE, 2005) . TIMSS also collects data on countries' educational systems, curricula, students, teachers, and school information. Thus, developments in the educational systems of different countries can be followed globally.\nAs for the assessment of students succes in Turkey, two different assessment and evaluation systems are observed in Turkish education system; the first of which is local, and the second one is central (\u00c7epni, \u00d6zsevgen\u00e7 & G\u00f6kdere, 2003) . Local assessment and evaluations are carried out by teachers in order to determine the level of knowledge and skills of students in the classroom. The examinations with broader participation prepared by the Ministry of National Education and applied in all the provinces are within the scope of the central assessment and evaluation. The history of the central examinations in the transition from primary school to secondary school in Turkey is studied, it shows that the High School Placement Examination (HSPE) administered up to 2003 was replaced with the Secondary Education Institutions (SEI) examination in 2004. The SEI exams were administered between 2004 and 2008. From 2008 until the year 2013, the Placement Examination (PE) was conducted. With PE, the ability of students to use various mental processes is measured based on student objectives in Turkish language, social sciences, mathematics, science, and English courses (MNE, 2010) .\nThe TIMSS survey of more than 60 countries around the world is an important project in determining the educational policies of the participating countries (Karamustafao\u011flu & Sontay, 2012) . The draft of the mathematical evaluation for the TIMSS study was formed around two dimensions. One of them is the content domain which is composed of algebra, geometry, number, and data and probability. The other is the cognitive domain consisting of knowledge, practice, and reasoning .\nThe National TPESE Examination (Transition from Primary Education to Secondary Education), which is also administered at the 8th grade, is a national central examination. The most prominent feature of the TPESE examination is that it assesses the student in a process rather than at an instance (MNE, 2013a). Geometry 21\nData/Probability 21 Table 1 showed that 31% of the questions come from numbers, 28% from algebra, 21% from geometry and 21% from data/probability content areas. Based on the calculations of the percentages when the TIMSS 2015 math questions are categorized according to cognitive levels, 31% of the questions were at the level of \"knowledge\", 45% at the level of \"application\" and 24% at the level of \"reasoning\"."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background", "text": "Tetik (2013) classified and compared 355 PE mathematics questions asked to 8th-grade students between 1998 and 2012 and 89 mathematics questions asked in TIMSS 2007 according to the TIMSS 2007 cognitive domain levels. As a result of the research, it was found that 29.30% of the mathematics questions asked to the 8th-grade students between 1998 and 2012 were at the knowledge level, 60% at the practice level, and 10.70% at the reasoning level. In the case of 89 mathematical questions asked in TIMSS 2007, 25.84% were at the knowledge level, 61.79% were at the application level and 12.36% were at the reasoning level. Similarly, Ba\u015fol et al. (2016) classified the mathematics test items of the TPESE exam according to the TIMSS levels and the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy in their study. As a result of the study, it was found that 78.8% of the questions were grouped under Level 1 and Level 2, 21.2% under Level 3 and Level 4 in the classification according to the TIMSS levels. Ta\u015ftekino\u011flu (2014) examined the questions of the 4th-grade mathematics exam applied in 3 primary schools in Istanbul according to the levels of the cognitive domain. In cognitive domain comparisons, 40% of questions asked in TIMSS were at the knowledge, 40% were at the practice and 20% were at the reasoning cognitive levels. It was determined that of the exam questions that were evaluated within the scope of the study, 67% were of the knowledge, 18% were of the practice, 15% were of the reasoning cognitive level, and there was no consistency between the exam questions and the TIMSS questions. According to the data from interview forms administered to teachers, it was determined that the majority of the teachers did not repeat a subject if the percentage of success in the class was low, did not use different teaching techniques, and their level of knowledge about the cognitive domain was inadequate.\nDelil and Delil (2012) Dalak (2015) , in his thesis, tried to reveal the parallels between the questions asked in the TPESE examinations, which were being applied since 2013, and the objectives related to the questions in the 8th-grade curriculum according to the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT). As a result of the study that used the document examination method, the rate of the Mathematics Course exam questions and the objectives of the program that were in the same level according to RBT were determined to be 50% and over.\nComparisons related to Bloom's Taxonomy or the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy were also made in different courses besides the Mathematics course. In his study, Aydo\u011fan (2008) classified the questions of geography in the social studies test according to the cognitive domain levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in the high school placement exams (HSPE and SEI) conducted between 2003 and 2007, and he examined the appropriateness of the questions to the social studies program. It was found that the most number of questions came from the level of comprehension, and there were no questions on knowledge -the lowest level -and evaluation -the highest level -among the geography questions of the SEI social sciences test. G\u00fcnd\u00fcz (2009) , on the other hand, analyzed the questions of middle school Science and Technology courses according to Bloom's Taxonomy. It was seen that 64.65% of the questions were related with knowledge, 9.68% with comprehension, 17.86% with application, 4.51% with analysis, 0.94% with synthesis and 2.34% with evaluation levels. In summary, 92.19% of the questions were revealed to be questions that measured lower-level thinking skills. \u00d6zcan and A\u00e7\u0131k (2011) examined the questions in PE Turkish test and middle school Turkish textbooks of 2007-2008 academic year according to Bloom's Taxonomy. It was seen that the questions in the PE Turkish test and the textbooks were prepared considering the cognitive levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.\nStudies found noteworthy that the findings of both the questions asked in the central examinations and the questions asked by the teachers in the exams were examined according to Bloom's Taxonomy.

The aim of this study is to analyze the mathematics test questions administered to 8 th -grade students in the TIMSS study of 2015 and the mathematics questions asked in the TPESE examination according to the TIMSS 2015 cognitive levels. The questions are relevant because they were classified according to the cognitive levels in the 2015 TIMSS national evaluation report.\nWhile consistency, sensitivity and stability are important in reliability according to B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00f6zt\u00fcrk, \u00c7akmak, Akg\u00fcn, Karadeniz and Demirel (2010) , it is important to collect data on relevance, usefulness and significance in validity.\nConsistency between independent measurements are examined for reliability. In the analysis of the TPESE examination mathematics questions, three experts -two males with 8 years of teaching experience and one female with 5 years of teaching experience -together with the researcher independently examined the cognitive levels of the TIMSS 2015 Mathematics framework, and again classified 20 mathematical questions independently of each other according to the cognitive levels of TIMSS 2015.

In other words, the mathematics questions of the TPESE exams did not overlap with those of TIMSS in terms of the cognitive domain. Table 7 shows that the most number of questions came from the number and geometry content areas in the classification of the mathematics questions asked in the TPESE exams between 2013 and 2016 according to the TIMSS-2015 content areas.

This is because the TPESE exams are applied gradually as the 1 st Term (November) and 2 nd Term (April). Because the numbers of objectives in the first TPESE exam held in November are few, no questions came from the content areas mentioned above. Therefore, in order to see the big picture, the following table was created based on the academic year."}, {"section_title": "\u0130 j Sum of sequence Sum of column", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Classification of the TPESE Exam Mathematics Questions on the Basis of TIMSS 2015 Content Areas", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "It was seen that among a total of 240 mathematics questions asked in the TPESE make-up exam administered to 8th-grade students between 2013 and 2016, 42.5% were at the knowledge, 45.5% were at the application and 12% were at the reasoning cognitive level. It was seen that the most number of questions came from the application and knowledge cognitive levels with similar percentages, and the least number of questions came from the reasoning cognitive level. The cognitive levels of knowledge and application constituted 88% of the questions. Only 12% belonged to the reasoning cognitive level. Hence, we can draw the conclusion that the TPESE exams have little room for questions that measure high-level thinking skills. Questions that measure low-level skills constitute the vast majority of questions (88%). In the literature, this situation has been put forward in Dalak's (2015) thesis. Dalak (2015) , in his thesis, tried to reveal the parallels between the mathematics questions asked in the Transition from Primary Education to Secondary Education (TPESE) examinations, which were being applied since 2013, and the objectives related to the questions in the 8th grade curriculum according to the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT). He stated that only 15% of the 2013-2014 academic year fall semester TPESE exam questions measure highlevel cognitive skills.\nMoreover, Yakal\u0131 (2016) examined all 80 questions in the mathematics tests of the TPESE administered in fall and spring semesters between 2013 and 2015, and 52 objectives related to these questions within the framework of the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. It indicates the lower cognitive levels and there are not any questions at the evaluation or creation levels. This situation is in contradiction to mathematical process skills (such as reasoning and association) which are expressed and emphasized to be improved in mathematics teaching programs (MNE, 2013d) .\nWhen the distribution of the TIMSS 2015 Mathematics questions is examined, it is seen that 31% of the questions belong to the knowledge, 45% to the application and 24% to the reasoning cognitive level in the 8 th -grade mathematics achievement test. Thus, the following conclusion can be reached: Of the TPESE math questions, the cognitive percentage of \"knowledge\" was well above the percentage determined by the TIMSS, while the cognitive percentage of reasoning was well below the percentage determined by the TIMSS. The cognitive percentages of application were close to each other. In the TPESE exam, instead of the reasoning questions that developed the reasoning power, questions at the knowledge level (the first level of the cognitive domain) were asked. This situation is in conflict with the mathematics curriculum. In addition to learning mathematical concepts, the development of a number of important skills has also been targeted with the approach adopted in the mathematics curriculum. These skills are high-level skills such as problem-solving, reasoning and associating (MNE, 2009).\nAs a result of the study, it was seen that the level that was represented the least in the mathematics questions of the TPESE examinations administered between 2013 and 2016, and in the mathematics questions asked in TIMSS 2015 was the reasoning cognitive level, but this rate was higher in the questions in TIMSS 2015. It was determined that there was fewer (12%) number of questions that measured highlevel thinking skills in the TPESE examinations. This shows the need to increase the number of questions requiring high-level cognitive skills during the central exams in our country, Turkey.\n\u0130ncikab\u0131, Mercimek, Ayano\u011flu, Aliustao\u011flu and Tekin (2016) evaluated the objectives of the secondary school mathematics curriculum published in 2013 according to the TIMSS cognitive domains. In their study, they stated that 30% of objectives of the 8 th -grade level was in the knowledge, 35% in the application and 35% in the reasoning domain. Although the rate of objectives about the reasoning domain in the mathematics curriculum was high, it is seen in studies (Ba\u015fol, 2016; \u0130ncikab\u0131, 2016) in the literature that this rate is low in mathematics questions of the entrance exams to secondary education institutions (PE and TPESE).\nBa\u015fol, Balgalm\u0131\u015f, Karl\u0131 and \u00d6z (2016) classified the TPESE exam math test items according to the TIMSS levels and the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. In their study, they found that 78.8% of the questions were grouped under Level 1 and Level 2, 21.2% under Level 3 and Level 4. In the distribution according to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy, the majority of the questions were at the application level, and the number of questions regarding the analysis and evaluation levels was small. The authors suggested that questions of an exam like TPESE (by which students are directed to an upper institution based on their cognitive levels) should be prepared in a way that they also measure high-level cognitive skills."}, {"section_title": "Interpretation of Results Related to the Distribution of TPESE Exam and TPESE Make-up Exam Mathematics Questions According to the TIMSS 2015 Content Areas", "text": "47.5% of the TPESE exam math questions come from the number content area, 18.3% from the algebra content area, 27.5% from the geometry content area, and 6.7% from the data/probability content area.

In their study, they pointed out that the distribution of mathematics questions concentrates on certain issues in general. They stated that the most number of questions in the distribution of the mathematics questions according to the content areas comes from the geometry area and the least from the probability and statistics area. In the TPESE exams that were administered between 2013 and 2016, the least number of questions came from the data and probability content area. The most number of questions came from the number subject, followed by the geometry subject."}]
