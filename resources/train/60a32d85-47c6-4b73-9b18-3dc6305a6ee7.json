When his siblings grew up and could pitch in, Raymond thought, he would revisit his goal of going to a university.\nMila Felix was a star student, earning straight A's in high school and acing her SATs.\nCompelled to serve her country-just like her father and grandfather-Mila joined the military after high school and served two tours in Iraq. When she returned home ready to take the lessons she learned from her experience abroad and contribute to her community as a civilian, higher education was the obvious next step. But it had been years since she was in a classroom and, after retaking her SATs and receiving low scores, she was counseled against entering a four-year university by a family friend who worked at a nearby university.\nWhile he didn't do badly, Jack Ingles found little inspiration at his small rural high school.\nHis parents didn't go to college, and going to a university never came up in conversations with his guidance counselor. So, Jack didn't think of himself as college material, and, even if he was, he didn't know what to study. After graduating, he moved from job to job and eventually got a job in a hospital. Now, with a little more life experience, he knows that he wants to serve in the health care field, probably as a doctor, although he is still open to other jobs in health care.\nJune Miller's son was born when she was a junior in high school. With daycare and other support from her family, she managed to graduate from high school with honors. June chose to stay close to home, so she could work to support her son while her grandparents provided childcare. Now, her son is old enough to start school, and she knows that it is time to continue her own education, so she can advance her career and provide a better life for herself and her family.\nComing from vastly different backgrounds, these four students have a few things in common: They are exceptionally talented, they are motivated to succeed, they have valuable life experiences to bring to the classroom, and they don't fit the mold of the typical student top colleges and universities recruit. There's one more thing they share: They are very likely to begin higher education at their local community college.\nNote: According to Tackling Transfer: A Guide to Convening Community Colleges and Universities to Improve Transfer Student Outcomes (see reference #4), 1.7 million degree-seeking undergraduate students begin at 2-year public colleges over a 12-month period (as opposed to fall-start only), excluding dual-enrollment students.\nTogether, these brief stories illuminate some of the \"non-traditional\" paths to higher education followed by a substantial proportion of the nation's college-going population. Each fall, nearly 1.1 million students-representing communities across a diversity of races, ethnicities, geographies, ages, and income levels-begin higher education in two-year public colleges.\n3 Most of these students have clear aspirations: As many as 80 percent indicate that their ultimate goal is to transfer and attain a bachelor's degree. 4 When they succeed in transferring to a four-year school, these students do just as well as their \"traditional\" student peers who started at four-year colleges and universities. Not only are these transfer students poised for individual success, but faculty often report that transfer students' perspectives, motivations, and life experiences enrich the academic and social experience for students in the classroom and beyond.\nUnfortunately, the data reveal that too many community college students seeking to attain a bachelor's degree fail to even enter a university and, when they do, suffer the consequences of unclear pathways. As a result, only 14 percent of them attain a bachelor's degree within six years of community college entry.\n5 While many community colleges have recently been working hard to improve two-to-four-year transfer pathways, more can and should be done.\nDue to geographic proximity and lower costs, regional public universities have tended to be the primary engine for bachelor's attainment for community college transfers. However, to fully serve the abundance of community college students seeking further opportunity, it should be incumbent upon the complete spectrum of higher education to ensure both higher rates of community college student transfer and bachelor's completion. The 290 colleges and universities with 70 percent or higher graduation rates-hereinafter referred to as \"the ATI sector\" or \"ATI institutions\"-have a mixed record of supporting transfer from community college.\n6 Not only does this limit the access of community college students, the evidence suggests that, by remaining on the margins, these four-year institutions overlook a pipeline that is extremely rich in the diversity and talent that they seek to recruit.\nThe research reflected in this paper estimates that, each year, more than 50,000 high-achieving community college students-defined as those who have over a 3.0 GPA and are enrolled in more than 24 credit hours in their first year-do not transfer to a four-year institution. Moreover, approximately 15,000 of these students have earned a 3.7 GPA or higher in community college-the equivalent benchmark for \"high performance\" predominantly found in the high school student college match literature.\nThese data validate what community college practitioners and research experts have known all along-community colleges are home to an abundance of talented students with the ambition to succeed. As ATI works toward its 50,000-by-2025 goal, we should include serving these students as a core part of our mission.\nEach year more than 50,000 high-achieving community college students do not transfer to a four-year institution-15,000 of these students have earned a 3.7 GPA or higher in community college students, with high representation of foster children, undocumented youth, and parenting students in the two-year population. For example, approximately a third of community college students report having a dependent in their care-more than double the incidence at four-year public and private institutions."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Lower socioeconomic status also intersects with community college campus racial and ethnic diversity, especially for subpopulations of students that experience the highest degrees of childhood poverty. 14 For instance, Black and Hispanic students are more likely to start in community colleges than their white peers. 15 Additionally, while American Indians and Alaska Natives are underrepresented on four-year campuses, the enrollment of these groups in public two-year schools (about 1 percent of the student population) approximates the national distribution (about 1.3 percent of U.S. residents)."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "Collectively, these data make clear that transfer pathways from community colleges present a significant opportunity for top colleges and universities to provide access to the students they have historically had the most difficulty reaching through traditional means.\nToday, community college students represent approximately 37 percent of all entering first-time degree-seeking undergraduates, with a total fall enrollment of 6.4 million students each year."}, {"section_title": "7, 8", "text": "Those enrollments are expected to reach 7.4 million students by 2025.

Furthermore, data indicate a high degree of complexity in how socioeconomic disadvantage is experienced by community college"}, {"section_title": "Community Colleges-Serving Millions of the Nation's Most Underrepresented", "text": "In recent years, community colleges have come under scrutiny for low rates of degree attainment. While there is still much work left to be done to improve student success, there are numerous examples of excellence in community colleges. For instance, the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence finalists have demonstrated strong outcomes in completion, labor market preparation, transfer, and equity. Moreover, Phi Theta Kappa's honor society, which inducts 134,000 new students each year, and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation's Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship have long recognized community-college students with significant talent and achievement. One of the aims of this research was to estimate the number of lower-income community college students poised to excel at four-year institutions who are not being reached by these and other efforts.\nBased on an analysis of national datasets, we found 41 percent of community college students, in their first year, obtain a first-year GPA between 3.0 and 4.0, and that 12 percent of new two-year students obtain at least a 3.7 GPA in their first year. 17, 18 Limiting the scope of the analysis to students who enroll in at least 24 credits in their first year, we found that 47 percent of these high-achieving, \"transfer-ready\" students do not transfer to any four-year institution within six years of entering higher education. Based on a threeyear average (2013) (2014) (2015) of national fall enrollment trends of first-time students at two-year public institutions and estimates of students with belowmedian family incomes in 2011/12, we estimate that:\nl More than 50,000 high-achieving lower-income community college students-those with at least a 3.0 GPA-do not end up transferring to a four-year institution within six years of beginning postsecondary education.\nl Approximately 15,000 of these students would have GPAs in the 3.7-4.0 range, which is equivalent to the academic qualifications described in Hoxby and Avery, 2013. 19 Because this analysis excludes community college students who began in the spring or summer terms, this figure almost certainly underestimates the number of high-achieving community college students that could excel after two-to-four-year transfer.\n17 The primary data sources accessed for this analysis (see Appendix: \"The Case\" Study Design for more detail) were the National Center The national data indicate that student success rates are high when transfer from community college to a four-year institution goes as intended-when students transfer with an associate's degree. 20 This finding is consistent with prior studies, which demonstrate that community college transfers to top colleges and universities typically succeed at the same rates as students who began at the same four-year institutions as first-year students. 21, 22 Similarly, at the exemplar institutions we consulted for \"The Practical Guide,\" many indicated that their community college transfer students graduate at high rates comparable to those of the traditional student body. These three schools illustrate the high level of college readiness among community college students with GPAs in the range identified in this study.\nUnfortunately, transfer rarely goes as intended-especially for lower-income students. Few transfer students leave community college with an award and only 36% of lowerincome transfer students attain a bachelor's within six years of beginning postsecondary education. 23 To fully support transfer students, ATI institutions should partner with community colleges to address attrition risks and progression delays that exist before, during, and after transfer. The companion practice report provides specific guidance in this regard (see The Practical Guide). While these observations are impossible to capture through a national data review, qualitative analysis conducted for this report-including conversations with faculty and staff at several institutions-and a literature review suggest that community college transfer initiatives positively impacted the broader academic and social experience on their campuses in several ways."}, {"section_title": "Transfer Students Succeed When Supported", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Classroom Enrichment", "text": "Faculty from different disciplines described the transfer population as generally coming in with exceptional work ethic and focus, varied professional and life experiences, and diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.

For instance, our contacts indicate that their community college transfer initiatives enrolled students who started new clubs (e.g., veteran and/or undocumented student affinity groups), volunteered in the local community organizations or hospitals, and spearheaded many of the support programs for transfer students-including peer mentoring, alumni outreach to community colleges, and transfer community-building events-that ultimately helped build bridges between the transfer and traditional student population. This corroborates findings from the 2014 Community College Transfer Initiative evaluation, which noted that their community college transfer students felt a strong desire to \"give back.\" In addition to expanding access and enhancing educational quality, there is a compelling economic case to be made for increasing transfer students. Specifically, supporting community college transfer pathways may offer four-year colleges a financially sustainable strategy to provide an affordable education to substantially more low-and moderate-income students. To test this proposition, we sought to quantify the financial aid investment required to support community college transfer enrollment and bachelor's completion."}, {"section_title": "Untapped Educational Excellence at Top Colleges", "text": "In comparison to data on traditional four-year students, data sources on financial aid for community college transfer students are sparse.

Even when ATI institutions are considered, the dearth of information and transparency on credit transfer, financial aid, and support systems can discourage students from applying or result in costly additional time-to-degree.\nA compressed timeframe at their bachelor's institution leaves transfer students relatively little time to establish a sense of inclusion and engagement, adapt to new academic expectations, and pace toward on-time graduation, let alone participate in the highimpact experiences typically associated with the ATI sector. Despite these challenges-and their potentially costly consequencestoo few ATI institutions provide the tailored support needed to ensure that community college transfer students access the full range of experiences available.\nWhile community college transfer students are likely to graduate, more needs to be done to support equitable and holistic success. Specifically, ATI institutions should consider pre-transfer programming in partnership with community colleges to set students up for success as early as possible, robust orientation programming after admission, and continuous post-transition support to reinforce key messages when students need them most. ATI institutions should also consider that transfer students are likely to hail from communities historically underserved by higher educationincluding students with low-income backgrounds, students of color, parenting students, veterans, etc.-and connect students to tailored programming and resources as needed."}, {"section_title": "Fostering Holistic Transfer Student Success with Dedicated Supports Engaging and Advising Community College Students Early", "text": "Rather than traditional recruiting tactics, ATI institutions should lean on established community college partnerships to build strong relationships with community college faculty and advisors-the main influencers of prospective students.
