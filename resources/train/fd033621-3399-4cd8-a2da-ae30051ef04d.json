[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Brain Images of Normal Subjects (BRAINS) Imagebank (http://www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk) is an integrated repository project hosted by the University of Edinburgh and sponsored by the Scottish Imaging Network: A Platform for Scientific Excellence (SINAPSE) collaborators. BRAINS provide sharing and archiving of detailed normal human brain imaging and relevant phenotypic data already collected in studies of healthy volunteers across the life-course. It particularly focusses on the extremes of age (currently older age, and in future perinatal) where variability is largest, and which are under-represented in existing databanks. BRAINS is a living imagebank where new data will be added when available. Currently BRAINS contains data from 808 healthy volunteers, from 15 to 81 years of age, from 7 projects in 3 centres. Additional completed and ongoing studies of normal individuals from 1st to 10th decades are in preparation and will be included as they become available. BRAINS holds several MRI structural sequences, including T1, T2, T2* and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), available in DICOM (http://dicom.nema.org/); in future Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will be added where available. Images are linked to a wide range of 'textual data', such as age, medical history, physiological measures (e.g. blood pressure), medication use, cognitive ability, and perinatal information for pre/post-natal subjects. The imagebank can be searched to include or exclude ranges of these variables to create better estimates of 'what is normal' at different ages."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "What is our imagebank designed to do?", "text": "The Brain Images of Normal Subjects (BRAINS) Imagebank (http:// www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk) is designed to provide detailed brain imaging data of healthy/'normal' individuals across the human life-course. The imagebank is a searchable database of integrated data sets already collected as part of research studies which include healthy (or control) subjects. These studies include detailed MRI using a range of sequences, and associated data, e.g. demographic details, health, and cognitive tests, and pregnancy details (for perinatal subjects). A key strength of BRAINS is the range and detail of these non-imaging variables. We are initially focussing on collating data from imaging studies at the extremes of life (old age, and later, perinatal) where least data are available in other databanks and there is most variability in brain structure (Serag et al., 2012; Sowell et al., 2003; Dickie et al., 2012a; Dickie et al., 2015a) , but our imagebank includes subjects of all ages.\nThe definition of 'normal' is not simple and therefore this imagebank can be searched by associated data such as, blood pressure, body mass index, cognitive test scores, gestational age at birth. For example, hypertension is so prevalent in older people that it can be regarded as normal, but some investigators may wish to study participants with blood "}, {"section_title": "Contents lists available at ScienceDirect", "text": "NeuroImage j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / y n i m g pressure within a certain range, and/or by imaging parameters such as the degree of atrophy or white matter lesions, that can vary widely in normal people with age. Brain structure in infancy is commonly altered in association with preterm birth, but not all preterm infants develop impairment, which leaves uncertainties about what is 'normal' in early life (Boardman et al., 2007 (Boardman et al., , 2010 . The imagebank will be expanded in the future to include new data as they become available, and subjects from other geographical locations. The availability of data including clinically relevant MRI sequences from healthy volunteers across the life-course (linked with related phenotypical, demographic and cognitive measures), without diagnosed disease is an essential resource:\n(i) As a reference atlas, for interpretation of brain images in clinical diagnosis, such as having access to healthy subject reference images closely matched to a patient's age and linked data (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), to improve diagnostic accuracy (Farrell et al., 2009) , and (ii) To develop new methods to detect brain pathology and associated clinical manifestations, such as early markers of neurodevelopmental impairment or dementia (Dickie et al., 2015a, b) .\nWe will build and share developmental ranked atlases across the life-course, similar to child growth charts, but for the brain (Dickie et al., 2013 , Dickie et al., 2015a . The imagebank will provide multiple data sets that can be used to test the accuracy and reproducibility of image processing methods and algorithms, in clinical and research settings. It will aid in determining early markers of disease by defining boundaries of normality to provide more precise estimates of disease risk. The reuse of data from already-funded primary studies is encouraged to increase value and reduce waste in research (http:// researchwaste.net/).\nThe BRAINS Imagebank is hosted by the Brain Research Imaging Centre at Edinburgh University, Scotland, UK on behalf of a Steering Committee which includes the Principal Investigators of the original studies, experts in ethics, law and governance, and lay representatives (http://www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk/steering). The BRAINS datasets are from previously funded and ongoing studies by members of the Scottish Imaging Network, A Platform for Scientific Excellence (SINAPSE), namely the universities of Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dundee, St Andrews, Stirling, and Edinburgh. It is funded by the Brain Research Imaging Centre at Edinburgh University, SINAPSE (http://www.sinapse.ac. uk/), BBSRC Sparking impact (http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/), and Edinburgh & Lothians Health Foundation (ELHF, http://www.elhf.co.uk/)."}, {"section_title": "Background: comparison with existing brain image databanks", "text": "In our systematic review of existing structural brain image databanks, including OASIS, ADNI, UK Biobank, and IXI among others, we found that normal subjects older than 60 years were relatively underrepresented and that these subjects often had limited cognitive and medical metadata to support their classification as 'normal' (Dickie et al., 2012a, b) . These subjects were mainly recruited as controls in studies of dementia, e.g. OASIS and ADNI, and their classification as 'normal' was generally determined through dementia-based assessments, e.g., clinical dementia rating (CDR) and Mini-Mental Statement Examination (MMSE). The majority of these subjects were aged between 70 and 79 years. Further, there were a limited range of sequences available for many of these subjects, e.g., only T1 images are provided in OASIS. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, required to effectively classify white matter hyperintensities , were often not available in other Banks (Dickie et al., 2012a, b) . BRAINS is unique among existing image banks in including a) a wide range of sequences for most subjects (e.g., T1, T2, T2*, and FLAIR), b) a focus on normal subjects aged over 60 years, up to the tenth decade (and in future perinatal subjects) and c) an extensive battery of cognitive and medical results in subjects often specifically recruited for studies of 'normal' cognitive ageing."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "The architecture underlying the BRAINS imagebank is based on the Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) (https://wiki.xnat. org/, Marcus et al., 2007) . A key reason for adopting the XNAT platform was the extensibility of its data model. The BRAINS imagebank delivers two alternative web interfaces. The primary interface is the 'Guest' web application interface, which is provided for external users, delivered via Apache Tomcat. The secondary interface is the default XNAT interface and is only available to the BRAINS project team and collaborators (PIs of hosted projects), to allow for access control, data curation and quality control. The 'Guest' interface allows searching of the anonymised data using imaging and associated data fields, and the option to save a search for later use."}, {"section_title": "Data quality control", "text": "Details of the protocol and quality control processes of the contributing projects will be provided where possible (http://www. brainsimagebank.ac.uk/datasets). This varies between studies and centres. Data from regular phantom scanning is available for all scanners (e.g. the Quality Assurance procedures of the Edinburgh Brain Research Imaging Centre http://www.sbirc.ed.ac.uk/research/qualityassurance/ qualityassurance.html). Details of individual studies image analysis and data checking QC are provided in individual linked publications. In addition, all data are checked during import into BRAINS, both image (sequence details, completeness of scan) and demographic data (matching of IDs to images, completeness of variables, variables range and definitions) -see 'data cleaning' below."}, {"section_title": "Exclusion criteria", "text": "Imaging: All individual studies require scans to be reported by a clinical neuroradiologist, and anyone with a scan which would represent significant pathology (e.g. cystic periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral haemorrhage or large infarct, perinatal stroke, or large tumour such as pituitary adenoma or glioma) would be excluded, but the presence of incidental abnormalities, e.g. white matter lesions, small infarcts or microhaemorrhages, that are common accompaniments of ageing and which were not associated with any clinically evident impairment, would be included. These features are reported in the database.\nClinical: All subjects are identified as 'healthy' or 'normal' when recruited for the original studies. References to the original studies are included in the data provenance, but in general people are living independently in the community, without severe physical, psychiatric or neurodegenerative disease that impacts on their daily life. Some are control groups for studies of disease. Acknowledging the wide range of 'normality', we include people with conditions common in older age -e.g. diabetes, hypertension -but record this so that these parameters can be included or excluded by users. People with low MMSE may have been excluded by the original studies, but BRAINS has not excluded any subjects based on MMSE scores (or other cognitive test scores where included in the original studies and provided to BRAINS)."}, {"section_title": "BRAINS imagebank architecture", "text": "The BRAINS imagebank is created using two support databases (Fig. 1) . The first database, the 'link' database, holds a linking table to enable a secure ID mapping service, for linking of new data sets to existing sets (e.g. identifying subjects with multiple visits), and for reverse linking anonymised data should the need arise. Longitudinal data for a specific subject will have the same subject ID, with a separate visit ID.\nInitially, the Textual Data pass through 'Data Cleaning' (Fig. 1 ). This involves checking the formats, coding, and ranges of textual data, and converting where necessary to fit the BRAINS schema.\nThe purpose of the second database, the 'Quality Control' (QC) database (MySQL), is to ensure QC for imaging, data linkage, and anonymisation. It contains data from the DICOM images and medical and related information from the original projects. The database is divided into tables corresponding to two main blocks depending on the origin: DICOM or other. The data are de-identified, but with a relatively low level of anonymity (i.e. name and patient ID removed). The textual data in the DICOM images is anonymised and catalogued using DICOM Confidential (Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010) . The link and QC databases are stored on a secure server on our internal network, with strict access restrictions."}, {"section_title": "QC tasks include:", "text": "-Physical units homogenisation (e.g. magnetic field in Tesla).\n-Values codification/concept mapping (e.g. sequence types 'FSE T2'/ 'T2'). -Inspection of \"abnormal\" values."}, {"section_title": "Anonymisation protocol", "text": "The original projects contributing data to the BRAINS imagebank often involve Person Identifiable Data (PID). Data available in the BRAINS imagebank are anonymised, and checked for anonymity.\nThe 'link database' contains a series of tables providing mappings from the original patient IDs and subjects' study IDs to their assigned BRAINS subject ID (BID). The BID is a randomly generated ID following the pattern \"BIDxxxxx\" where x is a digit. It uses the Java random number generator (48-bit seed, which is modified using a linear congruential formula). We also check for collisions with previously generated BIDs. These BIDs are generated when data for a new subject are processed for their inclusion in the QC database. The mapping between the original ID and the generated BID is stored in the 'link database' in order to ensure that longitudinal data are assigned to the correct BID.\nThe DICOM images are anonymised in a multi-stage process. Firstly, basic DICOM de-identification is performed for loading the data into the QC database. This removes the most obvious identifiers like the person's name, and patient ID, and removal of all private tags and rejection of DICOM images with information burned into the pixel data. The patient ID is substituted by the BID. This step is performed by DICOM Confidential and includes the generation of the DICOM catalogue tables in the QC database.\nFurther and much stricter DICOM de-identification is performed, again using DICOM Confidential (Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010) , before sending the DICOM images to the BRAINS imagebank. The privacy policy in this case is based on the DICOM standard basic profile with the 'keep longitudinal information' option. This includes removal of attributes like the date of birth, information about the institution and staff involved in the scanning, and substitution of the UIDs.\nFace de-identification is performed by the removal of distinguishing features from the image: face, teeth, ears etc. (Bischoff-Grethe et al., 2007) , and the results visually checked."}, {"section_title": "Standardisation of textual data", "text": "Some adjustments are made to raw data to avoid possibility of reidentification, e.g. 'age' is rounded to nearest year (excepting infant data), dates of scans are removed but the ordering is preserved for longitudinal data. A complete list of data mapping transformation information is available from the BRAINS web site (http://www. brainsimagebank.ac.uk/userguide)."}, {"section_title": "BRAINS schema", "text": "The BRAINS schema covers the range of imaging and associated data in each included study. Not all studies collect or provide all associated data. To implement the BRAINS schema XNAT data types were enriched and specialised by child data types specified in XML Schema documents.\nThe initial release of BRAINS will be searchable by a core subset of the schema fields. As the BRAINS imagebank is developed we will extend the searchable subset to cover the complete set of schema fields. A data dictionary of the non-imaging data included can be found at http://www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk/datadictionary and a summary of all current data can be found at http://www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk/ subjectQuery/summary.\nThe complete BRAINS schema covers the following broad categories: A major issue in combining these heterogeneous datasets is how to combine Textual data which may be recorded in different ways (e.g. age as whole years, months, weeks or days, or in decimal format), measured in different ways (e.g. blood pressure using an automated or manual sphygmomanometer) or using different tests to measure the same construct e.g. National Adult Reading Test (NART) or Mill Hill test for vocabulary/crystallised ability. An ontologist working with domain experts creates mappings from the original dataset to the BRAINS schema, and all decisions are recorded. Missing data are coded as 'not available'. Details of how we standardised the format of textual data will be available on our website once standardisations are finalised. The current (human readable) Textual data schema can be found at http://www.brainsimagebank.ac.uk/datadictionary, and (xml format: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ brainsimagebank/).
