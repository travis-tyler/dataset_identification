[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract The Informatics Visualization for Neuroimaging (INVIZIAN) framework allows one to graphically display image and meta-data information from sizeable collections of neuroimaging data as a whole using a dynamic and compelling user interface. Users can fluidly interact with an entire collection of cortical surfaces using only their mouse. In addition, users can cluster and group brains according in multiple ways for subsequent comparison using graphical data mining tools. In this article, we illustrate the utility of INVIZIAN for simultaneous exploration and mining a large collection of extracted cortical surface data arising in clinical neuroimaging studies of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment, as well as healthy control subjects. Alzheimer's Disease is particularly interesting due to the wide-spread effects on cortical architecture and alterations of volume in specific brain areas associated with memory. We demonstrate INVIZIAN's ability to render multiple brain surfaces from multiple diagnostic groups of subjects, showcase the interactivity of the system, and showcase how INVIZIAN can be employed to generate hypotheses about the collection of data which would be suitable for direct access to the underlying raw data and subsequent formal statistical analysis. Specifically, we use INVIZIAN show how cortical thickness and hippocampal volume differences between group are evident even in the absence of more formal hypothesis testing. In the context of neurological diseases linked to brain aging such as AD, INVIZIAN provides a unique means for considering the entirety of whole brain datasets, look for interesting relationships among them, and thereby derive new ideas for further research and study."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent advancements in imaging protocols combined with a reduction in storage costs have led to an upsurge of neuroimaging data in both clinical as well as research settings. Increasingly, neuroimaging databases are capable of containing image volumes in excess of hundreds or thousands of subjects Van Horn et al. 2005 , Van Horn and Toga 2009a , b, Biswal et al. 2010 . Moreover, brain databases are often limited to textbased metadata searches of their contents thus limiting the user interaction considerably. Once the complete set of image data files has been downloaded, a user is obliged to conduct a formal analysis of the data simply to discover if the data contain any particular effects of interest. Finally, many commonly available visualization tools ideally designed for neuroimaging focus on single subject data and are not conducive to plotting such multi-subject relationships. In the context of data mining and exploratory inspection of database content, this process is inefficient and time consuming.\nMany neuroscience database uses follow a typical processing and analytical approach which begins with a text-based search for relevant data and then downloading the raw imaging files for analysis. The commonly employed neuroimaging processing framework involves the fitting of the imaging data from each subject to a common spatial frame of reference in the form of a standardized brain atlas (Collins et al. 1994, Nowinski and Belov 2003) . The individual brain volumes are thereby subjected to warping with respect to specific template brain volume in order to remove the anatomical differences in brain structure (Lancaster et al. 1999, Nowinski and Thirunavuukarasuu 2001) , permitting population-level averaging (Van Horn and Toga 2009a, b) , and comparisons of anatomy between groups of subjects irrespective of overall brain size (Mega et al. 2005) . Final steps involve the specification of an experimental design and inferential statistical modeling, used to assess morphological differences according to phenotypic observations of interest, such as cortical thickness in relation to patient diagnosis (Thompson et al. 2001) .\nSuch analysis-driven techniques can provide useful average summaries of a collection of scans from a database (Van Horn and Toga 2009a, b) . However, these mappings often do not allow a user to view the structure and variation of multiple data sets across different subject-based categories. For instance, there are hippocampal volume deficits (Carmichael et al. 2005) as well as white matter alterations (Carmichael et al. 2010) in the case of Alzheimer's disease which may correlate with disease duration, severity, genetic susceptibility, and other factors (Stein et al. 2012) . While correlational analyses representing this result could be obtained by merging data from multiple subjects into an atlas space, extracting the hippocampus, and conducting a formal statistical analysis, this would be time consuming, computationally expensive, and might prohibit independent visualization of individual subjects with respect to one another, per se. Consequently, such an approach tends to prohibit or severely limit a more exploratory examination of database contents. In other words, data mining or exploratory analyses are not easily performed and a user must commit to a more formal image processing and statistical analysis. As a means for browsing database contents, this approach is costly and counter to the notion of exploring databases from a content-driven point of view.\nThus, to rapidly understand and explore the image-centric data contained within these repositories can often become both computationally demanding as well as operationally overwhelming. What is needed is a means by which users may explore relationships in these archives through interaction with the data themselves in contrast to only text-based searches and then inspection of data one subject at a time. Methods for data mining and exploratory analysis have been proposed (Megalooikonomou et al. 2000) and would seem ideally suited for examining database contents. For instance, in the context of neuroanatomical imaging data, it would greatly assist database users if they could directly view representations of the subject's data in an interactive way, discover the basic relationships between neuroanatomical features and subject metadata, as a prelude to downloading the data for a formal statistical examination. Dimension reduction, graphical display, and data-mining approaches form a useful combination of tools which, when used collectively, can be employed to interactively examine potentially large amounts of neuroimaging data at once. This has clear advantages for database interactivity, the discovery of interesting effects present therein, and hypothesis generation (Mennes et al. 2012, Voytek and Voytek 2012) .\nWe recognized that the ability to display multiple brain data sets simultaneously represents an essential step for data exploration and mining, allowing users to examine patterns of similar brain anatomy in advance of subsequent processing, atlas fitting, averaging, and computational analysis (Joshi et al. 2009 ). Through the process of exploring the similarity space of brain anatomy from across a large collection of preprocessed MR data, a user might be ideally positioned to identify interesting patterns in the data which would not be appreciated by averaging or by inspection of the metadata alone.\nWith this idea in mind, we developed a novel framework for the interactive discovery of brain morphological feature and meta-data attribute relationships drawn from a large-scale archive of structural MRI data. The goals of our work in the area are as follows: 1) To demonstrate a visually compelling interface for displaying multiple cortical surfaces computed from a repository of raw brain imaging data in which users may dynamically interact with the complete collection of surfaces and rapidly examine feature relatedness; 2) Illustrate a novel's text query-based framework which provides for the immediate interactive investigation of how subject metadata varies with regard to extracted morphological metrics; and 3) showcase graphical meta-analytics for visualizing the basic relationships between morphological metric values and subject metadata which may help to set the stage for subsequent formal statistical modeling.\nIn what follows, we illustrate the use of the Informatics Visualization for Neuroimaging (INVIZIAN) framework (Bowman et al. 2012) in the use-case context of neuroimaging data relevant to human brain aging and Alzheimer's Disease. The INVIZIAN software can be accessed via our project website, http://invizian.loni.usc.edu, with easy-to-use installation packages available to deploy the software on PC and Linux platforms, and links to the source code repository (http://bitbucket.org/uscini/invizian). INVIZIAN is also represented on the Neuroimaging Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) website (http://www.nitrc.org/ projects/invizian)."}, {"section_title": "Background and related work", "text": "Graphical visualization, dimension reduction, and query based database searches are widely available individually but have not been used together under a single framework previously. In this section we review several of these elemental approaches for data exploration noting their strengths and weaknesses:\nVisualization in neuroscience The prevailing graphical brain imaging tools such as FreeSurfer , BrainVoyager (Goebel et al. 2006) , and BrainSuite (Shattuck and Leahy 2002) are specifically designed to display brain surface models from a single subject at a time. This is because their focus tends to be on analysis and visualization of subjectspecific cortical data along with the feature values such as thickness, volume, curvature etc. In these approaches, while important for processing and visualization of brain surfacebased results at the individual subject level, the examination of multiple subjects at a time is not possible.\nDimensionality reduction Dimension reduction is widely used as a primary step to reduce the overall complexity of large volumes of data while minimizing information-loss. There are a number of well-known approaches. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Rencher 2002) transforms the data to a reduced dimensional representation using a set of orthogonal vectors which seek to explain variance components. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) (Kruskal and Wish 1978 ) is a strategy aiming to replicate the similarity between data in native representation using a lower dimensional representation. Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps (SOM) (Kohonen 1998 ) are a form of artificial neural network that produce a topology-preserving two-dimensional representation of the input data. While dimension reduction successfully reduces structural complexity of the input, in neuroimaging the relationship between the restructured output and original data is sometimes unclear.\nPrior work has implemented an interactive component on top of the dimension reduction to improve the focus and intuition of the calculations. An MDS system is proposed in (Williams and Munzner 2004) which allows a user to iteratively reduce the dimensionality of data, while targeting reduction computation toward regions of interest. Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR) (Yang et al. 2003a) constructs and arranges dimensions into a hierarchy, presented as a radial interface facilitating user exploration of dimensional configuration. Dimension Ordering Spacing and Filtering (DOSFA) (Yang et al. 2003a, b) extends VHDR by adding automated components seeking to identify lower dimensional subspace structure. Johansson and Johansson (2009) propose an interactive dimension reduction system driven by userdefined quality metrics. Any dimension reduction approach can lead to information loss, but in this interactive system the user is in effect able to decide what dimensions are important by appropriately weighting correlation, clustering and outlier significance. Once the user assigns weights and a dimensionality threshold, the system provides a graph illustrating information loss per variable reduced. In another compelling recent paper Endert et al. (2011) consider a means for users to graphically manipulate various dimension reduction model parameters through clicking and dragging of a two dimensional data plot. The users of the observation-level system operate entirely with the spatial interface and do not need to modify numerical parameters directly to alter the visualization. In addition to dimension reduction, visualization frameworks such as Ggobi (Cook and Swayne 2007) provides the ability to link associated graphical displays together using a coordinated multiple view approach.\nQuery-based search A query-based search system can be thought of as one facilitating guided discovery of significant data values through user query-result interaction. This can be performed through text-based phrases or via a user interface for selecting various criteria upon which to search. Results from such searches can be displayed as a list or table, but more interestingly as a graphical rendering. One approach for search visualization was pioneered by Keim and Kriegel (1994) in their method entitled VisDB for building a multidimensional view of a relational database repository. The authors defined type-specific distance metrics which were employed against all data to rank relevance to each user query. Feedback was then presented as a pixel map, with a carefully chosen color scheme depicting distance of query result from significant near matches. In a related approach, the program called Scout (McCormick et al. 2004) , uses GPU hardware acceleration to enable the guidance of visualization processing via mathematical evaluation. Users interact with the system through a customizable API which manipulates pixel parameters during visualization to identify statistically interesting combined parameter values."}, {"section_title": "INVIZIAN system architecture", "text": "In designing the INVIZIAN program, we sought to develop a graphically compelling system in which users could easily visualize a set of cortical surfaces as an entire collection and interact with them in a fluid manner using only their computer mouse (Bowman et al. 2012) . By combining tools for viewing relationships between clusters of similarly featured cortical surfaces, enabling searches over those data, permitting grouping and meta-analytic assessment, the INVIZIAN interface is specifically developed for users to explore and discover relationships that might not be appreciated in a strictly text-based search as a prelude to more formal statistical treatment. Using high-density surface meshes in an OpenGL-based (http:// www.opengl.org) interface, users may zoom in, rotate, and examine in detail the regional cortical patterns of within the clusters of similar brains. A summary of the INVIZIAN visual analytics system is illustrated in Fig. 1 and briefly consists of the following basic elements:\nFeature analytics, extraction, and representation Image preprocessing for T1-weighted anatomical volumes and subsequent feature extraction takes advantage of FreeSurfer's ReconAll cortical surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation algorithm . These steps are implemented in the LONI Pipeline workflow design and execution environment (Dinov et al. 2010 ) to take advantage of efficient parallel computing of surfaces and other results. Feature metrics, such as thickness, volume, etc. are extracted for each brain parcellation. Such features have previously served as useful biomarkers when evaluating the effect of disease (Narr et al. 2005 ), but are also recently being investigated as potential genetic phenotypes (Winkler et al. 2010 ) that influence heritability of the brain. As described previously (Joshi et al. 2011) , using these regional feature vectors, subjects are systematically compared to all other subjects in the collection using a probabilistic \"distance\" metric, and then this set of pairwise comparisons is decomposed using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to reduce its dimensionality and create a new set of coordinates in which brains which are most similar are positioned close to one another while those most dissimilar are positioned furthest from each other (Fig. 2) . These new coordinates form the basis for the simultaneous rendering of the entire set of extracted brain surfaces in the INVIZIAN user interface (Bowman et al. 2012) . Multiresolution brain surface attribute mapping Fluid interaction with the displayed cortical surfaces is an important design characteristic of INVIZIAN which employs a multiresolution technique to facilitate interactivity when viewing data. This has several advantages for when displaying multiple brain surfaces at once. For instance, a fully zoomed out view of the entire dataset collection loads surface meshes decimated by 95 %. The triangle count of such data is approximately 30 k, and the disk size of such a dataset is slightly less than 1 MB. However, when INVIZIAN determines that the user is viewing less than six surfaces in the field of view it seamlessly replaces them with meshes that have been decimated by 80 %. By and large, the decimated cortical surface models tend to be visually indistinguishable from the non-decimated versions, but afford considerable reduction in load-times by having triangle counts of around 100 k at~3.5 MB in size while providing a finer resolution surface for the user to inspect. When a single brain surface is selected, it is seamlessly replaced by its full resolution version, thereby enabling detailed inspection of its surface characteristics. Additional advantage is taken of GPU-based processing to interpolate and color the brain surfaces to present an aesthetically compelling experience for the user.\nQuery-based surface identification, clustering, and coordinated viewing Within INVIZIAN, a simple metadata dialogue is available if the user right-clicks on a surface with their mouse (Fig. 3) . The dialogue box lists subject data at the time the subject scan was conducted and typical information might include age, sex, weight, disease diagnosis information, as well as MRI scanning parameters. In addition to simply viewing the cortical neuroanatomy and meta-data for individual subjects, a user might be interested in how cortical feature values relate to clinical subject metadata. The user enters expressions such as``Subject Age> 70\" into the query text box and INVIZIAN renders a bubble around matching subjects (Fig. 4, top) . Clustered matches indicate potential relationships between subject metadata and the anatomical feature similarity. The user can then have INVIZIAN place a circular glyph around the surfaces to indicate group (Fig. 4, bottom) and store these groupings for later recall (Fig. 5) .\nINVIZIAN also provides a \"top-down\" or coordinated viewing window for the entire set of data which is linked to user mouse movements. When the user pans, zooms, or rotates, the projection renders a rectangle on top of a \"dot plot\", indicating the region of display currently occupying the view. The coordinated projection frees the user of either memorizing subject placements, or having to continually zoom out to reorient the view, subject-to-subject relationships. Examples of coordinated projection sub-plots can be seen in Figs. 5 and 9.\nFor the interested reader, an example data set for use in exploring INVIZIAN is available by contacting the corresponding author."}, {"section_title": "Use case: Graphical informatics applied to examining Alzheimer's disease", "text": "In order to illustrate how the INVIZIAN framework can be utilized to conduct exploratory analyses on neuroimaging Clicking with the mouse on any cortical surface within INVIZIAN displays this metadata dialogue containing subject-specific information including the subject's age, sex, weight and (by scrolling down in the window shown) diagnostic MRI information. Having the maximum resolution cortical surface rendering available allows the user to dynamically interact with and precisely examine the cortical detail for any selected subject data, we describe an example of the interaction with neuroimaging data from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), those having Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and an otherwise set of older healthy subjects. We specifically chose this demonstration due to the well-known observation that AD has significant alterations in brain cortical morphometry, in particular, the atrophic effects of AD on hippocampal anatomy (Jack et al. 2008 ).\nSubjects The neuroimaging datasets used consisted of a set of 120 MRI volumetric images (MPRAGE) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http:// Fig. 4 Highlighting the subjects matching a search expression: As the subject-specific cortical surfaces are arranged in a featuresimilarity dependent manner, the immediate graphical indication of results from a user-provided search illustrates a putative association between neuroanatomy and the subject metadata. (Top) Based on query results the user may define named groups, also assigning a group color, and optional description. (Bottom) INVIZIAN indicates group membership with a circular glyph which allows the user to view surface characteristics and group membership simultaneously www.adni-info.org/) cohort maintained at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at the University of California Los Angeles. Data belonging to 40 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 40 mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects, and 40 healthy, otherwise normal control (NC) subjects were identified. Each group had a mean age of 76 years.\nData pre-processing All the MRI images underwent skull stripping and further processing for cortical surface extraction using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) via a LONI Pipeline (Dinov et al. 2009 ) data processing workflow from which the cortex was parcellated into 34 regions, and volumetric feature values such as gray matter thickness, volume and surface area were determined. Using these metrics as regional feature vectors, we computed pair-wise probabilistic difference measurements -the Jensen-Shannon divergencebetween each pair of concordant regions, integrated over all region-pairs, to compute subject-by-subject \"distances\" (Joshi et al. 2011) . The Jensen-Shannon divergence is an information theoretical metric of (dis)similarity which has been used in medical image processing (Iglesias et al. 2011 , Lu et al. 2012 , biomarker discovery for cancer (Berretta and Moscato 2010) , genetics (Chen et al. 2013) , as well as text mining (Sasahara et al. 2013) . It has been used successfully in morphological analysis of neuroimaging data (Guo et al. 2005) . However, other measures of relative distance between subjects would be possible to reflect different aspects of data (dis)similarity suitable for various pattern recognition techniques (see for instance, Kuriakose et al. 2004 , Xu et al. 2006 .\nOnce this matrix of NxN subject-by-subject distances was obtained, we utilized classical MDS (Kruskal and Wish 1978, Chen et al. 2008) to project the data in a lower dimensional space and determination of new subject-specific coordinates as discussed above. Each subject's brain surface was then positioned in the INVIZIAN interface at these newly derived coordinates. Incidentally, to enable other spatial arrangements of brain surfaces, any set of 2D or 3D sets of coordinates can be utilized for surface placement within INVIZIAN permitting planar, scatter cloud, or in any other configuration (e.g. helical, spherical, etc.) depending on the interests of the researcher."}, {"section_title": "Visualization of diagnostic trends using cortical features", "text": "In the following subsections we illustrate several examples for visualizing differences between AD patients and NC subjects and making predictive inferences that might merit further examination of the data under more formal analytic frameworks.\nCortical gray matter thickness Gray matter thickness was measured as the mean distance from the gray matter/ cerebrospinal fluid interface to the gray/white matter surface, and vice versa. Figure 6 (left) shows the color map subdivided into quintiles used to map colors to the (0 to 5 mm) thickness valued features on the cortical surface. Figure 6 (middle) shows all 120 subjects colored according to thickness. Simple visual examination indicates that there is a general trend of colors from more blue on the left, to more red and yellow on the right. This describes the subjects having large thickness deficits on the left that gradually improve toward the right. Using the query input dialogue box, it can be quickly seen that that the subjects towards the left are the AD patients, while the subjects on the right are NC subjects. Utilizing the grouping functionality of INVIZIAN, Fig. 6 (right) shows the subjects grouped according to diagnosis meta-data value, with red glyphs representing patients with an AD value, and blue glyphs representing subjects with an NC value.\nCortical gray matter volume Gray matter volume was defined as the product of the thickness and the area of the surface layer midway between the gray/CSF and white/gray matter boundaries. Following identical steps discussed above for the rendering and display of cortical thickness we find a similar distribution of the subjects based on cortical volume. Figure 7 (left) illustrates the color mapping of volumetric feature values on the brain surfaces. Based upon the feature distribution and the query and grouping tool, Fig. 7 (middle) shows the subjects grouped according to the categories AD (red glyphs) and NC (blue glyphs). However, from observing the group clustering, it can be noted that many subjects with differing diagnosis are in overlapping clusters in contrast to the clearer separation seen when considering the distributions of cortical thickness. This clustering hints that there is a slightly decreased discriminatory capability of gray matter volume as a feature as compared to cortical thickness.\nCortical gray matter surface area Lastly, an average surface area measurement was calculated at each point on the cortical surface mesh through a processing of averaging over the areas of those adjacent triangles including that point. Displaying these color mapped brain surfaces illustrates a further reduced discriminating ability as illustrated in Fig. 8 . This is also evident observing the color-coded distribution of the area on the individual cortical surfaces. Little variation of surface area is present locally on the individual cortical surfaces as well as globally throughout the population.\nVisualization of local structural features The diagnostic trend findings illustrated above focus on global feature patterns in the population. To gain a better understanding of the local structural changes due to the disease, we use the coordinated projection to zoom in on a neighborhood of brains that share similar feature characteristics. Figure 9 (left) shows an image of the zoomed-in view of the brain surfaces from AD patients (red dots in the coordinated projection plot), while Figures 9 (right) is a zoomed-in view of the NC subjects (blue dots in the coordinated projection plot). From the two side-by-side views one can compare the detailed cortical structure and immediately appreciate the localized thickness deficits along the cortex. In the case of AD patients, there is a representing AD (Alzheimer's Disease) and blue representing NC (Normal Control). The slightly overlapped groupings indicate that gray matter volume has a reduced predictive power relative to cortical thickness for Alzheimer's disease noticeable decrease in cortical thickness overall, and particularly in the frontal, temporal, and some portions of the parietal cortex."}, {"section_title": "Implications of results", "text": "From visualizing this collection of cortical surface data in INVIZIAN, a user can rapidly examine the properties of the data itself to derive potentially valuable neuroscientific inferences. In regard to the use-case example illustrated here, we list them succinctly as follows:\n& Cortical thickness is likely to be the best predictor of Alzheimer's Disease in the observed population sample. & Although thickness and volume are proportionally related in the cortex, the spatial variation of thickness appears to follow a different distribution compared to regional volume. This may be due to the fact that regional boundaries vary widely from subject to subject. & Consequently, volume has a lower predictive effect for disease compared to thickness. & Surface area values do not provide a trend one way or the other with regard to AD. & While it is understood that the human cortex is thinner in the granular post-central gyrus region, which is apparent graphically for both AD and NC subjects, the AD subjects also show region-specific atrophy particularly in the frontal, temporal and to some extent parietal regions.\nAlthough the data processing was computationally the most expensive task (in excess of a few hours using an 800 CPU cluster grid), followed by feature display and analysis, the entire visualization process consisting of loading the processed data to reaching the above conclusions can be performed in a matter of a few minutes. The case studies demonstrate that INVIZIAN can be successfully used by researchers for visualizing database con exploratory analyses using visual tools."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this paper we sought to illustrate how the INVIZIAN system can be used for exploring distributions of neuroanatomical feature and subject metadata values across a collection of brain surfaces drawn from databases containing patients with age-related disease. This graphical informatics system employs a dynamic and interactive approach for mining largescale neuroimaging data, allowing the user to discover suggestive relationships between cortical surface feature and meta-data attribute values. This approach builds on pairwise distance calculations and decomposition of dataset features and uses the extracted brain surfaces to create a visualization environment intuitive to users of existing neuroimaging applications. Utilizing a multi-resolution mesh display, the system provides an exploratory visual overview of the data. The display environment anchors query-based grouping of clusters and feature-wise coloring for visual exploration of neuroanatomically similar groups. A collection of coordinated projections and graphical exploratory data analysis tools help the user keep track of global relationships with the data collection while they inspect and examine detailed local cortical structure. All in all, INVIZIAN provides a unique way to visually inspect, explore, and assess collections of data from large-scale databases.\nWe wish to emphasize that INVIZIAN is not meant to compete with nor replace a more formal statistical analytic treatment of the data. Though this may appear to be a limitation of this approach when, rather, the opposite is the case. INVIZIAN can be used as a useful precursor to explore, mine, and perform basic meta-analyses of neuroimaging archives as a way to generate new hypotheses about the data that might not have been apparent through narrative description of their collection, the samples in question, or previously described effects. Image-centric databases for neuroscience (Bug and Nissanov 2003) will require such tools to move beyond the limits of text-only searches and more readily take advantage of image content. The present situation with neuroimaging archives is not too dissimilar that Fig. 9 A comparison of subjects cortical attributes. Left, the quintile based color mapping of cortical thickness is coded in example AD patients, while, on the right, healthy control subjects are displayed using the same color scaling of satellite imagery and space science telescope databases which found particular utility when their content was re-factored from a catalogue-based system to one driven specifically by what the images contain. Noteworthy examples of this include Microsoft's World Wide Telescope (http://www.worldwidetelescope.org; see also Szalay and Gray 2001) and, of course, Google Earth (http:// www.google.com/earth).\nAs we develop the INVIZIAN further we will examine methods for visualizing multiple brain surface features per scene. For example, it would be of benefit to color the mesh data based on combinations of feature values. We will make the dimension reduction and offset generation system available interactively during runtime. We will also generalize the methods used to calculate the cortical surface coordinates by incorporating user-selected metadata attributes. While entirely feasible, there is a challenge in maintaining a suitable interface which is intuitive and not overly abstract to the user. Further evaluations will include what distance metrics lend themselves to effective user-based visual comparison of MRI cortical surface data.\nIn conclusion, the Informatics Visualization for Neuroimaging (INVIZIAN) framework graphically displays image and meta-data information from sizeable collections of neuroimaging data as a whole using a dynamic and compelling user interface. While not a replacement for more formal statistical analysis, INVIZIAN provides a means for quickly assessing brain and meta-data relationships as a precursor to further data access and modeling. In our paper, we illustrate the utility of INVIZIAN for simultaneous exploration and mining a large collection of extracted cortical surface data arising in clinical neuroimaging studies of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment, as well as healthy control subjects. Specifically, we show how cortical thickness and hippocampal volume differences between groups are evident using probabilistic distance and multivariate decomposition even in the absence of more formal hypothesis testing. For neurological diseases linked to brain aging such as AD, as well as across the entire lifespan, INVIZIAN provides a unique means for considering the entirety of whole brain datasets, exploring interesting relationships among them, and, in so doing, deriving new ideas for further research and study."}]
