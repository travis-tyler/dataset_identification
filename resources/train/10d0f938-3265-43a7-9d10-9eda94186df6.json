The dataset includes a total 513 unique lipid species out of which 341 are known lipids. For over 95% of the detected lipids, a relative standard deviation of better than 20% was achieved in the quality control samples, indicating high technical reproducibility.

AD is a neurodegenerative disease that irreversibly destroys the normal ability of the brain to access memories and make decisions 1 , and the affected person becomes demented with a decreasing quality of life. The causes of the onset and progression of AD have not yet been identified but differ from normal aging. While AD is associated with the presence of tau neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques in the post-mortem brain [2] [3] [4] , many other changes in both central and peripheral physiology have been linked to the disease 5 . Previous research suggests that the disruption of lipid metabolism is part of the pathophysiology of AD 6 . Lipids have clear roles in amyloidogenesis, neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, all thought to be tied to AD progression. Both central and peripheral lipid metabolism is altered in AD subjects and lipid metabolites in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood may provide information on the metabolic pathways contributing to AD pathophysiology.\nWhile tau and A\u03b2 plaques are prominent among the recognized AD markers 7, 8 , it is important to identify other biochemical changes which are related to disease development and progression. By identifying changes in other biological pathways associated with AD 9 , we suggest new targets to treat or biomarkers to diagnose this disease. Our limited understanding of AD is one of the main reasons that we cannot stop the progression of this disease 10 . Identification of biomarker and druggable target specific genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms may help to prevent AD progression. However, results have been unsatisfying to date 11, 12 . Progress in analytical chemistry now allows for the rapid and reproducible screen for hundreds of lipid molecules from triacylglycerol, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl esters, fatty acids and other lipid classes 13 , now referred to as lipidomics [13] [14] [15] . Lipidomics has been frequently used to associate blood lipid changes with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, depression and AD 6, 16 . Today, up to 800 different lipid molecules can be measured in human blood using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry 17, 18 . Lipids are a major chemical group that contributes significantly to the brain functioning 19 . A range of studies suggest the role of hypometabolism in the progression of AD [20] [21] [22] . Diabetes and insulin resistance also increase the risk of AD in older age [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Therefore, we hypothesized that the onset of AD may be associated with body's lipid metabolism. To test this hypothesis, blood lipid's levels can be used to link the lipid metabolism with AD. Previous studies support this hypothesis [29] [30] [31] , but evidence needs to be validated and solidified for specific lipid classes. The link of blood lipids with onset and progression of AD needs to be tested in large epidemiological studies so that the effect of confounding factors such as aging, medication and gender can be taken into account while investigating the associations of AD with lipids.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was initiated in 2004 to facilitate the validation of biomarkers for clinical studies on AD 32 . ADNI 32, 33 provides a unified online platform to researchers around the globe so that they can define the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The platform enables the collection, validation and use of data such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography images, genetics, cognitive tests, cerebral spinal fluid and blood biomarkers from thousands of individuals as predictors for the disease 34 . A targeted metabolomics of ADNI1 cohort serum specimens has been completed using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit 35 . In the dataset, 121 lipids species were measured using the flow-injection analysis-MS/MS and were reported using their semiquantitative intensities. The biocrates targeted method quantifies four lipid classes -acyl carnitines, lyso phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins using the direction flow ionization mass spectrometry. This analytical method suffers by the presence of isomeric lipid species in the sample therefore one signal can represent several lipid species. Whereas a liquid chromatography (LC) based separation can separate these isomeric lipid species and give multiple signals. In the presented data descriptor, up to 13 lipid classes including triacylglycerols, ceramides, phosphoethanolamine, lysophosphoethanolamine phosphoinositols, glyceroceramides, diacylglycerols, cholesterol esters were covered. Several lipids in these classes are not covered by other biochemical datasets available at the ADNI website 35 . For many lipids we have the acyl chain information available using their MS/MS spectra. For this consortium, a comprehensive and untargeted lipidomics dataset is presented here for the study the association body's lipid metabolism with AD and its clinical features. The NIH-West Coast Metabolomics Center has developed a liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based lipidomics assay of blood specimens [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Here, we used a UHPLC-QTOF mass spectrometer to detect, identify and measure lipids in blood samples from 806 individuals from the ADNI study and describe the details of the samples preparation, data generation, quality controls, data filtering and normalization. The ADNI repository hosts the whole genome sequencing, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, genotyping array, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography scans, blood and cerebrospinal fluid protein and peptide biomarker panel, medication use, anthropometric measurements, metabolomics and cognitive measurements for the recruited participants. The primary use to the data descriptor is to discover associations between serum lipid levels and these available information from the ADNI repository. To find these associations, linear or logistic regression models need to be computed while adjusting for key confounding variables such as age, gender or body mass index. Significant associations may indicate which lipid metabolic pathways can be implicated in the AD etiology."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort", "text": "The ADNI data repository (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/) supplied all the demographic information, neuropsychological and clinical assessment data, and diagnostic information used for this study and this information has been published previously 5 .

Data were acquired using a single charged surface hybrid 2.1 mm id \u00d7 100 mm length, 1.7 \u03bcm particle C 18 column (Waters). The mass spectrometer was tuned before each batch as per the vendor's instructions using Agilent tune mix (mass resolving power~10,000 Full width at half maximum (FWHM) and~20,000 FWHM for the Agilent 6530 and 6550, respectively). A reference solution of purine and HP-0921 (m/z 121.0509, m/z 922.0098 in electrospray ionization (ESI) ( + ) and m/z 119.0360 and m/z 980.0164 (acetate adducts) in ESI(-)) was used to correct small mass drifts during the acquisition. Mobile phase A (60:40 ACN:water + 10 mM ammonium formate + 0.1% formic acid) was prepared by mixing 600 mL ACN, 400 mL water, 1 mL formic acid and 630 mg of ammonium formate. Mobile phase B solvent (90:10 IPA:ACN + 10 mM ammonium formate + 0.1% formic acid) was prepared by mixing 900 mL IPA, 100 mL acetonitrile, 1 mL formic acid, 630 mg ammonium formate previously dissolved in 1 mL of H 2 O.

Before starting each batch of sample analyses, one empty injection, five solvent injections (MeOH/toluene 9:1 with CUDA internal standard), two extraction blanks and two Bioreclamation pool plasma samples were injected. Instrument performance was monitored for column backpressure and signal intensities of the reference compounds. The quadrupole/time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometers are operated with electrospray ionization (ESI) performing full scan in the mass range m/z 65-1700 in positive (Agilent 6530, equipped with a JetStreamSource) and negative (Agilent 6550, equipped with a dual JetStream Source) modes producing both unique and complementary spectra. Instrument parameters were as follows for the ESI ( + ) mode -gas temperature 325\u00b0C, gas flow 8 l/min, nebulizer 35 psig, sheath gas temperature 350\u00b0C, sheath gas flow 11, capillary voltage 3500 V, nozzle voltage 1000 V, fragmentor voltage 120 V and skimmer 65 V.

In this database, annotated lipids are associated with retention time, adducts, m/z value and InChiKeys, verified by accurate mass, isotope ratio, retention time and MS/MS spectra matching to either commercial lipid standards or to the LipidBlast library 42 . In the database, ESI positive mode had 515 m/z values and ESI negative mode had 457 m/z values. Table 3 "}, {"section_title": "LC-MS data processing", "text": "Using the ion database as a targeted list, we have extracted the ion chromatograms (EICs) for all the m/z values using the Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis (7.0) software. We have used a targeted signal extraction strategy for the study. Find by formula (FBF) method in the Agilent Mass Hunter software was used only for extracting ion chromatograms for the m/z values provided in the ion database. We have extracted ion chromatograph for 1 min before and after the expected retention time for each m/z value. Since the database already had adduct information, 'no adduct' parameter was chosen in FBF settings and only m/z values were used. EICs were used later to obtain the peak height values for lipids. No peak smoothing and integration method was applied to the EICs. The ion database had retention time information that exactly where the peak maxima for a lipid m/z value is so we have extracted peak maxima for each peak at the corresponding retention time. + . All the EICs are provided at the LONI database. Using the Agilent DA Reprocessor offline utility tool, the method was applied to all the raw LCMS data files (.d) in a batch mode. Data processing method files are provided in the data record (adni1-qual-method.zip). The output CSV files are provided in the data record (adni1-lipidomics-eics.zip) in Data Citation 3. These files contain intensities of the ions over the retention time range (retention time \u00b1 1.0 min) for each m/z value from the target database. These CSV files were imported into R software for further data processing. First the retention time of the internal standard were obtained for each sample. A retention time window of 0.2 min was used for finding the peaks for internal standards. Observed retention times for the internal standards were determined by finding the time point at which the intensity of the m/z value was maximum within the retention time range. A polynomial regression of second order (quadratic) curve was fitted between the expected and observed retention times of the internal standards. The retention times of the remaining compounds in the target database were recalibrated using the regression model. The updated retention times were used with a window of 0.20 min for each metabolite to extract the m/z intensities values belonging to that ion from the CSV files. Maximum intensity values within the retention time window were used as the peak height of the target compounds. Extracted targeted peaks for each sample were exported as .txt files. These files were imported into R and merged to form the raw lipidomics dataset. The signal-to-noise ratio was calculated by dividing the detected peak height of a lipid by the median of ion intensities within the retention time range for the m/z value of that lipid. Next, data were first normalized using the LOESS algorithm to remove trends and drifts in the data set within each batch for each individual lipid. Then, a median normalization was applied across all the batches. In order to prevent overfitting, the degree of smoothing for each LOESS curve was determined using leave-one-out cross validation. We used a 5-fold cross validated relative standard deviation (RSD) of the QC samples to measure the performance of the normalization procedure. The scatter plots of the injection order and the signal intensity for individual lipids and the principal component analysis plots of the overall dataset before and after the LOESS correction are provided in the data record(\"adni1_loess_results.zip\") Raw LC-MS data were acquired in an untargeted fashion and have been made available through LONI's data repository. A targeted signal extraction strategy was used to generate the lipidomics data matrix. First, ion profiles for all m/z values, 515 in ESI( + ) mode and 457 in ESI(-) mode were extracted from the raw LC-MS data files. For several lipids, more than two ions representing multiple adducts were extracted in both ESI positive and negative modes. Then a data filtering pipeline was used to select one adduct for each lipid with the lowest technical variance in the quality control samples. For example, if lipid X has two adducts (a1 + , a2 + ) in ESI( + ) and two (a1-, a2-) in ESI(-) modes. First, one adduct in each mode was selected using the lowest QC RSD criteria. For example, a1 + and a2-were selected. Then it was determined which one of these two has lowest RSD in QC samples and that was included into the final data matrix and the data dictionary. And if lipid Y has one adduct (a1 + ) in ESI( + ) and one (a1-) in ESI(-) modes. For this, it was determined which one of these two has lowest RSD in QC samples. Peak heights of those selected ions were used as a measurement for lipid species in one ionization mode. After filtering out multiple adducts for the same lipid, a total 367 entries in ESI ( + ) and 280 entries in ESI ( \u2212 ) modes files were remained. A total 98 lipids were detected in both modes. To minimize the penalty for multiple hypothesis testing while calculating false discovery rates for regression modelling, duplicate entries for lipids were removed by using the relative standard deviation in the quality control samples. An entry with lowest RSD should be selected for lipids having duplicate entries in the dataset. We have also computed the spearman correlation between peak heights values in both modes for lipids. Out of the total 98 duplicate detection in both mode, 80 (81%) showed a correlation of 0.80 or more, indicating that the pairs belong to same lipid species and have good quality data in both modes. The lower correlation for rest of 12 pairs can be attributed to poor detection in one ionization mode or presence of isomers. Therefore, we have used the RSD in QC samples for all these pairs to decide which lipid should be included in the data matrix that is ready for statistical analysis. Final data matrix had 513 unique lipids species out of which 341 were known lipids and 172 were known unknowns. This final dataset is provided in the data record (ADMC_ADNI1_LIPIDOMICS.csv) in Data Citation 4. Details about the measured lipid species are provided in the data record (ADNI_ADMCLIPIDOMICS_DICT.csv). Raw input matrices for ESI ( \u2212 ) and ESI ( + ) modes and intermediate matrices during the data filtering and merging steps have been provided in the data record (data_processing_matrices.zip). The R-script file describes the steps at which these files were generated during the data processing. Untargeted lipidomics assays allow a broad survey of lipid classes and changes in their levels. In these assays, lipid's chromatography peak height or integrated peak area represents its levels in a sample 38, 43, 44 . As pure chemical standards for every detected lipids species in an untargeted assay are not commercially available, it is not feasible to precisely estimate the absolute molar concentrations of them, therefore, peak heights are used for creating lipidomics data matrices. Statistical analyses of those peak heights across study samples identifies the significant lipid species that associate with an outcome of interest 45 . Use of the QC based LOESS normalization method removed the batch effect in this study so that samples can be compared for statistical purposes within the study. So if a compound has a mean peak height of 25,000 in a disease group and a mean peak height of 75,000 in a control group, these values can reliably be used to determine a 3 fold decrease in levels of the compound in the disease group in comparison to the control group. Since internal standard for every measured lipids are not available, it is not possible to precisely assess the signal linearity or concentration ranges for every lipid. Nevertheless, the Agilent 6530 and 6550 UHPLC-QTOF instruments that were used in the study have a linear dynamic range of up to 3 orders of magnitude. This range can provide reliable signals to identify up to a 100 fold decrease or increase in the levels of a majority of lipids, for example a mean peak height of 25,000 in cases versus 2,500,000 in control samples. Peak height of one compound can only be used to compare its level across samples, it cannot be compared with another compound's peak height due to different ionization efficiency. For example, if lipid A has a peak height of 25,000 and lipid B has 50,000, this does not mean that lipid B is two times more than lipid A. It is needed that the data matrix need to be scaled and transformed according to the statistical analyses.\nReversed-phase LC column with C18 sorbent and gradient separate lipid species by lipophilicity, thus, it can separate two chemically different lipids even with same mass. However it cannot separate two lipids species having same lipophilicity and mass values. In this case MS/MS spectra collected for particular peak can inform if the peak consists of one or more co-eluting compounds. , depending on the acyl chains. These isomers may elute at the same time and thus provide just a single peak. To confirm the purity of such peaks, MS/MS spectra were collected for each lipid species and we have confirmed that up to 70% of the peaks have only one lipid species as per matching their MS/MS spectra against LipidBlast library. NIST MS Search software was used to search the MS/MS spectra against LipidBlast library and then each spectrum was manually checked. TG (48:0) has a clean MS/MS spectrum and we have confirmed that it is TG (16:0/16:0/16:0). Rest 30% of the peaks showed mix MS/MS spectra with multiple isobaric lipid possibilities, and for them we have selected the most abundant acyl chains in the MS/MS spectra as acyl chain annotation. Because acyl chain's sn position could not be determined for several lipids, the naming convention uses \"_\" instead of \"/\" for the lipids with multiple acyl chains in the lipidomics dataset."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Principal component analysis, paired t-test, histogram and calculations of relative standards deviations were performed in the R programming language version 3.4.0.\nCode availability R script to generate the lipidomics dataset from the extracted ion chromatograms is provided in data record (adni1-lipidomics-script.r)."}, {"section_title": "Data records", "text": "The primary access site for this dataset is through Sage Bionetworks' Synapse platform: https://www. synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn9993525.

First, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of the lipidomics dataset to test for overall lipid and sample variance, for example, to screen for outliers. The PCA score plot showed a larger-variance cluster of human cohort samples and a small-variance cluster of Bioreclamation QC samples (Fig. 2) . Of the total variance, 95% was explained by the difference between these two clusters in principal component 1, compared to only 1.2% variance by the next-most important vector, principal component 2. Analysis of sample groups by further principal components did not reveal any impact of batch effects or injection time points, showing that this data set does not contain major injection bias error or other hidden bias groups.\nTo calculate the quality of the dataset generated by the lipidomics workflow, we computed the relative standard deviations of the intensity levels of the internal standards, as these were not used in the normalization scheme. Fig. 3 shows these values for positive and negative electrospray ionization modes before and after LOESS normalization. All internal standards showed reproducibility better than 20% RSD, proving that the data acquisition and data processing method has produced a high-quality lipidomics dataset.\nTo show the technical reproducibility of the lipidomics assay, we have accessed the RSDs of measured lipids in the QC samples. Levels of high quality lipids should not change much in quality control samples, providing evidence our data processing methods are robust and reproducible. Fig. 4 shows the histogram of these RSDs. In the same manner as the internal standards (Fig. 3) , we see that more than 95% of all lipid species were detected at a reproducibility of better than 20% in the QC samples, highlighting the excellent quality of the data. Consequently, we removed lipids from the data set that showed technical errors of more than 25% RSD. Finally, a paired t-test analysis of the replicated samples (n = 20) shows that up to 80% of the lipid species were not significantly different (p > 0.05), showing the removal of the batch effect by the data processing pipeline and the low analytical variability in this dataset.
