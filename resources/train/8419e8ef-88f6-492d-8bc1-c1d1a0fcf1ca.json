We evaluated Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b52 and \u03b54 allele frequencies across biomarker definitions-A\u03b2-/ND-(n = 268), A\u03b2+/ND-(n = 236), A\u03b2-/ND+ or SNAP (n = 78), A\u03b2+/ND+ (n = 204)-hypothesizing that SNAP would have an APOE profile comparable to A\u03b2-/ND-. Using AD Neuroimaging Initiative data (n = 786, 72\u00b17 years, 48% female), amyloid status (A\u03b2+ or A\u03b2-) was defined by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2-42 levels, and neurodegeneration status (ND+ or ND-) was defined by hippocampal volume from MRI. Binary logistic regression related biomarker status to APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54 allele carrier status, adjusting for age, sex, education, and cognitive diagnosis. Compared to the biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-) participants, higher proportions of \u03b54 and lower proportions of \u03b52 carriers were observed among A\u03b2+/ND-(\u03b54: OR = 6.23, p<0.001; \u03b52: OR = 0.53, p = 0.03) and A\u03b2+/ND+ participants (\u03b54: OR = 12.07, p<0.001; \u03b52: OR = 0.29, p = 0.004). SNAP participants were statistically comparable to biomarker negative participants (p-values>0.30). In supplemental analyses, comparable results were observed when coding SNAP using amyloid imaging and when using CSF tau levels. In contrast to APOE, a polygenic risk score for AD that excluded APOE did not show an association with amyloidosis or neurodegeneration (p-values>0.15), but did show an association with SNAP defined using CSF tau (\u03b2 = 0.004, p = 0.02). Thus, in a population with low levels of cerebrovascular disease and a lower prevalence of SNAP than the general population, APOE and known genetic drivers of AD do not appear to contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in SNAP. Additional work in population based samples is needed to better elucidate the genetic contributors to various etiological drivers of SNAP."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by a long preclinical stage in which the pathophysiology has evolved but clinical symptoms are not yet present. The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Workgroup established preclinical AD criteria for research based on biomarkers of \u03b2-amyloidosis and neurodegeneration [1] . These criteria led to the subsequent identification of a subset of individuals labeled with suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) due to biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration without \u03b2-amyloidosis. SNAP does not align with the leading theoretical progression of dynamic biomarkers during preclinical AD in which \u03b2-amyloidosis evidence appears first, followed by neurodegeneration [2] Among cognitively normal older adults, both SNAP and amyloid positive profiles are associated with worse cognitive trajectories when compared to biomarker negative individuals, but the fastest rate of decline is observed in individuals who are positive for markers of both amyloid and neurodegeneration [3] . Among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of dementia, SNAP is associated with increased risk of progressive cognitive decline [4] , smaller cortical volume [5] , and higher burden of white matter hyperintensities [5] compared to biomarker negative peers. In contrast, when compared to individuals with evidence of both \u03b2-amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, SNAP appears to be less likely to progress to clinical AD [6, 7] . Moreover, there is inconsistent evidence of clinical progression among SNAP individuals who are cognitively normal at baseline, with some studies reporting very low conversion rates [6, 8] .\nRecent genetic exploration of these biomarker groups suggests the frequency of the APOE \u03b54 genotype (a genetic susceptibility risk factor for AD) may be lower in SNAP when compared to amyloid positive or amyloid positive/neurodegeneration positive groups [4] . This finding suggests that the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline observed in SNAP may have a unique etiology that is not linked to APOE. In addition to the \u03b54 effect, it is well known that the APOE \u03b52 allele is protective against AD [9] . Such a protective role may be due to lower levels of AD neuropathology among carriers of the \u03b52 allele [10] , although work in the oldest old has suggested \u03b52 is associated with preserved cognition but high levels of neuropathology [11] . Additionally, studies of the possible underlying neuropathologies of SNAP, including tangle predominant dementia [12] , cerebrovascular disease [13] , and argyrophilic grain disease [14] , have highlighted an increase in disease risk among APOE \u03b52 allele carriers. Biomarker groups based on the preclinical AD criteria thus provide a tremendous opportunity to better understand the association between APOE and biomarkers of AD neuropathology and neurodegeneration.\nThis study assesses the frequency of all APOE alleles across biomarker groups among individuals diagnosed with normal cognition and MCI. We hypothesize that the APOE effect will be specific to the AD cascade [15] , such that when compared to biomarker negative participants, we will observe higher frequencies of the APOE \u03b54 allele and lower frequencies of the \u03b52 allele among the amyloid positive participants and among the biomarker (both amyloid and neurodegeneration) positive participants but not among the SNAP participants."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Participants were selected from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

NC and MCI group comparisons were completed using \u03c7 2 for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Unadjusted differences in APOE genotype frequencies were evaluated across all biomarker groups using \u03c7 2 . Next, two binary logistic regression models assessed differences between the A\u03b2-/ND-group and the three remaining biomarker groups (i.e., A\u03b2+/ND-, A\u03b2-/ND+ [SNAP], and A\u03b2+/ND+), adjusting for age, sex, education, and cognitive diagnosis. In the first logistic regression model, APOE \u03b54 carrier status was set as the binary outcome (carriers = \u03b52/\u03b54, \u03b53/ \u03b54, \u03b54/\u03b54 versus non-carriers = \u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b53). In the second logistic regression analysis, APOE \u03b52 carrier status was set as the binary outcome (carriers = \u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b52/\u03b54 versus non-carriers = \u03b53/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b54, \u03b54/\u03b54). Finally, using two separate \u03c7 2 tests, post-hoc pairwise comparisons restricted to the groups carrying at least one AD biomarker evaluated differences in APOE frequency between SNAP and each of the other two biomarker positive groups (A\u03b2 +/ND-and A\u03b2+/ND+). In all analyses, significance was set a priori as \u03b1 = 0.05. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure for the 6 planned statistical comparisons from our primary analyses (corrected-\u03b1 = 0.008). Supplemental analyses were run to test the impact of diagnostic status on our results and to evaluate differences when defining SNAP based on CSF tau levels rather than hippocampal volume. First, we evaluated biomarker group x diagnosis interactions on APOE \u03b52 carrier status and \u03b54 carrier status separately using the same logistic regression models outlined above. Second, we re-ran all analyses stratified by diagnosis, including logistic models and post-hoc \u03c7 2 tests. Third, we re-ran primary analyses removing individuals with the \u03b52/\u03b54 genotype to ensure these individuals were not driving group results. Fourth, we re-ran primary analyses using CSF tau biomarker levels based on a previously established cut-point (CSF tau!93 pg/ mL; [23] . Fifth, we repeated primary analyses covarying for white-matter hyperintensity burden quantified from 3D axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images collected as part of the ADNI-2 protocol and quantified using an established pipeline that has been reported in detail elsewhere [25] . Total white-matter hyperintensity volume was entered into logistic models as a continuous covariate, and we evaluated whether effects persisted when including this covariate. Finally, given potential concerns over batch effects for CSF and scanner effects for MRI, we chose to recalculate all biomarker groups using previously processed PET florbetapir data [26] to define amyloid positivity and restricted MRI data to 3T images from ADNI2/GO. Finally, additional analyses were run leveraging a polygenic risk score (PGRS) of AD based on the top 21 loci from the Lambert et al. meta-analysis [27] . All ADNI genotype data were imputed to the HRC reference panel and genetic processing was performed using PLINK (version 1.9) [28] . Quality control steps excluded SNPs with a minor allele frequency < 1%, with a genotyping rate < 99%, and out of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p<0.000001). Risk scores were calculated using the score function in PLINK. The association between PGRS was regressed on age, sex, diagnostic group, and biomarker group. One analysis was run using biomarker group defined using neurodegeneration definitions, and one analysis was run using CSF tau definitions."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The distribution of biomarker groups differed between NC and MCI participants (\u03c7 2 (3) = 104, p<0.001). While the frequency of A\u03b2+/ND-(33% in NC, 28% in MCI) and SNAP (10% in both NC and MCI) were comparable between groups, the NC group showed a higher frequency of A\u03b2-/ND-(50% in NC, 24% in MCI) and a lower frequency of A\u03b2+/ND+ (8% in NC, 38% in MCI).\nThere was an unadjusted difference in the distribution of APOE genotypes across biomarker groups (\u03c7 2 (15) = 179, p<0.001, see Fig 1) , which appears secondary to group differences in both \u03b54 (\u03c7 2 (3) = 147, p<0.001) and \u03b52 allele frequencies (\u03c7 2 (3) = 20, p<0.001). In fully adjusted models, the A\u03b2+/ND-and A\u03b2+/ND+ groups presented less frequently with the APOE \u03b52 allele compared to the A\u03b2-/ND-group (p-values<0.03), whereas the \u03b52 frequency was similar between SNAP and A\u03b2-/ND-(p = 0.97). Only the difference in \u03b52 frequency between A\u03b2+/ND+ and A\u03b2-/ND-survived correction for multiple comparisons.

See Table 2 for details.\nPairwise comparisons between the biomarker-positive groups (i.e., A\u03b2+/ND-, SNAP, and A\u03b2+/ND+) suggest only the SNAP group differed from the A\u03b2+/ND+ group for the \u03b52 allele (p = 0.005). No other pairwise comparison for the \u03b52 allele reached statistical significance (pvalues>0.08). Regarding \u03b54 allele frequency, all groups differed from one another (pvalues<0.03).

As expected, we observed a lower \u03b52 allele frequency and a higher \u03b54 allele frequency in participants with evidence of amyloidosis (i.e., A\u03b2+/ND-and A\u03b2+/ND+) compared to biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-) participants. As hypothesized, we observed comparable APOE allele frequencies among participants with SNAP compared to participants who were biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-). These results add to growing evidence that SNAP is not driven by an APOE pathway and that the neurodegeneration that defines SNAP likely has a unique etiology that differs from AD. To our knowledge, our results are among the first to report the frequency of the APOE \u03b52 allele in biomarker groups used to define preclinical AD. We observed lower \u03b52 frequencies in the amyloidosis (A\u03b2+/ND-and A\u03b2+/ND+) groups compared to the biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ ND-) group, but we did not observe an \u03b52 frequency difference between the SNAP (A\u03b2-/ND+) and biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-) groups. In post-hoc pairwise comparisons, we observed a higher \u03b52 frequency in SNAP compared the biomarker positive (A\u03b2+/ND+) groups. As highlighted in the introduction, the APOE \u03b52 allele is particularly interesting to evaluate in the context of SNAP because it has a well-documented protective effect on AD pathology [10] , yet it has been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease [13] . Similarly, an increased frequency of APOE \u03b52 have been reported in argyrophilic grain disease [14] and hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy [29] , suggesting APOE \u03b52 may play a unique role in the non-AD pathological processes implicated in SNAP [4] . However, our findings suggest that, like the \u03b54 allele, the frequency of the \u03b52 allele is comparable to observations in biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-) individuals. Thus, while \u03b52 may protect against the AD cascade in SNAP, the similar frequency distribution in biomarker negative (A\u03b2-/ND-) and SNAP groups suggests \u03b52 is unlikely to contribute to the neuropathology underlying SNAP. That said, the low \u03b52 frequency in SNAP emphasizes the need for further exploration in larger datasets where subtle differences in \u03b52 between SNAP and biomarker negative participants may be more readily detectable.\nWe also observed expected differences in APOE \u03b54 frequency among biomarker groups consistent with previous work in both cognitively normal [3] and MCI [4] cohorts, suggesting the \u03b54 allele frequency is lower in participants with SNAP compared to amyloidosis (A\u03b2+/NDor A\u03b2+/ND+ [2, 30] The APOE \u03b54 allele is thought to promote risk for AD through an amyloid rather than tau pathway [31] , and the present results suggest that APOE \u03b54 does not exert a major effect in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration in SNAP. It is interesting to note that one of the primary hypothesized pathways of neurodegeneration in SNAP, hippocampal sclerosis (HS), also shows no association with APOE when AD neuropathology is not present in the brain [32] . Similarly, primary age-related tauopathy (PART) appears unrelated to APOE [33, 34] , although debate surrounds this issue [35] . The present results suggest that neither APOE \u03b52 nor \u03b54 alleles correspond to the neurodegeneration or tauopathy observed in SNAP. In contrast to PART and HS, there is some evidence of an association between arteriolosclerosis and APOE in the presence of amyloidosis [36] , and some evidence of an inverse association between APOE \u03b52 and markers of cerebrovascular disease relative to what is observed in AD [13] . Thus, there is a need in the field to more carefully characterize the underlying neuropathology of SNAP across cohorts to more fully elucidate risk and protective factors. The ADNI participant screening procedures included an exclusion for overt cerebrovascular disease, suggesting it may not be ideally suited to evaluate the contributions of genetic drivers of cerebrovascular disease within SNAP. This feature of the ADNI cohort leaves open the possibility that APOE may contribute to SNAP when the driven by a cerebrovascular etiology.\nIn supplemental analyses, we observed an association between SNAP groups defined using CSF tau levels and PGRS for AD, suggesting that while APOE does not appear related to SNAP, some of the genetic risk associated with clinical AD is relevant to tau even in the absence of amyloidosis (see Table K in S1 Supplemental Materials). These findings recapitulate the lack of association between CSF amyloid, baseline hippocampal volume, and PGRS in a previous ADNI publication [37] , although CSF tau was not evaluated in that manuscript. The patterns of association between PGRS and biomarker groups (that differs from the APOE association with biomarker groups) highlights the need to better understand the genetic architecture of the neuropathological features of AD, and characterize how genetic factors differentially drive the neuropathological and clinical progression in AD. The amount genetic overlap between AD and SNAP likely depends on the various etiologies that underlie SNAP. Regardless of etiology, however, we provide strong evidence that APOE is not associated with SNAP.\nPrevious reports of these biomarker groups in ADNI, both among individuals with normal cognition at baseline [38] and among individuals with MCI at baseline [4] , are consistent with the clinical and cognitive group differences we observed here (Table 3) . Specifically, we observed expected group differences in cognition, biomarker status, and hippocampal volume including marked differences in cognition and hippocampal volume among SNAP individuals compared to biomarker negative individuals. Given that some of the group differences between SNAP and biomarker negative individuals depend on the way SNAP is defined (e.g., CSF tau levels), it appears that moving toward a multi-biomarker diagnostic scheme accounting for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (e.g., the A/T/N classification [39] ) will more accurately characterize the neuropathology underlying SNAP. Unfortunately, we did not have a large enough sample size to fully evaluate APOE differences among the A/T/N groups. Larger sample sizes with biomarker and imaging data are needed to fully characterize the genetic etiology of these neuropathological processes.\nThese findings must be interpreted in the context of several known limitations of the ADNI dataset. The frequency of SNAP observed in the present analysis (10%) is notably lower than some previous reports of SNAP (25%) [3] . This discrepancy may be due in part to the fact that, as previously mentioned, ADNI underrepresents the burden of cerebrovascular disease among older adults given sample recruitment criteria (Hachinski score<4) and MRI contraindications. Importantly, SNAP is a particularly strong driver of MCI in population-based studies more accurately reflecting the mixed etiologies of age-related cognitive impairment. Thus, it will be critical to further assess the association between APOE and SNAP in more representative cohorts. There is also an over-representation of APOE \u03b54 carriers in ADNI, highlighting the need to further investigate the full breadth of APOE alleles in additional samples that better represent the frequency of SNAP and each APOE allele. The ADNI cohort is also enriched for White, highly educated individuals who do not reflect the general population of older adults. Larger and more representative samples are required to fully evaluate the role of APOE \u03b52 in SNAP and will likely require a meta-analysis across multiple datasets. Therefore, it is imperative that future SNAP studies report the full spectrum of APOE genotype to more easily facilitate cross-study evaluations of possible genetic effects. As previously mentioned, there is growing emphasis on biomarker definitions that combine a marker of amyloid, a marker of tau, and a marker of neurodegeneration, called the A/T/N scheme [39] . Additional work focusing on APOE genotype in these smaller sub-groups will require much larger sample sizes, but the present results leave open the possibility that \u03b52 may be involved in neuropathological processes that underlie a more specific non-amyloid sub group (A-/T+/N+, A-/T+/N-, or A-/ T-/N+).\nIn conclusion, this study is among the first to provide evidence that the APOE \u03b52 allele frequency is comparable between SNAP and biomarker negative individuals and adds to existing evidence [4] that the frequency of the APOE \u03b54 allele is lower in participants with SNAP. These results collectively suggest that any genetic etiology of neurodegeneration in SNAP is likely through a non-APOE pathway, further supporting the notion that SNAP represents a heterogeneous subset of older adults experiencing non-AD neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "Supporting information", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "S1 Supplemental Materials.
