For example, in organismic biology, brain volume (BV) provides one of the most tantalizing correlates of neural and behavioral complexity across animal species, including primates (Butler and Hodos 1996) ; in anthropology, BV and its closely related measure of intracranial volume (ICV) are key criteria for comparing extinct hominid species to one another and to modern humans (Prothero 2007 ). Studies of human cerebral volumetry and allometry, whether undertaken by neurobiologists, biomedical scientists or anthropologists, frequently rely on accurate knowledge of BV and ICV to compare healthy and diseased brains, and to monitor the temporal trajectories of BV across healthy and diseased populations (C. D. Smith et al. 2007 ).\nBV trajectories are of great interest in healthy aging, in neurodegenerative diseases-e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)-but also in other neurological conditions which may accelerate brain atrophy-e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Despite numerous past studies which quantified brain volumetrics in health and disease, identifying reliable reference values for these measures is not always straightforward. Importantly, BV varies considerably with age and sex, such that different researchers may require distinct normative statistics for their studies depending on the age and sex compositions of their samples (Cosgrove et al. 2007) . Although this variability has been extensively explored and well established (Gur et al. 2002; Rushton and Ankney 1996) , it can nevertheless be difficult to identify accurate reference statistics for BV due to several important limitations which are shared by many studies. Firstly, researchers may utilize vastly different techniques to assess brain volumetrics (in vivo neuroimaging, post mortem physical measurement, etc.) and their quantitation approaches may differ substantially, which can lead to substantial variability in measurement error across studies (S. M. Smith et al. 2001) . Secondly, many reports are based on samples of inadequate sizes and/or compositions, such that the natural variability of brain volumetrics as a function of age and sex has not been quantified satisfactorily. Thirdly, BV and related measures have been reported in a range of formats (tabulations, graphical representations, written narratives, etc.), expressed using a variety of physical units (cubic centimeters, liters, etc.) and manipulated algebraically in various ways (e.g., normalized with respect to ICV, averaged across ages or sexes, etc.), such that different studies' data may require careful and systematic inspection to ensure proper comparison and interpretation. Thus, brain volumetrics reported by different studies can vary substantially even when their statistics are obtained from samples with similar demographics. For these and other reasons, researchers often find it necessary to review the neuroscience literature very thoroughly to identify reports whose methodologies are congruent with one another's and whose aggregation can provide trustworthy volumetric estimates above and beyond what single studies can afford.\nThis investigation is a meta-analysis of research studies which utilized in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to infer human BV, ICV, gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV) and cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV) throughout adulthood. Two sets of results are presented: (A) the linear regression coefficient for each of these measures as a function of age, across the interval from age 20 to 70, and (B) the values of BV, GMV, WMV and CSFV at the ages of 20 (young age), 45 (middle age) and 70 (old age).\nMetrics are reported in tabular format to facilitate visual comparison of studies and to provide researchers with the ability to select reports which they deem to be most appropriate for their purposes. For each study listed, numerical values are reported by sex where available, and weighted grand averages are computed to summarize findings across studies. Guidelines are provided to facilitate appropriate use and interpretation of the results by the reader. Finally, recommendations are made to neuroimaging researchers so that future studies of brain volumetrics report results in ways which facilitate meta-analysis and unbiased comparison with other studies.

A scoping review was conducted using the formalism of Arksey & O'Malley (2005) .

Lemaitre et al. 2012; Peelle et al. 2012; Jancke et al. 2015; Blatter et al. 1995) and one had over 1000 participants (DeCarli et al. 2005 ). Studies were not found to be significantly heterogeneous when reporting BV ( = 0.29, > 0.99, = 0), GMV ( = 1.15, > 0.99, = 0) or WMV ( = 1.35, > 0.99, = 0), but were found to have mild heterogeneity when reporting CSFV ( = 15.49, > 0.22, = 0.23). The\nBegg-Mazumdar rank correlation ( = 0.12, > 0.67) did not provide significant indication of publication bias.\nRegression coefficients. Table 1 and Figure 1 (Peelle et al. 2012) . GMV was found to trend negatively with age (males: -0.43%; females: -0.36%; both sexes: -0.37%), and more so than WMV (males: -0.11%; females: -0.10%; both sexes: -0.10%).\nThe annual difference in CSFV was found to be smaller in males (1.93%) than in females (2.15%), although the computed difference is relatively small (0.22%). Furthermore, because both GMV and WMV were found to have more negative regression coefficients in males than in females, it is likely that the true slope of the CSFV trajectory as a function of age is steeper in males than in females. Table 1 suggests that the small difference observed between males and females is likely driven by the study of Good et al. (2001) , who reported a smaller regression coefficient for males than for females and whose sample size was relatively large compared to most of the other studies included. Average volumetrics. Studies reporting volumetrics were not found to be significantly heterogeneous ( = 16.11, > 0.71, = 0). The Begg-Mazumdar rank correlation ( = 0.09, > 0.70) failed to provide significant indication of publication bias. Table 2 reports the average volumes of BV, GMV, WMV and CSFV at the ages of 20, 45 and 70, as calculated over studies fitting the selection criteria of the analysis; for brevity, Figure 1 ICV was found to decrease very slightly as a function of age, and Table 2 indicates that this finding is consistent across studies. Average BV is found to vary from ~1,150 cm 3 at age 20 to ~1,116 cm 3 at age 45 and ~1,009 cm 3 at age 70. Similarly, GMV varies from ~692 cm 3 at age 20 to ~641 cm 3 at age 45 and to ~560 cm 3 at age 70. Average WMV is ~509 cm 3 at age 20, ~494 cm 3 at age 45 and ~457 cm 3 at age 70."}, {"section_title": "Cross", "text": "As expected, the trend is reversed for CSFV, which varies from ~159 cm 3 at age 20 to ~266 cm 3 at age 45 and to ~365 cm 3 at age 70. Consistently, average BV, GMV and WMV are larger for males than for females; the reverse is found for CSFV, as expected.\nKey studies. Several of the studies included in this meta-analysis deserve discussion due to their relatively large sample sizes or to their detailed study of volumetrics. One such study is that of Good et al. (2001) , who used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to calculate the brain volumetrics of 465 healthy adults aged 17-79 (265 males) based on T 1 -weighted MRIs (voxel size: 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). These authors found a negative trend of global GM with age ( \u2243 -0.24% per year across sexes, = 0.489, p < 0.0001), and a GM/WM fractional volume ratio of ~1.82 across sexes.\nFor CSF, the IV-normalized regression coefficient was positive, consistent with age-related increases in ventricular volume ( \u2243 0.65% per year, = 0.377, p < 0.0001). Overall, BV was found to decrease in both sexes ( \u2243 -0.25% per year, = 0.489, p < 0.0001). Usefully, Good et al. reported both absolute and ICV-corrected values, such that the confound of head size was accounted for in their analysis.\nNevertheless, their study had considerably more volunteers younger than 40, such that their results might reflect younger adults' volumetrics to a greater extent than other studies. Had the authors' sample been more balanced, the reported regression coefficients would have likely been more negative for GMV, WMV and BV, and more positive for CSFV. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Motivation. Important goals of brain aging research include identifying factors which affect brain senescence and atrophy, quantifying the extent to which these factors influence it, and understanding how. The relationship between volumetrics and age is thus essential when monitoring brain aging.\nAccurate assessment of human BV across adulthood is indispensable because, without reference values against which BV changes can be quantified, reliable quantification of disease-related brain tissue loss across adulthood-and especially during old age-is difficult to achieve. Thus, the availability of human BVs throughout adulthood is very important to both scientists and clinicians.\nRationale. BV is a metric of critical importance in imaging studies of neurodegeneration due to typical aging, or to conditions like AD, PD and TBI. Surprisingly, although numerous reports of brain volumetrics across the lifespan have been published, the uncertainty surrounding the important relationship between volumetrics and age remains substantial. Firstly, although the temporal trajectory of BV is modulated by sex, many reports have not studied this effect separately for men and women. Secondly Sampling confounds. Because the interactions between genetic, phenotypic and environmental factors upon age-related volumetric trajectories are complex, studies frequently focus on just one of these many contributors which may partially explain the observed variance of brain trajectories. Some of these variables must be mentioned here due to their importance when interpreting the results of this study. For example, the variation of brain volumetrics with age and sex has been reported extensively by many studies, including those included in this report. Some studies describe brain volumetrics and related measures across the entire range of ages analyzed rather by decade or as a function of age. This can pose challenges to meta-analyses like ours because participants' age distribution is not always uniform in a\ngiven study, and the number of subjects whose age falls within each decade of adulthood is rarely reported. This can preclude the ability to survey the literature in a way which is amenable to reporting volumetric trajectories by decade; one notable exception here is the study of Walhovd et al. (Walhovd et al. 2011) , where decadal data are provided. Aside from age, sex is also very important as a biological variable affecting volumetric trajectories (Jancke et al. 2015) ; for this reason, this study reports regression coefficients and volumetrics separately by sex, where possible.\nGenes and environment. Aside from age, sex and head size, human BV trajectories are partly influenced by genetic and environmental factors whose effects upon the metrics discussed here may covary to a substantial extent. Lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, intelligence, educational attainment, alcohol consumption and smoking can all affect BV trajectories to various extents and, frequently, in a dosedependent fashion; such factors can be additional sources of variance which is not explained by other factors (Lenroot and Giedd 2008) . Genes which modulate aging rates and susceptibility to disease can themselves interact with environmental factors; together, genes, environment and their interaction contribute to brain aging trajectories in complex ways and can account for some of the variability observed in the measured rates of human brain atrophy (Seshadri et al. 2007 ). This meta-analysis does not account for the effect of such genetic and environmental variables upon brain trajectories because its purpose is to describe the BV trajectory expected of the general population rather than of any subgroup.\nNevertheless, future research should aim to meta-analyze the effects of genes and environment upon BV and related measures.\nAllometry. Head size may confound meta-analyses considerably because a structure's absolute difference in volume over some arbitrary time interval is proportional to the initial volume of that structure. Thus, head size must be accounted for in studies like ours to avoid fallacious inferences driven by effects related to brain allometry (the scaling of the brain with body size) rather than by the main effects of interest, such as aging or disease. Many reports of brain volumes identified in this study did not account for head size or, alternatively, accounted for it in ways which differed enough across studies that case-study comparison was too difficult or, indeed, impossible. Here, regression coefficients were reported as percentages of differences in volume per year precisely to convey information which can be interpreted independently of head size. It should be mentioned that, although normalization by intracranial volume is by far the most common approach to accounting for head size, there is more than one such strategies and certain approaches can be more suitable than others, depending on a variety of factors (Voevodskaya et al. 2014) .\nVolumetric measurement techniques. Information on the descriptive statistics (mean and variance) of brain volumetrics is available in reports of studies utilizing a variety of methods. These range from approaches superseded long ago-like post-mortem weighing of fluid volume displaced by the excised brain (Uspenskii 1964 to the effects of microstructural properties of brain tissue (e.g. myelination, iron, and water content) upon brain morphology calculations (Lorio et al. 2016; Natu et al. 2019 ) should be acknowledged. Nevertheless, because the MRI literature is the largest source of brain volumetrics currently available and MRI sample sizes eclipse those of most post-mortem studies very frequently, the MRI literature was found to be the most suitable one for this analysis.\nMRI acquisition parameters. Encouragingly, the results of this meta-analysis ( Figure 1 ) do not suggest that the regression coefficients and volumetrics reported by older studies differ systematically from those in more recent studies. This, however, does not demonstrate the absence of a relationship between the measures of interest here and the publication dates of the studies included. For this reason, future studies should aim to investigate in more detail the combined effects of MRI spatial resolution, partial volume effects, scanner field strength and of other factors upon the metrics discussed here. The available spatial resolution of anatomic MRI scans has increased considerably over the past thirty years; thus, MRI spatial resolution can confound meta-analyses like ours if their statistical effects are not accounted for. More recent studies are typically more likely to provide the opportunities of calculating volumetrics more accurately; currently, the typical voxel size of brain MRI scans is ~1 mm 3 , which frequently corresponds to a pixel size of 1 mm 2 and to a slice thickness of 1 mm. Indeed, many studies published in the past ~15 years feature today's standard voxel size of 1 mm 3 , although this is certainly not the rule. In a few older studies included here, the typical spatial resolution is-as expected-poorer than today's standard. For example, Gur et al. (1991) were based on MRI volumes with a slice thickness somewhat greater than today's standard. A third such study is that of Matsumae et al. (1996) , who obtained total intracranial volumes from 49 normal volunteers ranging in age from 24 to 80. Importantly, none of these studies were found to yield either cross-sectional regression coefficients or volumetrics which differed in any substantial way from those reported in recent studies (see tables and figure). Furthermore, whereas most older studies had relatively small sample sizes, others were relatively large even by today's standards (Bigler and Tate 2001) and may therefore still warrant consideration. Thus, Bigler et al. assessed ICV and BV in 532 subjects who were either healthy adults, TBI victims or AD patients. Interestingly, the regression coefficients and volumetrics reported by these older studies did not differ substantially from those reported by recent ones, and the relative sample sizes of the former studies were relatively smaller than those of the latter, such that older studies did not contribute as substantially to meta-analysis results as newer ones did.\nUtility of reported measures. Frequently, researchers who utilize brain volumetric data are interested in two important groups of measures: (1) the BV trajectory as a function of age, and (2) the mean and variance of BV at a given age and/or for each sex. The first such group of parameters includes linear regression coefficients describing the relationship between volumetrics and age across the range from 20\nto 70 years. The second group includes average volumetrics at selected ages (20 years, 45 years and 70 years). Researchers have many choices as to the nature, format and units used to report such data on the relationship between brain volumetrics and age. Depending on the context in which such values are required, certain choices may be preferable to others depending on the researcher's objective needs and/or subjective preferences. In this study, regression coefficients are reported as percentages of differences in volume per year, rather than in cm 3 per year, ml per year or in other units. Reporting coefficients using percentages rather than physical units of volume has a considerable advantage, in that the former choice is independent of head size whereas the latter is not. Thus, a regression coefficient reported as a percentage difference in volume per year does not suffer from the confounding effect of varying head sizes, either within or between studies. Nevertheless, because scientists frequently need to calculate the expected values of physical volumes based on regression coefficient data, it is also important to have access to reference values of average volumetrics for the end points of the age interval over which regression coefficients were computed (20 to 70 years in the present study). This is one of the reasons for which this study reports average volumetrics for men and women at the ages of 20, 45 and 70, which correspond conveniently to representative-albeit somewhat arbitrary-values for young, middle and old age.\nImportantly, availability of the two sets of parameters reported by this meta-analysis allows one to estimate the average value of volumetrics at any age of interest within the stated interval from 20 to 70, under the assumption that age and volume are linearly related. Thus, knowledge of these two important sets of parameters can facilitate the process of obtaining reference values for brain volumetrics at any adult age of interest within the range considered. Specifically, one can calculate the expected value of volume at age within the range from 20 to 70 by (A) identifying the value of the desired volume at age 20 in Table 2 , and then (B) calculating the expected value of at age as 1 100 1 20 20\nwhere is the corresponding regression coefficient for the volumetric measure of interest, as reported in Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal studies. Cross-sectional studies suffer from the major limitation that they only allow the investigation of age-related differences and trajectories rather than changes, partly because of cohort effects, secular trends and uncontrolled individual differences (Raz and Rodrigue 2006) . The results of the present study should therefore be interpreted with awareness of this important caveat. By contrast, longitudinal studies of brain volumetrics can be more valuable because they allow researchers to estimate brain atrophy rates within specific individuals and across specific time periods while (partially)\ncontrolling for individual differences.\nUnfortunately, the literature survey conducted identified relatively few longitudinal studies of brain atrophy in youth or middle age compared to old age. For this reason, data on BV trajectories across adulthood are more abundantly available from cross-sectional-rather than longitudinal-studies.\nAdditionally, many-if not most-longitudinal studies of brain atrophy focus on comparisons between groups whose membership is limited by relatively narrow eligibility criteria. Such criteria can encumber the inclusion of longitudinal studies in meta-analyses because different eligibility criteria may not only confound the meta-analysis, but also result in an aggregate sample whose characteristics may not be adequately representative of the general population. As importantly, few longitudinal MRI studies have measured brain volumetrics over periods exceeding 10 years and none have followed up participants over the entire course of their adulthood. This is partly due to the substantial practical challenges of doing so, and to the fact that MRI and related tools for the calculation of brain volumetrics have been widely available for only ~30 years. Incidentally, two other potential drawbacks of longitudinal studies are survivorship bias (Nunney 1991 ) and self-selection bias (Heckman 1990) . Thus, despite the many advantages of longitudinal studies, there is still considerable appeal in relying on cross-sectional brain volumetrics data when characterizing BV trajectories throughout adulthood. The reader is referred to the contributions of Raz & Rodrigue (2006) for further discussion of the relative merits of cross-sectional vs.\nlongitudinal studies of brain morphometry.\nFailures to report total volumes. Whereas most early MRI studies quantified only total volumes, many studies from the past decade have shifted focus to the detailed reporting of regional volumes and atrophy rates. One unfortunate and paradoxical side effect of this trend toward greater regional specificity and sophistication is that the total volumes of GM, WM and CSF are no longer being reported as often as before the advent of regional volumetric analysis. This can have unfortunate consequences because brain parcellation schemes often differ considerably across studies, such that various brain regions' measures fail to be reported in a way which facilitates summary. Thus, it may be tedious or impossible to calculate total volumes from regional volume data unless these data are complete and the parcellation schemes employed are specified unambiguously. Furthermore, many studies leveraging data from large repositories and efforts such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, and the UK Biobank (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) may fail to report the total brain volumetrics of healthy control subjects included in these studies; alternatively, their reported volumetrics may apply to healthy control individuals whose inclusion criteria and demographics may differ substantially across any pair of datasets from these neuroimaging consortia. For reasons like these, it is very important that future studies continue to report BV, GMV, WMV and CSFV in addition to regional volumes.\nLinear vs. quadratic models. Many studies of brain volumetrics-whether longitudinal or cross-sectionalhave modelled the time-dependent trajectories of brain volumetrics using either linear or quadratic regression models. In a strict quantitative sense, quadratic fits are better than linear ones because the former yield a smaller sum of squared residuals, i.e. better goodness of fit. Nevertheless, due to the danger of overfitting in studies like ours, the question as to which model is more justified empirically deserves discussion. In some studies included here-e.g. Taki et al. (2004) -linear fits seem appropriate, and the quadratic relationship between volumetrics and age does not appear to be substantial. In others-e.g. Sowell et al. (2003) -visual inspection suggests that the contribution of the quadratic term to the BV trajectory is important. It has been proposed that the choice between linear and quadratic models is largely dependent upon the age range of participants in a given sample, and that researchers should strive to explore as broad a range as possible (Fjell et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, the inclusion of participants in the first and second decades of life may strengthen the argument in favor of using quadratic models due to the trajectory of brain dynamics during development (Sowell et al. 2003) . The present meta-analysis of volumetric trajectories across adulthood provides evidence in support of the assertion by Fjell et al. (2010) according to which the most seemingly appropriate fit is determined by the range of ages included. Good et al. (2001) did not find significant WM decline with age in their sample of 465 healthy adults; these authors suggested that, in the first six decades of life, aging affects GMV more than WMV, and that both GMV and WMV decrease substantially after age ~60. Thus, the quadratic regression curves depicted in these authors' study suggest some GMV increase up to the fifth decade of life, with relatively slow subsequent decline into the eighth decade; by contrast, the decrease in WMV appears to be monotonic. These trajectories are reproduced by other studies (Fotenos et al. 2005; Walhovd et al. 2011 ). In particular, the results of Walhovd et al. (2011) indicate that cerebral GMV and BV decrease monotonically throughout adulthood, suggesting that a linear fit may be appropriate for these measures.\nBy contrast, cerebral WMV exhibits nonlinear behavior in that it increases slightly between ages ~20 and ~60, and then decreases relatively faster than within this interval. The present meta-analysis found that, historically, studies based on quadratic models have been far less common than those using linear models.\nBecause the eligible quadratic model studies identified here were few and had a relatively modest combined sample size, their inclusion in the meta-analysis was deemed to be problematic and potentially misleading. Future studies should therefore explore the suitability of quadratic models in more detail to warrant rigorous meta-analysis.\nMeta-analytic limitations. It is important to acknowledge that this meta-analysis is neither exhaustive nor definitive. For example, although many studies were reviewed to generate it, it is both plausible and likely that many studies which fit the selection criteria of the meta-analysis were not included because of missed opportunities to identify them. Furthermore, different study selection criteria may have resulted in rather different meta-analysis results, and it is not clear that the selection of studies included here is the best possible selection. For example, studies published before 1990 were not included and very recent studies may not have been available in the public literature databases consulted at the time when the study was undertaken. For some measures, the lack of overlap between the CIs of several studies (see Figure 1 ) may suggest that some sources of between-study heterogeneity could not be removed even by implementing the stringent search criteria of the meta-analysis. It is also possible that some metrics included in the meta-analysis were systematically affected by confounds which were not discussed here. Finally, the values of various parameters extracted from each study may not be as numerically accurate as those originally computed by the respective study's authors based on their original data. All these limitations of this analysis are duly acknowledged. Nevertheless, this meta-analysis does cover a relatively large portion of the scientific literature on brain volumetrics and therefore has the potential to be of substantial utility to scientists and clinicians."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "BV trajectories in adulthood are of substantial interest in studies of human aging. Historically, regression coefficients describing the relationship between age, BV and related metrics have been under-reported by MRI studies of human volumetry despite many researchers' need to compare brain trajectories across different populations to map effects associated with disease, genetics or environmental factors. Similarly, the average volume of the brain is a key fact about humans which is illustrative of mankind's uniqueness, and the ability to calculate its value at various ages during adulthood based on a normative, aggregate sample is very important to neuroscientists, gerontologists, anthropologists and clinicians. The crosssectional data provided in this meta-analysis can facilitate such calculations and allow researchers to gain further insight to assist the interpretation and assessment of the literature on this important topic. Future studies of brain volumetrics across the lifespan should strive to provide decadal data and to explore the nonlinearities of age-dependent BV trajectories. Because there are relatively few longitudinal reports of brain atrophy during youth and middle age, more such studies should be undertaken to quantify BV loss.\nThis could facilitate and advance the necessary transition from surmising volumetric trajectories from cross-sectional data to their fiducial estimation from longitudinal studies."}, {"section_title": "Conflict of interest statement", "text": "The author declares that he has no conflict of interest. , et al.

Average volumes of the brain (B), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the age of 20, 45 and 70. Meta-analysis results which aggregate all studies listed are displayed in bold face. Values are listed separately for males and females, where possible; for studies which do not distinguish trajectories by sex, values are listed under \"M&F.\" The sample size of each study is also reported. A dash indicates that data were not reported by the study in question, or that reported data could not be utilized in the meta-analysis.
