[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "A comparison of automated segmentation and manual tracing in estimating hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke and healthy control participants. Ynicl (2018), ABSTRACT Manual quantification of the hippocampal atrophy state and rate is time consuming and prone to poor reproducibility, even when performed by neuroanatomical experts. The automation of hippocampal segmentation has been investigated in normal aging, epilepsy, and in Alzheimer's disease. Our first goal was to compare manual and automated hippocampal segmentation in ischemic stroke and to, secondly, study the impact of stroke lesion presence on hippocampal volume estimation. We used eight automated methods to segment T1weighted MR images from 105 ischemic stroke patients and 39 age-matched controls sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. The methods were: AdaBoost, Atlas-based Hippocampal Segmentation (ABHS) from the IDeALab, Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) using 3 atlas variants (Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuromorphometics), FIRST, FreeSurfer v5.3, and FreeSurfer v6.0-Subfields. A number of these methods were employed to re-segment the T1 images for the stroke group after the stroke lesions were masked (i.e., removed). The automated methods were assessed on eight measures: process yield (i.e. segmentation success rate), correlation (Pearson's R and Shrout's ICC), concordance (Lin's RC and Kandall's W), slope 'a' of best-fit line from correlation plots, percentage of outliers from Bland-Altman plots, and significance of control\u2212stroke difference. We eliminated the redundant measures after analysing betweenmeasure correlations using Spearman's rank correlation. We ranked the automated methods based on the sum of the remaining non-redundant measures where each measure ranged between 0 and 1. Subfields attained an overall score of 96.3%, followed by AdaBoost (95.0%) and FIRST (94.7%). CAT using the LPBA40 atlas inflated hippocampal volumes the most, while the Hammers atlas returned the smallest volumes overall. FIRST ( = 0.014), FreeSurfer v5.3 ( = 0.007), manual tracing ( = 0.049), and CAT using the Neuromorphometics atlas ( = 0.017) all showed a significantly reduced hippocampal volume mean for the stroke group compared to control at three months. Moreover, masking of the stroke lesions prior to segmentation resulted in hippocampal volumes which agreed less with manual tracing. These findings recommend an automated segmentation without lesion masking as a more reliable procedure for the estimation of hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Brain atrophy is associated with both normal aging and with brain pathology, especially neurodegenerative disorders. At the age of 65 years, a third of men and half of women are at risk of having a stroke or developing dementia (H\u00e9non et al., 2006) . Stroke is one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide (Aerts et al., 2016; Maier et al., 2015; Strong et al., 2007) and a third of stroke survivors develop post-stroke dementia (PSD) months (early-onset) to years (late-onset) after the initial stroke incident (Mok et al., 2017) . Vascular dementia, including PSD, is the second most common cause of cognitive decline, with only Alzheimer's disease (AD) being more prevalent (Seshadri and Wolf 2007) . Yet, the regional atrophy patterns in PSD are not understood.\nQuantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed changes in brain structures in normal aging and in neurodegenerative dementias. Accelerated hippocampal volume loss has been described in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including temporal lobe epilepsy, Huntington's disease, AD, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic alcoholism and panic disorder (Geuze et al., 2005) . In AD, for instance, hippocampal atrophy is considered a distinguishing feature (Scheltens et al., 1992) and a hallmark of this disease. In conditions such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, several studies have reported smaller hippocampal volumes (Apfel et al., 2011; Frodl et al., 2006; M Meisenzahl et al., 2009; Woon et al., 2010) . Smaller hippocampal sizes have also been reported in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (Fein et al., 2000) . In major stroke, hippocampal atrophy has been associated with cognitive decline in survivors (Gemmell et al., 2012; Kliper et al., 2013) .\nManual tracing of the hippocampus is the accepted gold standard among neuroanatomical experts Frisoni et al., 2015) . However, manual segmentation is laborious and very time consuming. An expert rater may need up to two hours to trace the hippocampus (Morey et al., 2009 ) and results may be influenced by rater bias (Colon-Perez et al., 2016) . For large sets, manual tracing of the hippocampus is restricted by time and cost. For this, automated segmentation was proposed as a reliable alternative to human manual tracing, and its application is now widely performed in large datasets of patients with conditions such as AD (Morra et al., 2010) and temporal lobe epilepsy (Kim et al., 2012; Pardoe et al., 2009) . In AD, computational segmentation techniques have shown good reproducibility and are comparable in accuracy to manual tracing (Fischl et al., 2002; Pantel et al., 2000) . The high reproducibility of automated methods reduces bias and facilitates the replication of findings between studies.\nApproaches to computerised segmentation include multi-atlas-based registration and propagation (Aljabar et al., 2009; Heckemann et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2013) and machine learning-based clustering (Maglietta et al., 2016; Morra et al., 2010; Patenaude et al., 2011) . For instance, Morra et al. (2010) evaluated FreeSurfer and three A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T machine learning classifiers (hierarchical AdaBoost, support vector machines (SVM) with manual feature selection, and hierarchical SVM with automated feature selection (Ada-SVM)) for normal and AD populations. AdaBoost and Ada-SVM compared more favourably with manual segmentation. Also, a novel strategy for hippocampal segmentation was proposed by Maglietta et al. (2016) using the RUSBoost classifier, which correlated the most to manual tracing when compared to random forest and FreeSurfer.\nAvailable automated methods were not designed to segment MRI images in stroke populations and very little is known about the influence of stroke lesions on their performance. The stroke lesions, often considerably large, appear hypo-intense on T1weighted images and are hard to discriminate from the gray matter. In this study, we investigated the performance of several automated segmentation tools in two populations: healthy controls and participants with ischemic stroke. We compared their performance against human manual tracing of the hippocampus with and without the masking of stroke lesions. We hypothesized, based on findings from prior studies on healthy and other disease groups, that:\n1. Automated methods and manual tracing would return comparable hippocampal volumes for control and stroke populations on both group and individual levels; especially for methods using protocols similar to the EADC-ADNI harmonized protocol Frisoni et al., 2015) used here for manual tracing. 2. Automated segmentation methods and manual tracing would comparably characterise atrophy states of control and stroke groups from data acquired at equivalent timepoints. 3. Given that lesions in our stroke population occurred remotely outside the hippocampus, their presence would not significantly and negatively impact on the estimation of hippocampal volume by the automated methods."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CANVAS study", "text": "It is an observational longitudinal case control study in which 135 ischaemic stroke patientsconfirmed clinically and radiologicallyand 40 age-matched healthy controls are followed over five years.

A subset made of 101 participants (22 controls"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "and 79 strokes) was separately traced by a second expert rater (QL). The manual tracing of the hippocampi progressed blindly based on the subject ID alone.\nThe intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss 1979) was used to measure inter-rater reliability for raters MSK and QL. ICCs were 0.86 for controls, 0.9 for stroke participants and 0.9 for the two groups together. For comparison with automated methods, manual tracing by MSK was used. A sample representation of hippocampal manual tracing of control and stroke participants is shown in Fig. 1 .\nCAT is based on an Adaptive Maximum a Posterior (AMAP) technique without the need for a priori information about tissue probabilities. Tissue probability maps are not used constantly in the sense of the classical unified segmentation approach (Ashburner and Friston 2005) , but only for spatial normalization and for initial skull-stripping. AMAP is adaptive in the sense that local variations (in mean and variance) are modelled as slowly varying spatial functions (Rajapakse et al., 1997) . This not only accounts for intensity inhomogeneities, but also for other local variations of intensity. Additionally, the segmentation approach uses a Partial Volume Estimation (PVE) with a simplified mixed model of a maximum of two tissue types (Tohka et al., 2004) . Segmentation starts initially with three pure classes (gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) and is followed by a PVE of two additional mixed classes: gray-white matter and gray-cerebrospinal fluid. This results in an estimation of the amount of each pure tissue type present in every voxel. CAT estimates of hippocampal volume were based on the Hammers (Gousias et al., 2008) , LPBA40 (LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas) (Shattuck et al., 2008) and Neuromorphometics (Caviness et al., 1999) brain atlases. Here, we refer to the CAT methods by their respective atlas names: Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuro (short for Neuromorphometics).\n2010) of multiple images when available, 2) removal of non-brain tissue , 3) Talairach transformation (affine transform from the original volume to the MNI305 atlas), 4) segmentation of subcortical white matter and deep gray matter structures including hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, ventricles (Fischl et al., 2002; , 5) intensity normalization (Sled et al., 1998) , 6) tessellation of the gray matter-white matter boundary, 7) topology correction (Fischl et al., 2001; Segonne et al., 2007) , and 8) surface deformation following intensity gradients (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale 2000) . FreeSurfer morphometric procedures show good test-retest reliability across scanner manufacturers and field strengths (Reuter et al., 2012; Han et al., 2006) .\n\n\ngroups, we combined the control and stroke measures for each method. The other measures were: process yield, a measure (= 1 \u2212 |1 \u2212 |) based on best-fit line slope 'a', a function ( ) = 1 < 0.05, = 0.95 \u210e ; based on 'p' values from ANOVAN analysis of control vs. stroke, and a measure (= 1 \u2212 1\u2044 ) where n1 is the count of outliers from the BA plot for each method and N is the number of participants.\nTo avoid any bias in the ranking of methods, we analysed correlations between the comparison measures and removed measures that were redundant. If a measure significantly correlated to multiple measures, that measure was removed first. If a measure significantly correlated to only one other measure, we eliminated the one which correlated higher to the other non-redundant measures. We used Spearman's rank correlation to eliminate redundant measures given there was an outlier in the W measure and f(p) values could only be discrete. In addition, all scores were not normally distributed. The overall score for each method was then computed as the sum of the non-redundant measures. Scores were also computed as percentages of the maximum score that could be achieved (equal to the count of nonredundant measures).\nmethod used (e.g., see correlation plots in supplemental Fig. 1 ). Hence, we present our findings below based on hippocampal volumes averaged across hemispheres.\ncorrected) hippocampal volumes for both controls and stroke participants are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. In general, the figure shows close distributions among methods except for Hammers segmentation showing distinctively lower hippocampal volumes. The mean volumes for both control and stroke groups from the Hammers segmentation were shown to be significantly lower compared to all other methods, including manual tracing. For the stroke group, the LPBA40 and Neuro methods were also shown to have significantly different mean volumes compared to the other methods (see Table 3 ). \nThe automated methods correlated to manual tracing similarly for both groups: similar slopes for best-fit lines as shown in Fig. 3 . For easier visualization, best-fit lines were computed for control and stroke data combined, then they were normalized by mean hippocampal volume from manual tracing (see Fig. 4 ). AdaBoost, FIRST, and 'Subfields' had slopes being the closest to 1 (slope of 'perfect-fit' line). FreeSurfer (a = 1.18) and Hammers (a = 0.63) showed respectively the highest and lowest sensitivity to hippocampal volume variation compared to the rest of the methods.\nzero) lies within the 95% CI of mean volume difference (d). Other than 'Subfields', ABHS and FIRST had mean volume difference (d) being the closest to the line of equality.\nThe 95% CIs for mean (d) and for the LOAs are determined by variability (s) in the distribution of volume differences and by sample size (N). The larger the sample size and the smaller the volume differences between the methods, the narrower are the confidence intervals. Given a wider distribution of volume differences, FIRST had the widest CIs for both (d) and LOAs.\nWe examined the outliers in each BA plot. Across all plots in Fig. 5 , there were 32 data points showing extreme overestimation or underestimation. The distribution of outliers between methods is presented in supplemental Table 1 , showing FIRST with highest outliers' percentage. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between the outliers' volumes, corrected by TIV, and the count (n) of segmentation methods affected. Supplemental Fig. 3 shows a significant correlation between these two variables suggesting that participants with smaller hippocampal volumesperhaps compromised by degenerationwere estimated with less accuracy.\n\nratio V/V Manual in Table 5 specifically shows the amount by which each method over or underestimated hippocampal volume for each group. The differentiation between the two groups depended on the way the methods modulated hippocampal volume (over or underestimation in same or opposite directions). For most methods, there was only about 1% difference in the amount of modulation of control volumes as opposed to stroke volumes. Consequently, the p-values for these methods were \"practically\" similar to that of manual. On the other hand, AdaBoost and FreeSurfer respectively overestimated control volumes by about 2% lower and higher than their overestimates of stroke volumes. Consequently, AdaBoost ( = 0.28) and FreeSurfer ( = 0.007) seem to have respectively underestimated and overestimate the difference between the two study groups.\nFinally, the accurate delimitation of the hippocampus from surrounding structures proves to be particularly challenging (Maglietta et al., 2016) and is influenced by many factors, including the choice of MR scanner, image acquisition protocol, post-processing of images, the number, thickness and orientation of slices, segmentation approach, atlases, and the defined anatomical boundaries of the hippocampus itself. Even though the automated segmentation methods were assessed on the same dataset, their performance as compared to manual tracing remains relative to the aforementioned factors, especially to the contrast and resolution of the MRI dataset which were bounded by the acquisition hardware. We also remind the reader that the comparison we made between the automated segmentation methods and manual tracing was based solely on hippocampal volumes. We did not compare the anatomical maps produced by the automated segmentation methods in order to quantify their accuracy against manual hippocampal maps.\n\nHighlights \uf0b7 FreeSurfer v6.0 -Subfields segmentation tool is favoured for hippocampal volume estimation in healthy controls and in ischemic stroke patients \uf0b7 FreeSurfer v6.0 -Subfields agreed most with manual tracing of the hippocampus performed in accordance with the EADC-ADNI harmonized protocol for hippocampal segmentation \uf0b7 Masking or removal of stroke lesions form MRI images negatively impact on the performance of automated hippocampal segmentation methods \uf0b7 Manual and automated hippocampal segmentation methods reveal significantly compromised hippocampal state for ischemic stroke patients compared to age -matched healthy people ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT "}, {"section_title": "AdaBoost", "text": "AdaBoost is a machine learning based segmentation method.

Agreement between measures is quantified by constructing limits of agreement (LOA).

Except for LPBA40 ( = 0.01), there was no significant difference in mean volumes for FIRST ( = 0.4), FreeSurfer ( = 1), Hammers ( = 1) or Neuro ( = 0.96). More importantly, the hippocampal volumes from the unmasked lesion segmentations agreed more, and correlated better, with manually traced volumes (see Table 2 ). Correlation and concordance measures (Pearson's R, Lin's RC, Shrout's ICC, and Kendall's W) for the automated methods were higher (by 0 -0.27) in the case of unmasked lesion segmentation, except for Lin's coefficient of concordance RC, which was higher for masked lesion segmentation with LPBA40. This was driven by a significantly lower mean volume which became closer to mean volume estimated by manual tracing. For the remainder of this analysis, we compare manual hippocampal tracing to automated segmentation without stroke lesion masking.

For both control and stroke groups, ABHS and 'Subfields' correlated the most to manual tracing, R ABHS (Control, Stroke) = (0.89, 0.92) and R Subfields (Control, Stroke) = (0.88, 0.92). FIRST correlated the least with manual tracing; R (Control, Stroke) = (0.62, 0.83). AdaBoost and the CAT methods generally correlated higher than FreeSurfer for both study groups. Hammers had the highest Pearson's correlation coefficients R (Control, Stroke) = (0.85, 0.89) among the CAT methods, but also underestimated hippocampal volumes the most; while LPBA40 overestimated them (see Fig. 3 ). FreeSurfer and AdaBoost also returned higher hippocampal volumes; shown mostly above the dotted 'perfect-fit' line in Fig. 3 . The large proportional bias in hippocampal volumes by Hammers have caused this method to score poorly on Lin's concordance measure, with RC < 0.4 for both control and stroke groups as shown in Table 4 . LPBA40, which had a positive bias in the mean, also scored poorly with the control group (RC = 0.29), but higher with the stroke group (RC = 0.45). Due to their relatively lower bias in the mean, FreeSurfer and Neuro scored fairly with the control (RC = 0.42 and 0.48) and stroke groups (RC = 0.63). The Lin's scores for ABHS and 'Subfields', with volume means being the closest to that of manual tracing, were higher for both study groups compared to other methods. RC scores for FIRST and AdaBoost were relatively similar with control, but FIRST (RC = 0.79) scored higher with the stroke group than did AdaBoost (RC = 0.71). In terms of Shrout's ICC measure, FIRST scored the lowest with the control group (ICC = 0.62) and Hammers scored the lowest with the stroke group (ICC = 0.81). ICC scores for the rest of the methods ranged between 0.75 and 0.88 for control and between 0.83 and 0.92 for stroke.

The first redundant measures to be dropped were Pearson's R and Kendall's W, because each significantly correlated to two measures. Then, we had to decide between Lin's RC and the measure '1-|1-a|' which were significantly correlated ( = 0.029). Since the correlation between Lin's RC and Shrout's ICC ( = 0.066) approached significance, while the correlation between '1-|1-a|' and ICC did not approach significance ( = 0.35), we eliminated the RC measure. Furthermore, RC correlated higher to the sum of the remaining nonredundant measures compared to the measure '1-|1-a|'. This finding also supported the elimination of RC. The remaining non-correlated measures were used to compute the overall scores for the automated segmentation methods, which ranged between 87.3% and 96.3% (see Table 7 ). Subfields and Hammers scored highest and lowest, respectively. For the most frequently used methods, FIRST scored better than FreeSurfer v5.3. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we estimated the hippocampal volumes for healthy and ischemic stroke participants using several automatic segmentation methods and compared them to volumes obtained through manual tracing based on the EADC-ADNI harmonized protocol for hippocampal segmentation.\nSubfields performed best for hippocampal volume estimation; closely trailed by Adaboost and FIRST. Other studies using, mostly, older version of FreeSurfer (Cover et al., 2016;  A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T Maglietta et al., 2016; Morey et al., 2009; Mulder et al., 2014; Rana et al., 2017) have proposed this tool as a viable alternative to manual tracing for quantifying hippocampal volume in AD. We also found a substantial agreement between the newer version 5.3 of FreeSurfer and manual tracing for the estimation of hippocampal volume in healthy controls and ischemic stroke patients. Furthermore, our findings suggest that Subfields (in FreeSurfer version 6.0), AdaBoost and FIRST are better alternatives than the standard pipeline of FreeSurfer. This is based on the overall ranking of methods based on a multitude of measures. In addition to estimating overall hippocampal volume, Subfields allows for the quantification of volumes for various parts of the hippocampus. This allows one to characterize atrophy in hippocampal sub-regions, potentially providing more sensitivity in differentiating between study groups.\nWe note that our findings were based on method comparison relative to data acquired at the three-month timepoint. This is still relevant if one is interested in absolute hippocampal volumes at any single timepoint. For quantifying relative hippocampal volume change over time, the ranking of evaluated methods may change. For instance, we used the cross-sectional segmentation pipeline of FreeSurfer in this study in line with the rest of the methods, but for a longitudinal study, the longitudinal processing stream of FreeSurfer (Reuter et al., 2012) is preferred.\nReferring to Fig. 3 , the bias in hippocampal volumes shown by the various segmentation methods may be attributed to differences in datasets used for training and fine-tuning, as well as the segmentation approaches taken by these methods (atlas-based vs. model-based). In a longitudinal study, this bias can be tolerated so long it is fixed (i.e., not proportional to hippocampal size). The behaviour of the best-fit line (slope 'a' in Fig. 4 ) could predict the accuracy of the compared methods in assessing the amount of hippocampal volume change over time. Methods with slopes a > 1 will tend to overestimate hippocampal volume change over time. On the contrary, methods with slopes a <1 will tend to underestimate volume change. AdaBoost, FIRST, and Subfields are posed to estimate a hippocampal volume change being the closest to manual estimation.\nThe ischemic infarcts for all stroke participants occurred away from the hippocampus except for one stroke participant who had a prior infarct involving the right hippocampus. The automated methods did not have difficulty segmenting this case, and similar to manual tracing, they all estimated a relatively smaller volume for this hippocampus. However, lesion masking was found to negatively impact on agreement measures of methods tested. The masking of the lesions could have negatively affected the quality of image registration and modified the image intensity distribution such that less accurate volumes were produced. The results here suggest that, at least for the estimation of hippocampal volume, it is more effective not to mask the stroke lesions. This recommendation may or may not apply to volumetric estimations of other structures. There are indications, though, that lesion masking may not be needed even for the estimation of brain structures other than the hippocampus. In A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T (Werden et al., 2017) , the stroke lesions were not masked, yet most FreeSurfer-reconstructed images did not require manual corrections. Additionally, the effect of lesions in multiple sclerosis was recently evaluated in (Gonzalez-Villa et al., 2017) . There, it was concluded that the presence of lesions did not affect the segmentation systematically. The lesions either made the segmentation underperform or 'surprisingly augmented' its accuracy (Gonzalez-Villa et al., 2017) .\nThe different comparison measures adopted in this study helped to uncover weaknesses and strengths of the evaluated methods. This was not going to be otherwise achieved if only one or two measures were used. Other than Subfields, which was shown to be interchangeable with manual tracing, the use of BA plots interestingly revealed that FIRST was the closest to be interchangeable with manual tracing despite lower scores achieved on other measures. Also, the use of BA plots helped us examine the nature of outliers. The 32 outliers examined represented data from various participants (15 strokes and 2 controls) and by different methods. None of the participants was considered an outlier for all segmentation methods at once. This confirms that none of the images had an anatomical abnormality or quality issue to the extent that it could have systematically influenced the outcome for all methods.\nThe evaluated methods achieved excellent overall scores (between 87.3% and 96.3%) and thus choosing one method over the other for hippocampal segmentation may prove difficult; given the tight distribution of these overall scores and the trade-offs between measures for some of the methods. The study questions and the comparison outcome objectives may eventually dictate the kind of segmentation preferred. In this study, we did not have a priori preference to what method we ought to use, but rather we wanted a method that can replicate findings from manual tracing as close as possible. Our ranking of the automated segmentation methods using an overall score based on non-redundant measures was an attempt in that direction. However, there were limitations to the design of overall ranking score. Firstly, the list of measures included in the overall score was by no means exhaustive. This list only included measures we deemed appropriate and necessary for our study objectives and did not include for instance processing times which were quantitively different between methods. Secondly, the list included a measure (RC) which seeks absolute agreement and does not tolerate bias in the data; even when this bias is not proportional. And thirdly, there were influential factors that could not be objectively quantified nor included in the overall score such as ease of implementation and amount and/or type of segmentation output data.\nDespite being located remotely, stroke injuries seem to have influenced hippocampal volumes even at this early stage, as indicated by most methods (see Table 5 ). There are indications, though, that hippocampal volume differences between healthy participants and stroke patients early after stroke onset may be the result of an ongoing vascular burden (Werden et al., 2017) . The two effects may prove challenging to untangle.\nAll methods showed that, at three months, the average hippocampal volume for control was larger than that in stroke; with manual showing a borderline significance ( = 0.049).
