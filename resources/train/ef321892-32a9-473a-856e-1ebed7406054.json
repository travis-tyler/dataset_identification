[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The current state of higher education in sciences and engineering (S&E) in the US has recently become of concern. In particular, policy makers, economists and scientists 1 debate whether the system is adequate to sustain and improve the country's competitiveness in global innovation, Jackson (2003), Freeman et al. (2001), Freeman (2005). More recent re-assessments of the issue suggest that, contrary to some studies, training rates in S&E programs are growing, and labor market data provides no evidence of a shortage but rather of an excess supply of scientists, Butz et al. (2003), Mervis (2003), Teitelbaum (2004). Ensuring high graduation rates from S&E programs, however, is not sufficient to guarantee retention of high quality specialists in S&E professions. Studies find that a large fraction of S&E baccalaureates work in non-S&E jobs, Lowell and Salzman (2007), Preston (2004). This fact may or may not be of big concern since undergraduate education to a large degree is supported with private loans and savings. At the graduate, and especially doctoral level, attrition from S&E becomes more of a problem since graduate training is predominantly financed with public funds, and, therefore, is costly, Thurgood et al. (2006). It is found that a large fraction of doctoral research skills are employed outside R&D, Mishagina (2007). In 2001, only 55 percent of S&E doctorates worked in R&D-related tasks, and about 22 percent have never worked in R&D in their life. Employment choices vary throughout a career: Doctorates start their careers in R&D (72 percent) but only 45 percent are still in R&D thirty years later. Finally, about 8 percent works in tasks previously thought unsuitable for S&E doctorates such as financial and other business services, which presents a dramatic career change. These facts suggest that the doctoral skill set including the level of their technological advancement is marketable outside S&E, which facilitates outward mobility when the relative values of employment options change. These changes in career prospects in sciences can be caused by the overproduction of doctorates, the decrease of R&D funding, or falling demand due to outsourcing, Freeman et al. (2001), Lowell and Salzman (2007). Effective policies aimed at the retention of doctorates require understanding the economics behind their career choices. The observed career dynamics of the S&E doctorates present the following puzzle: The first part of the puzzle is that high employment rates in R&D early in a career are accompanied by the lowest starting salaries in R&D relative to other employment options. The second part concerns the attrition from R&D with age. The transition rates out of R&D are non-monotonic and accompanied by the rapidly growing earnings of those who stay. The standard model of self-selection -where ability is known -is unable to explain the observed behavior. The first part of the puzzle cannot be reconciled with the static occupational choice model unless large non-pecuniary benefits are present. Sociology and economic literature concerned with the motives of researchers and the reward structure in sciences traditionally emphasizes that scientists extract high psychological satisfaction from engaging in research, termed as \"the joy of puzzle-solving\" or \"the taste for science \", Stern (1999), Levin and Stephan (1991). The magnitude of these psychological benefits, however, must be enormous to generate the observed employment rates in R&D early in the career considering the value of relative earnings. In the absence of self-selection, they should cover the difference between earnings in R&D and other tasks: $9,540 a year compared to applied tasks (or 27 percent of annual earnings in R&D) and $13,000 a year or 35 percent respectively compared to non-S&E. Alternatively, the dynamic occupational choice model would suggest that there is an investment motive of engaging in R&D. For example, R&D can provide training that pays either later on in R&D (Moen (2001)) or in other tasks, thus serving as a \"stepping stone job\" (Jovanovic and Nyarko (1996)). Neither of these possible explanations, however, is consistent with the second part of the puzzle, namely high exit rates and large earnings growth for the stayers. First, high non-pecuniary benefits do not explain why individuals leave R&D unless these benefits are decreasing with time. Second, if R&D compensates for early losses in earnings due to training, it is not clear why researchers would leave exactly when they begin to receive a return on their training. If, however, they receive this return performing tasks other other than R&D, their earnings in R&D should exhibit the lowest profile compared to the earnings in other tasks. Finally, an alternative explanation to decreasing participation in the profession with age could be related to decreasing productivity with age, which makes the profession \"the game of the young\". This case is best illustrated by careers of professional athletes whose performance falls due to the inability of an ageing body to meet the physical demands of the sports. However, the studies of the productivity of academic scientists found no conclusive evidence that productivity measured in publications or citations falls with age (Stephan (1996)), and the productivity of non-academic scientists has never been studied. In addition, the \"game of the young\" would manifest itself in the large curvature of the earnings profile and would imply large negative coefficients at the quadratic term in the wage equation 2 . However, average earnings in R&D do not have an early peak but rather grow very rapidly. This paper provides the following explanation for the observed phenomenon: Productivity in R&D compared to other tasks strongly depends on one's talent to do research. This talent ex ante is not known with certainty but can be learned by engaging in R&D. Therefore, incomplete information about one's talent drives young researchers into R&D. Later on it forces those with low realized ability to leave the task, while the survivors in R&D enjoy the high growth of earnings. Research talent comes into play in two ways: directly through the ability to pose novel research questions and indirectly through accumulated research capital that allows to complete the research projects. The research capital can be thought of as research skills or developed scientific reputation in the field, which evolves differently for people with different levels of ability: it accumulates faster (depreciates slower) for researchers with higher level of ability. This way even small differences in research ability can generate large differences in productivity over time. To test the proposed hypothesis and to study the responses of the supply of research skill to changes in the economic environment, the paper develops and estimates a dynamic occupational choice model with symmetric learning about R&D ability and stochastically evolving human capital. Using information on their endowments of task-specific abilities and skill prices, individuals specialize in tasks related versus unrelated to S&E. Tasks within S&E are of two types: a) creation of new knowledge through R&D and b) application of accumulated scientific knowledge through teaching or professional services. The types of tasks differ in their skill requirements and private returns. Ability to produce scientific breakthroughs is incomplete information until the individual engages in research. While in research, ability is revealed with some probability. Research-related human capital evolves stochastically: More talented researchers have higher probability to upgrade their research capital while in research. They are also less likely to lose it during research employment interruptions. This can be thought of as a simple way to incorporate dependence on past performance. Note that this paper defines \"career\" as a sequence of tasks rather than occupations. This approach is based on the findings that some scientific occupations involve little to no actual involvement in R&D, which is the main interest of policy analysis, Mishagina (2007). Moreover, it was found that a traditional \"research career\" implies switching away from R&D tasks to other activities. For example, it was found that academic scientists tend to spend less time in R&D and more time teaching or consulting after being tenured, Mishagina (2007). Therefore, if one is interested in studying participation in R&D, conditioning on occupations rather than tasks can be misleading. For example, a switch from industrial to academic research would be recorded as a switch from \"scientist\" to \"post-secondary teacher\" and would be mistakenly considered as \"leaving research\". Alternatively, promotions would be recorded as a switch from \"scientist\" to \"manager\" and would be considered as a \"career change\". Conditioning on tasks disentangles mobility due to promotions or sectoral changes as long as an individual is still mainly involved in research on the main job. Finally, mobility described in this paper does not happen due to firm-to-firm mobility, which mainly occurs due to up-or-out contracts in academia. As long as scientists spend most of their time in research, mobility from one university to another is not considered a career switch. The assumption of unknown research ability early in the career and stochastic learning adopted in the paper are not unintuitive. Scientific projects are the results of the collaboration of multiple researchers. For example, the average number of authors per article in academic biochemistry is 2.90, and in physics 3.6, [Stephan (1996), Preston (2004)]. When observing the final output of a team, it is not straightforward to infer the contribution of each team-member. Individual productivity, and therefore ability, can only be inferred if the person engages in an individual project or becomes a group leader. Therefore, the probability of learning assumed in this paper can be thought of as a probability of receiving a chance to engage in such a project. The latter can be possible if individuals receive a research grant or access to research facilities early in their career. Therefore, a higher probability of learning can be related to improvement in the access to research funding either because of an overall increase in available resources or a decrease in grant competition. The dependence of R&D productivity on past performance has been previously emphasized in the S&E literature. Stephan (1996) suggests that the survival of scientists in research depends on their ability to achieve a \"critical size within a limited time frame\", similarly to the survival of new firms. Resources in sciences are highly competitive and conditional on a variety of factors, one of which is the novelty of the research project and the scientific reputation of the investigator. Through acquiring resources scientists can develop more ambitious projects and gain scientific reputation in their field. High reputation, in turn, lets them \"keep their place in the funding queue\" and grow further. This generates cumulative advantage and a growing gap between researchers with different levels of research ability reflected in scientific productivity parameters such as citations, publications, and earnings, Diamond (1986), Neal and Rosen (2000). In addition, it was found that accumulated knowledge depreciates fast, McDowell (1982). Therefore, research career interruptions are costly to doctorates. The speed of research human capital depreciation is assumed to be slower for more talented researchers, which also contributes to the gap in productivity. The model is fit to the rarely used Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), a longitudinal data set on employment histories and earnings of doctorates educated in the US. The data have been collected biennially by the National Science Foundation since 1973. The survey is unique because of its longitudinal nature and large sample size. Doctorates constitute only 0.5 percent of the labor force, and therefore would be represented by a handful of observations in national surveys. The SDR follows doctorates regardless of their labor force status and employment sector as long as they reside in the US and are under the age of 76. This makes it possible to study their career choices even if they quit S&E. In addition, it contains rich employment information specific to S&E. The parameters of the model are estimated using the Method of Simulated Moments. Empirical moments on career histories, earnings, and transitions of 23,700 doctorates in Life Sciences are matched with the corresponding simulated moments predicted by the model. The main finding of the paper is that information about research ability plays an important role in explaining the observed career dynamics. Under the full information scenario, participation in R&D falls for young scientists by 44 percent, and lifetime participation in R&D by 20 percent. At the same time the average quality of the supplied skill and retention in R&D dramatically improve. Full information allows individuals to make optimal decisions from the very beginning of their careers and improves their expected discounted lifetime value. The effect of incomplete information intensifies with the rate of information arrival, which in this paper is related to funding possibilities. Faster learning increases participation in R&D, the quality of the retained skill due to the faster attrition of the lower ability researchers and an increase in the discounted lifetime value of the individuals. Next, the predictions of the model are used to understand how the supply and quality of research labor responds to changes in the economic environment and availability of its outside options. This is important for designing and evaluating policies aimed at the retention of talented scientists and engineers in R&D. Using the estimates of the model parameters, I evaluate the effects of R&D subsidies and changes in the employment options outside S&E. I find that the supply of research skill is sensitive to changes in relative skill prices in-and outside R&D. This finding contradicts previous results that the supply of S&E skill is inelastic. This paper is related, first of all, to the literature on the economics of S&E such as Stephan (1996), Freeman (1975), Ryoo and Rosen (2004), Majumdar and Shimotsu (2005). In particular, it contributes to the studies of the S&E workforce; for example, Ferrall (1997), Biddle and Roberts (1994), Zucker and Darby (2006), and Fallick et al. (2005). The first novelty of this study is its explicit modelling of selection into S&E tasks previously taken as exogenous. The second is its consideration of employment options outside S&E as part of the choice set. The third contribution is the possibility to use the model to analyze the behavioral responses of doctorates to various policy changes. This paper is also related to the general literature on occupational choices such as the static self-selection model by Roy (1951) and Heckman and Sedlacek (1985), dynamic models by Keane and Wolpin (1997), Miller (1984), and their application to specific professions. Examples of the latter are the study of careers of lawyers by Sauer (1998), politicians by Keane and Merlo (2007) and Diermeier et al. (2004), and secondary school teachers by Stinebrickner (2001). The latter study and Scafidi et al. (2007) are especially closely related to this work because they address similar issues. In particular, both papers assess the timing and reasons for the attrition from teaching professions, including switching to non-teaching occupations which constitutes career changes. The model developed in this paper is not specific to scientists and can be applied to study career decisions in other professions, where dependence on past performance and high ability are the key features, such as performing arts or sports. The remainder of the paper consists of four sections. The model and its numerical solution are outlined in Section 2. It is followed by the description of the data, stylized facts on the career dynamics of doctorates, and the estimation algorithm. Section 4 presents estimation results and several counterfactual experiments. The final section concludes and proposes directions for further research on the topic."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "In this section I describe the theoretical dynamic model of the occupational choices of S&E doctorates.

A scientist begins to make decisions when he becomes a PhD. The decision to become a PhD and the choice of the field are taken as exogenous. Individuals are also assumed to graduate at the same age and not to time their graduation to the labor market conditions. A scientist is active on the labor market for T periods, which is assumed to be deterministic and the same for everyone. At T + 1 everybody exits the market with probability 1 and never returns. At the current stage, I capture retirement as random attrition out of the sample with task-specific probability \u03c6 i starting at period 10. Each individual is endowed with three types of abilities: research-related, denoted as R; applied, A; and unrelated to S&E tasks, N . \"Research\" ability can be thought of as a talent to pose novel research questions and generate interesting ideas. \"Applied\" ability is a talent to \"sell\" or apply existing knowledge to given problems and tasks rather than posing new ones. Finally, non-S&E ability can be thought of as people skills or general analytical abilities. These abilities are assumed to be constant over the individual's career. Denote the vector of person i's ability endowment as , and I allow for abilities to be correlated but do not explicitly impose the sign of the correlation coefficient. The parameters of the ability distribution (\u00b5 and \u03a3 x ) are model parameters to be estimated. These intrinsic abilities are the only source of ex ante heterogeneity in the model 3 . Suppose also that there exist three tasks: research (r), application of existing scientific knowledge (a), and some combination of non-S&E tasks (n).

It can be symmetrically learned with probability \u03b4 if the scientist engages in R&D. For individuals who never worked in R&D x R can be inferred from the observed realizations of x A and x N and the parameters of the skill distribution, which are public knowledge. Denote the perceived level of research ability x R asx R , and let \u03c4 be an indicator that x R has been revealed. Then:x It is assumed that learning about research ability evolves according to: Pr(\u03c4 = 1|\u03c4 = 1) = 1 That is, conditional on employment in research, individual's research ability is revealed with probability \u03b4. Once research ability has been learned it remains public knowledge forever. It is assumed that research ability gets revealed through an individual research project or the possibility of leading one. It is assumed that this chance is higher for scientists who are believed to be more productive (e.g. research grants that are crucial for individual projects are easier to obtain for scientists with a better research record or higher expected quality of the project and the probability of that project to become a breakthrough ceteris paribus). Therefore, the probability of discovering one's true research ability is increasing in one's perceived ability: Productivity in each task m, is a function of the task-specific ability, x m , and accumulated human capital, h m . The former is constant throughout career, while the latter evolves according to the following technology: In applied and non-S&E tasks the evolution of human capital is standard as in Keane and Wolpin (1997), i.e an additional period of employment these tasks increases the corresponding task-specific human capital by one unit and there is no skill depreciation (i.e.  Thus, human capital appreciates slower for lower ability researchers. Since human capital is assumed to change stochastically only in research, the task superscript is dropped for the remainder of the paper.

The shocks are assumed to be normally distributed \u03b5 \u223c N (0, \u03a3 \u03b5 ), where \u03a3 \u03b5 is assumed to be diagonal, that is, shocks are uncorrelated across tasks. Note that the pre-PhD experience is not included in the wage equation. The first reason for that as reported by Thurgood et al. (2006), pre-doctoral experience is very infrequent. The data set used in this study does not provide information on the pre-doctoral experience. The second reason for that is given by several studies who found no significant returns to pre-doctoral experience in the earnings of PhDs. Individual's state in period t is described by the vector S: The state vector consists of the following components: an indicator that the research ability has been revealed \u03c4 , the vector of perceived abilityx, the vector of accumulated task-specific human capital h = (h r , h a , h n ), last period employment choice pd, and an individual's age t. The next period's state space, S is given by: where \u03c4 and h = {h R , h A , h N } evolve according to the laws of motion described by (2) and(4) respectively. Each individual's preferences over task choices d given their state S are represented by a a utility function u(S, d): where ) is a wage offer as described above, b d is a choice-specific non-pecuniary benefit, and c pd,d is a transition-specific switching cost from task pd to task Non-pecuniary benefits b d are expected to capture non-wage and other benefits as well as personal preferences to perform different tasks. For example, many studies of the organization of science describe research as a puzzle-solving activity where the very process is in itself a reward to its participant, Stephan (1996). Several studies found the evidence of this reward in the life-time earnings of scientists, Stern (1999), Levin and Stephan (1991). The latter study includes the \"taste\" for puzzle-solving directly into the scientist's utility function in addition to accounting for the monetary benefits research activity brings through the enhancement of the total human capital. The switching costs are expected to account for the adjustments caused by changing tasks. For example, switching from primarily teaching to research would require \"catching up\" on the recent findings in the area. Alternatively, switching from non-teaching to teaching would require preparing a course outline, assignments and other materials. The non-pecuniary benefits and switching costs are assumed to be time-invariant and the same for all individuals. They are also assumed to be known to all but unobserved by the econometrician.  where u(S, d) is as described above and \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) is a discount factor.

In either case, the value in R&D also reflects whether the research human capital will be augmented or not: The values of the two other tasks depend only on whether the R&D capital will depreciate or not.

The terminal value, v T , is assumed to be equal to zero for all individuals regardless of their state: Define the expected term in the value function 12 as Emax: Due to the assumption of normality of the productivity shocks, the integral in equation 14 does not admit an analytical solution but can be evaluated numerically. The expected values of the value function is approximated through simulation using a simple frequency simulation method. For computational reasons the distribution of the shocks is discretized with R \u03b5 points of support with R \u03b5 being fairly large 4 . Let \u03b5 l = (\u03b5 l r , \u03b5 l a , \u03b5 l n ) be a l'th draw from the trivariate normal distribution with mean zero and a given variance-covariance matrix, where \u03b5 l = (\u03b5 l r , \u03b5 l a , \u03b5 l n ), and let \u03b5 l : l = 1, 2, ...R \u03b5 be the matrix of these draws. For each of these draws I construct simulated approximations for the Emax function. Defin\u1ebd is a choice-specific value function evaluated at \u03b5 l . Then the Emax(S) is calculated as: Since the terminal value is assumed to be equal to zero, in the final period T , the approximation is given by: In each period prior to T the Emax(S ) function in the next period is already known and can be used in the evaluation of the Emax(S) in the current period: The distribution of types was also discretized to have 700 points (types). Each type is represented by a triple describing the individual's endowment of the abilities of three types, x. Each type is therefore a draw from the trivariate normal distribution with the parameters defined by the values of \u00b5 and \u03a3 x . Types were re-drawn every time the distribution parameters changed. For the matrix of the values of abilities x the matrix of Emaxwas calculated by recursively solving the problem for each feasible state for each type. By discretizing the continuous variables \u03b5 and x and assuming stochastic evolution of the human capital in research, the state space becomes a grid of 20,250 points for each type for 15 periods. The grid includes some states that will never be visited by an individual and can therefore be excluded to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The solution of the model involved searching over the feasible points and did not require polynomial approximation as compared to Keane and Wolpin (1994). Because the state space is now discrete, the choice probabilities have to be smoothed. The smoothing is done by weighting the value of the actions compared to the value of the state by some parameter \u03c1 after solving the optimization problem: 14"}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "This section outlines the estimation procedure and the data set used in this paper. It also provides the stylized facts on the career choices of scientists and engineers, occupational transitions and earnings."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The model is estimated using the Survey of Doctorate Recipients ( and phone interviews), the survey has very high response rates (80 percent). This potential source of error is adjusted in the survey using the weights. This paper bases its analysis on the weighted data. Non-response rates for the employment and personal information used in this paper are low (0-1.2 percent and 0-2.7 percent respectively). The survey is unique, first of all, because it provides information on the group of professionals that is small relative to the population. Due to this problem, other data sets (e.g. CPS) would have a very small number of individuals with PhD degrees. Secondly, the data in the SDR is longitudinal, and allows following the individuals as their careers unfold. Finally, the survey asks about academic achievements and other profession-specific information usually unavailable in the general type surveys. There exist several studies that used other data sets, primarily collected by the authors, for example, Mangematin (2000), Robin and Cahuzac (2003), Gaughan and Robin (2004), Oyer (2005), Diamond (2001), Grimes and Register (1997). Those data sets were constructed by the authors using individuals' CVs posted on academic websites. The advantage of this approach is that it allows to construct complete employment histories and to have full productivity parameters not available in the SDR. Unfortunately, I could not follow their example or use one of their data sets because of the small number of observations (at best a few hundred individuals). Another drawback of these data sets is their focus on the academic careers in contrast to the SDR that includes doctorates regardless of the relevance of their employment to the S&E, which provides crucial information for the purposes of this study. The major interest to this paper were employment records. They contain information on the employer (e.g. geographic region, detailed sector, size, type of industry), occupation and its relevance to the PhD major, primary and secondary activities (i.e. \"activities that occupy most time on a typical work week\"), information on professional activities (membership in scientific societies, participation in conferences), as well as scientific productivity (publications and patents). Unfortunately, the questions on publishing and patenting activities were asked only in selected years (1983,(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001), and referred only to two years preceding the survey. Due to very low response rates to these questions it was impossible to infer the total number of publications and patents even for a small subsample of individuals. For these reasons, direct scientific productivity variables were not used in this study. The survey was designed to collect information only about employment at the time of the survey. Because the retrospective information on employment was not available, career histories were constructed using available data for the individuals who responded to more than two consecutive surveys and provided enough information to assign them to one of the three tasks 5 . The resulting subsample consists of 23,700 individuals whose personal and job characteristics are described in the last column of Table 6. Individuals in the subsample are more likely to be white US citizens. They are more likely to be men although the participation of women in Life sciences is the highest compared to other disciplines. Academia employs roughly 60 percent of all individuals, and private sector accounts for another 30 percent. Roughly 45 percent of the academics were tenured and another 17 percent held tenure-track appointments. Finally, 10 percent of all doctorates were employed as postdoctorates and another 23 percent held temporary academic appointments. Individuals in the sample were assigned to one of three tasks: two tasks in the S&E sector, and the third type includes tasks unrelated to S&E. I distinguish between S&E and non-S&E tasks to pin down the \"career changes\". Within S&E all occupations are divided by the primary task: creation of new knowledge, further referred to as \"R&D\" and the application of accumulated knowledge or \"application\".

The latter group includes agricultural and food scientists, biologists and biochemists, environmental and health scientists. Table 6 compares individuals in three tasks by observed personal and job characteristics 7 . As can be noted, the main difference comes mostly from average age. Scientists employed in non-S&E tasks are on average older (48.50 versus 45). They are also more likely to be married (0.67 versus 0.47) which is probably related to their being relatively older. Scientists in R&D are slightly more likely to come from private Carnegie Research I and II universities. The fraction of graduates from the top schools 8 is also higher in R&D than in applied jobs but similar to that in non-S&E. Next, there is a difference by citizenship status. to those in applied tasks (0.601 versus 0.337 respectively). In non-S&E, the fraction of academics in Carnegie Research I/II is also high, but they are employed in non-S&E departments (see assignment principles in Appendix 1). Finally, more academics in R&D hold temporary positions other than postdoctoral appointments when compared to other tasks (0.484 versus 0.277 versus 0.36). Figure 1 show the participation rates of the Life sciences doctorates in each of the three tasks by time since graduation. The first observation is that career choices vary throughout career. Doctorates tend to start their careers in R&D (72 percent) but over time they leave R&D for applied and non-S&E tasks so that after 30 years since graduation only 45 percent of the doctorates are still employed in R&D. Non-S&E tasks account only for 3 percent of the newly minted doctorates, but after roughly 15 years since graduation employment in non-S&E grows to 10 percent. This fraction remains constant until the rest of the career, while the participation in applied tasks continues to grow. In addition to the individuals who start their careers in R&D, another 6 percent join the task later in the career. The difference between the two numbers suggests that late entries into R&D are costly. Finally, the remaining 22 percent of scientists never work in R&D in their entire career.  dollars. It can be seen that individuals employed in R&D early in the career have the lowest starting salaries relative to the other tasks. On average, researchers start with $35,500 a year which is consistent with the finding that many life scientists start their careers in postdoctoral and other non-faculty appointments with relatively low salaries, Stephan and Ma (2004). These earnings are on average 26 percent and 35 percent lower than those in applied tasks and non-S&E ($45,000 and $48,000 respectively). However, R&D salaries grow and catch up with those in applied tasks by the fifth year after graduation, and with those in non-S&E by the thirteenth year. At the end of career, the R&D earnings dominate those in application and non-S&E by 21 percent and 14 percent respectively. Overall, \"stayers\" in R&D experience a 180 percent growth of earnings by thirty years after graduation compared to 80 percent growth in both applied tasks and non-S&E. Some studies explain low starting earnings in R&D relative to those later in the career to be a payment for the on-job-training, Moen (2001). This however does not explain why scientists leave R&D if they expect higher returns on the investment. It seems to be more likely that the high growth of the salaries is caused by the outward selection of those with lower ability and thus lower earnings. In order to better understand the nature of the mobility, the transition rates between tasks are next analyzed.  The first observation is that transition rates vary in their shape and timing by origin and destination. Mobility between S&E-tasks is higher than mobility out of S&E and differs in pattern. The transitions from R&D to application have several pronounced peaks: at 4, 10, and 18 years on the task. Mobility from applied tasks to R&D is monotonically decreasing, which suggests that returns or late entries to research are rare. Transitions into non-S&E are single-peaked at about 10-12 years on the task and do not substantially vary by origin until later in the career. This observation proposes that non-S&E employers value researchand applied skills and experience in a similar fashion. The timing of the transition rates out of research early in the career suggests that mobility may be caused by the expiration of tenure probation periods in academia. Figure 4 presents transition rates by sector, which support this hypothesis. However, main transitions to non-S&E happen from the non-academic sectors. These transitions can be correlated with postdoctoral appointments and inability to secure a permanent position. Mishagina (2007) finds that individuals with higher number of postdoctoral appointments have a higher probability of leaving R&D for non-S&E tasks, which may suggest a \"discouraged worker\" effect.   Sauer (1998). The shape of the transitions is traditionally associated in the literature with the presence of incomplete information, Sauer (1998), Nagyp\u00e1l (2007). Notably, the timing of the transitions coincides with the period believed to be crucial for young scientists to establish a foundation to build reputation in R&D. Therefore incomplete information about research ability seems to be a plausible explanation for the observed career dynamics.

This problem is overcome by using the Method of Simulated Moments. For the given parameter values \u03b8 the individual optimization problem is solved and choice probabilities are computed. Next, I simulate individual 30,000 career paths. For each simulation, a type is randomly chosen out of the matrix of pre-drawn ability vectors and an initial state vector is formed. A career path is generated starting from the first period and moving forward to period T : a random value is drawn and using the computed probability vector the optimal choice and wage are recorded. The vector of state variables is updated according to the laws of motion of the state variables described in (9). The simulation is repeated for 15 periods, and an individual career history is recorded. I use these career histories to compute a set of 400 moments to be matched with the corresponding moments in the data. The average difference between the two sets of moments is weighted by the inverse of \u039b, a diagonal matrix with a typical element {\u03bb ii } = \u03c3 i , where \u03c3 i is the standard deviation of the i th moment. This weighted distance between the simulated and actual moments gives the criterion function, which is minimized by the choice of the model parameters \u03b8: wherem is a vector of empirical moments obtained from N observations, with a typical j th is a vector of the moments obtained from S simulated careers at parameter values \u03b8 with a typical j th elementm(\u03b8) j = 1 S \u03a3 S i=1 m ij (\u03b8). The criterion function is minimized using the Nelder-Mead optimization method. Both the model solution and moment simulation were executed in parallel using 10 processors. Since individuals and types are uncorrelated, both procedures were evaluated separately for 10 subgroups of 70 types and 1,000 simulations each. Simulated moments obtained for each subgroup were then collected and merged by the main server which used them to calculate the value for the criterion function and update the vector of parameters. This way the actual computing time was reduced by 10 and could be even further reduced by shrinking the size of the subgroup each processor works with and increasing the number of processors utilized."}, {"section_title": "Sources of identification", "text": "It is assumed that a scientist works for 30 years, which would correspond to retirement at 62 given the median age at graduation in S&E doctoral programs of 32, Thurgood et al. (2006). The available data on the labor force status of doctorates suggest that participation drops from 92 percent in 55-59 age group to 80 percent in 60-64 age group and further to 40 percent in the 65-75 age group, Kang (2003). More detailed information for the latter age group is not available. The life span is divided into 15 periods of 2 years to reflect the biennial nature of the data. The set of moments is described in Table 7. The moments can be divided into three groups: a) moments pertaining to career choices and earnings, b) moments related to lifetime participation in R&D, c) moments describing transitions between tasks. Each set of moments contains data on choice or change in choices, corresponding mean salaries, and salary standard deviations. Moments on the lifetime participation in research include individuals who ever tried R&D versus individuals who never tried R&D. Moments on earnings and their standard deviations help identifying the parameters of the ability distribution and the parameters of the wage equation. The parameters of the human capital evolution tech-nology are identified jointly by the participation rates and salaries. The former also help pinning down non-wage benefits. Moments on the lifetime participation in R&D and relevant earnings and moments related to the transitions identify learning rates and transition costs. The costs of leaving non-S&E are especially difficult to identify since the corresponding transition rates are not available. This is why it is important to have information on lifetime participation in research and transition-specific salaries."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Estimation results summarized in Table 1. For identification, non-salary benefits in non-S&E are normalized to zero, therefore the estimated values for benefits in other two tasks reflect the benefits relative to the non-S&E. The estimated coefficients b a is essentially null while b r is approximately $4,770. Recall that the standard occupational choice model with non-pecuniary benefits described earlier would suggest high benefits in R&D compared to other tasks ($9,500 and $13,000 respectively). The model predicts high switching costs from non-S&E sector to both R&D and application: $17,260 and $17,002 respectively. These results support the common perception that late entries or returns to S&E are difficult. The transitions between applied and R&D are virtually free. Returns to R&D from the applied tasks are more expensive ($1,380) but not as expensive as returns from non-S&E tasks ($1,940). These low estimates of the transition costs within S&E produce higher transition rates within the sector then predicted by the data. Estimated values for the technology of human capital evolution correspond to the average probabilities of the human capital growth of 0.80 and depreciation of 0.43. Another result is positive correlation coefficients between the abilities, which suggest hierarchical sorting rather than sorting based on comparative advantage. The strongest correlation of 0.78 is found for R&D and non-S&E abilities. Correlation coefficient between R&D and non-S&E, and application and non-S&E are 0.67 and 0.56 respectively. This finding suggest that depending on the variance in the distribution of the skills in the population and relative variance among the skills mobility from task to task is easier than under the comparative advantage sorting scenario. The estimated variance of abilities is the largest in non-S&E followed by R&D ability (0.51 versus 0.36) capturing the high variance of the observed earnings in non-S&E due to the heterogeneous nature of tasks by the construction of the category. Productivity in applied tasks is also the least subjected to shocks, whose variance is estimated to be 0.08 compared to 0.64 in non-S&E and 0.98 in R&D. Mean ability in non-S&E is the lowest (9.58). Therefore, individuals choosing non-S&E since right after graduation have very large realized abilities in this task. Finally, the coefficient in the learning technology function predicts the probability of learning after 1 period to be approximately 0.3. More discussion on the effect of the various schedules of information arrival follows after the discussion of the model fit."}, {"section_title": "Model Fit", "text": "This part of the section demonstrates how well the model fits the observed career dynamics   R&D at all ages. The difference may include individuals with relatively low research talent who would have chosen research if they have not known their true ability ex ante. The difference between the predicted rates is especially high early in the career: in the first year after graduation there are 45 percent more researchers in R&D if ability is unknown. The latter is also due to the high predicted costs of entering R&D later in the career and finite time horizon. The gap between the participation rates gradually narrows down as low ability researchers leave the task. This is consistent with the data where major exits happen early in the career.  in R&D drops by 65 percent. These findings suggest that if human capital accumulation was independent of ability, more people would be attracted to R&D partially because of the perspectives of faster salary growth in R&D and partially because of better perspectives in other options due to the skill transferability. The latter explains lower retention rates in the R&D because more scientists accumulate experience and it happens faster than under the baseline scenario which improves their outside options and facilitates the move. This increased outward mobility occurs at the cost of the relatively lower ability scientists and results in an improvement of the average ability of the stayers.

The model allows to evaluate how each of the stories contribute to the inter-task mobility and career choices. Table 3 presents simple accounting for the role of each competing explanation. To obtain each of them, first the coefficient at the non-pecuniary benefits were set to zero keeping everything else constant. Then, skill transferability coefficients were restricted to be zero and new predictions were obtained. The results suggest that imperfect information about ability accounts for about 15 percent of participation in and 8.5 percent of mobility out of R&D tasks. Skill transferability accounts for another 7 percent and 4.25 percent respectively.

Two types of experiments were conducted: First I compare different learning schemes to quantify the effect of incomplete information about ability on scientific careers. Secondly, I evaluate how supply and the quality of the research skill reacts to changes in relative skill prices caused by a) R&D subsidies and b) the improvement of the employment options outside S&E."}, {"section_title": "Learning Schemes", "text": "The speed of information arrival is expected to change the relative value of employment in R&D tasks. To quantify this effect I evaluate three cases: a) slow learning \u03b4 = 0.05, b) sure learning \u03b4 = 1, and c) \u03b4 = 0.75. The probability of learning in the model is equivalent to having a chance to engage in an individual project, which is possible if a scientist receives a research grant or access to specific equipment or materials. Therefore, higher probability of learning can be associated with improvement in the availability of grants or decreasing competition for them. The results are compared to the cases of full information and the baseline model. The latter predicts that information about research ability arrives gradually over time: the baseline probability of learning \u03b4 is 0.30. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 4. Probability of learning \u03b4 = 0.05 \u03b4 = 0.30 \u03b4 = 0.75 \u03b4 = 1 1. Participation in R&D: -4.65% 0 3.20% 3.88% 2.

The results suggest that incomplete information about ability intensifies with the rate of the information arrival. As probability to learn increases, more scientists choose R&D options: in the \"sure learning\" case lifetime participation in R&D grows by 2.26 percent compared to the baseline case, while when the probability of learning is low (0.05) participation falls by 3.51 percent. As the probability of learning grows lower ability researchers are \"sorted out\" earlier resulting in the higher average ability of those who stay (-23.51 percent vs 10.20 percent in the extreme cases). The next result is that the \"slow learning\" case decreases the expected discounted value by almost 6 percent, while when learning is faster the value increases by 2.19 percent and 2.66 percent depending on the case. The results of these experiments show that the effect of information about ability on the retention and quality of research skill intensifies with the speed of information arrival."}, {"section_title": "Changes in relative prices", "text": "The next experiment evaluates how changes in relative skill prices affect the career dynamics of doctorates. First, I evaluate the results of subsidies in R&D sector that would result in an increase in the relative skill prices by 50 percent.   Freeman et al. (2001). Other studies suggest that raising salaries in R&D is ineffective because scientific labor supply is inelastic due to long and costly training, Goolsbee (1998). However, as shown on Figure   13, the supply of the R&D skill is responsive to changes in skill prices: 50 percent raise of R&D skill prices causes participation in R&D increase by nearly 11 percent throughout a career, and almost doubles retention rates. Increased participation comes at the cost of decreasing quality in R&D. The average quality of R&D labor drops by almost 16.5 percent, which happens because relatively lower ability researchers have higher value of participation in research. Without modelling production of R&D, however, it is hard to tell whether the overall production of new knowledge falls due to the decreased quality of the participants or gains due to increased participation because of the cumulative nature of knowledge production.

In this case, participation in R&D falls by 17 percent, although retention does not improve (see Figure 13 and Table 5). The average quality of labor in R&D in this scenario increases by 3 percent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper explains the puzzle in the observed career dynamics of S&E doctorates that is hard to reconcile with the standard occupational choice model unless large non-salary benefits in R&D are assumed. The puzzle consists of a) predominance of R&D employment early in the career accompanied by the lowest relative earnings and b) decreasing participation in R&D as careers develop in combination with high growth rates of the stayers. This paper suggests that the dependence of productivity in R&D on ability to produce new research ideas intensified through the dependence on past performance and the lack of a priori information about ability account for a large fraction of the non-salary benefits in R&D. The paper develops a dynamic model of occupational choices with symmetric learning about research ability and the stochastic evolution of human capital to capture the proposed mechanisms and evaluate the predicted behavior. The model is estimated on the rarely utilized Survey of Doctorate Recipients for 1973-2001 using the Method of Simulated Moments. The paper finds that incomplete information about ability to do research plays an important role in career choices. Incomplete information causes higher participation in R&D and reduces the average quality of the supplied research skill. Information about ability accounts for approximately 44 percent of the non-salary benefits in R&D. To better un-derstand the effect of incomplete information and its realization, several different learning schemes were evaluated and compared to the full information case. The results of these counterfactual experiments suggest that the effect of learning intensifies with the speed of information arrival. The predictions of the model were used to evaluate the effect of changes in the relative skill prices in R&D and non-S&E. Both experiments suggest that supply of research skill previously thought of as inelastic is sensitive to changes in relative prices and the value of outside options. The last category, non-S&E tasks, included tasks unrelated to S&E. In order to distinguish the relevance of a job to S&E, I used a taxonomy different from that adopted by the NSF. For example, the NSF taxonomy considers all managerial occupations as unrelated to S&E. This way, the head of a university department or a director of a research laboratory would be considered as someone who changed his career. For the purposes of my analysis, such a classification would give misleading results because mobility from S&E to non-S&E would include both career advancements (exits due to promotions) and career changes. Distinguishing between the two is possible only when managerial occupations are separated by their relevance to S&E. One example of non-S&E tasks would be teaching non-S&E subjects (e.g. in humanities, business 10 , law, or arts). Another example would be employment in the areas of legislation, business services, such as finance, accounting, non-technical consulting, or marketing and sales of products and services in non-S&E industries (e.g. tourism and hospitality, entertainment, and media). Some might argue that business consulting or legislation in high-tech industries or manufacturing requires technical knowledge. I agree with this argument but believe that technical education for these professions does not require to be at the level of a research doctorate. This classification of occupations can seem too general as it does not differ by discipline. However, for the purposes of this study it captures the major features of jobs that are similar across different disciplines. For example, it is true that mathematicians and biochemists investigate very different problems using different methods, and their products have different life-cycle and commercial value. However, both types of scientists use analytical and modelling skills, need to demonstrate high ability to generate original ideas to create scientific breakthroughs, and aim at being independent researchers. Second argument is that the current classification allows for interdisciplinary projects that are very common in industrial research and development, when the difference across disciplines is less defined and scientists from different fields are considered as substitutes. The same argument applies for grouping research occupations from different sectors. It is true that academic and industrial research differ considerably in requirements, earnings, and work environments, however when it comes to research it is expected to impose similar requirements to research ability, implicitly via project funding queue or explicitly via tenure contracts."}]
