[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease report aggregation and transmission of pathogenic proteins between cells. The topography of these diseases in the human brain also, therefore, displays a wellcharacterized and stereotyped regional pattern, and a stereotyped progression over time. This is most commonly true for AD and other dementias characterized by hallmark misfolded tau or alpha-synuclein pathology. Both tau and synuclein appear to propagate within brain circuits using a shared mechanism. The most canonical synucleopathy is PD; however, much less studied is a rare disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The hallmark pathology and atrophy in PSP are, therefore, also highly stereotyped: initially appearing in the striatum, followed by its neighbors and connected cortical areas. In this study, we explore two mechanistic aspects hitherto unknown about the canonical network diffusion model (NDM) of spread: (a) whether the NDM can apply to other common degenerative pathologies, specifically PSP, and (b) whether the directionality of spread is important in explaining empirical data. Our results on PSP reveal two important findings: first, that PSP is amenable to the connectome-based ND modeling in the same way as previously applied to AD and FTD and, second, that the NDM fit with empirical data are significantly enhanced by using the directional rather than the non-directional form of the human connectome. Specifically, we show that both the anterograde model of transmission (some to axonal terminal) and retrograde mode explain PSP topography more accurately than non-directional transmission. Collectively, these data show that the intrinsic architecture of the structural network mediates disease spread in PSP, most likely via a process of trans-neuronal transmission.

This is most commonly true of AD, as well as other dementias characterized by hallmark misfolded tau or alpha-synuclein pathology, both of which appear to propagate within brain circuits using a shared mechanism. The most canonical tauopathy is AD, but a diverse group of related taupathies are known: FTD, corticobasal degeneration, semantic dementia, and many more (7) . Far less studied is a rare disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The hallmark pathology and atrophy in PSP are similar to those in other tauopathies, and its regional patterning is likewise highly stereotyped: initially appearing in the striatum, followed by its neighbors and connected cortical areas (8, 9) .\nThe mechanisms underlying stereotyped patterning and progression in tauopathies are not fully understood, and both cell-cell communications governed by anatomical and functional connections, and cell autonomous molecular factors characterized by gene expression signatures, could conceivably play a role in vulnerability to disease spread (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Foremost among non-cell autonomous factors is network connectivity, which is increasingly considered a plausible and even key driver of vulnerability (16) (17) (18) .\nAssuming that trans-neuronal transmission must proceed along axonal projections, the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathology spread can be given quantitatively and deterministically from the inter-regional anatomic connectivity patterns (19) . Modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) (20) and post-processing techniques like fiber tractography (21) and connectivity mapping (22) have enabled the computation of interregional connectivity, yielding what is frequently called the human \"connectome. \" Recently, our group proposed a mathematical model of prion-like trans-neuronal spread of neurodegenerative pathology called the network diffusion model (NDM), evolved on dMRI-based structural networks or connectomes. This model demonstrated that observed spatial patterns of neurodegeneration in common degenerative diseases like AD and FTD can be explained simply as a consequence of network spread (16) . This model also gives an explanation of selective regional vulnerability in terms of disease epicenters, called eigenmodes, associated with pathology. Since the model is deterministic, it was successfully employed to predict future atrophy patterns of AD subjects from their baseline patterns and connectomes (17) .\nIn this study, we explore two mechanistic aspects hitherto unknown about the canonical NDM of spread: (a) whether the NDM can apply to other common degenerative pathologies, specifically PSP, and (b) whether the directionality of spread is important in explaining empirical data. We, therefore, apply the NDM to quantitatively assess whether trans-neuronal transmission of PSP pathology can recapitulate observed PSP topography. Our empirical data come from an unprecedented dataset of 60 PSP subjects from the 4-Repeat Tauopathy Neuroimaging Initiative (4RTNI) study, a multinational prospective observation study that examines clinical, radiologic, and biological findings of disease progression in tauopathic individuals, including PSP. 1 Our interest in PSP arises from its distinct spatial pattern 1 http://4rtni-ftldni.ini.usc.edu.\nin comparison to AD; hence the ability of NDM to explain PSP pattern would contribute to the emerging notion that all neurodegenerative pathologies follow shared mechanisms of spread.\nTo assess the second question, we propose a novel construction of a directional human connectome, for the first time. Clearly, directionality of tracts or inter-regional anatomic connectivity, as defined by the polarity of individual axonal projects (soma to axonal terminal or vice versa) is impossible to determine from dMRI data, as water diffusion along fiber bundles does not respect cell polarity. Instead, we exploit the well-known fact that homologous structures exist between many species, for some of whom we do happen to have anatomic connectivity data from painstaking tracer studies. Using retrograde tracer studies, a detailed mesoscale mouse connectome was reported by the Allen Institute (23) . We, therefore, developed a novel technique whereby human and mouse brain atlas parcellations are used to define homologous brain structures, and the Allen mouse directional connectivity is transferred to non-directional human connectome. The importance of studying directional connectomes is that in vitro and in vivo mouse studies are increasingly revealing directional preference in the transmission of various misfolded proteins; however, conclusive data on directionality of each protein are not currently established (24) .\nOur results on PSP reveal two important findings. First, that PSP is amenable to the connectome-based ND modeling in the same way as previously applied to AD and FTD. This establishes that PSP might propagate using the anatomic connectome in the same way that is known for AD and FTD. Second, we found that the NDM fit with empirical data are enhanced by using the directional rather than the non-directional form of the human connectome. Specifically, we show that the anterograde model of transmission (some to axonal terminal) explains certain aspects of PSP topography more accurately than the non-directional model. Similarly, certain aspects of PSP are better explained by the retrograde mode of transmission. Overall, both directional models outperform the non-directional model, and retrograde mode is overall the most accurate. These intriguing results have several ramifications for future studies."}, {"section_title": "MaTerials anD MeThODs", "text": "Building an anatomic connectome from Parcellated atlas and dMri of healthy cohort Axial T1-weighted structural fast spoiled gradient-echo scans (TE = 1.5 ms, TR = 6.3 ms, TI = 400 ms, 15\u00b0 flip angle, 230 \u00d7 230 \u00d7 156 isotropic 1 mm voxels) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging data (55 directions, b = 1,000 s/mm 2 , 72 1.8-mm-thick interleaved slices, 0.8594 mm \u00d7 0.8594 mm planar resolution) were acquired on a 3T GE Signa EXCITE scanner from 73 fully consented young healthy volunteers under a previous study approved by Weill Cornell's institutional review board; for details of study protocols see Ref. (25) . The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, a history of neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, seizure, or drug or alcohol abuse. Demographic characteristics of these young healthy subjects are shown in Table 1 . Tractograms were extracted from these 73 young healthy subjects to create the normative connectome for the study. The measure of connectivity used in this paper is the anatomical connection strength (ACS) as proposed in Ref. (26) . The overall differences in regional connectivity were normalized by a scaling factor equal to the sum of the connections. Thus, the connection strength, ci,j, between ROIs i and j, was defined as the ACS score of streamlines connecting the two regions i and j. We refer to this network as graph G = {V,E} whose nodes \u03bdI \u2208 V represent the ith GM region, and edges ei,j \u2208 E represent white matter fiber pathways whose connection strength is ci,j.\nConnections are assumed to be bidirectional since directionality is not deducible from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography data.

The ABI generated their mouse connectivity data using an anterograde viral tracer engineered to express GFP natively using a promoter with high affinity for the ubiquitous transcription factor synapsin (23) . The specific vector they used, rAAV1, travels exclusively along axons, across synapses, and through dendrites in the CNS, and almost exclusively travels in an anterograde direction (over 99% of the time). Viral vectors were injected and then mice were sacked after a period of approximately 3 weeks and their brains assessed for the expansion of GFP expressing viruses into other regions and for expansion of the GFP expressing virus within the targeted region. Brains were then sliced and each slice was analyzed by an automated camera system to sum the number of pixels across all voxels in each cytoarchitectonically defined brain region; these values were then normalized by injection volume, to give a per voxel connectivity density measurement between any two areas out of the total 213 regions defined in the data. The cohort of mice used to generate the dataset was of N = 1,231 C57/BL6 males, and regions were taken from the previously created ABI Mouse Brain Ontological Reference Atlas, created using specific staining for regional cell types with a cohort of N = 469 C57/BL6 male mice. C57BL/6 male mice are a common inbred strain of laboratory mouse and the most widely used mice for use as models of human disease and neurodegenerative disorders. There are several differences in connectivity between mouse lines. No comparable mesoscale whole brain connectome has ever been created for another mouse strain, hence at this point, any large-scale wiring differences in the connectomes of different mouse strains are unknown. Further methodological details and descriptions of the assumptions used to create the dataset can be found in the supplementary information in Ref. (23) . Total projection density between regions was generated by multiplying element-wise by the rows the connectivity matrix times the number of voxels in each seeding region. Next, the 426-region mouse connectome was used to inform the directionality of specific connections in the 86-region human connectome C. Custom MATLAB code then transformed the ABI connectivity matrix CABI of size 426 \u00d7 426, whose nodes reflected a parcellated atlas consisting of 426 GM regions, into a custom connectivity matrix of size 86 \u00d7 86, based on the human atlas parcelation. To achieve this, the afferent and effect connections of all samples that fell within the (i,j)-th pair of human homolog regions were summed to give the in-and out-degrees of the human regions: degreein and degreeout. The overall directionality was estimated by the anterograde ratio D .C. Most of the neocortical connections are bidirectional, and only a small percentage shows strong directionality (see Results). These connections emanate from primary sensorimotor cortices and subcortical structures, as expected. In order to ensure that mouse directionality was relevant to human data, each strongly directional connection was qualitatively verified from macaque data available in the literature, especially from the CoCoMac database (29) , which provides an ordinal measure of directionality (one of three levels of connectivity in either direction).\nWe applied directional connectivity to all human regions for which there were clear mouse analogs: primary sensory neocortical regions, and subcortical regions. The mouse atlas was transferred to a human atlas by taking directional connectivity ratios (outgoing/incoming) per region-to-region connection for all human region pairings both having mouse analogs. We then multiplied the directed connectivity ratios from mouse analog region pairings with the region-to-region connectivity strength in the Desikan Atlas. Here, we define mouse analogs to human regions in two ways: first, we used region pairings where both human regions had directly comparable mouse regions. For example, the precentral gyrus-postcentral gyrus connection is anatomically analogous to primary motor area-primary somatosensory area connection in mice. Second, we combined mouse regions from the Allen Institute atlas into the larger human regions from the Desikan Atlas when the larger combined region in mice was directly analogous to a human region. For instance, the Allen Institute atlas has the hippocampus broken into the various CA regions and the subiculum; the connectivity profiles of these were summed into one hippocampal region, as per the Desikan Atlas, before taking directional connectivity ratios of connections with the hippocampus. All regions not fitting one of the two above mentioned criteria were ignored and no directionality was imputed on human region-to-region connections where both regions did not have a mouse analog. Prior work has noted similarities between mouse and functional connectomes and the regions of the default mode network (30) , suggesting that for a first pass at applying directed connectivity to a human connectome, mouse directional connectivity ratios can suffice. However, all results should be interpreted through the lens of the clear limitations of imputing gross wiring patterns from one species to another."}, {"section_title": "age-Matched normal and PsP cohorts", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the 4RTNI database (see text footnote 1).

The conditions for exclusion were any significant neurological disease other than PSP, including PD, multi-infarct dementia, HD, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, or history of significant head trauma followed by persistent neurological deficits or known structural brain abnormalities. Demographic characteristics of these subjects are shown in Table 1 . For our study, we used 60 PSP subjects after elimination due to unknown age, gender, and failed FreeSurfer quality control.

T1-MPRAGE, FLAIR, DTI, ASL-perfusion (ASL), and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) MRI sessions were acquired at 3T. The parameters for the PSP scans were chosen to match those used by the ADNI, including those being developed for ADNI-2 for ASL, rs-fMRI, and DTI at the time. Two-sample t-test was used to generate a random sample of 150 age-matched controls from ADNI database. Demographic characteristics of these subjects are shown in Table 1 . This randomly generated sample of 150 age-matched healthy controls was used to generate a group atrophy vector for the study.\n68 cortical and 18 subcortical volumes from 3T T1-weighted baseline MRI images were extracted using FreeSurfer software for both the cohorts. Estimated Total Intracranial Volume generated by FreeSurfer was used as an estimate for intracranial Volume (ICV) as a normalization measure to correct for head size in this study. ICV has previously been used in several studies for normalization particularly for neurodegenerative disorders for better estimation of regional atrophy that is caused by pathology (31, 32) . Image processing steps were visually inspected for white-gray matter boundary and skull-stripping errors to ensure they had been carried out correctly. Subjects were eliminated from the dataset due to FreeSurfer failure or insufficient MR contrast. A vector of regional atrophy was created by using a two tailed t-test between PSP and NC mean ICV corrected regional volumes such that tPSP = {tPSP(i)|i \u2208 [1,N]} (N = 86). The t-statistic was converted to the natural range [0,1] using the logistic transform, following (17).

The directionality, defined such that \u22121 represents a purely retrograde connection, and +1 represents a purely anterograde connection, is shown as a histogram in Figure 2E .

Figure 3A shows spread of maximum Pearson correlation strength R i max corresponding to the best fit between empirical data and the NDM seeded at region i. The distribution of R i max is being shown as a histogram. Since R i max serves as a measure of the likelihood of each region being a seed, this information is spatially depicted in the \"glass-brain\" insets.

For seed regions that are plausible, this would yield an intermediate peak in R where the NDM best matches empirical data, then diffusing uniformly and resembling actual data less and less. The highest R was achieved by the HTH, a region known to suffer early atrophy and could most likely be a seed to PSP for the connectome-based network diffusion. Next in a model-free analysis, we establish the role played by proximate anatomic features in governing the regional patterns of PSP atrophy. We considered HTH as anatomic predictors based on highest R achieved from repeated seeding analysis above. Each covariate is a 84-long vector, covering the entire brain. Since the group atrophy t-statistic is generally bilateral, we removed lateralization effects by averaging the left-and right-hemispheric values of these vectors, giving predictor vectors of size 42 \u00d7 1.

As seen in Figure 7B with anterograde mode, initial seeding at HTH is followed by diffusion especially into the pallidum and caudoputamen, followed by limbic structures such as hippocampus and amygdala, then thalamus, then to middle temporal-frontal structures, and finally to the cortex. With retrograde mode (Figure 7D) , initial seeding at HTH is followed by entorhinal, followed by other limbic structures such as hippocampus and amygdala, and thalamus, then to striatal, middle temporal-frontal structures, and finally to the cortex."}, {"section_title": "DiscUssiOn", "text": "The current study applies network modeling to a rare disease as the first to systematically test hypotheses of disease spread in human subjects living with PSP. Other neurodegenerative diseases like FTD, AD, and ALS syndromes have been well-studied from a human brain network perspective, and have received more attention than equally important and related disorders (15) , due to a lack of available human data on this rare disorder. The present analysis takes advantage of an unprecedented dataset of 60 subjects with PSP from a multinational prospective observation study called 4RTNI (see text footnote 1). Warren et al. proposed the term \"molecular nexopathy\" to refer to a coherent conjunction of pathogenic protein and intrinsic neural network characteristics (33) . They enumerated a diverse set of FigUre 7 | (a) ND prediction from bilaterally seeded hypothalamus (HTH) with anterograde directional connectome. Glass brains of network diffusion model (NDM) seeded at the bilateral HTH at t = 40 years (corresponding to highest peak R) shows spatial patterns of ND progression from HTH using anterograde connectivity. Similar to Figure 4a , even with anterograde directional connectivity the most affected regions are subcortical striatal structures especially caudoputamen and globus pallidus, and limbic areas like amygdala and hippocampus, which are shown in green. (B) Spatiotemporal evolution of empirical PSP pathology with anterograde directional connectivity. Evolution of HTH seeded network diffusion exhibits the, limbic, striatal, and temporal areas as early affected regions, followed by somewhat slower diffusion into the frontal and parietal regions. This spatial sequencing predicted by the model is a close match with PSP tau progression. We selected three equidistant years at t = 13, 26, and 39 years between early stage (t = 0) with no diffusion through mature stage (t = 39). Here, time is arbitrary, and the use of \"years\" is only meant for illustrative purpose. (c) ND prediction from bilaterally seeded HTH with retrograde directional connectome. Glass brains of NDM seeded at the bilateral HTH at t = 41 years (corresponding to highest peak R) shows spatial pattern from HTH using retrograde connectivity. With retrograde directional connectivity the next most affected region is entorhinal (big sphere in cyan) and then limbic areas like amygdala and hippocampus which are shown in green.\n(D) Spatiotemporal evolution of empirical PSP pathology with retrograde directional connectivity.

Although a full encapsulation of these various protein-specific mechanisms into a network model like ours will require much more detailed data and studies, here we have made a beginning by explicitly considering one of the key ways in which misfolded protein species might interact with the extant network-i.e., via directional (as compared to non-directional) transmission. We explored two mechanistic aspects hitherto unknown about the canonical NDM of spread: (a) whether the NDM can apply to other common degenerative pathologies, specifically PSP, and (b) whether the directionality of spread is important in explaining empirical data. Our first key contribution is to show that the mathematical graph theoretic NDM of trans-neuronal transmission can apply to other degenerative pathologies, specifically it can recapitulate observed PSP topography. The interest in PSP arises from its distinct spatial pattern in comparison to AD; hence the ability of NDM to explain PSP pattern contributes to the emerging notion that all neurodegenerative pathologies follow shared mechanisms of spread. Our second key contribution is the novel construction of a directional human connectome, exploiting the homologies in brain anatomy that exist between species as diverse as human and mouse. The importance of studying directional connectomes is that in vitro and in vivo mouse studies are increasingly revealing directional preference in the transmission of various misfolded proteins; however, conclusive data on directionality of each protein are not currently established (24) . Our third key contribution is to show that the NDM fit with empirical data are enhanced by using the directional rather than the non-directional form of the human connectome. Certain aspects of PSP topography are better explained by the anterograde model of transmission (some to axonal terminal) than the non-directional model, and certain aspects of PSP are better explained by the retrograde mode of transmission. Overall, both directional models outperform the non-directional model, and retrograde mode gives overall the best fit. These intriguing results are further discussed below."}, {"section_title": "Focal seeding Followed by network spread recapitulates PsP atrophy", "text": "We tested whether network spread from focal seed sites would recapitulate PSP regional atrophy patterns. Although trans-neuronal transmission appears the most likely candidate, the exact mode of transmission is unknown. We first simulated spread between regions in a bidirectional manner, such that pathology has an equal chance of spreading in the anterograde or retrograde direction. To minimize model bias, we performed repeated seeding such that each brain region in turn has a chance to serve as the single onset region from which subsequent pathology transmission was modeled using the NDM. The HTH was found to be the best seed region, with the highest model correspondence of R = 0.42. The model performance seeded at HTH is significant in comparison with random network scrambling of the structural connectome ( Figure 5 ) (p < 0.05), confirming that network organization is integral to disease spread in PSP, rather than an effect that has arisen by chance. Surprisingly, it was a better seed than any region in the striatum, even though striatal atrophy is usually the most prominent feature of the topography of PSP. The next best seed region was Pallidum, which is certainly plausible as converging post mortem and neuroimaging studies showing the striatum is the most affected region of pathology in PSP (8, 34) ."}, {"section_title": "Directional structural connectivity Model", "text": "Having identified structural connectivity as the most likely mechanism of transynaptic pathology spread in PSP, we sought to further improve our model by adding directionality. Clearly, a direct measurement of directionality of fiber tracts is impossible from current dMRI techniques, as water diffusion along fiber bundles does not respect cell polarity (soma to axonal terminal or vice versa). Instead, we exploit the well-known fact that homologous structures exist between many species, for some of whom we do happen to have anatomic connectivity data from painstaking tracer studies. A detailed mesoscale mouse connectome has recently become available from the Allen Institute (23) . These data are fully directional, since it is based on retrograde AAV tracer experiments on a large number of mice. We, therefore, developed a novel technique whereby human and mouse brain atlas parcellations are used to define homologous brain structures, and mouse directional connectivity is transferred to non-directional human connectome.\nTrans-neuronal transmission can have a distinct directional bias, such that misfolded protein species might follow anterograde or retrograde transport or signaling pathways. This is especially true in subcortical and striatal connections, which are known to be highly directional in comparison to corticocortical connections. Although little work has been done in PSP, tau pathology in AD differentiates between efferent and afferent connections (24) . Hence, we tested the hypothesis that directional (whether anterograde or retrograde) process of spread along structural connectivity network will further improve model performance in PSP. The directional NDM results are shown in Figures 6 and 7 , and confirm that either mode is a better fit than non-directional ( Table 2) . Interestingly, some aspects of PSP topography are better recapitulated with anterograde mode of transmission, especially striatal areas; whereas other aspects are better recapitulated by retrograde transmission, especially temporal and limbic areas. Quite unexpectedly, the HTH is the most likely source of pathology origin in all three modes of transmission, a result that raises many questions that should be addressed in future investigations."}, {"section_title": "cOnclUsiOn", "text": "Collectively, these data show that the intrinsic architecture of the structural network mediates disease spread in PSP, most likely via a process of trans-neuronal transmission. The additional success of the directional network models suggests a simple process whereby local production of pathology starts off a process of axon-to-soma or soma-to-axon transmission, which due to the nature of the directional network topology, prominently accumulates in striatal and temporal areas. In this study, our focus was to build and apply directional NDMs in a purely data driven fashion, rather than a detailed exploration of the mechanistic aspects that govern directional transmission. We have shown that directionality of transmission may be an important aspect that network models should incorporate in future and related studies involving a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. If confirmed by future, larger, studies, the apparent selective vulnerability and early seeding of PSP and other tauopathies in specific areas might plausibly entertain an explanation purely in terms of directional transmission, without requiring cell-type or region-specific vulnerability of brain region to pathology. To our mind, this would be the most parsimonious and economical reading of available data."}, {"section_title": "limitations", "text": "Several methodological considerations should be considered when interpreting our results. The first are limitations of the NDM. The NDM is a first-order, linear, parsimonious model of diffusive spread that assumes that the structural connectivity network remains unchanged over the duration of the longitudinal analysis. Moreover, individual subject genetic repeat length, medication history and age of symptom onset were not available. These variables could have implications in the individual group wise analysis, when identifying each subject's seed region or determining individual rate of disease diffusion. Because this is the first study to empirically test multiple network models of pathology spread in PSP, it will benefit from independent replication. Future work elucidating striatal vulnerability as well as the effect of repeat length on disease spread is necessary.\naUThOr cOnTriBUTiOns SP coded, analyzed data, and wrote portions of the manuscript.
